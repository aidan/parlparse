Our actions are guided by the best up-to-date evidence.

The good news is that the number of young people who have tried a drink is falling; it fell from 62 per cent in 2001 to 54 per cent in 2006. The proportion of 11 to 15 year-olds in that category is also falling, but the bad news is that those who are drinking are drinking more. We have to raise public concern and it is absolutely right that the public are concerned about this. The issue is not just young people buying alcohol illegally; it is more broadly about young people&#146;s access to alcohol. We need the industry to refuse to sell to young people. We need to be clear that unsupervised drinking by young people is unacceptable. We need to work closely with parents, schools, health services and the police.</p>

There is a lot of confusion about units of alcohol, for example, so it is important that we make it clear. Young people need to grow up learning how to drink sensibly and to know their limits. Parents know at what age people may drink, and the noble Countess is correct that they have to take responsibility.</p>

The immediate causes were near-simultaneous, unscheduled outages at Sizewell B and Long Gannet power plants. The resulting disturbances to the supply/demand balance triggered an automatic response designed to cut demand and preserve the integrity of the system as a whole. The action was sufficient to stabilise the system, but supplies to about half a million customers was cut off. Most were restored within an hour.</p>

The generating margin, which is the capacity over peak demand at any time, is currently 26 per cent, which is historically very high. It was 19 per cent in 1997. The outages were caused by system and other outages and errors that are currently being investigated.

That is the answer to the question. It is also important to share skills.

In May 2008, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&#151;NICE&#151;issued guidance on the management of type 2 diabetes, which includes advice on the self-monitoring of blood glucose. NICE guidelines continue to advise that, as part of an integrated package that includes patient education, the self-monitoring of blood glucose can have benefits for some patients.</p>

Diabetics such as me will be reassured that NICE has come out with the decision that she has announced. NICE is not known for making hasty decisions. The decision is certainly in conflict with what was reported in the press. I am sure she is aware that diabetics have a difficult job combining exercise, diet, medication and monitoring, which is absolutely essential, to see that what they are doing is correct. Are we not seeing here a cost-benefit exercise, where the costs are too well known and the benefits not truly understood?</p>

This is a useful addition to the debate, but the key point about self-monitoring is that it should be suggested on a patient-by-patient basis. It should include structured patient education so that the patient understands what to do with the information that they are collecting. I think the noble Viscount will agree that that is absolutely the key point. However, prescribing decisions about blood-testing strips are for local determination. Primary care trusts should not impose a blanket policy on testing strips for people with type 2 diabetes. Healthcare professionals should work with people with diabetes to make joint decisions about the value of self-monitoring blood glucose and prescribe accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0806233000109"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a paving amendment, and quite deliberately so. Restoring the broken link between national average earnings and the basic state pension is at the heart of the Bill and must be the bedrock of any national consensus on pensions after the Turner report. It is so easy to get lost in the trees of detail on the Bill, but the basic state pension really is the wood.</p>

<a name="80623-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0806233000110"></a>Amendment No. 43A is a paving amendment for the substantive one, Amendment No. 136, which ensures that the earnings-link section from last year&#146;s Pensions Act comes into force no later than 1 April 2012. That section requires the Secretary of State to review the basic state pension, the standard minimum guarantee in state pension credit, and widow&#146;s pension and widower&#146;s pension in industrial death benefit to determine whether they have kept their value in relation to the general level of earnings; and, when he considers that the level of earnings has increased during the review period, to lay a draft of an uprating order before Parliament increasing the amounts by a percentage that is not less than the relevant increase in earnings over the review period.</p>

<a name="80623-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0806233000111"></a>The basic state pension has fallen in value so far over the past 30 years that pensioners have been forced into a means-test maze that destroys incentives to save for old age. We all agree that we must stop that rot. The Government want to bring in personal accounts and automatic enrolment for millions of pension savers in April 2012, but refuse to make a commitment to keep their side of the pension bargain. They say that the earnings link will be restored between April 2012 and April 2015,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0806233000112"></a>Of course, that is in the far from certain event that this Government will then be in power, so the attitude of the Conservatives to the amendment is of more than academic interest. In the Commons, and again in this place, they have tabled an amendment asking the Government effectively to say where they stand. That is fine so far as it goes and we will support it, but is it not the height of hypocrisy for a party that seeks to be taken seriously as the next Government to challenge this Government on when they will restore the earnings link without answering the same question themselves? Even if their Front Bench feels unable to support our simple amendment, I hope that Conservative Back-Bench Peers&#151;I do not see many of them at the moment&#151;and Peers from all round the Committee will feel able to join us, as they did last year on the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, to give pensions justice to women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0806233000113"></a>It is no surprise that Help the Aged, in its excellent Spotlight report on pensioner poverty, points out that lack of money bars a large minority of the population from enjoying many of life&#146;s pleasures. Nearly one in seven pensioners in the UK has not had a meal out for more than one year; about one-third of pensioners have not had a holiday in the past five years; and more than half believe that an extra &#163;5 a week could make a real difference to their lives. Pensioner poverty is getting worse. Means-tested benefits are not getting through to about two in five pensioners who are entitled to them. It is high time for us to set a firm date to protect the basic state pension. I beg to move.</p>

My first reaction to this amendment is that it is starred; in other words, it was put down at the last moment before the Marshalled List was assembled. Although I have a complaint on the amendment, it is not for that reason. I can hardly object to starred amendments when my noble friend Lady Noakes and I have put down some ourselves, which we hope will be debated today. We will see how the day pans out with the Statements and anything else that may occur. I note too that the Minister has littered today&#146;s Marshalled List with amendments over and above those on the first Marshalled List, although, admittedly, none of those appeared to be starred when I glanced through them this morning.</p>

I do not know whether he intends to go to a vote now, although as a former Whip I am more than suspicious. The Government have said that they fully intend personal accounts to come into operation in 2012, which I assume means at the beginning of the financial year 2012-13. I should be grateful if the noble Lord could confirm that this is a correct interpretation of events to come.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0806233000116"></a>This Committee can be in no doubt that two things are inextricably entwined with personal accounts. The first is the freezing of the second state pension; the second is to uprate the state basic pension by earnings rather than the RPI. Last year, in our debates, the Minister said that the latter would be done during the next Parliament. But the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, is right. No date was set and, although he and I tried to firm this up, we failed for the very good reason that no one could know when in the next Parliament such a commitment would be affordable. I was eventually, and am now firmly, persuaded of this.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0806233000117"></a>Since last July when the 2007 Bill arrived on the statute book, the nation&#146;s finances have gone from bad to worse. Not only have the Government had to bail out Northern Rock, we have also seen the fiasco of them seeking to remove the 10 per cent income tax band. They have had to increase the upper earnings limit of national insurance and have brought forward the freezing of the second state pension, which, I might remind the Committee, was supposed to help pay for the uprating of the basic state pension by earnings.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0806233000118"></a>Not only that, but in order to do anything extra&#151;equipment for our troops in Afghanistan, more money for local authorities and housing associations&#146; social housing schemes or the National Health Service&#151;the Government&#146;s only recourse seems to be to borrow yet more money. Why do Labour Governments&#151;there have been two while I have been in your Lordships' House&#151;always finish their term in government with huge borrowings, which then take many years for a Conservative Government to get down again to a realistic level? That is exactly the case today, but we must wait for perhaps as long as two years for a general election before we can start to repair the damage that has been done to the British economy. I defy the Minister to repeat the words of the late Lord Callaghan, &#147;Crisis, what crisis?&#148;.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0806233000119"></a>Having got that off my chest, it is a fact that no one in any party or none&#151;even the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott&#151;knows when it will be possible to afford to uprate the basic state pension by earnings. Somehow, though, by hook or by crook, there is a commitment by this Government, in the rather unlikely event that they are still in power, to do it by the end of the next Parliament. I have to say to the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, that to put a date on it that may possibly be even in this Parliament is just not on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0806233000120"></a>The noble Lord challenged me to give a commitment on behalf of my party that we would uprate by earnings.

I and a number of other colleagues raised the issue at Second Reading. We received a fairly firm assurance from our Front Bench that the Government were committed to paying the increase via the wages index with effect from 2012. I would have liked it paid immediately but nevertheless we did have an assurance from the Front Bench and I was prepared to accept that in the prevailing circumstances and I am prepared to accept it again. I want the wages index to be used as soon as possible. We did have that assurance, however, and I am prepared to accept that.</p>

Indeed it is enshrined in statute already, as my noble friend has said. However, a legitimate question for Parliament and the public to ask is &#147;When has a Government promise been fulfilled?&#148; Is it when the promise is enshrined in statute? Is it when the relevant section of an Act has been triggered by the publication of a statutory instrument bringing the promise into operation? Or is it when the Government have announced a firm starting date? In the other place the Minister said that the Government&#146;s objective was,</p>

<p><a name="0806233000212"></a>to restore the link in 2012 or by the end of the next Parliament at the latest. However, this still leaves pensioners, current and future, in the dark. I urge the Government to take this opportunity to put the matter unequivocally beyond doubt.</p>

Amendment No. 136 and the paving amendment that stands with it in this group relate to one of the most important aspects of the Bill&#151;the long-term incomes of pensioners. More than any other group in the country, pensioners are affected by uprating policy because they are exposed to it for longer. I have often felt that the ramifications of upratings policies across the benefits field are not given the degree of care and attention that they should be given by the House of Commons and by your Lordships&#146; House. From year to year, although the changes may be apparently slight in terms of the figures of the annual increases, over periods of time they have profound effects on policy. The most important thing Mrs Thatcher&#146;s Conservative Government did in relation to benefits was to de-link the pensions uprating from earnings in 1981. By a margin, it was the most important thing done by that Government.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0806233000125"></a>I want to clothe my noble friend&#146;s robust and sound arguments with one or two examples of what can happen over a spread of years. For example, if the   


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1234"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1234</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>25 pence age addition that 330,000 pensioners who reach the age of 80 each year are blessed with&#151;the 25 pence that was first introduced in 1971&#151;had been uprated in terms of earnings since 1971 it would now be worth nearly &#163;5 per week. As my noble friend rightly pointed out, the evidence is that &#163;5 a week would be worth having if you were 80 and reliant on benefits; in that case, people would welcome such a pension addition.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0806233000126"></a>Let me give two other figures at random to illustrate how big an impact this would have. Between 1997, when the Labour Government first came into office, and 2008&#151;roughly 10 years&#151;the retail prices index went up by 37 per cent. Over that same period, the pension level went up by 45 per cent, but the increase in average earnings was 54 per cent. Translated into a single pension, that is &#163;5.60 per week&#151;again, an increase of &#163;5 per week had uprating been linked to earnings during that period. That is &#163;290 per year. The Prime Minister would need to go about the United Kingdom making special one-off payments of &#163;200 a year for fuel and &#163;200 for health checks for young people if there were consistent benefit policies that uprated the benefits available to people in relation to the increase in earnings and not, as happens currently, to the RPI.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0806233000127"></a>Let us look at the broader sweep. If the basic pension had kept pace with average earnings since 1980, it would have amounted to &#163;137 per week for a single pensioner. That is nearly at pensioner credit levels. We could deal with all the means-testing difficulties that we have rehearsed over many debates. That sum is calculated in a recent publication by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation called <I>The Impact of Benefit and Tax Uprating on Incomes and Poverty</I>, which I commend to the department and the Minister as making instructive reading.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0806233000128"></a>For the reasons I have outlined, the uprating policy can, over a period, have a dramatic impact on pensioner poverty and across the whole benefits structure. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, is right to be careful about the cost of such a change; it would not be cheap and would involve making a principled decision about whether to allow pensioners to share in the increasing prosperity of the nation. The Rowntree Foundation report makes the very positive suggestion that we should be looking at some of the increases that fiscal drag brings into the Treasury over these periods; where the tax thresholds are not indexed to the same extent and more people are brought into taxation, the Exchequer benefits. The report makes some compelling calculations which demonstrate that there is some comfort for the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and others who rightly think that this has to be paid for and that the money cannot just be conjured out of thin air.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0806233000129"></a>This is one of the most important amendments to the Bill and one of the most important debates. I encourage my noble friend to seek what comfort he can from all sides of the Committee, but I would press the amendment to a Division at some stage in our proceedings; it is a core issue which needs to be decided. People need to be asked on which side of the divide they stand. I do not think it is fair to do anything other than attach the uprating to average earnings in April 2012&#151;nothing less will do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0806233000132"></a>The amendments provide me with a further opportunity to set out the Government&#146;s commitment on earnings uprating and how that will be carried out. My honourable friend the Minister of State for Pension Reform said in the other place:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="0806233000221"></a>&#147;Let me put beyond doubt our commitment to reinstate the link. That is not just my guarantee; there is a legal obligation, and we will stick to it&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 22/4/08; col. 1252.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="80623-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0806233000133"></a>We have legislated to restore the earnings link to the basic state pension in the Pensions Act 2007. In fact, Section 5 was brought into force by Section 33 of that Act. During the next Parliament, we will link the uprating of the basic state pension to average earnings. Our objective, subject to affordability and the fiscal position, is to do that in 2012, but in any event by the end of the next Parliament at the latest. Let me make it clear: our aim is to restore the link in 2012. That timing strikes a balance between making reforms that are affordable in the long term and tackling the problems identified by the Pensions Commission. The commission&#146;s view is that a short delay in introduction, from 2010 or 2011 as originally suggested, would not unduly affect outcomes or undermine the overall thrust of our reforms.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0806233000134"></a>The current arrangements allow for some flexibility on timing. If, for example, economic conditions prove uncertain, we have some flexibility to consider timing and affordability in light of the circumstances. That is nothing more than a sensible safeguard. Understandably, noble Lords, like many others, are keen to find out the timing of the earnings link as soon as possible. To that end, we will make an announcement, as we have said before, on the precise date at the beginning of the next Parliament.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0806233000135"></a>On the process for earnings uprating, Section 5 of the Pensions Act 2007 sets out the arrangements to be followed in determining whether pension amounts have retained their value in relation to the general level of earnings. That requirement and the subsequent arrangements for uprating these amounts will be carried out as part of the annual process for uprating pensions and benefits. Those arrangements were debated in depth during our consideration of the previous Bill.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0806233000136"></a>The amendments are not needed to strengthen the commitment on earnings uprating or the arrangements in place to carry it out. We have been clear in setting out our commitment on earnings uprating as part of a complementary package of reforms that follow the thrust of the Pensions Commission&#146;s proposals to develop a solution for the future. Earnings uprating of the basic state pension will happen by the end of the next Parliament at the latest. However, our objective remains for the link to start in 2012 and we continue to plan on that basis.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0806233000137"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Oakeshott and Lord Kirkwood, suggested that we have not done anything to support pensioners since 1997, but our strategy since 1997 has been to target help on the poorest pensioners while providing a solid foundation of support for all. In fact, we are spending around &#163;12 billion more on pensioners in 2008-09 than we would have been had the 1997 policy continued. Around half of that extra spending is going to the poorest third of pensioners. Today, no single pensioner has to get by on less than &#163;124 a week, compared with just &#163;69 in 1997, which is a rise of over a third in real terms. Pension credit has been upgraded in line with earnings since it was introduced in October 2003. In April 2008, it increased by more than earnings. Since 1996-97 all pensioners have seen similar rates of income growth. Net pension incomes have increased by 29 per cent since 1997 and all pensioners have seen similar rates of income growth. That is in contrast to 1996-97, when the incomes of the richest pensioners grew much faster than the incomes of the poorest. We have put in resources, particularly in seeking to protect the poorest pensioners.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0806233000138"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked about the introduction of personal accounts in 2012. We debated that point last week. I confirmed that 2012 is still the year in which we are planning for their introduction. We have not given a precise date within that year, as there is clearly a great deal of work to be done. As we discussed, Tim Jones did an update on the timing and his report was put in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0806233000139"></a>The noble Lord said that we had brought forward the flat rating of S2P. We have not. The changes that we are making via the National Insurance Contributions Bill are to make sure that the flat rating of S2P keeps on track to where it was designed to finish and to take place when the pensions proposals were put together. The noble Lord berated this Government for their borrowing, but I believe that this Government&#146;s economic record bears strong comparison with that of their predecessor. My noble friend Lady Turner gave her support to linking the basic state pension with earnings as quickly as possible. I acknowledge that she has been a long-standing campaigner on this issue.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0806233000140"></a>We could debate endlessly the challenge that the economy faces and the Government&#146;s record, of which I am proud. However, we do not need the amendments because we have already set down clearly in legislation our determination to relink the basic state pension with earnings. The amendments are unnecessary and I ask noble Lords not to press them.</p>

I accept that legislation has been passed to restore the earnings link, but how do we ensure that that happens and when? The Minister says that we may have to wait seven years, but that is far too long. Millions of pensioners do not have flexibility on that because they will not still be alive when that day comes.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0806233000142"></a>The noble Lord should know better. It is not fair to say that my noble friend Lord Kirkwood and I were saying that the Government have done nothing for pensioner poverty. We accept that they have done a great deal. We were pointing out that, despite all the money that has been spent, many pensioners are still falling through the means-test net and many are still in poverty. That was the substantive point that we were trying to make. As long as the basic state pension continues not to be linked to earnings, that situation will grow worse. As we all know, pensioner poverty on the Government&#146;s official figures grew worse last year, so the policy is not working.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0806233000143"></a>In response to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, I say that we have moved this paving amendment today because we do not want an issue of this importance to be considered late at night with few Peers here. We want to have the debate now. On the question of commitments, when George Osborne became shadow Chancellor, the first tax pledge that he made was to abolish stamp duty on share dealing in the City. Pensioners will notice that the Conservatives have the money to pledge a &#163;4 billion a year handout on share dealing but are not prepared to pledge a penny to give a firm date for restoring the earnings link.</p>

<a name="80623-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0806233000144"></a>I thank my noble friend Lord Kirkwood for his encouragement to test the Committee&#146;s opinion, which I had every intention of doing. I should like to do so now.</p>

The Statement is as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement about the European Council held in Brussels that I attended with my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary on 19 and 20 June.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The main business of the Council on Thursday and Friday evening was to focus on the economic challenges ahead: the triple challenge of rising oil prices; rising food prices; and, because of the credit crunch, the rising cost of money; and in the wake of the US downturn, measures to keep the European economy moving forward. Important conclusions were also reached on the Irish referendum, climate change, the millennium development goals and the European response to the deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;On Thursday evening in the discussion on the Irish referendum vote, the Irish Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, offered to the Council meeting in October a report on the next stage for Ireland. The Council agreed that other member states should continue with their ratification process, and I was able to report for the UK that, as with 18 other countries, the Lisbon treaty had completed its parliamentary process and that the Bill had received Royal Assent on Thursday. Once we have received the judgment in an ongoing legal case, we will move to ratification.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;This time last year, the price of oil was around $65 dollars a barrel. At the previous EU Council in March, it stood at $107 dollars a barrel, and at the June Council, the oil price had risen further still to more than $135 dollars a barrel. The global challenge that we face is a rising demand for oil, particularly from China and the other emerging economies now and into the future, which has so far been only partly met by an increase in supply, driving up fuel bills for families across the whole of Europe. Governments are taking action domestically to help, but we know that these are ultimately global problems requiring global solutions. The shared European view is that we must take action to reduce our dependence on oil and to improve our energy efficiency.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The new technology of carbon capture and storage will help us continue to use coal, oil and gas in a way that avoids harmful carbon emissions. So earlier this year we reiterated our commitment to move forward with up to 12 commercial-scale carbon capture and storage plants in place by 2015, and last week, accepting UK arguments about the importance and urgency of this, the Council called on the Commission to bring forward an incentive mechanism to achieve this goal.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Transport will account for two-thirds of future increases in oil demand, so improving fuel efficiency and exploring alternatives to petrol and diesel is  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1240"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1240</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>essential. To incentivise innovation among car manufacturers, the UK will continue to push for a definitive commitment to an EU-wide car emissions target of 100 grams per kilometre by 2020, down from 160 grams, and a 40 per cent reduction on levels today, saving the typical British family around &#163;500 a year in fuel costs.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;At Britain's urging, the Council also agreed to explore the scope to accelerate the introduction of commercially viable electric vehicles, and the infrastructure that their widespread use would require, in the European Union. Generating the electricity needed for electric cars is significantly less carbon- intensive than using oil. With almost all major car manufacturers, including UK-based ones, now close to developing commercially viable hybrid and electric vehicles, they have the potential not only to reduce our oil dependency and carbon emissions but to create thousands of jobs in Britain's automotive industry as well.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;All these measures will help to meet our overall EU target of reducing carbon emissions by 20 per cent by 2020, or by 30 per cent as part of a wider international agreement, but these decisions are made in the context of a dialogue between oil producers and consumers where both commit to greater transparency and a better balance between supply and demand.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The Council welcomed Saudi Arabia's high-level meeting between oil producing and consuming states that I attended in Jeddah this weekend, and I am today writing to all European leaders informing them of the results of the Jeddah process, which will lead to a follow-up summit in London later this year.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;I can tell the House today that the Jeddah summit discussed measures to deliver a more sustainable global oil price, reduce the risks and uncertainties that can increase prices and ensure greater investment in new oil production, as well as in energy efficiency and alternatives to oil.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;I proposed that Britain and other oil consumers should open up our markets to new investment from oil producers in all forms of energy, including renewables and nuclear, providing oil producers with a long-term future in non-oil energy. In return, oil producers should be open to increasing funding and expertise in oil exploration and development, through co-operation with external investors and providing increased oil supply in the medium term, while growing economies adjust to a less oil-intense long-term future.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;I turn now to the related problem, also discussed by the Council, of high global food prices and the need to do more to combat price inflation. The prices of rice and wheat are now double what they were only a year ago. Higher food prices cause concern to many of us here at home, but in poor countries, where food often accounts for more than half a family&#146;s spending, they can be even more devastating.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;So to tackle rising prices both here and overseas, and to help boost agricultural production, the Council agreed to implement the conclusions of the Rome

The EU also agreed to assess the evidence on the indirect impacts of biofuels. The UK&#146;s Gallagher review of the indirect impacts of biofuels, which is due to report shortly, will be part of this process.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;We committed to work towards a successful outcome to the Doha trade round, where eliminating trade-distorting subsidies and import restrictions could increase global GDP by as much as $300 billion a year by 2015. This is something that I have discussed with President Bush, President Lula, Chancellor Merkel, President Barroso, other world leaders and trade commissioner Peter Mandelson in recent days, and I believe that, while we are at the eleventh hour, a deal is within our grasp.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The EU must also take tough action on elements of the common agricultural policy that raise the cost of food for consumers across Europe. Removing incentives for taking arable land out of production, for example, could reduce EU cereal prices by up to 5 per cent. The Council agreed to re-examine the issues of fair competition and sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;As part of this year of action on the millennium development goals, and ahead of the G8 in July and the United Nations meeting in September, the European Council signed up to an agenda for action that reaffirms EU aid targets and sets specific milestones to be achieved by 2010. On education, there will be increased EU investment of &#8364;4.3 billion to recruit 6 million more teachers globally. On health, there will be an extra &#8364;8 billion to help to save another 4 million children&#146;s lives and to provide for 75 million more bed nets in Africa. I will be pushing the G8 in July to ensure we have the 120 million nets that we need so that every child and family in the world is able to sleep safely at night.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The Commission has also agreed to establish pioneering millennium development goal contracts, linking EU spending on aid to specific outcomes by developing countries. I am pleased to announce a British contribution of &#163;200 million to be channelled through this new mechanism.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The Council also discussed the deteriorating political and humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe. In recent weeks, under Robert Mugabe&#146;s increasingly desperate and criminal regime, Zimbabwe has seen at least 84 killings, 2,700 beatings, the displacement of 34,000 people and the arrest and detention of opposition leaders, including Tendai Biti and Morgan Tsvangirai.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;In the face of this unacceptable situation, the European Council reiterated its readiness to take further measures against those responsible for the violence. We will seek to impose travel and financial sanctions on those in the inner circle of the criminal cabal running the regime. The House knows that since the Council met last week the situation has deteriorated further still. As a number of African presidents and prime ministers have already stated, the regime has made it impossible to hold free and fair elections in Zimbabwe, and state-sponsored terror and intimidation have put the opposition in an untenable position.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1242"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1242</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Our thoughts are with the people of Zimbabwe, who are facing an unprecedented level of violence and intimidation from this regime. The world is of one view; that the status quo cannot continue. The African Union commission has called for violence to end. The current Government&#151;with no parliamentary majority, having lost the first round of the presidential elections and holding power only because of violence and intimidation&#151;are a regime that should not be recognised by anyone. The UN Security Council will meet today, and the Foreign Secretary will make a detailed Statement in a few minutes, after discussions he, I and the Minister for Africa held with African leaders today.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;SADC and the African Union leadership should meet to discuss the emergency. We understand that there are plans for SADC to meet very soon and we support the plans for that happening quickly. We urge that SADC&#146;s observers&#146; evaluations of the seriousness of the situation on the ground be made public. We urge that the UN and the African Union work together with SADC to send envoys and a mission to Zimbabwe to discuss the situation on the ground and the way forward. We believe that the UN envoy should be allowed to return. The international community must send a powerful and united message; that we will not recognise the fraudulent election rigging and the violence and intimidation of a criminal and discredited cabal, and that we are ready to offer help to the reconstruction of Zimbabwe once democracy has been restored.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The Council also expressed its ongoing concern about the humanitarian situation in Burma in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis, and called for a return to democracy and the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners. We made clear our continued determination to play a leading role in ensuring peace and stability in Kosovo. Our national interest remains a strong Britain in a strong European Union, and we will continue to focus on an outward-looking European agenda that tackles effectively the issues that affect us all: the global financial crisis; the rising cost of food and fuel; combating climate change; and supporting people in the poorest countries in the world. That is what the Council did at its June meeting, and that is what this Government will be doing in the run-up to the French presidency in July. I commend the Statement to the House&#148;.</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0806233000155"></a>When the Prime Minister arrived at the summit he was greeted as saviour of a treaty that he was ashamed to sign with others only a few months earlier. No doubt on this occasion he enjoyed being popular; but how can we possibly expect any clarity or consistency of purpose against such a background? It was clear in your Lordships&#146; House last week the course that the Government have set. They have ruled out declaring the Lisbon treaty dead. They have ruled out the  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1243"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1243</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>referendum they once promised, even now that the only people in Europe allowed to vote have rejected the treaty. The Government have lined up with those pressing for an unchanged treaty, thereby bullying and cajoling the Irish people to change their vote. They have ruled out Parliament having any lock on what may now be cooked up in the EU to get round the Irish vote. Those are four critical choices, and four wrong choices. The Government are stubbornly clinging to a European past, when what we need is to chart out a new course for a more open, less regulatory European Union.</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0806233000156"></a>We were told in this Chamber last Wednesday by the noble Baroness that we had to sign away our freedom of manoeuvre and ratify the treaty in order to secure more influence in last weekend&#146;s talks. That sounded then like an insider illusion, and now it is shown to have been an insider illusion. Not a single change is signalled in 25 pages of conclusions. Instead the communiqu&#233; talks arrogantly of,</p>
<ul><a name="0806233000226"></a>&#147;continuing to deliver concrete results in the various policy areas of concern to the citizens&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0806233000213"></a>That, of course, does not include the citizens of Ireland.</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0806233000157"></a>So, work goes on&#151;on the European External Action Service, on the borders agency, on a common European asylum system, and so on. But perhaps the noble Baroness can tell us the legal basis for such work. Is there one? Can she give us one feature of the Lisbon treaty that she would like to see modified in the negotiations following the Irish vote?</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0806233000158"></a>When will the Government and those in Brussels see that nothing divides the European elite from its people more than the repeated evidence that whenever they vote no, they are treated as having said yes? Did the Prime Minister by any chance have a bilateral discussion with the Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic and Ireland during the summit? If so, what was his message to the Czech Republic and Ireland?</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0806233000159"></a>Can the noble Baroness also explain a number of resolutions in the communiqu&#233;? In paragraph 10, it says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="0806233000222"></a>&#147;Modern technologies must be harnessed to improve the management of external borders&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0806233000214"></a>It talks of,</p>
<ul><a name="0806233000227"></a>&#147;legislative proposals on an electronic system for travel authorisation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0806233000215"></a>In paragraph 15, it invites the Commission,</p>
<ul><a name="0806233000228"></a>&#147;to present possible solutions for the long-term management of large-scale IT systems in the areas of Freedom, Security and Justice&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0806233000216"></a>What technologies are those? Is it the taking of DNA? Is it mass fingerprinting, or iris records? Are the Government seriously proposing that UK citizens should get EU computer authorisation before being allowed to travel? If it does not mean that, what on earth does it mean? What is the large-scale IT system proposed? Perhaps it is a Euro-ID card. Should not the Government sort out the handling of top secret data on al-Qaeda before they even contemplate European-wide databases on our own citizens?</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0806233000160"></a>The Government invited the EU Commission, or so it appears, to work on family law and an EU proposal on inheritance and wills. The English law of property succession is substantially different from that  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1244"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1244</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of most European countries. What benefit for us can come from a common approach here? Can the noble Baroness assure the House that the Government will veto any proposal&#151;that is, if we still can&#151;for a common EU policy on inheritance tax?</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0806233000161"></a>There are fine words about the troubling rise in food prices. But is not the truth that there has been a dismal failure to act on free trade or reform of the CAP, something for which the Government gave away &#163;7 billion of British taxpayers&#146; money and got nothing in return? Can the noble Baroness tell the House of one reform in the CAP, however modest, that was agreed last weekend?</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0806233000162"></a>The EU has been one of the prime cheerleaders of the race into biofuels, an acknowledged factor leading to food price increases, disastrous rain forest destruction and food shortages. Last weekend, the summit said that there is now a need &#147;rapidly&#148; to reassess this. What is the UK Government&#146;s policy on this? Should more biofuels be planted, or less? Can the noble Baroness tell us?</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0806233000163"></a>We welcome the fine words on the problems of rising energy prices, and indeed the Prime Minister&#146;s efforts in Saudi Arabia, but is not the truth that the UK Government and the EU have wasted the past 10 years in ensuring future energy security? What is the Government's best forecast for the price of oil and gas six months out as a result of the weekend's initiatives? If it helps the noble Baroness&#151;she is, I know, no great expert on this&#151;I would settle for an answer saying whether it will be up or down. If they acted a bit faster, we would not be in the state we are in.</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0806233000164"></a>Finally, although I know that we are awaiting another Statement after this one, I must comment on the shocking situation in Zimbabwe. It shames our Government, shames the EU and shames the dismally weak leadership given by the UN bureaucracy, even before the red-carpet treatment lately given to Mugabe at a UN conference in Rome. It also tarnishes the name of President Mbeki of South Africa, who has walked by on the other side and watched tyranny thrive.</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0806233000165"></a>At long last&#151;but when it is far too late, with Mugabe reducing his country to a desert of hopelessness, starvation and torture&#151;we see this subject placed on the agenda for the EU summit. Time and again, we have demanded at this Dispatch Box action on Zimbabwe. Time and again, the noble Baroness and her predecessor, the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, have said that any action would be counterproductive and that there has to be an African solution. Is it not now obvious that wringing our hands in that way has been a political and humanitarian disaster? I welcome the belated words in this Statement but they cannot bring back homes for the exiled, food for the starving, dignity for the beaten or fathers to the orphaned.</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0806233000166"></a>The bureaucratic pap of last weekend&#146;s presidency conclusions is dismally behind the game. It is long on regrets and loud on calls but silent on action. Pathetically, 250 fine words boil down to the EU saying it,</p>
<ul><a name="0806233000229"></a>&#147;reiterates its readiness to take additional measures against those responsible for violence&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0806233000217"></a>I bet that that had Mugabe and his thugs shivering in their palaces. Can the noble Baroness tell us one concrete EU step against Mugabe that was agreed at

When will the Government apologise to this House, which has been so tireless in its efforts in the cause of Zimbabwe&#146;s suffering people, for the failure of the UK and the failure of the EU to act earlier and far more firmly than it has done to date? We await the next Statement and hope that it will answer some of those questions.</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0806233000168"></a>On the loss of the Lisbon treaty&#151;if it is lost, though we are still a long way from that&#151;we on these Benches hold to our position that it would remove a number of useful improvements to the European Union&#146;s current structures, certainly in foreign policy; in a number of issues in justice and home affairs, such as migration and crime; and in parliamentary scrutiny. Can the Leader of the House say how far some of the discussions we have had on improving national parliamentary scrutiny could, at least as far as the UK Parliament is concerned, be put into operation by this Parliament because they are valuable in their own right? It would be a gesture of confidence in strengthening the role of national Parliaments if the British Government were willing to put into effect some of those improvements in parliamentary scrutiny and to work more closely with other national Parliaments, even while we are waiting to see what may or may not happen with the current amending treaty.</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0806233000169"></a>We also recognise that the European Council had to discuss a number of urgent policy issues, whatever the institutional setback. I note with interest that those on the Conservative Benches alternate between discussing how appalling the European Union is and complaining that it has not been effective enough on a range of subjects. On the subject of future oil and energy prices, I read the <I>Financial Times</I> every day and note the range of predictions. Of course, we all expect the British Prime Minister to be far more of a guru than bankers and others who predict prices, and I look forward to hearing what the Government will say.</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0806233000170"></a>The Statement said a certain amount about climate change and foreign policy. I was rather puzzled that it did not refer to the eastern neighbourhood policy, on which there is a great deal of work to be done, or to relations with the Mediterranean countries, on which the French have put up some rather badly thought-through proposals. There are real issues at stake with the Mediterranean countries.</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0806233000171"></a>I was also disappointed that the Statement does not stress the important work that the European Union is attempting to undertake on migration policy and border management, where there clearly are active British interests at stake since so many migrants who enter the European Union are trying to get to the United Kingdom. The idea of a closer dialogue with sending and transit states is therefore actively in Britain&#146;s interest. As for the issue of family breakdown, divorce law and inheritance law, I am conscious that a number of people, including  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1246"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1246</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lady Meyer, have actively argued that in a world where cross-border marriage and cross-border living are increasingly common, we need more active European negotiations on access to children, divorce law and the like.</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0806233000172"></a>We welcome the comments on Doha. One of the things that we on these Benches would like from Her Majesty&#146;s Government from now on is more straight-talking, not only to the British public but to some of the member states, about where interests lie in closer European co-operation. The remarks of President Sarkozy on the Doha round and the role of Commissioner Mandelson were extremely unhelpful. They played to populist French politics rather than constructive European co-operation. The recent remarks of the German Foreign Minister on why we need the European army and why he also wants to cut German defence spending also show the huge gap between the illusions in the debates of other nations as well as our own.</p>

<a name="80623-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0806233000173"></a>We on these Benches want a Government who not only play an active and constructive role in Europe but explain to their own domestic public the role that they are playing in Europe and to other member Governments the objectives that they think should be European priorities.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, talked in his opening remarks about referendums and the bullying and cajoling of Ireland. All I can do, rather than taking the time of the House now, is refer him to the many, many answers that I gave earlier to these questions. I have done that bit.</p>

<a name="80623-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0806233000175"></a>It was important to finish our parliamentary process. Noble Lords who had, as I did, the privilege of being part of the debates last Wednesday will know that the House agreed that it was important that our Prime Minister should go into the discussions aware of the British parliamentary view and able to continue some of the detailed discussions to which the noble Lords, Lord Strathclyde and Lord Wallace of Saltaire, have referred today. My right honourable friend did indeed have bilateral meetings with both the Irish and the Czech Prime Ministers to talk about the current European situation and other issues on the European Council agenda. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, is pleased that he did so.</p>

<a name="80623-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0806233000176"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, kindly went through a number of issues that were of particular concern. I will try to cover as many of them as possible in the time allotted to me. We have had many discussions both in the committees of your Lordships&#146; House and on the Floor of your Lordships&#146; House about data sharing and its relevance and importance to tackling serious organised crime, people trafficking, terrorism and so on, and I will not repeat them. I will say, however, that it is right that the European Union should continue to discuss with its member states how best to ensure that we share information appropriately and with safeguards&#151;this concerns the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, as it does us all&#151;to enable us to continue to tackle these important issues.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1247"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1247</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80623-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0806233000177"></a>On property and wills, a relevant issue is understanding that members of our country who choose to own properties in other countries will be subject to the conditions on properties and wills of those countries. Noble Lords who have looked into this will know that there is quite a difference between the property laws and inheritance laws of France and those of the UK. It is therefore right and proper that, without suggesting in any way that we give up anything, we should have dialogue and discussion about how that might work as more and more people from this country choose to buy properties not only in France and Germany but further afield&#151;for example, increasingly in Estonia.</p>

<a name="80623-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0806233000178"></a>I can tell the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, that we did not opt in to the divorce proposals. As he will know, after extensive consultation with the judiciary, we felt that it was not appropriate to do so because of our unique and distinct system. However, there are issues that we need to discuss, particularly when it comes to children and maintenance. We have signed up to the Hague process, which is very important. We can also veto any inheritance tax suggestions, as the noble Lord says. That, too, is important.</p>

<a name="80623-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0806233000179"></a>I said in the Statement and I have said before in your Lordships&#146; House that we have invited Professor Gallagher to review biofuels. I also alluded to this in my answer to questions about the results of the EULAC conference in Peru, which I was privileged to attend on behalf of my right honourable friend. It is important that we look sensibly and sensitively at food and fuel needs. As soon as we have the results of that review, I am sure that we will bring them to your Lordships&#146; House and another place to discuss them properly.</p>

<a name="80623-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0806233000180"></a>I will say little on Zimbabwe, as there will be a full Statement by my noble friend, who has led and discussed these issues right the way through the process that we are engaged in. I understand that he has been in discussion with other leaders today. I do not accept the tone of the suggestion made by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, that somehow this Government have not done enough. I hesitate to ask but I am interested to know exactly what the noble Lord thinks that we should have been doing. To solve this problem, we have to work in partnership with the European Union. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, about the number of times that opposition Members in both Houses have said, &#147;We don&#146;t like the European Union that much but, when it comes to these issues, why are you not doing more together?&#148;. The action that we are seeking to take is the most effective that we can find. However, we all recognise how desperate the situation is. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has done everything that he can think of. He continues on a daily basis to concern himself with trying to find ways of tackling these issues and&#151;with support from the European Union and other world leaders&#151;to put pressure on Zimbabwe to try to resolve this as peacefully as possible.</p>

<a name="80623-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0806233000181"></a>The Council conclusion makes it clear that we need further reform of the common agricultural policy to continue to improve the market orientation of agriculture. The budget review will also look at the CAP. The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, is right that there is   


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1248"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1248</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more to be done. We need to make sure that there is pressure to do that, but it is clear from our perspective that we wish that to happen.</p>

<a name="80623-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0806233000182"></a>There is&#151;I address this point to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, in particular&#151;a reinvigoration of what is called the Barcelona process for a union of the Mediterranean. I hope that we will see that work continue. We are pleased that the proposals on the eastern partnership are included in the conclusions. We are in favour of improvements to partnerships with all our European neighbours. This will help to balance the outreach south through the French-proposed Mediterranean union. I hope that the noble Lord will welcome that and see it as a greater benefit.</p>

<a name="80623-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0806233000183"></a>Finally, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Wallace. We talked quite a lot during the passage of the Bill about the fact that it is important to explain properly the work of the European Union, particularly where concerted action can play an important role. I am thinking not only about issues that affect us all across the European Union, such as those that I have already discussed, including serious and organised crime and so on, but about those areas that enable our citizens to live, work, travel and study in the European Union and enjoy the benefits of so doing.</p>

I will not, unlike the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, ask her what she thinks the price will be in six months or even six days, because I doubt whether she, or anybody else, really knows at the moment. However, I gather that at Jeddah there was some difference of opinion about whether at least an element of the huge increase in the price of oil was caused by speculation. I understand that the Government themselves are not of the view that there has been speculation. While I doubt whether it would have been wholly the cause, does my noble friend have any evidence on whether speculation has or has not been part of the cause of the increase in the price?</p>

Are the figures that she gave inclusive of what is intended for Zimbabwe or in addition to it? On the question of net grant or soft loan, how will the British contribution of &#163;200 million be denoted? Will it be a straight grant or some other form of money? Perhaps she will write to me.</p>

I shall write to him, particularly on how our additional &#163;200 million is used, as I suspect that it may still be the subject of discussion to see how it would be most effective. My understanding is that the totals include Zimbabwe. However, depending on what happens, there is an additional commitment in the Statement to look further at what might be done. I will wait for my noble friend to talk further about that in the context of his Statement.</p>

The presidency conclusions contain four and a half pages devoted to the western Balkans, including a detailed two-page declaration as the only annexe to the conclusions. However, there is no mention of Croatia. Before the Council met, the Commissioner in charge of enlargement, Olli Rehn, said that the result of the Irish referendum would have no effect on progress towards further enlargement. However, it appears that both France and Germany contest that and say that there can be no further enlargement until the necessary institutional reforms have been put in place to accommodate it.</p>

<a name="80623-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0806233000190"></a>Croatia has made significant progress in its negotiations towards accession and is now close to it. It is far ahead of any of the other western Balkan states. Would it not send a negative message to the whole region if Croatia&#146;s progress to accession were put into cold storage or blocked at this stage? The Government may have taken a position on that; I wonder whether they have. Do they agree with France and Germany or feel that the negotiations should stay on course now that Croatia has come so close to accession? Maybe the noble Baroness the Lord President would prefer to write to me if she does not have the answer, but it is an issue on which we would like clarification.</p>

As the noble Lord says, the Irish voting no should have no impact on the progress on technical negotiations for Croatia or for anybody else. Croatia set a target to complete negotiations in 2009; that target has been acknowledged by Commission President Barroso. I think&#151;it is also the Government&#146;s view&#151;that enlargement is the greatest success of the European Union. We all know that it is an effective lever for peace and prosperity in the western Balkans and for a Turkey that is a partner in reform and positive regional influence. I hope that that says enough for the noble Lord to be in no doubt of the UK Government&#146;s position on the issue.</p>

<ul><a name="0806233000231"></a>&#147;tackles effectively the issues that affect us all: the global financial crisis; the rising cost of food and fuel; combating climate change; and supporting people in the poorest countries in the world&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0806233000218"></a>Are not all those issues real ones for real people, whether in Ireland or in Burton upon Trent? However, it is difficult to get people to understand why the EU is relevant. If one could take party politics out of this, would there not be a strong case for doing more to explain to people why this is true? We have not succeeded in doing that. I do not think that this should be a party-political matter, but is it not incumbent on us to say why that statement is very true?</p>

One of the issues that arose during the discussions on the treaty was how best we could make sure that people understand the benefits of our membership of Europe and the benefits of being able, as 27 countries&#151;and, we hope, eventually more&#151;to work collaboratively together, whether that be around issues such as trade and development or around issues of justice and security.</p>

That would be easy to do, but the CAP could be extremely useful and could do a very good job for something else. If it rains over the great plains of Australia, China or wherever, there will be surpluses of grain. Under the CAP, there is a lot of storage. To buy in times of surplus and to release in times of shortage would be a good function to promote.</p>

Let us suppose that the judgment is in Mr Wheeler&#146;s favour and that his legitimate expectation of a referendum on the Lisbon treaty has not been met by the Government. How will the Government react? Will they proceed to ratification or will they grant a referendum? Secondly, on environmental policy, let us suppose that it becomes clear that, as many scientists believe, global warming has been caused almost wholly by the activity of the sun and hardly at all by human CO2 emissions and that, therefore, the planet may now be cooling down. What effect would that have on our environmental policy and that of the EU? The noble Baroness looks at me askance, but there are thousands of scientists who believe that now.</p>

Is it just that there should be any doubt at all, following the Irish referendum, which said no to the Lisbon treaty, that the treaty should continue to be ratified instead of being declared dead? That surely is not justice. Various reports in the newspapers, both yesterday and today, suggest that the Irish are being put under great pressure from the various countries of the EU, particularly France and Germany.

Would an alternative not be for the Government to advocate one change in the Lisbon treaty that would remove a lot of the worry and concern: the removal of the self-amending provisions?

Our objective now is to see what the Irish position will be and then to consider our position.

The Statement is as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;I am sure that the whole House will unite in its condemnation of the depravity of the Mugabe regime; in grieving at the needless loss of life; in wanting to send a clear message of support and solidarity to the people of Zimbabwe at this time; and in supporting new African efforts to find a resolution to the crisis. We share both their demand for a democratic future and their belief that they should not be denied this by violence or intimidation. Our primary concern has always been for them.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Since 29 March and the extraordinary scenes of courage shown then by those ordinary people who put their faith in democracy and the ballot box, we have seen a regime that has reverted to type. President Mugabe and his key generals use changes to the law as a means of identifying people who chose to vote for change. From then onwards, a campaign of violence was inflicted on those people, intend to punish them for having the temerity to say no to Robert Mugabe and no to ZANU-PF. We know that 34,000 people have been displaced, 2,700 injured and 84 murdered since that day. Two thousand of those people are sheltering in Harare, in MDC headquarters.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;This is not British propaganda. NGOs have documented the existence of torture camps. Independent media have published the names of those who have directed and orchestrated that violence.

Thousands of teachers and public servants had volunteered as presiding officers in the first round but have withdrawn their names for fear of violence and intimidation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;By Sunday, only 84 local election observers had been accredited when more than 10,000 had applied. It is a matter of public record that Morgan Tsvangirai has been detained five times in the past 10 days and that MDC Secretary-General Tendai Biti has been in prison and charged with a trumped-up treason offence since arriving back in Harare. The stage was set for the most rigged election in African history.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Robert Mugabe and his thugs have made an election impossible. It is clear that the only people with democratic legitimacy are those who won the parliamentary majority on 29 March and took most votes in the first round of the presidential election&#151;the Opposition. Zimbabwe needs a Government who are broad based and command the confidence of the majority of Zimbabweans. In addition to stopping the violence, that must be the focus of regional and international efforts. Since the announcement yesterday, the Prime Minister, Lord Malloch-Brown and I have spoken to Foreign Ministers and key figures in southern Africa and around the world. This is a crucial moment for Africa and the region. Ahead of the election, 40 senior Africans underlined their concern at the conditions in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The AU Commission has called for violence to end. The head of the Pan African Parliament Observer Mission said that violence was now at the top of the agenda of this electoral process. Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa, who is currently chair of Southern African Development Community, has said that,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08062317000048"></a>&#147;the current political environment in Zimbabwe falls far short of (SADC's) ... principles and guidelines&#148;.</p>
</ul> He said yesterday that the situation was scandalous and that what was happening in Zimbabwe was embarrassing to all Africans in the region. It is now for SADC and AU leaders to convene in early session and to establish a clear basis for regional engagement on the issue.<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;At the European Council last week, the Prime Minister and other leaders underlined their readiness to take further measures should President Mugabe attempt to steal the election. On behalf of the EU, the Slovenian Foreign Minister has issued a clear statement condemning the violence and the conditions which forced Morgan Tsvangirai to withdraw from the election. I spoke to Foreign Minister Rupel last night to welcome that statement and to discuss with him now the need to consider urgently how we can put further pressure&#151;a widening and deepening of the EU visa ban and targeted financial measures&#151;on Robert Mugabe and his elite which can be actioned at the next meeting of EU Foreign Ministers. Javier Solana and Commissioner Michel have both now issued statements condemning the violence and supporting Morgan Tsvangirai's decision.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;I have spoken to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and I welcome his statement yesterday. Later today, the Security Council will discuss

I am sure that our permanent representative will speak for the whole House when he says that the UN must contribute to the resolution of this crisis before the entire region is destabilised further. It is right and it is necessary that the Security Council, the African Union and SADC work together on this. The UN agencies have prepared for the many more refugees who may now flee Zimbabwe.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>The UN Secretary-General&#146;s envoy remains in the region and should be allowed to return to Zimbabwe. But the burden will still be borne by the region and by Zimbabwe's neighbours, and the role of their leaders is vital. Britain has long and historical links with Zimbabwe. I have never believed that the rights and wrongs of history should prevent us from speaking clearly and frankly about the situation today. Robert Mugabe's misrule does not invalidate the struggle for independence: our colonial history does not mean we cannot denounce that which is wrong. The test at all times should be whether our commitment and action can help the people of Zimbabwe.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The cynical decision to suspend NGOs delivering vital aid shows how far Mugabe has gone in abandoning Zimbabwe's people. Our foremost duty is still to press for humanitarian space to be re-opened and for those NGOs to be allowed to restart operations. One and a half million people have been affected by the ban. As the second largest bilateral donor, we will continue to provide aid and assistance as we can. The Secretary of State for International Development has chaired a meeting this morning to consider what more we can do to support urgently those in Zimbabwe. I have spoken to our ambassador and he and his staff are working hard to maintain a full suite of diplomatic amenities. Travel advice remains under review and recommends against all but essential travel.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;We will continue our efforts publicly and privately press for a solution to this crisis that reflects the will of the people in Zimbabwe. I am sure that honourable Members will agree with me that such a solution cannot come quickly enough. Mr Mugabe says that only God can remove him from office. Let us hope that the people of Zimbabwe get there first&#148;.</p>

Have we not now reached the point at which quiet diplomacy is finally at an end and where the UN and/or the democracies working together should finally move decisively? Is not the terrorising and murder of MDC members, of which the abduction, torture and murder of the young wife of the mayor of Harare is perhaps a hideous

Have we suggested, for instance, that the UN set up a commission of inquiry into the atrocities of Mugabe&#146;s criminal regime? Can there be a referral to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity? Was not that the purpose, among others, of setting up the court?</p>

<a name="80623-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08062317000006"></a>Is the Minister aware that South African lawyers have now pointed out that under Zimbabwe&#146;s own laws, since there is no run-off election within 21 days of the previous presidential elections, Robert Mugabe is holding office unlawfully, having not had a voting majority first time round? By this clear law the first round winner, the courageous Mr Tsvangirai, who is now sheltering, I understand, in the Dutch embassy in Harare, and whose life is in danger from the ZANU-PF mobs, should now be declared president. Is the noble Lord aware that the clear illegitimacy of the Mugabe regime requires SADC by its own rules to disbar Zimbabwe from membership? Has that point been discussed with the President of Zambia, who is chairman of SADC? Should not the UK now consider, first, the withdrawal of recognition from what is clearly a gangster regime? Secondly, should not the UK urge much tougher sanctions and a tougher application of existing EU sanctions against Zimbabwe and individuals and extend the visa ban to families and relatives of regime leaders, as we have repeatedly urged? That seems to have been ignored the other day when Mugabe turned up at the FAO meeting in Rome and where a UN official had the temerity to say that Mr Mugabe stood &#147;in good stead&#148; with the UN? Thirdly, should we not start putting together clearly and visibly the post-Mugabe programme of rescue and support for recovery which the people of Zimbabwe&#151;it was once a prosperous country and could be again&#151;will urgently need?</p>

<a name="80623-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08062317000007"></a>No one pretends that any of those moves is easy or can be undertaken unilaterally&#151;that would be absurd. Is it not essential to ensure that China, which is also involved in the area, faces its responsibilities in southern Africa and that Beijing, Moscow and Tokyo are just as necessary a part of the collective action needed as Washington or Brussels? I hope that our diplomats and policy makers have grasped that point at least and that we shall go forward from here in a positive direction to prevent an even greater tragedy.</p>

Before I comment on the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, perhaps I may say that the noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown, has gone to the limits of his endurance and capacity in trying to find some answer to Zimbabwe&#146;s problems. When I speak about the limits of his capacity, I have to say that that is very great indeed. I do not believe that any single individual could have done more. Having said that, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that there is a case for declaring loudly and clearly the election of Mr Mugabe when it happens, which will be soon&#151;in the next few days&#151;to be unlawful and to consider withdrawing our recognition of Zimbabwe in the light of that illegal position.</p>

<a name="80623-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08062317000009"></a>We could and should take further the issue of freezing the bank accounts of families and relatives of the regime and of making it clear that we will not help them in obtaining educational positions for their children in the universities of the western world. It is not unusual&#151;I say this in my capacity as a professor emerita&#151;to find the sons and daughters of some very disagreeable international figures benefiting from their parents&#146; position in order to obtain what one might call plum situations in the best-known universities of the world. The universities have a certain responsibility in that regard.</p>

<a name="80623-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08062317000010"></a>I have two other points. First, we might consider whether there is room for a Commonwealth meeting with SADC. It is striking that, of those African countries which have clearly spoken out about the dreadful situation in Zimbabwe&#151;such as Tanzania, Zambia and Botswana&#151;all but Angola are members of the Commonwealth, which has not had the kind of problem that the UN has had with Russia, China, and South Africa defying attempts to debate the situation. South Africa would undoubtedly be isolated in the Commonwealth, but that might currently be no bad thing.</p>

<a name="80623-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08062317000011"></a>Secondly, it is easy for us to be eloquent without always following actions we might take. I plead once more for the Minister and the Leader of the House to consider whether we should not look again at the absolute ban on Zimbabwean refugees being allowed to work in this country other than in the most exceptional situations. We now know that they cannot be sent back for some time to come; I wish that I could say that it will be next week but, as realists, we recognise that it will be at least several, perhaps many, months before Zimbabwean refugees in this country can be safely returned to a country that will otherwise undoubtedly torture and kill them if they are. In those circumstances, we cannot continue to refuse to allow Zimbabwean refugees to find some way to sustain their livelihoods and families. In the light of the Prime Minister&#146;s statement, I ask that the refugee situation be considered case by case and that such people, many of whom have been persecuted and tortured, should be allowed to work in this country and to return to their own in some better future to give the benefit of their education and experience in this country to their long-suffering people.</p>

I say to her and to the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that we all share the frustration that we have not been able to do more. This unites us; it is not a matter of pride that we should still be discussing President Mugabe as an individual in office, despite all that has happened. Use though he does the word &#147;decisively&#148;, I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, does not envisage military action. No parties in Zimbabwe have asked for military action. There is a full understanding that at this time that would be counterproductive for all sorts of reasons. We are discussing the most effective way to bring pressure on a rogue regime, the illegitimacy of which is quite beyond doubt. In that regard, we are probably in much the same place and can learn from each other what we might do to enhance those pressures.</p>

<a name="80623-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08062317000013"></a>First, during the end of last week and the weekend, Zimbabwe&#146;s neighbours in southern Africa went to the press one after the other and said that the intimidation level was making open and free elections all but impossible. That has created a potential coalition of SADC, the AU and the UN to allow us to take action against Mugabe on a scale that was previously impossible. For all his talk of sanctions, they were, as the noble Lord, Lord Howell, says, actually quite limited, against a handful of 130 individuals, and not particularly deep and wide. We now have the opportunity, first in the European Union, to dramatically deepen those sanctions and target bank accounts held not just in Europe, but globally, and look at the possibility of preventing the families of those who have committed these crimes being able to enjoy scholarships or travel aboard.</p>

<a name="80623-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08062317000014"></a>Each individual who has had a hand in this illegitimate second round must realise that they are open to the possibility of European and other international arrest warrants. None of them can travel easily without the possibility, at a customs point somewhere, of the hand of the law coming down on their shoulder and their being told that a European or other arrest warrant has been issued for them. Their actions are making them isolated criminals who have very few places to go outside Zimbabwe.</p>

<a name="80623-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08062317000015"></a>I reassure the noble Lord that this is an illegitimate regime in the view of this Government. As I said to the press this morning without the benefit of knowing what the South African lawyers said, by going beyond the constitutional requirement for a second round within 21 days because of efforts to manipulate the result, President Mugabe was governing on borrowed time and no longer within the bounds of his own constitution. He now faces the fact that the African Union does not under its own rules allow presidents who are not elected by democratic means to take their seat. President Mugabe faces the fact that most of his SADC neighbours have confirmed that his conduct of this election has not been within its own principles. We therefore face a different context, where the possibility of new pressure is real.</p>

<a name="80623-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08062317000016"></a>There remains the prospect of Commonwealth discussion of this matter. I have been in repeated contact with the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, but as I have said previously, we are a little impaired by the fact that Zimbabwe is not suspended from the Commonwealth, as are, for example, Pakistan or Fiji, but has resigned from it. African countries hesitate to bring the Commonwealth back into something that they think is better solved by SADC, the AU and the UN.</p>

<a name="80623-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08062317000017"></a>We are looking at the support that we may need to give Zimbabweans in this country, particularly at the ban on refugees taking up work.</p>

On whether power resides in the hands of President Mugabe or the members of the joint operations centre, our suspicion is both. We look at President Mugabe as still very much responsible for the actions taken in his name, but it is undoubtedly the case that it is the joint operations centre, rather than the ZANU-PF party apparatus, that has run the second round of this election in such a brutal and militarised way.</p>

We are looking for that kind of leadership across the whole of southern Africa. Would it not be helpful if ex-president Nelson Mandela, who is in London this week to celebrate his 90th birthday&#151;for which I am sure the whole House will send its good wishes&#151;could speak out about the appalling situation in Zimbabwe? His authority would surely carry some weight, even with the dreadful regime there.</p>

I am sure she has noticed that Mr Mandela&#146;s wife, Graca Machel, was one of the signatories to the open letter published last week. We need to be very careful not to appear to put pressure on Mr Mandela to come out publicly while he is here for his 90th birthday celebrations. He must be fully conscious of how powerful his words would be if uttered at the right time. Despite his extreme reluctance to involve himself in political issues at this stage in his life and career, I have no doubt that he must be weighing the pros and cons of this. However, were he to deliver a statement in London, apparently as a result of pressure from us, I think that it would lose a lot of the force that it might otherwise have.</p>

Some of them are expected to report on what they see to a meeting of SADC leaders later this week and possibly to the AU summit at the weekend.

Is the evidence that is already available being systematically compiled with that view in mind? The noble Lord will recall the example&#151;he mentioned it earlier&#151;of the six year-old boy who was incinerated only a week ago because he was in the home of his father, who was an opposition politician. Since then, there have been appalling reports of the systematic mutilation of members of the opposition, with many atrocities occurring.

It is not an impossible path to proceed down. There is a possibility of winning Chinese acquiescence as well as Russian acquiescence&#151;to take the two countries which have at times shown diffidence and resistance to these approaches. We have had success with China on Zimbabwe. As noble Lords may remember, I was able to secure a commitment from the Chinese last year in Beijing to cease development assistance to Zimbabwe. This year we received a commitment from the Chinese that the arms on the Chinese arms shipment provided by a state company would not be unloaded but would instead be returned to China rather than used for internal repression in Zimbabwe. So this is not a dialogue of the deaf; it is a dialogue where we are making progress. But my noble friend is correct. We need to make a lot more progress to try and align China with our vision of good governance and human rights in Africa.</p>

When there is a Government whose legitimacy we do not accept, we make it clear that we do not accept that Government as representative of the people of the country and therefore that we will not do business with them. That is the formula that we are seeking here. I would just ask whether, in addition to the case of Mr Tsvangirai and the Dutch embassy, we would really want to close our embassy and leave the 14,000 British nationals in Zimbabwe unprotected?</p>

Secondly, he said that the heavy arm of the law may very well pick up the people in Mr Mugabe&#146;s regime when they come to Europe.

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08062332000008"></a>On the second point, it is worth saying that President Mugabe was not in Europe on a state visit to a European capital; he was there under the same provision which has allowed Fidel Castro, Yasser Arafat and President Ahmadinejad to go to UN headquarters in New York at a time when they were not on good terms with the United States. It is just part of the terms and conditions&#151;the agr&#233;ment&#151;of UN offices. As a membership organisation available to all countries, the heads or official representatives of those countries can travel through the national territory of the country where the UN headquarters is located to attend a meeting. So please do not believe that there was support in that case. At the EU Lisbon meeting at the end of last year, there was a judgment that letting him come was a lower profile way of handling the situation than having a confrontation around it. It was not necessarily a judgment we shared, which is why our Prime Minister did not attend the meeting.</p>

The current situation is damaging not just the people of Zimbabwe but the reputation of the international community, which is seen as impotent and over-reliant on South Africa, for example. However, we have drawn some strength from the way in which we as a country have dealt with African dictators in the past. When Idi Amin evicted the Ugandan Asians this country gave support and, in many instances, shelter to those who lost their homes, their community and their citizenship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08062332000021"></a>Clause 13, which Amendment No. 44 seeks to amend, provides for a review of the qualifying earnings band. It is right that the band is reviewed, but the clause appears to restrict revaluation to considerations of whether the bands have kept their value. I would like to see a wider power to vary the bands that would allow changes to be made for any reason. This would allow other issues to be considered, such as whether the new system band was properly serving the low paid or those with higher pay. There also needs to be periodic reviews of whether the proposed contribution levels are good enough to provide an adequate pension. Experts consider a lifetime 15 per cent contribution as necessary for most people to meet their preferred retirement income. While the proposed contribution levels have been carefully struck as a compromise between different interest groups in the debate, it should not be forgotten that the objective must always be to provide a decent retirement income. Pension provision is about the future. It is about provision for our children, our grandchildren and even our great-grandchildren. Nobody knows what the future may hold. It therefore seems right and proper that there should be a degree of flexibility to cope with unforeseen events.</p>

Nevertheless, as far as this clause is concerned, it is felt that there is a case for rather more flexibility. I therefore beg to move.</p>

It is important to recognise that the band of earnings represents part of the compromise and the consensus on the whole pensions settlement and that any radical departure from that may undermine the consensus. The limits, particularly the upper limit, have the effect of controlling employers&#146; costs as well as ensuring that the personal accounts scheme stays on the target market and does not compete unduly with alternative pension provisions. We completely understand that the band may need to be changed occasionally, but I am not sure that the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment, which does not even have the affirmative procedure attached to it, is the right way of going about things. As such changes could be quite significant, we see primary legislation as perhaps the right way of realigning the scheme.</p>

The reforms that we have discussed have been structured to set a median earner with a solid state entitlement on course to achieve an income in retirement of around 45 per cent of their working life earnings, in line with the recommendation of the Pensions Commission. The qualifying earnings band establishes the link between working life earnings and pension saving. As the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said, this is part of the consensus that was reached. Having made this important link, we need to maintain it. We will do this by reviewing the limits of the band every year to see whether they have maintained their value. Depending on the outcome of that review, we expect to uprate the limits in line with changes to average earnings.</p>

<a name="80623-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08062332000026"></a>Ensuring that the limits of the qualifying earnings band keep pace with changes to average earnings will ensure that the contributions of jobholders also keep pace. This is important if we are to maintain the balance between working life income and income in retirement. Uprating the lower limit of the qualifying earnings band in line with changes to average earnings will also avoid enrolling increasing numbers of workers on very low earnings, for whom state provision already offers high income-replacement rates. It is crucial that we retain the flexibility necessary to ensure that the earnings band is uprated appropriately. As my noble friend said, pensions are a long-term issue. However, the clause as drafted already provides that flexibility. I do not believe that these amendments would provide any additional flexibility when it comes to reviewing and uprating the limits of the qualifying earnings band. Accordingly, I ask my noble friend to withdraw her amendment.</p>

We accept that they might have to be realigned, which was the purport of the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, although there should be a special procedure if that is to be the case. However, the flexibility that the Minister wants is merely to say what kind of revaluation it is, because Clause 13 talks only of the Secretary of State determining whether the earnings band has maintained its value. As this is in essence about earnings leading to replacement income in retirement, I cannot see any other logical basis on which to determine value, and I struggle to see what kind of flexibility the Government seek.</p>

We are simply creating a little space to have flexibility. It is not unreasonable for government to ask for that. I know that the noble Baroness always sees the most horrendous plots when the Government seek flexibility, but it is not that. We have made very clear our intention to maintain the link between lifetime earnings and replacement income and the proposition that the bands are set to get that replacement rate of 45 per cent at the start. We expect to uprate them by earnings, and we hope and believe that this regime will remain in place for 20, 30 or 40 years with the consensus that has been built, but we cannot be absolutely certain.

This is when the Government either do not know the answer or do not want to tell us what they are going to do with the Bill. It has been relatively clear from the outset. The Pensions Commission recommended that the bands be uprated in line with earnings. The Government, in their White Paper, accepted that recommendation. The Minister has said that he accepts it on more than one occasion at the Dispatch Box. However, when we seek to get that reflected in the Bill we are confronted with complete obduracy for reasons that have not been articulated, except to say that it is for flexibility. That is not satisfactory, and I seek to test the opinion of the Committee.</p>

</ul>
<a name="80623-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08062332000056"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall also speak to the other amendments in this group. Clause 15 is the first in a series of clauses setting out the minimum requirements for pension schemes that can be used to comply with the new employer duties. As it stands, the clause requires qualifying schemes to be UK tax registered, so as to enable scheme members and their employers to benefit from UK tax relief on their contributions. For scheme members, this is equivalent to a contribution from the Government, through a lower tax deduction, to their retirement savings.</p>

<a name="80623-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08062332000057"></a>However, we recognise that individuals may be seconded to the UK from abroad for short periods of employment and that, prior to their arrival, some would have joined a pension scheme set up in their home countries, outside the UK tax registration regime. Government Amendment No. 50 will enable us to accommodate individuals in such circumstances. It contains a regulation-making power to allow the Secretary of State to specify in legislation that non-UK schemes can be qualifying schemes under the employer duty where they are not UK tax registered in prescribed circumstances, which are likely to be those in which their members are able to receive UK tax relief on their contributions made from UK earnings, as is permitted in certain circumstances by HMRC.</p>

<a name="80623-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08062332000058"></a>The amendment and others in the group are concerned with ensuring that we support and encourage existing good-quality pension provision. We want to encourage employers to retain their existing pension arrangements, where those arrangements satisfy our  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1271"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1271</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>minimum standards, by providing as much flexibility as possible for multinational employers with a multinational workforce.</p>

<a name="80623-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08062332000059"></a>We also want to ensure that the widest range of schemes can be offered as qualifying schemes, but with the necessary safeguards to protect members&#146; interests. Schemes operated outside the UK could provide high-quality benefits and we do not want to prevent employers from offering them. However, such schemes are not subject to FSA regulation of their operations. Therefore, it is important to ensure a robust regulatory regime for non-UK-based schemes if they are to be used under the employer duty.</p>

<a name="80623-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08062332000060"></a>With that in mind, Amendment No. 76 limits the application of the quality requirements set out in Clause 25 to UK-operated personal pension schemes whose operation is regulated by the Financial Services Authority. Amendment No. 81, meanwhile, brings in a new clause containing the power to prescribe in regulations the quality requirements for personal pension schemes whose operation falls outside the FSA&#146;s regulatory remit. That is the case for non-UK-operated personal pensions.</p>

<a name="80623-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08062332000061"></a>Taken together, Amendments Nos. 76 and 81 seek to future-proof our policy by being clear what the quality criteria are for schemes whose operations are regulated by the FSA, while enabling us to cater for schemes subject to a regulatory regime outside the UK or schemes with features not common to UK schemes where that might be appropriate. That will allow the Secretary of State to respond flexibly to the widest range of schemes and enable employers to retain diverse, high-quality pension provision.</p>

<a name="80623-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08062332000062"></a>As a consequence of Amendments Nos. 50, 76 and 81, we are introducing a number of technical amendments to Clauses 18, 25 and 86, which make up the remaining amendments in the group. I hope that the Committee is in agreement with the proposals to support and encourage good-quality existing provision. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="08062332000063"></a><a name="80623-0008.htm_spnew20"></a><b><a name="80623-0008.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="08062332000372"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> Not being a tax expert like the Minister or my noble friend Lady Noakes, I am afraid that I have a few questions. I readily understand that there should be minimum requirements for pension schemes to be tax registered where they are indeed tax registered, but he said towards the end of our proceedings last week that the Government were interested in the total amount of money going into the schemes as a primary test. I think that that was at col. 1018; I am speaking from memory. I shall go into that in a bit more detail in a minute or two. Given that, it does not particularly matter whether you have a tax-registered scheme, so long as the total amount of money is at least equal to the minimum that the Government have set out in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80623-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08062332000064"></a>Another point occurred to me in listening to the noble Lord. I understand that the schemes that he is interested in under the amendments are not regulated by the Financial Services Authority. However, the regulatory part of the Bill is all about the Pensions Regulator. To what extent, if any, might they be regulated by the Pensions Regulator?</p>

<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1272"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1272</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>qualifying schemes is that they are registered under the Finance Act 2004. The getting of tax relief is not the only important thing, obviously; that tax relief is available only if the structure of the scheme fits certain criteria. That is why the provision is there.</p>

<a name="80623-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08062332000066"></a>When we are talking about satisfying the quality requirements of money purchase schemes, the noble Lord is right in one respect. We are interested in the amount that goes in, not the basis on which it is calculated. However, that is a separate point. We are providing for schemes that expats might routinely be signed up to when they come into the UK. They are not registrable under the Finance Act 2004. Typically, there might be arrangements if there are corresponding schemes under which UK tax relief can still be available on contributions, but the provision that a qualifying scheme should be registered under Part 4 of the Finance Act 2004 is an important building block in the definition of qualifying schemes generally.</p>

<a name="80623-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08062332000067"></a>We are simply taking out and enabling a further qualifying arrangement by taking the power to look at circumstances of specific schemes that would not fit the criteria. If we do not do that, we could end up with a situation in which, when an expat was seconded into the UK to work and remained a member of their home-country scheme but that scheme could not be a qualifying scheme, there would be an auto-enrolment duty on the employer. That would not make much sense if the scheme that they were in were good quality. We are carving out an opportunity through regulation to be able to bring forward other criteria to facilitate that. It is no more or less than that.</p>

<a name="80623-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08062332000068"></a>The noble Lord also asked what, if the schemes were FSA registered or came within the FSA&#146;s ambit, the powers of the Pensions Regulator would be. The new clause is wide enough if necessary to safeguard members&#146; interests by including regulatory requirements as part of the qualifying requirements. Those might include requirements relating to the regulatory jurisdiction that a scheme falls under. It is a process by which one can seek to ensure effective regulation, even if it is not regulation under FSA and UK arrangements. That is the purpose. I hope that that deals with matters satisfactorily for him.</p>

I would like to restart the debate launched by the party opposite&#151;by Mr Willetts and Mr Rifkind in the other place&#151;for a lifetime savings account. I was persuaded by their arguments, if not the technicalities. The point of raising it today is that it is appropriate to see whether there is any support among the political parties, business and industry for such a scheme, because unless there is it is obviously not going to go anywhere.</p>

<a name="80623-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08062332000075"></a>Why might such a scheme be necessary? As they grow older, men on above median earnings will usually have some savings beyond their pensions. As mortgage pressures, for example, ease, they may have an ISA or two. Those people on below median earnings, especially women who may be well below, seldom have savings. There is abundant research to show why. Scottish Widows has always flown the flag for women&#146;s pension issues, as did the former EOC, which did good work on this, the DWP and the former DSS. Some of these points are fairly obvious but perhaps bear repeating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08062332000076"></a>Women will not have rainy-day savings because, clearly, there is not enough disposable money. Their earnings may be part-time, low and intermittent; in some sense, they may be regarded as temporary. What money there is may generate difficulties of management and, more likely, problems of debt, rather than problems of savings. On top of that, for younger women especially, there is still the utopian view that a Prince Charming at best, or husband if not, will see to it that there is almost a financial division of labour within the family. He will do the long-term pension stuff, while she does the short-term household budget stuff. His pension, therefore, is for them both. The idea that the pension was for both of them was one of the reasons why your Lordships time and again were behind pension sharing after divorce.</p>

<a name="80623-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08062332000077"></a>Despite what we know about family breakdown, the belief that it is for the man to provide for both of them persists. The woman may therefore feel that to save in a pension, rather like having a pre-nuptual agreement, somehow indicates a lack of trust. If money is tight and if the man saves into a pension, the woman, in turn, is more likely to view household spending as her priority. The trainers for the children and school trips are her contribution to family financial circumstances and she will tend to put other people&#146;s financial needs, especially those of the children, ahead of her own.</p>

<a name="80623-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08062332000078"></a>The woman sees saving in a pension as being selfish&#151;research has shown that women use that word&#151;and women are hard-wired to think that that is the worst of all social sins. Even if she does not think that she is being selfish, she could be put off by complexity, obscurity, worries about mis-selling and concerns about the impact of means-tested benefits whereby, allegedly, Tracey&#146;s mum who saved is no better off than her aunt down the road who did not. Above all, pension savings are locked away for 40 years. Therefore, if there is a crisis around the corner, they are untouchable, even though the need now may be far greater than the need in 20 years&#146; time because of, for example, divorce, disability, repossession or the husband&#146;s unemployment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08062332000079"></a>I believe that the policy makers are making a mistake. At retirement, men and women are, for the most part, in similar financial situations with a steady but low income and steady but predictable expenditure. Because men are none the less worse off in retirement than when they are in work, that is projected somehow on to women&#146;s working lives. Because they share a common retirement life, it is almost like a retrospective fallacy. It is presumed that they share a common financial situation in their working lives and that, therefore, the job of pension savings is for men and women alike, primarily to smooth the way from work to non-work worlds.</p>

<a name="80623-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08062332000080"></a>However, just because the experience in retirement may be broadly similar, that does not mean that there will be a similar experience in work patterns and that, therefore, income should be relocated from working life to pensions in the same way. It does not mean that it makes equally good sense for women as it usually does for men to smooth incomes from working life to non-working life. Whereas men probably will work throughout and build a pension throughout, women face much more of a rollercoaster of risk, to which men are never exposed, which will result in intermittent connection with the labour market.</p>

<a name="80623-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08062332000081"></a>We need to help women to smooth their incomes during their working lives&#151;something that we do not normally need to do for men&#151;just as we need to smooth for both genders their income from their working lives into retirement. More than most men, a woman will need a rainy-day savings account&#151;&#163;5,000, &#163;10,000 or &#163;15,000 probably&#151;because of the risks that she will face, which will be higher than those of most men, and because, as a low earner, she is much less likely to have any protection against those risks. Her need for a rainy-day account is greater, but her likelihood of having one is less. You would expect her instead to save in a pensions account. I suggest that those poorer women simply cannot afford to have both a rainy-day account and a pension, even if they were minded to. Faced with an impossible choice, women may choose to do neither and will remain at the edge of financial risk.</p>

<a name="80623-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08062332000082"></a>How do we help such poorer women? We are very good at helping better-off men who need our help least. For example, the movement of ISAs to pensions is permitted, even if the man probably has both and can afford both. The woman needs the reverse&#151;that is, pensions to ISAs. But ISAs alone will not do, as they do not have the tax attraction or the employer&#146;s contribution. As far as I am aware, there is no one simple and affordable product on the market that allows women to combine short-term rainy-day savings and long-term pension savings. Would a LiSA do that?</p>

<a name="80623-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08062332000083"></a>The Tory proposals originally were probably fiscally too complex, because of the tax relief that comes into a pension pot, which would not normally be available for spending purposes, and because the American example&#151;401(k)&#151;was probably too loose. But we have a ready-made vehicle: the 25 per cent tax-free lump sum is available at the age of 50 now, rising to 55 in April 2010. It is often used to pay off the mortgage, the university costs of children or even to help children on the housing ladder. That lump sum can be drawn  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1275"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1275</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ahead of drawing one&#146;s pension by 15 or even 25 years if one chooses to continue to work, provided that the money goes into an income drawdown fund. So you can draw your lump sum at the age of 50, although you may not need to draw your pension until you are 75.</p>

<a name="80623-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08062332000084"></a>I propose that, subject to a floor and ceiling, individuals&#151;obviously this would be most helpful to women&#151;could access that lump sum over their working life. The floor might be &#163;20,000, so that there has to be something like 10 years of savings already in the pension pot. The ceiling might be &#163;80,000 or &#163;100,000, so that it is not distorted by clever accountants as a wheeze to pay school fees, for example. It would mean that the woman could access &#163;5,000, &#163;20,000 or &#163;25,000 during her working life if she needed to, but it would have to be rebuilt before she could draw any more. For example, if she took &#163;10,000 from a &#163;40,000 pot, she would not be allowed any more until she had rebuilt beyond that &#163;40,000 to, say, &#163;60,000. She could then take 25 per cent of the difference between the &#163;40,000 and &#163;60,000&#151;that is, a further &#163;5,000.</p>

<a name="80623-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08062332000085"></a>No tax adjustments would be necessary because that sum comes tax free. It is simple. Obviously, depending on when it is drawn down, it would have investment return implications and would need to be tracked in order to consider whether, for example, there should be a limit on the number of times it could be accessed. I believe that such a proposition or something similar would, if the Government and the industry were so minded, overcome what to me is the deepest risk of mis-selling, which is not that you are not better off in retirement than if you had not saved, which is how it is usually presented, but that you are worse off in your working life because you have saved and you cannot rescind that decision or touch those savings when your need in your working life may, especially for some women, be more desperate.</p>

<a name="80623-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08062332000086"></a>We are hooked on the false assumption that you are always better off under the age of 65 and worse off over the age of 65. That is what pensions are all about. For some women that is simply not true. Yet that assumption is seldom questioned because we still think in gender terms. I certainly advise younger people with non-conventional careers or no employers&#146; contributions not to think of a pension but instead to go into an ISA. Poorer women do not have that luxury. However, with personal accounts and compulsory employer contributions, it is wise for a woman to go into a pension, but only if she has some rainy-day protection.</p>

<a name="80623-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08062332000087"></a>To summarise and to conclude, I cannot do, and I do not think that any of us can, the counter-factual as to how many women might save who otherwise would not or, equally important, how many&#151;I feel that there will be a growing number&#151;would continue saving who otherwise would be tempted to give up when it gets difficult. We know that half of all women give up when they have children. When the going gets tough, the women get out. I believe that some women face far harder financial pressure during their working lives than at retirement, but this is seldom mentioned because it is not true for the men and we still continue to model pensions on assumptions about men&#146;s working lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08062332000088"></a>I suggest to your Lordships that poorer women cannot afford both rainy-day savings and a pension. We may be giving them bad advice to go for a pension if through financial pressure they need access to that money earlier. That 25 per cent tax-free lump sum could allow us to bridge the risk that they face. As constructed, pensions are not an appropriate vehicle for some women. However, if there was support within government and the industry to provide a simple combined product&#151;a LiSA&#151;I think that that could be a win-win situation for us all. I beg to move.</p>

As my noble friend was speaking, my mind went back some years to a time when people could draw the whole amount out of their pension funds and pay for it at the end of their lives. They could draw the whole amount out of the occupational funds. It was mainly women who did this simply because of crises during their lives&#151;they drew it out for their children or for whatever purpose. If we want to have a saving culture that covers both men and women, this idea is certainly worth looking at. It is a probing amendment but it is something we need to pause and think about. It may or may not work but I certainly think it is worth examination. That is why I lend my support to the amendment.</p>

This is an interesting idea and potentially a rather valuable one. From memory, in the United States there was a similar scheme a few years back. It had both advantages and disadvantages. It illustrated the scope of what people might require and how they might be helped in this way.</p>

<a name="80623-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08062332000091"></a>It seems to me that it makes the whole concept more attractive. That is important because if we are going to have more people covered by pension saving we have to make it as obviously attractive as we can. It also means that the tax-free sum could help women in particular at particularly difficult and crucial times of their lives. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, said that this does not mean that your pension savings are simply locked away for life. That is a rather important point to hang on to. It recognises that many women are not able both to have a pension and to save in addition to that pension. That is the crucial point. I should have thought that anything that could be done to help in that regard should be done and is obviously of particular importance to women. This is an imaginative idea that deserves study and I hope that the Government will give an assurance that they will at least think about it and examine its potential.</p>

The analysis is understood and shared and the objectives are laudable and fine. This may sound like a bureaucratic point of view from the Opposition Benches, but anybody who has listened to Mr Tim Jones of the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority will know that he is absolutely fixed with the notion that this has to be a quintessentially simple scheme without any kind of embellishments&#151;I do not mean that in a derogatory way as I think this is a fundamentally important idea.</p>

If this provision were as seductive as the noble Baroness sets out, lots of people might take advantage of it. Notwithstanding that I agree with the concept, might we not find that it would be so seductive that a lot of people would go for this and we might end up with a level of expenditure and administration behind the personal accounts that would put the whole scheme in jeopardy?</p>

Pensions have always been a poor fit for the risk and realities that women face. I very much welcome their support for what was an initiative by David Willetts in launching four years ago a consultation on the paper <I>Towards a Lifetime of Saving</I> written by the Conservative Research and Development Policy Unit. LiSA&#151;the lifetime savings and pension account&#151;is a new approach which is extremely simple, clear and flexible and supports both life cycle and retirement saving. It is very much a wrapper not a product in itself and, after the consultation last August, John Redwood&#146;s Economic Competitiveness<I></I>Policy Group report endorsed the idea of a flexible lifetime savings account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08062332000099"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord Fowler that this in an interesting and valuable notion. His reference and the reference by the noble Baroness to the Section 401 scheme in the United States gives us an example of how one can turn the cycle of what has now become a system in which it is very easy to borrow but very difficult to save. That is one of the problems the Government are now facing in bringing forward the Bill. I agree, however, with the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope, that although the concept is good, we are a little concerned that it might make the objective of PADA and Mr Tim Jones more complicated. Although it is a very good idea, attaching what one might describe as bells and whistles to the concept might make it a little more difficult to introduce and delay its implementation. However, it is important to know where the Government stand on the idea. There is no doubt that the noble Baroness is right&#151;something needs to be done to meet the particular circumstances faced by women as well as a number of other groups in society. It is easy to regard investment in a home as the opportunity to build up resources for retirement. Indeed, we have seen a shift towards greater emphasis on property investment in the main home rather than in a more flexible savings account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08062332000101"></a>The noble Baroness has given us an excellent opportunity to reflect on how we can ensure that the particular circumstances of certain groups, especially women, are met much more adequately and positively by new concepts and by moving forward in a way that will positively encourage the sort of saving that we would all like to see.

The more I listen, the more I think about it. When she introduced this probing amendment she, very fairly, asked where the Conservatives stood on this. They are not exactly progressing very fast. I remember the major initiative by David Willetts four years ago&#151;that is quite a long consultation. I was not quite sure, listening to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, where the Conservatives stand, even though they are keen to hear where the Government stand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08062332000103"></a>I am a bit sceptical, to be honest. The noble Baroness has rightly highlighted the problem of poorer women in particular, but whether this is the right way to solve it I do not know. It raises the question of whether a revolving pension pot, which is what she is talking about, should enjoy tax relief. In principle, it also raises the question of whether the tax-free lump sum is ultimately defensible and is the best way of dealing with pensioner poverty. It is very interesting that this debate has highlighted that possibility; the noble Baroness might say that as long as you have the tax-free lump sum, you should be able to withdraw it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08062332000106"></a>I am all in favour of this savings initiative that will spread the breadth and practice of saving. The Minister should not be shy about the Government encouraging such things. Long ago, when the poor did not save, a government department, called the Post Office, introduced insurance for the poor and the Post Office Savings Bank. It had a good run and provided a useful service. Regrettably, on insurance, when the private sector showed far more enterprise than the Post Office, and did good work for the poor thereby, the secretary to the Post Office, when encouraged by colleagues to employ salesmen to promote his product, wrote:</p>

I am sympathetic to my noble friend&#146;s concern that some individuals, particularly the low paid and women, may be reluctant to commit to saving in a pension because their money would be &#147;locked away&#148; until their retirement. I was interested in what my noble friend said about less emphasis on smoothing income from women who are in work to retirement, and should like to reflect further on that component of her contribution. However, from a policy perspective and an operational viewpoint, this proposal goes against the underlying principles of reform at a time when it is paramount that we make pensions simpler and clearer.</p>

I acknowledge my noble friend&#146;s point that access to the tax-free lump sum does not have to be accompanied by retirement or indeed by a pension at that time, but I suggest that it is the start of the decumulation process. The age has been changed from 50 to 55 because at age 55 it was increasingly difficult, given longevity, to sustain pensions. Given the demographic pressures facing the UK and a tendency by individuals to underestimate their longevity, increasing retirement incomes is very important. It is the central objective of all our reforms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08062332000110"></a>Allowing individuals to withdraw some of their funds prematurely could not only undermine the purpose of providing tax relief for pension saving but reduce individuals&#146; income in retirement. It may also increase the risk of reliance on means-tested benefits in retirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08062332000111"></a>In addition to this fundamental objection to the proposal, I am concerned about the practical implications and repeat what others have said. Any pension schemes used under the employer duty would have to absorb the costs of this extra functionality, particularly if access were to be restricted to prescribed circumstances. That might involve costly changes to scheme rules and there would be additional processes around transactions, payback periods, deciding on the reasons for access, verifying those reasons for access, pursuing outstanding funds, and so on. This would lead to greater costs for employers or scheme members depending on how the scheme administration was paid for. This is not just an issue for personal accounts. If you had this facility, you could not just focus it on personal accounts, and how it would work for a defined benefit scheme would be a particular challenge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08062349000004"></a>Of course we recognise that there are times when people need to access funds for emergencies, but to cope with the complexities of life, individuals have the option of saving for the long term in a pension and of putting something away in a shorter-term tax-free savings product, such as an ISA, for rainy days. I accept the comment that it might be a struggle for everyone to save in two different pots, but from 2010 the savings gateway will provide stronger savings incentives. Through a matched contribution the scheme aims to kick-start a saving habit among people on lower incomes, enabling them to plan for the future and cope with financial pressures. The savings gateway will provide a better way to target those who want to access liquid saving, rather than allowing everyone to have early access to their pensions.</p>

<a name="80623-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08062349000005"></a>I remind noble Lords of the changes that have been made to help women in particular achieve a decent income in retirement. There have been transformational changes to the basic state pension, which we passed last year. There have been changes to S2P, and there is the whole concept of auto-enrolment and the scheme that we are discussing in this Bill, focused on people with low to medium earnings&#151;the group, regrettably, within which women are overrepresented&#151;to help them into saving.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1281"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1281</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80623-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08062349000006"></a>My noble friend referred to research. We believe that there is little evidence to support the assertion that low-paid individuals are unlikely to commit to pension saving because their money is locked in until retirement. Several sources, including DWP and international evidence, suggest that there is little demand for a facility that allows individuals to access their pension savings before retirement. DWP qualitative research in 2006 found that individuals felt strongly negative about the option of allowing people to access their pension funds for reasons other than their retirement. They felt that it was incongruous with the scheme&#146;s aim of encouraging people to save. I believe that the US experience in the 401(k) accounts is that there was only 18 per cent take-up of the drawback facilities and no strong evidence to suggest an attraction to increased saving through that facility.</p>

<a name="80623-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08062349000007"></a>Finally, we should not forget that from 2012 all individuals will retain the choice as to whether to save in a qualifying scheme or whether a more liquid product might better suit their needs. There is a range of pension and tax-efficient savings products to suit individuals in all circumstances. Trying to address all of life's potential future complexities in one financial product would make schemes administratively burdensome and costly. There are substantial downsides as well. People who get into financial difficulties and have the facility to access scheme funds earlier could put those funds in the hands of creditors whereas they would otherwise be protected through the pension scheme.</p>

<a name="80623-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08062349000008"></a>It is paramount that our pension reforms focus on the key goal of increasing pension savings by providing simple and appropriate products. The amendment would undermine that. As I am sure my noble friend is well aware, it would be impossible to have a qualifying scheme if we adopted this proposal as it stands because you could not have a scheme that was registered under the Finance Act 2004 and that had these provisions. I know that she is aware of that. If we were ever to go down this route, the other place would have to change the tax rules to enable lump sums to be withdrawn from a pension scheme earlier. I am sure that she is aware that there is no great appetite for that.</p>

<a name="80623-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08062349000009"></a>I know that my noble friend will withdraw her amendment, because it is a probing amendment. I have no doubt that she will not see this as the end of the debate and that she will continue to develop and articulate this issue. However, I earnestly say to her that wherever that debate leads, there is no great appetite for this within the industry that we can discern. I have raised it anecdotally with a few people, though other people's experience may be different. But whatever the appetite, I do not believe that this is a matter for this legislation. I do not doubt that my noble friend will continue to develop and campaign around the concept. Nevertheless, I would ask her to withdraw the amendment in the interim.</p>

First, I thank noble Lords. I am grateful for the range of contributions; they were thoughtful and helpful. Perhaps I may comment on the concerns that people raised over and beyond the

The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said that PADA offered essentially a simple product, a point reinforced by my noble friend the Minister, and that this amendment might add bells and whistles that would make it more expensive to deliver. I accept that it would make what is currently a simple product more complicated. My argument is that it would make it more attractive and would produce greater staying power and robustness in the longer term as a result.</p>

<a name="80623-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08062349000011"></a>Much of my noble friend&#146;s speech seemed to miss the point: &#147;Pensions are for retirement; therefore retirement savings are for retirement&#148;. Yes, we know that. The problem arises when people feel that they cannot afford retirement savings because they may face a higher risk in their pre-retirement age. How do you manage to persuade them not only to auto-enrol, which I think they will do, but to continue to save at points of crisis? The alternative may be to go for high rates of debt, rates of 15 per cent or 20 per cent, when the CAB will say, &#147;Stop making your pension contribution&#148;. My noble friend has not begun to think about how we keep women in auto-enrolled schemes when the first financial crisis begins to hit. They will auto-enrol&#151;inertia will see to that&#151;but they will not necessarily stay in. Currently, half of all women drop out of a pension scheme on the birth of their first child. It will be even higher with auto-enrolment because they did not make a conscious choice to join in the first place, unlike today's schemes.</p>

<a name="80623-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08062349000012"></a>I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said, and I thought that his words were very elegantly phrased. He said that pensions were &#147;a poor fit for the risks and realities that women face&#148;. One of those risks and realities is the rollercoaster of risk through lone parenthood and financial problems. A product such as this would simply add a top slice of liquidity to a pension pot. That is all that it is doing. We have that top slice of liquidity now and it is called the tax-free lump sum. It is already divorced from pensions and payment. You can take it at 50 though you may not take your pension until you are 75. All I am trying to do is to remove the age bar.</p>

<a name="80623-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08062349000013"></a>I accept that that complicates the product and that PADA would therefore not want it now. I accept that without industry support it will not go anywhere, and I accept this may be an appropriate subject to return to in the 2017 review if, as I hope, industry and Governments of any and all persuasions follow this through. But I think that we will have a problem of staying power with auto-enrolment when women hit their first financial crisis and cannot access their savings. This product might help to keep them in when otherwise they would opt out. As for how often, I would not put a limit on the circumstances in which you could access the funds. That would be unnecessarily intrusive, as my noble friend suggested. You might wish to limit the number of times you could access them in order to keep the tracking mechanism simple, but I would not want to prescribe the circumstances.</p>

<a name="80623-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08062349000014"></a>As I say, I think that my noble friend missed the point. He talked about how much we have done for women&#146;s income in terms of the changes in pensions in retirement. That is precisely my point. Women will do  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1283"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1283</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>relatively much better in retirement as a result of all the changes that the Government have made. But we have not helped them fully to address the risks pre-retirement. If we do not, that may damage the very agenda that my noble friend has for post-retirement issues. There is still a failure of mindset to engage in the risks and realities for women which the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, described.</p>

<a name="80623-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08062349000015"></a>This may not be the right solution and I do not expect industry to be enthusiastic. Why would it be? This would be a product sold to very poor women, with poor returns. But if Government come to realise, as they may do, that if women have to choose between current rainy-day savings or money in an emergency and longer-term pensions, most women&#151;and there is plenty of DWP research to support this hypothesis&#151;will cut back on pension saving. They, and we, will be the poorer as a result.</p>

<a name="80623-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08062349000016"></a>I have said enough. I am grateful for noble Lords&#146; contributions to this short debate. I hope that my noble friend will take this away. I would like to see the department beginning to carry out some research on this, possibly on an all-party basis, to see whether there is a market and a need and whether it is structurally viable. Some time down the road&#151;and I take the point about DC schemes, DB schemes and all the rest, so it is a longer-term haul&#151;if they are so minded, when we come to the review in 2017, perhaps such a project could be added to the Bill that will be winding its way through your Lordships&#146; House. Under those circumstances, and again with gratitude for the contributions, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08062349000022"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to the amendments grouped with Amendment No. 56. Qualifying schemes used for automatic enrolment will need to meet minimum standards beyond those set by the existing regulatory framework. This is the case for both workplace personal schemes and occupational schemes. The Bill already provides for certain minimum standards for schemes used under the employer duty; for example, the minimum contributions required for money purchase schemes at Clauses 19 and 25. It also contains powers in Clause 15 to prevent qualifying schemes requiring excessive charges or contributions from active members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08062349000023"></a>We recognise, however, that it may be appropriate to introduce further safeguards specifically for automatically enrolled members.

Amendment No. 56 will give the Secretary of State the flexibility to allow additional qualifying criteria for schemes used for automatic enrolment to be specified in secondary legislation if necessary. This power will be subject to the affirmative procedure to allow both Houses an opportunity to scrutinise any such requirements. Amendment No. 57 is a technical amendment to clarify the language in Clause 16 following Amendment No. 56.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08062349000024"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Thomas and Lady Greengross, are concerned about the level of charges in qualifying schemes. Our current evidence suggests that most occupational schemes have charges that enable individuals to accrue meaningful savings. The Pensions Commission found that charges in DC occupational schemes tend to be under 0.6 per cent, depending on the size of the employer. Similarly, we do not presently have reason to believe that charges to active members in workplace personal pensions are currently excessive. Although there is no comprehensive data, our understanding is that most large WPPs have charges of around 0.4 to 0.8 per cent annual management charge. Charges in group stakeholder pensions are capped at 1.5 per cent annual management charge for the first 10 years, and 1 per cent thereafter.</p>

<a name="80623-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08062349000025"></a>We are commissioning research to help us understand more fully some aspects of the overall pensions market, the products within it and practices. As part of this we are exploring current practices in the WPP market, such as charging and the investment options provided. This research will inform our considerations on the need for additional qualifying criteria and our planned consultation with stakeholders. We will, of course, be seeking both the views of the industry around best practice in areas such as charging and approaches to default investments, and those of consumer representatives about what further safeguards, if any, are needed to ensure that individuals have the right level of protection in these schemes. Given these assurances I ask the noble Lord and the noble Baronesses not to press their amendments. I beg to move.</p>

As the Minister said, the amendment continues the debate about the quality criteria for workplace pension schemes, both money purchase schemes and personal pension schemes. In particular, it is important that workplace pension schemes should be low-cost, have no transfer penalties and have an appropriate choice of funds, including a good default option. The amendment would ensure that total employee and employer contributions in workplace pension schemes, net of all costs and fees, will be at least equal to the level of default contributions in personal accounts. It is worth noting that the Pensions Commission&#146;s second report recommended that auto-enrolment into an employer DC scheme&#151;I think that the Minister alluded to this&#151;should be permitted if,</p>

As we know, the amendments seek to ensure that auto-enrolled pension schemes meet additional quality criteria beyond the 3 per cent. I am pleased that the Minister has brought forward his own amendments on this important issue. Much of what I want to say has been covered in the debate, so I welcome the Government&#146;s recognition that they must take account of the quality of workplace pension schemes if workers are auto-enrolled into them. Now that the European Commission has provided reassurance that auto-enrolment does not break the distance marketing and unfair commercial practices directives, the Bill has already been amended to enable this to happen.</p>

<a name="80623-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08062349000028"></a>Before I turn to the other amendment, perhaps I may briefly say something about levelling down. We have read quite a lot in the media over the past few days that personal accounts could represent a threat to existing pension provision. I do not think that that will be the case. It would be very serious if it were the case. It is certainly an unfortunate and bad message to be promoted. It could mean that employees&#151;the very people we are trying to help to improve their pension provision&#151;lose confidence in personal accounts before they have begun because of negative media coverage.</p>

<a name="80623-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08062349000029"></a>It is suggested that employers will level down their contribution levels to 3 per cent, the minimum required by personal accounts, or, even worse, stop providing pensions for their employees altogether. I am not sure why they would do that as a result of this Bill. I cannot understand that. My view is that the threat of levelling down could be one that we have to face in any event. But the threat is not created by this Bill or personal accounts, because employers can reduce pension benefits. As we know, regrettably, some have done so. It is one of the reasons why my noble friend Lord Turner was asked to chair his review and why he recommended what have become personal accounts. It would be a strange unintended consequence if the very thing that the commission recommended was the cause of declining pension provision. Rather than levelling down, I very much hope that employers will increase pension benefits for all the reasons that we are debating the Bill, such as taking into account rising longevity.</p>

<a name="80623-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08062349000030"></a>Just prior to Second Reading I hosted a briefing session on the Bill on behalf of the People&#146;s Pension Coalition which was attended by all the major stakeholders and many noble Lords, including the Minister. I recall that my noble friend Lord Turner&#151;I send him my congratulations on his new role&#151;arguing that personal accounts were carefully targeted at those who make little or no pension saving or have no access to a good employer scheme. We know that this is the group that  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1286"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1286</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is currently not well served by the pensions industry. I therefore see personal accounts as an add-on to existing provision, not a threat.</p>

<a name="80623-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08062349000031"></a>That is relevant to my other amendment because the threat, if any exists at all, may turn out to be to personal accounts rather than to existing schemes. I assume that auto-enrolment into workplace pension schemes will reduce the number of people who would otherwise have become members of personal accounts. That is a debate for another time, but can the Minister tell me what impact it may have on PADA&#146;s planning assumptions? This matters because auto-enrolment into workplace pensions means that the existing non-occupational contract-based providers are likely to get many new members without much, if any, effort at all&#151;probably at zero marketing cost. I support that, as have all the main stakeholders; they all recognise that this should increase pensions saving.</p>

<a name="80623-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08062349000032"></a>As Members of the Committee will know, the stakeholders wrote to the European Commission to support auto-enrolment and the broad thrust of the Government&#146;s pension settlement following the Turner commission. I have seen a copy of that letter, which said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="08062349000322"></a>&#147;It is important to ensure savers get a fair deal. The legislation currently being discussed by the UK Parliament (the Pensions Bill) gives the UK Government wide powers to establish a quality threshold that can effectively protect consumers. The Government has committed to consult and seek consensus from all the stakeholders, including the Financial Services Authority, about this&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062349000309"></a>The amendments with my name to them were tabled to ensure that this happens and that the other schemes into which consumers may be auto-enrolled are at least as good as personal accounts. We do not want employees enrolled into high-charging schemes with poor investment choice and unfair transfer penalties.</p>

<a name="80623-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08062349000033"></a>The wording of my Amendment No. 80 is carefully chosen. The words are used by the Pensions Commission itself. On page 306 of its second report, it recommended that auto-enrolment into an employer DC scheme should be permitted if,</p>
<ul><a name="08062349000356"></a>&#147;the combined employer and employee contribution exceeds the combined level in the scheme, taking into account the level of charges&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08062349000310"></a>The &#147;scheme&#148; now means &#147;personal accounts&#148;. This was an implicit acknowledgment of the negative impact of charges. Yet the Bill is silent on what additional quality criteria there should be, although I know that the Minister has spoken on that. We do not want to go back to the bad old days of high-charging, poorly performing and ineffectively governed private pensions, especially if workers have not really chosen to join them but have been auto-enrolled.</p>

The Minister has indicated that the Bill will allow the Government to make regulations to set additional quality criteria if that is necessary, as I think it may well be.</p>

In confirming the noble Baroness&#146;s fears over some of the levelling down, the important PricewaterhouseCoopers report, reported in the financial pages of today&#146;s <I>Guardian</I>, is significantly worrying to me. Although colleagues across the Committee are accustomed to the trend of closing defined benefit schemes to new employees, the report clearly demonstrates that 16 per cent of participants have closed their DB schemes to future accrual by existing members and that another 11 per cent expect to do so. That is a worrying degree of change in a short time and I hope that the Government are actively considering it. It supports the argument and adds detail to the important points made by the noble Baroness. I hope that the Government have something to say on that trend, which, if sustained, will be extremely worrying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08062349000036"></a>However, having listened to what the Minister said, I am particularly concerned about the impact of Amendments Nos. 60 and 78 on small&#151;I mean small&#151;enterprises: the kind of businesses that are the mainstay of the economy of my home region of south-east Scotland, in the Borders. If the Government are doing this work&#151;I am glad that they are&#151;can we have some assurance that specific parts of it will address micro-businesses and not just small enterprises in the normal sense of the phrase? The Minister was reassuring in that he said that this work is being done. My worry is that most of his approach addressed much bigger enterprises and companies of a scale that are more realistically able to limit administration costs. I am thinking of family businesses with five or six employees, maybe 12 at most. I hope that, in any work that the department does in investigating these important matters, it has a special section that satisfies itself that the condition applying in those circumstances will be adequately addressed, as well as the conditions for the bigger, more professional schemes with teams of accountants who can more easily deal with these things administratively.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, hopes that levelling down will not occur. We will return to that as we go through our Committee stage. Certainly, some of the evidence that is starting to come from organisations such as the ABI shows that employers are increasingly concerned about how compliance with the personal accounts scheme&#151;we will come to this again, probably later this evening&#151;and how definitions work in the current scheme are pushing them towards levelling down, because it is too much like hard work to comply. We will return to that theme. We cannot regard it as an idle threat. It is a real problem, which we must bear in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08062349000039"></a>I have one comment on the amendments on charges that the Liberal Democrat Benches and the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, have spoken to. When the

A criticism of the report was that charges are just one side of the equation and that the report did not look at returns. If we simply concentrate on whether charges are higher or lower than the eventual level in the personal accounts scheme&#151;we do not know what that is, or whether we will achieve the aspiration of 0.3 per cent&#151;and do not look at returns, we will mislead ourselves. Looking only at the charging levels is a narrow approach to comparability. I accept that charging can have a big impact on net returns if gross returns are equal between investment opportunities, but they are not. I therefore hope that that will be taken into account when those who have tabled these amendments consider what to do with them.</p>

I think that we agree that the level of charges is an important component in making sure that auto-enrolment and personal accounts work. I confirm to the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, that the power that we are taking in our amendment will provide the flexibility to address that issue if our research shows something untoward or difficult in how charging is undertaken in workplace personal pensions. The issue has not reared its head as a problem thus far, but we need to do the research in relation not only to that but also to how default investments work. We need to address that, which is the purpose of the government amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08062349000042"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said that he hoped that we would focus particularly on micro-businesses. The research is focused on industry practice around these products and opportunities, although I take the point that the issue of how industry practice relates to different sizes of business should be covered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08062349000043"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Greengross and Lady Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, referred to levelling down. That is an important issue. Our reforms are designed to complement and not to replace existing employer provision. A number of key measures will help to focus the personal accounts scheme on those without access to existing pension provision and to discourage levelling down. These will include a ban on transfers between existing pension schemes and personal accounts, as well as an annual contribution limit for the personal accounts scheme, which was set at &#163;3,600 in 2005 earnings terms. Employers with existing good schemes will be encouraged to continue offering them via a straightforward qualification test, which we will discuss shortly. New minimum contribution

<a name="80623-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08062349000044"></a>Our research shows that most employers with good schemes support our reforms and that the majority, particularly the larger employers, plan to maintain their schemes at current levels. However, we are not complacent and we need to continue to track employer attitudes and likely reactions to the reforms as we move towards 2012. There is a worldwide decline of DB schemes for reasons that we have discussed on a number of occasions. We have taken care to ensure that qualifying tests for DB schemes are workable. We have also put in place phase-in arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08062349000045"></a>It is too early to say precisely what the charging structure will be for personal accounts and what levels can be achieved. PADA does not yet have the full authority&#151;I hope that it will do as a result of the Bill&#151;to complete its work in designing the scheme to engage with providers of various services. It has launched consultation on how charging might take place, so that is very much work in progress. Personal accounts were predicated on low charges, because over the lifetime of a pension scheme they can make a significant contribution to the end result, as can investment policy. I hope that noble Lords will feel reassured and not press their amendments, because we are taking a power to deal with the issues on which we have focused.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="08062349000326"></a>&#147;However, in the event that this has not occurred when the employer duties commence, <I>subsection (2)</I> enables regulations to be made to modify the contributions required for money purchase schemes that are contracted out ... It will not be possible to increase the minimum contributions required for money purchase schemes, including the scheme established at Clause 58, without amending these sections&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062349000311"></a>Why can this not be done under the procedures in the 2007 Act? There is plenty of time before 2012, when the Government are adamant that personal accounts will roll out.</p>

<a name="80623-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08062349000059"></a>As I understand it from government amendments, a hybrid scheme, no matter where it is owned, can be a qualifying scheme as long as it is managed in the United Kingdom, but if it is both owned and managed overseas, it cannot qualify except in certain circumstances. Government Amendments Nos. 76, 77, 79 and 80 to Clause 25&#151;I except Amendment No. 78 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross&#151;make provision for non-UK-based schemes potentially to qualify if they are properly regulated. My noble friend Lady Noakes will speak about them. What does that mean for schemes that have their being in the European Union or the EEA? I should know the answer to this, but could schemes operating in and under the regulating powers of, for example, France or Germany still qualify? It seems from Clause 17 that they could. However, just because it is an occupational retirement provision within the meaning of the IORP directive does not help me very much. The definition of the IORP directive in Clause 86, while technically correct, is not exactly clear. IORP should be set out in full&#151;&#147;institutions for occupational retirement provision&#148;&#151;and not as an abbreviation, especially as I am told that is so called by practitioners. I hope that these schemes are to be regulated to the standards that we have in the United Kingdom. What, therefore, are the differences, if any, between the IORP regulations and our own Pensions Regulator?</p>

<a name="80623-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08062349000060"></a>Although I have not put down a specific amendment to this effect, I would also like to probe paragraph (c) of Clause 17, which allows the Secretary of State to prescribe a pension scheme that has its main administration in jurisdictions that are not in an EEA state. Will the Minister give me an undertaking that such schemes will not be prescribed unless their regulation is at least as stringent as ours? After all, by definition, they are not covered by the IORP. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08062349000062"></a>Amendments Nos. 59 and 66, spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, would extend the scheme quality provisions to include qualifying money purchase and contracted-out defined benefit pension schemes administered anywhere in the world. It is very much our intention to enable employers who wish to use occupational schemes based outside the UK to do so under the duty, provided they meet the necessary regulatory and quality standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08062349000063"></a>However, while we are confident that all UK schemes fall within the categories of defined contribution, defined benefit or hybrid schemes, we cannot make the same assumption about schemes based elsewhere. It is possible that overseas schemes will have different benefit structures that will not be assessable against the quality requirements we have put in the Bill. Given the potential diversity of occupational pensions arrangements around the world, it is not possible to set out global standards in the Bill. That is why we have taken regulation-making powers, at Clauses 16 and 24, to set out additional regulatory and quality requirements for overseas schemes and to respond should new types of scheme emerge in the future.</p>

<a name="80623-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08062349000064"></a>The noble Lord asked about contracting out. The commitment to abolish contracting out is to be introduced by the end of the next Parliament. In the event this did not happen before the duties came into effect, we need to ensure that contributions in contracted-out money schemes are appropriate. However, there is no intention to change contributions through primary legislation. I may need to come back to that point after reading the record. As regards the point the noble Lord raised on Clause 17 and occupational pension schemes, he is right that an occupational pension scheme is defined under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of that clause. Paragraphs (b) and (c) concern those administered elsewhere than in the EEA and those that come within the IORP directive. Incidentally, as regards the point about drafting and the terminology, we shall wish to consider whether this is appropriately described.</p>

<a name="80623-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08062349000065"></a>I direct the noble Lord to Clause 24, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="08062349000327"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision as to the quality requirement to be satisfied in the case of an occupational pension scheme within section 17(b) or (c)&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062349000312"></a>Therefore, we are dealing with occupational schemes here, not personal pensions. Clause 24 picks up the point about schemes that fall within Clause 17(b) and (c).</p>

<a name="80623-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08062349000066"></a>I should like to reflect on the issue that was raised about contracting out and what that means in terms of contributions and write to the noble Lord as I am not sure that my explanation was particularly coherent. I hope that that enables the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment at this juncture, but if he is not satisfied he can return to it at a later stage.</p>

He said that the commitment given during the passage of the 2007 Bill, now the Pensions Act 2007, concerned the alterations to be made to contracting out by the end of this Parliament. This Parliament probably has another two years to run. As the Government are determined to do this, I can see no good reason why they should not do it in that time, but perhaps the Minister&#146;s letter will answer that point.

<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08062349000075"></a>I apologise in advance for the length of my remarks but this is an important topic. It raises complex issues for which the solutions that my amendments explore are, in turn, not easy. I have tabled these amendments to the quality requirements for money purchase schemes in Clause 19, but the issues apply equally to personal pension schemes in Clause 25. When we return to these issues on Report&#151;I think it is fairly certain that we shall&#151;our amendments will cover Clause 25 as well.</p>

<a name="80623-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08062349000076"></a>There is also the issue of whether the definition of qualifying earnings in Clause 12, which is the definition which drives both Clauses 19 and 25, ought also to be amended because of its impact on defined benefit schemes, and I shall be asking the Minister about that as well.</p>

<a name="80623-0011.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08062349000077"></a>There is a basic question behind these amendments: how much disruption to existing pensions provision are the Government seeking to make and, linked to that, how much levelling down are they prepared to risk? The Committee will be aware that the approach to contributions in this Bill is not in line with pension practice at present. The use of an upper and lower limit, while understandable in the context of the default personal accounts scheme, is not used in private sector money purchase schemes. Typically, they have no such limits or bands. However, the most significant difference is the definition of earnings. The Bill uses a definition which includes commission, bonuses and overtime. Definitions vary in private sector schemes, but the practice now is overwhelmingly to focus on a definition of basic earnings. Sometimes some elements of variable pay are included, but these are increasingly rare.</p>

<a name="80623-0011.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08062349000078"></a>So the problem is that the way private pensions work at present does not fit easily into the Bill's view of qualifying earnings. Because the private sector schemes  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1293"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1293</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>do not have lower or upper thresholds, contributions will generally be calculated on a higher amount than the Bill requires, but there will be exceptions, particularly among lower paid employees with a large element of variable pay such as commission.</p>

<a name="80623-0011.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08062349000079"></a>The problem is exacerbated by the pay reference period which we expect the Government to set in line with the payroll periods used by employers; that is, weekly or monthly. Where an individual has a variable element of pay in one or two pay reference periods, the calculations under the Bill may well produce a spike in required contributions which, in that pay period, and that pay period alone, are higher than the amounts that the employer calculates under his existing pension scheme. Taken over a whole year, the employer's scheme may produce a higher amount of contributions, but it would fail the test set out in Clause 19 because of its focus on the pay reference period.</p>

<a name="80623-0011.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08062349000080"></a>I am sure that noble Lords will have seen the rather complicated calculations that produced that result, and a number of submissions from outside organisations have exemplified the problem. I hope that the Committee will not ask me to make mathematical proof of the issue. There is a consensus among both employer groups and those associated with pension provision that there is a real problem here. My amendments in this group set out a number of ways of tackling the problem, and I shall spend a few minutes of the Committee&#146;s time explaining the amendments and the solutions that they offer.</p>

<a name="80623-0011.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08062349000081"></a>Amendments Nos. 61, 62 and 63 are the ideal solution from the employers&#146; perspective. They allow the quality requirements to be met by reference to the definition of &#147;earnings&#148; as used in the employer&#146;s own scheme. I expect that the Minister&#146;s answer will be along the lines of, &#147;We must not let employers manipulate the definition of earnings in order to evade the obligations that the Bill sets out&#148;. Of course, the vast majority of employers would not even think about doing that. In any event, the compliance regime in Chapter 2 could easily be expanded to cover the case of deliberate manipulation of earnings components to avoid the basic intent of the Bill, if that were the only objection to using the employer&#146;s definitions of earnings.</p>

<a name="80623-0011.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08062349000082"></a>My other definitions are less than ideal but try to preserve the employer&#146;s ability to operate schemes with different definitions on a modified basis. Amendments Nos. 60A, 61A, 61B and 62A propose that an aggregate test be adopted, so that if the employer could satisfy the tests over the whole of its workforce, the quality requirement would be met. In effect, swings and roundabouts between employees would be tolerated. That might well mean that some employees ended up getting less than others in terms of individual contributions allocated to them, but the employer would at least be meeting the overall 3 per cent limit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08062349000083"></a>The Minister cannot accuse employers of cheating with this group of amendments, but he may respond to them, as well as to those for basic earnings, that a definition that resulted in less saving for some jobholders would be unacceptable, and that the implementation of the Bill in terms of producing replacement income in retirement must be tested at the most granular level  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1294"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of each employee. It has been put to me that the Government&#146;s approach is nothing like the usual 80-20, where you try to get 80 per cent of the benefit for 20 per cent of the effort or the cost. It is not even based on getting 99 per cent of the benefit, but it seems to be based on an absolute need to avoid disbenefit to some infinitesimally small fraction of employees overall; at least that is what we understand the Government&#146;s position at the moment to be. I warned on Second Reading about the best being the enemy of the good, and I hope that the Minister is mindful of that when he responds.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08062349000084"></a>Amendments Nos. 64 and 65 attempt other ways of solving the problem. Amendment No. 64 says that the Secretary of State could fix the pay reference period for the purposes of the quality requirement in Clause 19 as a different period, so that the quality requirement for the employer schemes could be tested, say, annually, instead of by reference to the individual pay reference period linked to payroll. That is not the same as the aggregate test, as it would still require the test to be met at the level of the individual employee, but it would be established over a longer period, which would allow employers to get the benefit of not having their schemes ruled out because of the spike effect of particular variable pay in certain pay reference periods. Amendment No. 65 is a last-ditch attempt to preserve existing schemes and says that if, when calculated over a longer period, there is still a shortfall in contributions, the employer can make up the difference within three months.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08062349000085"></a>It is far from clear that employer-based schemes will be preserved if we cannot use employer-specific definitions. The NAPF has pointed out that there are big legal and actuarial costs involved in changing scheme rules to meet the Bill&#146;s definitions and that the monthly calculations will add administrative costs. If employers adopt the Bill&#146;s definitions to replace their own, the DWP will have forced employers onto a path that leads inexorably to levelling down. It will not be surprising if employers decide that if they have to change the definition of earnings, they might just as well change the bands as well and, if they go that far, why not just use the minimum percentages or the personal accounts scheme? Levelling down is a big danger and, whatever the DWP&#146;s surveys from last year show, now that employers are confronting the detail, the NAPF and the ABI are reporting that levelling down is now the most likely path. Currently, employers pay an average of 6 per cent into DC schemes, which is double what the Bill requires; that is what is at stake.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08062349000086"></a>The issue is not just one of the complexity and cost of handling pension contributions on a different basis than current practice, though that is certainly important. We also have to add the cost and complexity that will be caused for the compliance regime, especially for small and medium-sized employers. Employers are concerned that the Government have not appreciated the real burdens that build up under the Bill.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08062349000087"></a>I said at the outset that I would be asking the Minister about the definitions of qualifying earnings and defined benefit schemes. My initial thought was that the issue of qualifying earnings had no relevance  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1295"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1295</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to defined benefit schemes because, unlike DC schemes, the calculation of contributions does not drive benefits, but Clause 22, which sets out the criteria for a DB test scheme, also defines the accrual rate of pensions by reference to qualifying earnings, which is simply not in line with how DB schemes work in practice. Why on earth is the DB test scheme standard phrased in a way that is alien to the workings of DB schemes currently in existence? Are the Government really set on the destruction of the vestiges of private sector DB provision?</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08062349000088"></a>My amendments seek to amend the Bill to give flexibility for both existing and future occupational pension schemes. We on these Benches want employers to own the concept of retirement provision for their employees. There is another route, which is based on protecting existing schemes, but forcing new ones into the Bill&#146;s straitjacket; grandfathering. The Minister expressed concerns at our last Committee day that grandfathering has its own problems for sustainability and complexity over time, but it is another possible route and it should be carefully considered. I hope that the Minister will agree that we need to amend the Bill and that he will have something positive to say in response to my amendments. I beg to move.</p>

I reiterate how grateful I have been for the representations and meetings that we have had with people such as the EEF and the NAPF and providers such as Norwich Union, Scottish Widows and Standard Life. They make a fair point. I quote the Norwich Union, saying that accepting fluctuating contributions, including bonuses and overtime,</p>
<ul><a name="08062349000357"></a>&#147;is not standard industry practice and would therefore increase the costs of running pension schemes by tens of millions of pounds, reduce returns for savers and add complexity to employers&#146; decision making and administration&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08062349000313"></a>The response that we heard at the end of the previous Committee day did not encourage me that the Government were thinking hard enough about how they could deal with these points and ensure that unnecessary costs were not imposed on good quality existing schemes.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08062349000090"></a>I do not share the rather extreme concern of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, who asked whether the Government were set on the destruction of the remaining vestiges of defined benefit pension schemes. That is rather alarmist, and if the Government are having that effect it is by not really thinking things through properly. I do not think that it is deliberate. This is a genuinely difficult problem on which we all need to work together to find a solution. Again, I stress that I thought the People&#146;s Pensions Coalition had some good points when it was concerned to maximise the effective employer contribution in schemes, particularly for lower earning employees who are obviously most at risk. If they do not build up their pension enough, they will fall into the means-test trap.</p>

Like the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, I do not want to repeat the comments I made briefly at the end of the previous Committee day. Clearly, there are concerns about investment behaviour, burdens on industry and trying to establish what the appropriate contribution rate would be on short-term payments of earnings when overtime in the retail trade, for example, might fluctuate each week by two or three hours, requiring adjustments to be made.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08062349000093"></a>I do not have a solution, but I understand that the industry and the Government are seeking ways though it. They may need more time. The noble Baroness seemed to suggest that she would come back on Report, which is likely to be in October, and that discussions would take place over the summer. My noble friend should be in no doubt that concern is widespread and that the Government will have to address these issues.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08062349000094"></a>Amendments Nos. 63 or 64, which will allow annual terms of reference so that calculations can be done just once during the year, may be the very least that the Government should be moving towards. We all want to ensure that an individual ends up in the best-buy outcome. We all want to build in checks against perverse behaviour by employers, which can perhaps be seen by regulation by the TPF. We also want to ensure that there are no other hassle inducements for employers to desert their existing schemes. Clearly the advantage is both higher rates of contribution and not having that first &#163;5,000 basic excluded because of the problems of calculating weekly or monthly contributions that both employer and employee have to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08062349000097"></a>I have been made aware of the research on this issue, which shows that the cost of levelling down in the insurance-based pensions market alone could witness a fall in annual contributions of &#163;900 million.

<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="08062349000099"></a><a name="80623-0012.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80623-0012.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08062349000394"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have spoken on this issue, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, for the manner in which she moved the amendment. I fully understand that this is airing issues with a view to getting the right outcome.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08062349000100"></a>Clause 19 confirms that contributions into qualifying occupational money purchase schemes need to be at least 8 per cent on a band of earnings. The minimum contribution is based on the Pension Commission&#146;s recommendations that an overall contribution of 8 per cent of qualifying earnings could set a median earner with solid state entitlement on course to achieve an income in retirement of around 45 per cent.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08062349000101"></a>Amendment No. 60A would alter the basis of this contribution-based test by enabling the scheme to require an average employer contribution of 3 per cent of qualifying earnings. Amendment No. 61B has a similar effect. It would enable a scheme to require an average total contribution of 8 per cent of qualifying earnings. We understand that some of our stakeholders perceive the quality requirements for money purchase schemes to be complex because most existing schemes use basic pay as the definition of pensionable pay rather than qualifying earnings.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08062349000102"></a>However, the amendments tabled do not simplify the quality test. If anything, they potentially complicate it. Employers and schemes would still be required to track the aggregate qualifying earnings for all jobholders to ensure that the correct contribution was deducted in each pay period. Furthermore, if there were a shortfall, it would be unclear to which members a top-up payment was owed. That could lead to greater complexity. What is more, these amendments would expose some jobholders to the risk of consistently saving well below the minimum proposed by the Pensions Commission. The noble Baroness acknowledged that.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08062349000103"></a>We are listening to stakeholders and understand their concerns about the application of the test. We will work with them to explore practical ways to make the test as workable as possible without undermining the minimum level of saving required by the reform. If we are serious about addressing undersaving this must remain sacrosanct.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08062349000104"></a>Amendment No. 61A would ensure that no more than 10 per cent of members receive a contribution below 3 per cent of qualifying earnings. Amendment No. 62A similarly requires that no more than 10 per cent of members receive less than the total contribution of 8 per cent required under the test. Taken alone, these amendments change the basis of the quality test in Clause 19. The test ensures that each individual in the scheme receives at least the default contribution required under the employer duty. A 10 per cent tolerance would mean that certain jobholders would not&#151;or may not&#151;be saving at the minimum level  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1298"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>required under the reforms. This could make all the difference, for those at the margins who receive only the default minimum contribution, as they might not be able to save to achieve the income in retirement that these reforms aim to provide.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08062349000105"></a>Taken together, Amendments Nos. 60A, 61A, 61B, and 62A have a different impact. They would ensure that under a scheme-average test no more than 10 per cent of members could fall below the minimum level. While this would provide some protection against significant inequalities between members, it would nevertheless leave vulnerable members exposed to the risks of undersaving I have just outlined.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08062349000106"></a>As I explained during the debate on Clause 12, the definition of qualifying earnings is a core element of the Pension Commission&#146;s proposition to set a median earner with solid state entitlement on course to achieve an income in retirement of around 45 per cent. Any measure that undermined this would put the outcome of the entire reform at risk. Amendments Nos. 61, 62 and 63 together could do exactly that by enabling employers and trustees to define earnings within their scheme rules.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08062349000107"></a>We recognise that many employers already provide generous contributions on basic earnings and would be likely continue to do so in good faith. However, these amendments would leave members vulnerable to changes in pay structures occurring for perfectly legitimate business reasons, which could reduce the value of the contribution below the level proposed by the Pensions Commission. Even if such an amendment were limited to apply to existing schemes only, under grandfathering arrangements, there would always be a risk that future changes to the scheme or the employer&#146;s pay structures would reduce the value of the contributions. We cannot legislate to leave people vulnerable to saving below the minimum in this way. Not only would it put the outcome of reform in jeopardy, but by permitting the minimum standard for contributions to vary across employers, it could also potentially lead to discrimination against vulnerable groups.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08062349000108"></a>Amendments Nos. 64 and 65 operate in a different way. Taken together, they could provide for an easement to the application of the quality test for occupational schemes. Amendment No. 64 permits a pay period of, for example, 12 months to be set for the purposes of the quality standard. That would mean that a scheme could be assessed over a longer period to allow some smoothing of contributions where they might otherwise fluctuate above and below the minimum level, the spike to which the noble Baroness referred. Amendment No. 65 relaxes the requirement that scheme rules provide for 8 per cent of qualifying earnings over the pay reference period provided the employer makes up any shortfall in contributions himself so that the 8 per cent is met.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08062349000109"></a>We have been engaging with stakeholders on this issue and understand their concerns about the application of the test for existing schemes. We remain of the view that the quality standards laid out in the Bill will work for the majority of schemes on most occasions without the need for scheme rule changes. We expect that payroll software will support employers in monitoring that this is the case. Where it is clear that a scheme will

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08062349000110"></a>Amendments Nos. 64 and 65 do not fully address the issues stakeholders have raised. They would not apply evenly across occupational and personal pension schemes. Furthermore, Amendment No. 64 is already achievable by virtue of the powers in Clauses 14 and 116, which enable us to set a longer pay period for the purposes of assessing money purchase schemes. Amendment No. 65 raises additional questions about how compliance against the employer&#146;s duty to make shortfall payments would be monitored and enforced because it could cause confusion about whether the scheme itself fell below the qualifying standards or whether it was a matter of a failed payment by the employer.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08062349000111"></a>We recognise that employers and schemes still have concerns and that these amendments represent genuine attempts to address them. We are keen to minimise any disruption to current arrangements, which is why the qualifying test must be designed in the simplest way. As noble Lords know, the Government are determined to ensure that all savers receive at least the new minimum level of pension contributions. For this reason, we have not been persuaded that grandfathering is the right answer.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08062349000112"></a>We do not want to disrupt the smooth administration of existing arrangements that offer good pension outcomes for many savers. Therefore, if it were possible to perform the test in a way that reduced employer administration, perhaps by enabling the use of a range of assessment periods, that is something we would seriously want to consider, provided that it also preserved the new minimum level of pension saving.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08062349000113"></a>The noble Baroness asked specific questions in moving the amendment. She asked how much disruption we want. We want minimum disruption to existing schemes. These proposals are designed to achieve that and to do all we can to prevent it. We are mindful of the risks of that, which is why we need to address the issues that she identified.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08062349000114"></a>In all of this, we should be mindful that personal accounts would be a money purchase occupational scheme and the qualifying test will apply. If the qualifying test were to be changed to enable minimum contributions on aggregate earnings where only 10 per cent of individuals could fall below the minimum, that could seriously affect the scheme. First, as drafted, the minimum contributions into personal accounts would be considered across the membership as a whole. Given that the scheme is expected to be used by many thousands of employers, it would be complex to do that, and it would raise problems in identifying where an employer had failed to make sufficient contributions. Secondly, we estimate that 4 to 7 million people will be saving in personal accounts under the reform, and a system that would permit up to 10 per cent of those people to be saving at very low levels below the minimum would expose up to 700,000 people to the risk of undersaving in personal accounts alone.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08062349000115"></a>The noble Baroness also asked about defined benefits schemes and qualifying earnings. Employers with a contracting-out certificate have met the scheme standard

Employers will need to look at a jobholder&#146;s qualifying earnings in assessing the scheme against the test scheme standard. However, given the generosity of existing DB schemes, we expect the vast majority to meet the standards. What is more, we expect that the test will be conducted on a one-off basis for DB schemes and will be reviewed as an exception when circumstances change.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08062349000116"></a>We acknowledge the challenges in making sure we get the right answer to all this. I think the noble Baroness will acknowledge that the specific proposals put forward do not do that, although I do not think there was an expectation that they would be received in those terms. We are determined to work with stakeholders to make sure that we can get through this. There are ways that we might do it. We have some time before we get to Report. On that basis, I hope the noble Baroness will not press her amendment. We acknowledge there is more work to do on this to see whether we can reach a proper outcome. We are aware of concerns in the industry. I am sure there is a way through this.</p>

First, are the Government insistent that the new scheme must be satisfied for every employee in the land who comes within its scope? Are they unwilling to accept any form of averaging? Throughout the Bill, I have constantly said that the best is the enemy of the good. We are talking about getting millions of people into pension saving. Is it not good enough to have 99.5 per cent meeting the standard? I keep hearing from the Minister that we have to do this at the level of every single employee.</p>

<a name="80623-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08062349000118"></a>Secondly, in relation to the possibility that employers might manipulate their earning patterns or their pay structures in order to get some apparent advantage from the rules, does the Minister not accept that the compliance regime could be amended to work perfectly well to deal with that? The compliance regime could underpin, just as it will be able to deal with employers who induce their employees to opt out and things like that. It would be relatively easy to define a test that could be used by the Pensions Regulator in cases of employer actions or omissions for some deliberate purpose. I should be grateful if the Minister could answer those questions.</p>

On the first question, that is done on a collective basis for defined benefit schemes, not on an individual basis. For money purchase schemes and defined contributions schemes, it has to be on an individual basis. We need to be clear that we are not asking for existing schemes to replicate the earnings band. What matters is that the amount that goes into the scheme at least equals what would go into the scheme if the 8 per cent of the band on the definition of earnings that is adopted were applied. We are not asking for that to be adopted in every scheme, simply that the contribution that goes into the scheme under the existing scheme&#146;s rules produces at least that outcome.

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08062349000120"></a>In relation to manipulation of earnings, I entirely accept that most employers would act honourably in this and seek to do the right thing. Indeed, they would see the benefit of good quality pension provision. However, to rely on the compliance regime to avoid avoidance in this area would be quite difficult because one can envisage circumstances where an employer might quite legitimately restructure the pay structure and have a range of choices. One way of doing it might have the benefit of reduced contributions under these arrangements. There might be a perfectly possible commercial&#151;</p>

The noble Baroness was advancing the proposition that, if people manipulated their pay structures to reduce their contributions, the compliance regime would pick that up. However, it would be difficult to rely on the compliance regime to distinguish those situations from situations where there was a genuine commercial reason to restructure pay or a dual reason to restructure pay. That is why we do not see that as a route forward. It is a similar situation with grandfathering arrangements. You might identify up-front schemes that were okay, but there might be legitimate commercial reasons for restructuring pay down the line. I stress that I believe that there is a way through this, using mechanisms other than those that the noble Baroness has identified. We need to make sure that we achieve that.</p>

I made it clear when I moved the amendments that I was not proposing to divide the Committee this evening, because the issue is too important for it not to be clear that we have got the right answer. I hope that the Minister, if he was in any doubt, is now fully apprised of the fact that there is a problem and that the problem needs a solution.

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08062349000135"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the People&#146;s Mujaheddin Organisation of Iran&#151;the PMOI, as it is more generally known&#151;is opposed to the Iranian Government. Its stated aim is to replace that regime with a secular democracy. Most of its members are based at Camp Ashraf, which is located in Iraq, and under Saddam&#146;s regime it operated as a de facto wing of the Iraqi military. Although it currently describes itself as a non-violent democratic movement, there can be no doubt that the PMOI was responsible for acts of terrorism over a long period, stretching back some two decades prior to 2001. These acts were not attributed to it by the Iranian authorities: the PMOI expressly admitted responsibility for a number of horrendous crimes carried out against the Iranian people, both civilian and military targets. The PMOI is not widely supported in Iran because of those attacks and because it fought alongside Iraqi forces against Iran in the war between those countries.</p>

<a name="80623-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08062349000136"></a>The PMOI says that it decided at an internal meeting in 2001 to renounce violence and that it now seeks instead to pursue its objectives by peaceful means. It has not conducted any attacks since then, although it has not made any public statement renouncing violence. Until 2003, it maintained an extensive arsenal at Camp Ashraf, at which point it found itself surrounded by US forces and surrendered its arms.</p>

<a name="80623-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08062349000137"></a>The PMOI was added to the list of proscribed terrorist organisations in 2001. Proscription is a tough but necessary power, and its effect is that the proscribed organisation is outlawed and is unable to operate in the United Kingdom. The consequence of proscription is that specific criminal offences apply in relation to a proscribed organisation. They include membership of  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1303"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1303</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the organisation and the provision of various forms of support, including organising or addressing a meeting and wearing or displaying an article indicating membership of the organisation. Further criminal offences exist in relation to fund raising and various uses of money and property for the purposes of terrorism.</p>

<a name="80623-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08062349000138"></a>A group of 35 interested parties, comprising noble Lords and honourable Members of another place, disagreed with the PMOI&#146;s proscription. A statutory procedure exists for any proscribed organisation or anyone affected by the proscription of an organisation to apply to the Home Secretary for that organisation to be deproscribed. Members of this group correctly followed this procedure and wrote to the Home Secretary to request that the PMOI be deproscribed. They argued that the PMOI was no longer concerned in terrorism, having renounced violence and disarmed itself, and that their desire to express their legitimate support for the PMOI and its objectives was unlawfully curtailed by its continuing proscription. The then Home Secretary carefully considered this application but continued to believe that the PMOI was concerned in terrorism, which is the statutory test for proscription. He formed that view in the light of the PMOI&#146;s lengthy history of violence, in the absence of any public renunciation of violence and taking into account the fact that it only disarmed two years after the decision to renounce violence, when it had no choice in the face of the overwhelming force of the US military.</p>

<a name="80623-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08062349000139"></a>While accepting that there had been no attacks since 2001, the then Home Secretary took a cautious approach and was not satisfied that the renunciation of violence was more than a temporary cessation for pragmatic reasons or that the 2003 disarmament would have taken place were it not for the war in Iraq and the artificially restrictive circumstances arising from that. He was concerned that the PMOI might return to terrorism in future as a means of achieving its objectives, if the situation in Iraq were to make it possible and if it became strategically advantageous for it to do so.</p>

<a name="80623-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08062349000140"></a>Let me make it clear that this decision was not taken lightly. The Government share the desire of those 35 honourable Members and noble Lords to see the advance of democracy and the promotion of human rights around the world. Given the wide-ranging impact of proscription, we are committed to ensuring that proscription decisions are lawful and proportionate. However, the Terrorism Act 2000 sets out the definition of terrorism and the criteria for considering whether an organisation is concerned in terrorism. The Act does not refer to the motivation or political agenda of those who perpetrate acts of terrorism and, as POAC accepted, the Secretary of State is entitled to conclude that there is no right to resort to terrorism, whatever the motivation. We do not condone terrorism anywhere, whatever its justification or its target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08062349000141"></a>The Home Secretary&#146;s refusal to deproscribe was appealed to POAC, the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission, which upheld the appeal and found that the PMOI was no longer an organisation concerned in terrorism. POAC directed that the Government lay an order before the House deproscribing the PMOI. Although POAC considered that the Government were wrong to refuse to deproscribe the PMOI in 2006, it

It also stated that the Government were entitled to give little credibility to public statements made by the PMOI, as their public statements contained spin and the evidence submitted in the course of the hearing was &#147;contradictory and potentially misleading&#148; and demonstrated &#147;a shifting approach&#148;.</p>

Simply, there is no basis in fact for the conclusions that the article draws or for the headline, and we refute any of the suggestions in the article.

By deproscribing the PMOI from the terror list, which in all conscience it should never have been on in the first place, this country sends this strong message to the mullahs and despotic rulers in Iran; &#147;You must immediately cease your despicable actions against your own people and your meddling in Iraq or face the consequences of your actions in the future&#148;. Those actions are why I have spoken in support of this organisation for a number of years now.</p>

However, worse&#151;so much worse&#151;has been happening in Iran and has been well documented by independent journalists and those who have escaped the regime. Women are denied equal rights with men in marriage, divorce, child custody and inheritance. If a woman goes to court, her evidence is considered to be worth only half that given by a man. A girl under 13 can be forced to marry a much older man if her father permits it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08062349000150"></a>Women can be stoned for allegedly committing adultery, and that stoning is to be done in a very special way. A woman is buried up to her shoulders. She cannot escape. Interestingly, if a man is being punished by stoning, he is buried only up to his waist, and if he can wriggle free he is spared the stoning. No such luck for a woman. Rules govern the size of the stones that can be used as well. They must not be so small that they do not hurt, but nor must they be too large to be able to kill outright. The execution is public and children may be brought along to watch their mother&#146;s stoning. What kind of people are these?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08062349000151"></a>At last there is hope for the poor people of Iran, who have had so much to endure. The National Council of Resistance of Iran&#151;the campaigning arm of the PMOI&#151;is led by a charismatic woman, Mrs Maryam Rajavi, who insists that there must not be war with Iran, but nor must the mullahs be appeased. She calls for support for the Iranian people in their resistance, and is determined to bring about full democratic change in her country. We can only applaud her for this and tell her that the eyes of the world will be on her and her supporters when that day comes. We should offer our help and support to end, by severe sanctions, the regime that is clinging on to power now.</p>

The very strong judgments of the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission, the Court of Appeal and indeed the European Court of First Instance made it utterly plain that justice required the PMOI to be taken off the list. There can be no doubt about that.</p>

<a name="80623-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08062349000154"></a>Secondly, it is of great importance that if, as I trust, this order proposed by the Minister is approved tonight both by your Lordships and by the other place, it will do a great deal to establish and underline the concept of the rule of law. To have two such excellent judgments in this country by eminent judges so clearly stated and not to approve them would be the most dreadful attack on the concept of the rule of law. I am very glad that the Minister was able to come and do this tonight. I strongly endorse his proposal that this order should be made. I would like to thank him for the clarification in his newspaper article this morning which, to me at any rate, came as a bit of a surprise. The Minister has done a great deal to take away my surprise. Therefore, I support this order.</p>

The tests here, in front of both courts, is whether the PMOI is presently&#151;not in the past, distant or near&#151;concerned in terrorism or preparing to be concerned in it. The Government&#146;s argument at both the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission and the Court of Appeal can be summed up this way: once a terrorist, always a terrorist. This is a nonsense. Both courts, after considering all of the evidence, open and closed for security reasons, rejected that argument and found no evidence to support assertions that the PMOI was concerned in, or preparing to be concerned in, terrorism. This order rights a great wrong done to the 4,000 members of the PMOI, part of Iran&#146;s resistance coalition. They sit in exile in the deserts of Iraq because the theocratic regime in Tehran has stolen their freedom and slaughtered around 120,000&#151;yes, that is right&#151;of their friends and supporters.</p>

<a name="80623-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08062349000156"></a>Why was this ban put in place? The then Home Secretary said it was because the mullahs insisted upon it as the price of opening talks with the EU on its nuclear weapons development programme. Ludicrously, in making the ban, the Government said that the PMOI had no presence in the UK and no record of harming British or western interests anywhere in the world. Who are the terrorists? It is not the PMOI which makes and supplies the roadside bombs which slaughter British and coalition troops in Iraq and Afghanistan; that is done by the mullahs' private army, The Revolutionary Guard, itself labelled as a terrorist organisation by the United States.</p>

<a name="80623-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08062349000157"></a>This resistance revealed two weeks ago that an estimated eight out of every 10 of the roadside bombs slaughtering our British troops come from Iran, smuggled across the border on 51 networks. Details of these networks and those who run them have been given by the resistance to the coalition forces and to our own Ministry of Defence. It is not the PMOI which is seeking to build nuclear weapons; it was the resistance

<a name="80623-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08062349000158"></a>It is hard to understand why the Government refused our request to deproscribe the PMOI. When challenged by 35 Members of your Lordships&#146; House and those in another place, the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission ruled that that refusal was,</p>
<ul><a name="08062349000359"></a>&#147;perverse ... flawed and must be set aside&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08062349000315"></a>Scathingly, it added that it was,</p>
<ul><a name="08062349000360"></a>&#147;in the (perhaps unusual) position of having before it all of the material that is relevant to this decision. In our view, that is a requirement of the 2000 Act&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80623-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08062349000159"></a>In plain English, what the POAC decided was that the Government had got the law wrong, ignored the evidence and asked the wrong questions, which led them to come to this perverse and flawed decision. When the Government appealed to the Court of Appeal, they had their nose rubbed once more in the evidence they had ignored, when the Court of Appeal said,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="08062349000329"></a>&#147;Closed material was also available to the applicant"&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062349000316"></a>that is, to the Government&#151;</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="08062349000330"></a>&#147;We have considered that material. It has reinforced our conclusion that the applicant could not reasonably have formed the view ... that PMOI intended in future to revert to terrorism&#148;. </p>
</ul>
<a name="80623-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08062349000160"></a>That is a damning indictment of the way the Government have handled this matter. The Government now have a duty to ask the EU to remove the ban on the PMOI imposed at their request and I want to ask the Minister to tell me tonight how and when and how soon this will be done.</p>

<a name="80623-0013.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08062349000161"></a>The order will give new hope to those millions inside Iran who cry freedom and want to see their country a respected member of the international community, rather than a pariah&#151;a country which respects human rights, not least the rights of women, and ends its nuclear weapons development and its murderous interference in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Gaza and elsewhere. Iran will be free. Freedom may be delayed but it cannot for ever be denied.</p>

However, there is little point my repeating it now that it has been given to your Lordships, so I shall briefly touch on another matter. Tonight may be a time less for recrimination and more for thanks to all those who have brought us to the position in which we are today. I would like us all to record our thanks to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn of Hadley. To have such a distinguished lawyer on our side was an enormous bonus, and what he had to say obviously carried enormous weight. The noble Lord, Lord Corbett, should be thanked by all of us for his magnificent leadership as chairman of our committee. Then there were those who represented us in court&#151;they did a marvellous job&#151;and the members of the NCRI in London, who had campaigned tirelessly for years to achieve this result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08062349000163"></a>One thing is left to be done. It is now surely up to the Government to see that the EU listing, which was based on the then Home Secretary&#146;s original order to proscribe, is also brought to an end. On 12 June the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said at col. 670 that as the British listing alone underpinned the EU listing it was likely to be reviewed. That is simply not good enough. When a decision no longer has any legal basis&#151;the decision in Europe does not any more, because the legal basis was proscription in this country&#151;it should be reversed forthwith, not reviewed. It is the Government&#146;s job and duty to see that that reversal takes place.</p>

I feel proud that, across the Benches in this House, all parties have pulled together in support of justice.</p>

I am grateful that my noble friend intervened as one who can judge the matter a little more objectively than some of us, because he has not been involved in all the debates.</p>

<a name="80623-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="08062349000166"></a>This may be technically a debate, but there is really no question for the House to decide. The Government have brought the order before us because they had no alternative; Section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2000 said that they must. Had the Government listened to some of us before the unseemly saga began, the Secretary of State could have come before us tonight with a good grace and claimed the credit. My noble friend on the Front Bench would not have had the task of making the speech that he did; if I may say so, it was hardly a gracious retraction on the part of the Government.</p>

<a name="80623-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08062349000167"></a>The Government have suffered a humiliating defeat in the courts. Their attitude has been labelled as perverse. The unhappy story is not yet over, as, already, two noble Lords have pointed out. The PMOI is the subject of a decision by the Council of the European Union to include it in the European list of terrorist organisations, so that its assets in the EU territories are frozen and so that Europe sends out a signal that the PMOI is perceived as a terrorist organisation. It is no secret that that was done at the instance of the United Kingdom Government, as my noble friend has said. A ruling by the EU Court of First Instance that it is wrongly included has been evaded by what can be described only as a shameful piece of sophistry.</p>

<a name="80623-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08062349000168"></a>I believe that the conclusions reached by all three of the distinguished courts will be vindicated by the verdict of history. It is perverse that those who so courageously opposed a regime, which is the very centre and source of a web of terrorism and has been condemned by United Nations&#146; human rights bodies

<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08062349000169"></a>It is not too late to rectify the injustice or to congratulate the PMOI and the National Council of Resistance on their complete vindication. This is not the end of the ordeal suffered by the Iranian people at the hands of the mullahs, but I believe that it is the beginning of the end and that the people of Iran may look forward at no great distance to the dawn of a new freedom and the restoration of their country to its rightful place in the international community.</p>

I also have an interest as one of the 35 people who made the application to POAC. Today, we are able to say that a long chapter of shame by the British Government is ending. It has sullied the reputation of our nation, my political party and those who, in their positions of influence, have given sustenance and the appearance of respectability to the murderous and inhumane regime that rules Iran and subjects its citizens to barbaric treatment.</p>

<a name="80623-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08062349000171"></a>As we welcome the late arrival of this long overdue removal of the NCRI and the PMOI from the proscribed list of terrorist organisations, we should stop and consider just what these wicked people have done. Children have been executed. My thoughts tonight are with the young, mentally handicapped, 16 year-old girl who had the audacity to question the judge at her trial by saying, &#147;You should be trying the man who attempted to rape me, and did rape me, rather than put me on trial for adulterous behaviour&#148;. What was her punishment? It was summary execution. She was taken out and hung publicly. My thoughts are with the memory of that young girl and her family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08062349000172"></a>Mention has just been made of United Nations resolutions. The mullahs&#146; regime has cocked a snook at the United Nations time and time again. It cares little about the world&#146;s opinion of its barbaric behaviour. No one in this nation should ignore the rantings of the mullahs. As my noble friend Lord Corbett said, they will continue their evil activities until they are removed from power once and for all. Such a removal will be achieved only when the people of Iran are able to enjoy free and fair elections, unencumbered by the interference of the theocratic guilty men. My thoughts then will be that if the Iranian people get free elections, the brave and courageous Madam Rajavi will take her place on a ballot form. She will subject herself to the democratic process. By her example over these past years, I have no doubt that the people will respond in the way that they should.</p>

I also want to provide a bit of history because, when the order was put before the House, and included the PMOI, I and others from this House and the other place, went to see Mr Straw. I reminded Mr Straw that, as a member of the Labour Party and as a chairman, I encouraged people at the conference to welcome Madame  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1310"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1310</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Rajavi and people from the resistance. To a person, they rose and applauded this brave lady and the people around her. Do you know what the response was? The response was, &#147;Tony, we are in Government now&#148;. I find that on the offensive side because principles cannot start and finish when elections are taking place. If it was good enough to give support to oppressed people in opposition, we should have the courage to give them support now we are in power and to do something about it.</p>

<a name="80623-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="08062349000174"></a>Mr Straw made a statement on BBC television. The world saw a British Minister saying to the world that it is on the list because the mullahs asked him to put it on the list. Can noble Lords think of anything that is more offensive in a democracy? A seemingly laughing face was seen on our televisions as the same Mr Straw rubbed shoulders with the mullahs. Time is short and many noble Lords will share my joy at the end of this  period.</p>

<a name="80623-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08062349000175"></a>My message to the Government, critical as I am, is a genuine plea. Do not appease despicable people just because of the oil that lies beneath the ground in Iran. Think of the threat to the democratic state of Israel that comes out of the mouth of President Ahmadinejad, who wants to drive the Israeli people into the sea. I ask the Government to show the world that this country is rightly concerned about the export of terrorism from Iran. Bullets and bombs from Iran are killing and maiming brave coalition forces, not just in Iraq but also in other countries. Our former prime minister, Tony Blair, also told the world that Iran was the greatest exporter of terrorism in the world. We should all be concerned about the nuclear ambitions of these despots. I plead with the British Government to speak out against the atrocities and let all of us hold our heads high as we work not just here but within the European Parliament.</p>

<a name="80623-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08062349000176"></a>Quite recently in Brussels, talking to other people from other nations, it was clear that the lead given by the British Government, which has now been proved to have been unlawful, motivated other countries to put the PMOI on the European list. The Government should work now to redeem themselves. They can do a penance by saying to our friends in Europe &#147;We got in wrong&#148;. Have the courage to say this. Some of those countries can be forgiven for taking an example from this country with its long tradition of democracy. Let us once and for all rid ourselves of the shame of our Government who have used every legal advice to assist the wicked and evil rulers who reside in Teheran.</p>

I never believed it was a terrorist organisation&#151;on the contrary.

It has the same sort of agenda as a political organisation and I emphasise that it is a political organisation that seeks change by

It really is disgraceful that the Government were able to persuade the EU to adopt the line it did&#151;they should not have done so. We can now go forward and I hope that we can work in future with this group of people to ensure that eventually the people of Iran achieve the democratic state that they deserve.</p>

It has to be approached with caution and thought. Although noble Lords clearly disagree with the position advanced by the Government in proscribing the PMOI at the outset, it was a position honestly adopted. I refute the suggestion that it was to appease the Iranian regime. The Government&#146;s record in advocating support of a democracy in Iran, expressing their concern about the treatment of juveniles within the justice system there and arguing the human rights case is very strong, which colleagues should recognise. That is not to say that I do not understand the very powerful views that have been expressed in the House this evening and the intention behind them, because I do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08062349000182"></a>We have now moved to deproscription; we have moved in good time and in good order. We have complied exactly with the POAC ruling, and we will proceed, as we always do in these matters, quite properly. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, said that he acknowledged and supported our approach. He is right to make the case for the rule of law.

My noble friend Lord Corbett, the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, and my noble and learned friend Lord Archer have pressed me for details of when it is expected that Council of Europe Ministers will consider these matters. We have already advised them of the POAC decision and said that we intend deproscribing the PMOI. Because we were the national competent authority making the decision, the PMOI was listed under common position 931. The fact that that decision has now

It is now for the Council to consider what action it needs to take in the light of the deproscription. It would be wrong of me to say that deproscription will be automatic but the fact that we were the national competent authority which originally made the decision will be weighing on Council Ministers when they reach their decision. It would be strange if they did not follow our lead. They will need to be advised again and reminded that we have now deproscribed and that that order is in effect. </p>

Its procedures and proceedings are for Council Ministers, but they have been fully advised and kept up to date. They know exactly what the position is within the United Kingdom, as the competent authority. It will be up to them to make their decision based on actions that we have taken.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="08062349000331"></a> Clause 21, page 9, line 45, leave out subsection (3)</p>
</ul>
<a name="80623-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08062349000193"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is to find out a little more about how a complicated part of this Bill will work. Rather like the previous amendment tabled by my noble friend Lady Noakes, subsection (3) of Clause 21 allows for a scheme to qualify for auto-enrolment even though some of its members may not meet the test scheme standard as laid out in Clause 22. That allows for a great deal of, in this case, helpful flexibility. Defined benefit schemes are becoming ever rarer and, without that flexibility, the Bill would be another nail in their coffin.</p>

<a name="80623-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="08062349000194"></a>However, this clause will help to keep these schemes open only if that flexibility is properly understood by employers and is clearly and consistently applied by the Government. Can the Minister give us a clearer idea of the Government&#146;s intentions? How many members must fail to meet the test scheme standard before the scheme fails? How bad must the shortfall be before it is considered over the top?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="08062349000195"></a>The Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in another place made an accurate point:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08062349000317"></a>However, this argument failed to convince the Government that some flexibility should be applied in the clauses relating to the money purchase schemes that we have just discussed. I seek more clarification on all this. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="08062349000196"></a><a name="80623-0014.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80623-0014.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08062349000414"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> I thank the noble Lord for his amendment, which I understand is a probing one. Clause 21 sets out the quality requirements for defined benefit schemes with members in employment that is not contracted out of the state second pension scheme&#151;commonly known as non-contracted-out schemes. This test operates in a similar way to the reference scheme test, which is an existing test of overall scheme quality for schemes with members whose employment is contracted out of the state second pension scheme.</p>

<a name="80623-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="08062349000197"></a>We recognise that many employers make generous pension provision through their defined benefit schemes and we want to encourage them to retain these schemes. That is why, when developing the quality test for non-contracted-out DB schemes, as well as ensuring that they deliver the additional private pension saving required under the reforms, we sought to minimise any burdens on business by introducing a simple scheme-wide test. Amendment No. 67 would prevent the test scheme standard from being a scheme-wide assessment. I know that that is not the intention but the amendment could make the application more complex and increase the burdens on business. Undertaking an assessment of the projected benefits for each member of a DB scheme would be more time-consuming and complex for employers.</p>

<a name="80623-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="08062349000198"></a>Amendment No. 68 would remove an important power in Clause 21 allowing the Secretary of State to make secondary legislation relating to the test. Without the regulation-making power in Clause 21(4), the Government&#146;s ability to set the criteria for determining whether the pensions provided by a scheme were equivalent to, or better than, those provided by the test scheme would be severely curtailed. We would also effectively lose the power to specify the detailed application of the test scheme standard in technical guidance, as our ability to issue guidance is, by virtue of subsection (5), dependent on the ability to make regulations. This guidance will be particularly important where actuarial comparisons are being made.</p>

<a name="80623-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="08062349000199"></a>The power in subsection (4) is there to enable us to provide employers with the right assistance. Without it, employers, possibly with advice from their actuary, would have to determine how the test scheme would operate in order to assess whether their own scheme met the standard. The test would no longer be standardised across schemes, because employers and/or their advisers might have to rely on their discretion in making an assessment in relation to their scheme. This is something that they might not feel comfortable

We will use the regulation-making power as necessary to prescribe the method of determining whether the test scheme standard has been met, which will ensure that it targets the additional pension saving required under the reforms and is a relevant and effective measure of scheme quality.</p>

<a name="80623-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08062349000200"></a>I hope that my response has clarified the purpose and importance of this regulation-making power sufficiently for the noble Lord to feel able to withdraw his amendment. How many individuals must fail the test is not relevant to how defined benefit schemes are tested, because it is done on a scheme-wide basis, whereas with defined contribution schemes one is looking at inputs on an individual basis.</p>

Broad equivalence has to be determined by reference to the test scheme set out in Clause 22. A whole host of issues might need to be taken into account. Setting them down in guidance will assist employers in making the determination. It is a little like the reference scheme test, which determines whether schemes can be contracted out of the state second pension scheme. It is detailed guidance about a whole range of issues that are likely to be relevant in making that determination.</p>

It is quite extraordinary how little detail the Minister can give us on so many matters. Many people have commented on how the success of auto-enrolment in personal accounts will depend on the detail of the implementation, yet we are discovering that reams of this detail have not in any way been firmed up. Not only is Parliament being asked to sign into law a Bill that makes radical changes to pension provision in this country, but we are being asked to do it with only the haziest outline of what the future holds. To a great extent, we are being asked to buy a pig in a poke. This vagueness goes beyond good parliamentary practice, as important as that is. It means that employers are equally unable to predict the changes in costs that might be imposed on them only a few years hence. Unless the Minister can give me a bit more information, I shall have to seek the opinion of the Committee.</p>

We use the term to ensure that the widest-possible range of scheme types can be directed to the test scheme standard, because the test scheme does not replicate the benefit structure of all defined benefit schemes. We need to be able to gauge the standard of any scheme in the most appropriate manner to ensure that the wider reform&#146;s objective will be met. Nor do we want to interfere with the benefit structures by requiring them to align with the test scheme.</p>

<a name="80623-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="08062349000205"></a>By requiring that pensions are broadly equivalent, we enable schemes offering pensions on a different basis&#151;for example, on a career-average basis&#151;to be compared with the test scheme. Therefore, the regulations and guidance that will follow under Clauses 21 and 22 will set out how an employer should assess whether they meet the broad equivalence test. This is exactly the approach used under the reference scheme test for contracting out for the same reasons.</p>

<a name="80623-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="08062349000206"></a>I do not understand why the noble Lord is so vexed by this. We know of no defined benefit scheme that we expect to fail the test, but the noble Lord will understand that a whole range of different benefits and calculations is provided in defined benefit schemes&#151;they are not all the same. Therefore, guidance that helps employers in assessing whether any individual scheme meets the test will be needed. I do not see why the noble Lord is so concerned about that.</p>

<a name="80623-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="08062349000207"></a>These are highly technical issues. Sometimes an actuary will need to be involved. As I think I said, we broadly expect this test to be looked at once up front and then for employers to keep an eye on any changes occurring to the scheme, but it is fundamentally a one-off calculation. We are not aware of any defined benefit scheme that would fail that test. It seems to me a pretty straightforward issue.</p>

<a name="80623-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08062349000208"></a>I shall seek to reinforce the point for the noble Lord. If we are looking at defined contribution schemes, we are looking at inputs on an individual basis, as we discussed earlier. When we are evaluating defined benefit schemes, we are broadly looking at outcomes for those schemes and trying to evaluate whether those outcomes are equivalent to what the test scheme would produce. It is a different approach because of the different nature of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.</p>

<a name="80623-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="08062349000209"></a>I hope that that is sufficient for the noble Lord. It is not really a case of saying that we do not know and will have to fill in these things in due course. Of course, the detailed rules will need to be worked out and new detailed rules will undoubtedly need to be introduced if new defined benefit schemes come along. The whole purpose of this is to help employers to be clearer about how they make their judgment on whether the scheme satisfies the standard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="08062349000216"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall also speak to the other amendments in the group. Clause 22 introduces the test scheme. A scheme that passes the test scheme standard provides for pensions broadly equivalent to, or better than, those under the test scheme. Government Amendments Nos. 69 and 70 enable the pension age in the test scheme to be adjusted upwards in regulations to reflect increases in state pension age. This is to ensure that the scheme test remains an appropriate benchmark of scheme quality. We expect that, following the recent reforms to state pension age, employers will review the pensionable ages in their schemes in the future. These government amendments allow us to consult stakeholders on the most effective way of changing the pension age in the test scheme without imposing additional burdens on employers. I beg to move.</p>

I listened with interest to the Minister&#146;s explanation. The government amendments are, of course, very sensible. With the state pension age rising to 68 over a long period, it would be wrong to insist that qualifying DB schemes should maintain their retirement age at 65. However, the Minister&#146;s amendment only allows the Government to ensure that the test scheme benchmark is kept up to date; it does not ensure that it will be done.</p>

<a name="80623-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="08062349000218"></a>My amendment would make certain that no qualifying DB scheme is held to a lower age than the state counts from. Such a situation is, I am sure, not one that the Minister would consider beneficial. DB schemes are already fighting numerous disadvantages compared with money purchase schemes, as the ever falling number remaining open to new members makes clear. My amendment would not prevent a scheme from choosing to allow retirement at an earlier age if it should wish to. It would merely make annual regulations adjusting the prescribed age unnecessary, which I hope the Minister would approve of.</p>

Amendment No. 71 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, would require the pension age in the test scheme automatically to track increases in state pension age once they are equalised for men and women. However, linking the pensionable age in the test scheme directly to changes in state pension age could lead to complexity. Over a transitional period, state pension age will increase in gradual steps, until it is 68 for both men and women.</p>

<a name="80623-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="08062349000221"></a>It is unlikely that the pension age of an employer&#146;s pension scheme will exactly match the transitional arrangements for increasing state pension age and we would like to be able to take account of changes to defined benefit pension provision in adjusting the pension age of the test scheme. We believe that simply linking to state pension age could have the unintended consequence of making the qualifying test more complex.

We want to make sure that the test scheme is relevant to what is happening to defined benefit schemes generally.

It is very unlikely that in aggregate that will mirror the timetable of the state pension age changes.

<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1318"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1318</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which hybrid schemes will qualify. Hybrid schemes are an integral part of the pension landscape. They exist in a variety of forms, some providing the better of a defined benefits or money purchase pension and some combining elements of both.</p>

<a name="80623-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="08062349000234"></a>Clause 23 sets out the quality requirements for UK hybrid pension schemes, which is meeting the money purchase or the defined benefit quality requirements, or in some cases, both of those tests in relation to parts of a hybrid scheme. We want to encourage employers to retain existing high quality pension provision. We know that hybrid schemes can offer employers a way of sharing the balance of risk in pension provision with their employees. We therefore need to ensure that the quality requirements can be applied to a range of schemes and in a way that minimises the burdens on business.</p>

<a name="80623-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="08062349000235"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 73 and 74 will achieve this by ensuring that Clause 23 is workable for a wide variety of hybrid schemes. They enable regulations to modify the quality requirements to accommodate better schemes, such as combination hybrid and cash balance schemes. Amendment No. 72 simply tidies up the drafting of the clause by ensuring that it is consistent with similar provision in the employer duty chapter.</p>

<a name="80623-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="08062349000236"></a>The final government amendment in this group is to Clause 86. Clause 86 defines terms for the purposes of Part 1 of the Bill, including definitions of the occupational pension schemes to which the quality requirements in Clauses 19 to 23 apply. Amendment No. 121 refines the definition of a hybrid scheme as a scheme that is neither a money purchase scheme nor a defined benefit scheme. This refined definition should assist employers in identifying whether their scheme falls into that category and so provides a clearer indication that they should follow the rules under Clause 23 in assessing whether the scheme meets the quality requirement. This is a minor and technical but necessary amendment. We believe that these amendments to the qualifying requirements for hybrid schemes strike the right balance between safeguarding private pension saving and minimising the burdens of business.</p>

<a name="80623-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="08062349000237"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has tabled an amendment that would require the Secretary of State to direct employers to the appropriate test for their hybrid scheme by rules made in regulations. Our intention is that rules will direct employers and their advisers to the appropriate test. We are keen to minimise burdens on business. Employers will often set up hybrid pension arrangements that are tailored to suit their workforce. This means that there is a wide range of hybrids and the landscape is ever-changing. We need the quality requirements to respond flexibly to hybrid schemes as they develop, to provide employers with certainty on whether their scheme meets the right quality standard, and to safeguard the interests of members who will be saving in these schemes.</p>

<a name="80623-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="08062349000238"></a>Primary legislation sets out the fundamentals, giving employers certainty about what test a qualifying hybrid scheme will have to meet. Regulations will enable the test to be modified for certain types of hybrid and rules will direct employers to the appropriate test and set out its detailed application. Rules provide for greater flexibility and enable us to respond to future innovations

I put it down to discover, if I could, how the rules to define a hybrid scheme will be decided. I understand that the arrangement to have rules is to have flexibility as we go along, but rules mean different things in different bits of legislation, so I would like to know what legal effect they will have if they are not made by regulations. Secondly, I do not want to sound racialist or anything like that, but where does a foreign-managed scheme fit into all this and will it have to obey these rules however they are made?</p>

I was trying to explain the starting proposition for whether any scheme is a qualifying scheme and an autoenrolment scheme. There are tests to be met for that. We discussed earlier that special provision would need to be made for non-UK schemes to see whether they are administered and provided in such a way that they can be brought within the ambit of the provisions of the Bill. It would be the same for hybrid schemes as for defined benefit or defined contributions schemes. I hope that deals with that point.</p>

<a name="80623-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="08062349000243"></a>In relating to the impact of rules, they are rules under the hierarchy of arrangements that I explained. Primary legislation sets out the fundamentals for how the test applies to hybrids, then regulations enable them to be fleshed out. More detailed rules are provided within those regulations. I am not sure that that is such an unusual hierarchy of arrangements in pension or other provisions. I believe it would be right that if those rules come out of the regulations or primary legislation, they would have the same legal standing. I think I might take some advice on that, and if I need to qualify it, I will. I hope that sets in context how we are proceeding to deal with hybrid schemes. I am happy to share with the noble Lord a range of different hybrid schemes just to emphasise their complexity and multiplicity. It is only 22 minutes past nine, and I am sure that he could stomach a few of them.</p>

<p><a name="st_232"></a>
<a name="08062349000264"></a><a name="80623-0016.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80623-0016.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08062349000440"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I wish to raise the issue of the burdens that this Bill will impose on employers, in particular on SME employers. The contents of Clause 26 are welcome as far as they go. They allow employer and employee contributions to be phased in over a period of at least three years and possibly longer. I am sure that employee phasing will help to minimise the amount of opting out in the early phase, and will thus give inertia a better chance of succeeding. Employer phasing is an essential part of letting employers adjust slowly to the additional cost burden that this Bill will inevitably impose.</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="08062349000265"></a>The latest regulatory impact assessment estimates that, once the transitional period has been completed, the central estimate of the extra direct cost will be &#163;2.5 billion each year. However, the cost will fall disproportionately on small and micro-firms, which will bear &#163;1.2 billion of the total, adding around 1 per cent to their labour bill. The relative impact for medium and large firms is much smaller, at around 0.5 per cent of labour cost. Of course, these are averages. Businesses of all sizes vary in their labour intensity. Those that use more staff will bear a higher relative cost burden.</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="08062349000266"></a>There is also the indirect cost burden. The Government apparently set up a cross-government group of so-called experts to look at administrative costs. I should be interested to hear from the Minister why the Government thought that a group of civil servants alone, with no business representatives, was the right body to carry out this exercise. This group found that the costs were now predicted to be higher than estimated for the December 2006 White Paper; and, in particular, that year one costs had increased by more than 20 per cent to &#163;350 million, while ongoing costs had shaded up to &#163;101 million. The important part of the analysis is that it starts to reflect more accurately the impact on the smaller end of the business community. All of the increase in start-up costs is focused on the small and micro-firms, which now account for &#163;280 million out of the total of &#163;350 million.</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="08062349000267"></a>These cost estimates produced by the department are not uncontroversial. The British Chambers of Commerce estimates that the ongoing annual cost is more than &#163;300 million, not &#163;101 million as shown in the regulatory impact assessment. Of course, there is a rather weary scepticism among businesses about government estimates of the burdens being placed on them. Real businesses have rarely been able to identify any reality behind the calculations that appear in regulatory impact assessments. That is part of the broader picture of the Government not fully reflecting the reality of regulatory burdens on business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="08062349000268"></a>The Prime Minister, when responding to my honourable friend Sir John Butterfill in a debate on the Queen&#146;s Speech in another place last year, said that there would be special arrangements for small businesses.  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1322"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1322</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>However, so far as I can see, the Bill has no arrangements for small businesses. The transition arrangements set out in Clause 26, which I have said are welcome, seem to be available to all employers; hence, nothing special has been done for smaller businesses.</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="08062349000269"></a>The Engineering Employers&#146; Federation has done a lot of work on a scheme that would compensate smaller businesses for some of the extra costs that they will inevitably incur. This scheme involves payments to the smaller employers to offset some of their costs over a three-year period. I gather that this has had a somewhat dusty response from the Treasury, which does not surprise me as the Treasury does not like spending money and has little or no understanding of the SME sector. Will the Minister say what the view of his department is of the need to provide a mechanism to support smaller employers? What does he think of the EEF&#146;s proposals?</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="08062349000270"></a>Instead of making payments to smaller employers, another way of dealing with the problem would be to extend the transitional provisions for small and medium-sized employers so that they got a higher amount of relief from the full costs or got it for longer. This might mean that the pension pots of their employees took longer to get going at the full rate, but, as I have already said, we should not let the best be the enemy of the good. The successful implementation of auto-enrolment across all sizes of business would be a very great prize, and it would be a shame to spoil it because of some dogmatic view that every employee or every employer had to be brought along at exactly the same pace.</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="08062349000271"></a>The Treasury is also said to be wary of relief for SMEs because of the dangers of abuse and of companies fragmenting themselves to take advantage of preferential treatment. In this, it is rather like the DWP, which sees abusive employers lurking in every corner. The EEF has discussed the Treasury&#146;s concerns with RSM Robson Rhodes, a significant accounting firm, which has advised that a combination of the additional burdens on fragmented business entities plus the judicious use of an associated company definition, which is well known in tax law, would overcome those concerns. That is, companies do not have a natural incentive to fragment themselves. In any event, it can be overcome by an associated company definition.</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="08062349000272"></a>Does the Minister think that the Government can achieve more flexibility in this way? It might need an amendment to the Bill, but we would be happy to support him in this. If this sort of flexibility does not work, what are the Government going to do to ease the burdens on small businesses? They need more than fine words. The Minister will doubtless cite his department&#146;s research, which shows that businesses will be coping with the cost pressures that the Bill will introduce. I remind him that this research was conducted from July to September last year, which was before the credit crunch started to work through the economy. Even then, only 20 per cent thought that they could recover their costs in prices. I doubt that the figure would be anything like that today.</p>

Then again, we could have another two years of this Government and their way with the economy, so we cannot be confident.</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="08062349000274"></a>I look forward to hearing from the Minister that the Government are fully aware of the cost problems facing businesses as a consequence of the Bill, and indeed the administrative burdens that come with it, and that they have some concrete and constructive proposals to help small and medium-sized businesses.</p>

<p><a name="st_233"></a>
<a name="08062349000275"></a><a name="80623-0016.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80623-0016.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08062349000441"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> I have a couple of questions. I absolutely support the case that has been made, for the reasons that I explained when I spoke to an earlier group of amendments. I have real concerns about the impact that the provisions will have on micro-businesses, and nothing that the Minister said earlier about looking at them as an industry-wide group of employers assuaged my fear. As the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, who so ably opened the debate, said, the economic context has certainly changed. The report carried in the <I>Guardian</I> financial pages suggests very clearly that things are shifting again after a period of relative stability. It would be foolish for us to set up these changes without having some pause for thought about the much less benign economic climate that we are moving to. She is absolutely right to think clearly about that now.</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="08062349000276"></a>Do the Government have a timetable in mind for these transitional provisions? Obviously the provisions are triggered to some extent by the enactment of Clause 19, but the Government must have a calendar of events which will unfold year by year as the transitional periods are triggered. Can the Minister say more about the cost-sharing scheme? Such a scheme makes perfect sense. A tiny firm may be able to show that the provision it is trying to make will be facilitated by extra time and that it is trying in good faith to work with the grain of government policy, but that two years is not enough. It is not clear exactly where in the clause small businesses are provided with the opportunity to opt in over a transitional period.</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="08062349000277"></a>Somewhere in the regulations that flow from this primary legislation there should be flexibility that gives scope and room for manoeuvre to tiny family businesses that are acting in good faith, trying to do what they are required to do and willing to deploy their facilities for their job holders and employees, but which will find the costs too high when they implement the provisions in this clause simply because they do not have the time to make adjustments. If the economic circumstances are to be much tougher for small businesses to cope with then it is entirely right that we should think now about those circumstances. It is entirely reasonable to anticipate that that is exactly what might happen in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="08062349000279"></a>The first issue is what the staging and phasing will do. The two ideas get, in a sense, mixed up. The phasing will consist of two phases: phase 1, specifically in the defined contributions scheme, will be a 1 per cent  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1324"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1324</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>year for employer contributions; and phase 2 will be a 2 per cent year. The Bill itself specifies that both will have to be a minimum of a year. There have been conversations about the total of the two, and much of those conversations suggests that the two added together may be three years, but that is to be defined after further conversation with stakeholders.</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="08062349000280"></a>How does the staging and phasing fit together? Staging will be a process whereby all employers will not be required to meet their duty on day one of phase 1. The staging will divide employers into groups. The Bill is not precise about what those groups are; that will once again be the subject of consultation. The only groupings that have been used so far&#151;they have been used by HMRC and the former DTI to introduce complex regulations, changes of regulations or changes of charging&#151;have essentially been based on size of firm. So the most probable grouping&#151;it does not mean that it will happen; it will be decided after consultation&#151;is by size of firm. Large firms will come in early, some on day one to make the whole process sensible, and smaller and smaller firms will be staged in. This will give special relief to small firms. While small firms will participate in, say, the 1 per cent period for only a short time, in the early part of that period there will be no burden on small firms.</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="08062349000281"></a>The burden of the questions from the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, was how we got our sums and who we involved. In the December 2006 impact assessment our estimate of employer administrative costs were &#163;291 million for the first year and &#163;96 million per year in the steady state. In the December 2007 impact assessment, those estimates were revised upwards to &#163;310 million and &#163;101 million. That is an increase of around 20 per cent for the first-year costs and 5 per cent for the ongoing costs. The impact assessment published alongside the Bill included a detailed explanation of the changes to our estimates since 2006. They reflect changes in our methodology rather than additional requirements on employers. In the December 2006 White Paper, the Government announced that they were setting up a cross-government group of experts to improve understanding of the cost impact of the reforms on employers.</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="08062349000282"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said, the composition of that group was internal. It included the DWP, the then DTI, the Better Regulation Executive, HMRC and the Small Business Service. The group carried out a robust challenge of DWP assumptions, bearing in mind all the available evidence. It gathered and applied evidence from colleagues at HMRC and from commissioned research by Durham University and Middlesex University&#146;s business schools that sought views directly from employers and payroll providers on likely administrative costs. Some of the changes that resulted from the detailed scrutiny carried out by the group were: updated wage estimates and the inclusion of a 30 per cent non-wage cost of employment; increased estimate of the value of the time of owners and managers for microfirms using new analysis of dividend payment; more robust estimates of the cost of collecting monthly contributions validated by commissioned research; inclusion of the opportunity cost of employees&#146; time as a cost to the employer; inclusion of extra processes that employers are likely to carry out, such

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="08062349000283"></a>We think that those estimates are now robust. However, there will inevitably be uncertainty this far from the introduction of the reform, and the estimates will be updated as new databases are received. I have given our estimates of administrative costs. For a microfirm&#151;I believe that we have defined that as five or fewer employees, but I will correct that in a letter if I am wrong&#151;there will be costs of &#163;200 for the first year and &#163;70 thereafter, with some &#163;300 and &#163;80 thereafter for small firms, and rather more for the medium and larger firms but in proportion a good deal less, as noble Lords have pointed out.</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="08062349000284"></a>On the issue of financial help, we recognise that the reforms should impose the fewest possible burdens on employers of all sizes, and small employers in particular. In developing the policy framework for the reforms, we have engaged with employers and their representatives to ensure that we balance our objective of increasing access to pension savings with minimising employer burdens. As I have explained, the phasing policy is explicitly designed to smooth the increased costs for employers as a result of the reform. Our expectation is that it will be of most benefit to those employers who do not currently offer workplace pension contributions. The majority of small employers will fall into this group, so will benefit disproportionately from phasing. In that sense the phasing policy is targeted on the smallest employers and has a cost-reducing effect. Introducing a further support payment would duplicate that effect.</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="08062349000285"></a>Looking beyond the phasing policy, we recognise that the operational approach taken by the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority and the Pensions Regulator is crucial in minimising burdens. Clause 62 requires the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority to have regard to minimising burdens on employers in implementing the reforms. The delivery authority has already established an employer panel for ongoing consultation on the design of the scheme. That is evidence of how seriously the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority takes that principle.</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="08062349000286"></a>Of course, we have already produced working estimates of the administrative costs to employers in the cost-benefit analysis in the impact assessment. Those are based on the cost of the activities that we believe employers will undertake and, as I have said, on robust methodology. As is normal with major reforms, they were scrutinised by the Better Regulation Executive and Small Business Service within government.</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="08062349000287"></a>We recognise that small employers have limited capacity to respond to regulatory change and that fixed administrative costs per firm affect them disproportionately. Our analysis reflects that. This strengthens our resolve to design the reforms with them in mind, but it does not automatically point to a package of compensation. Until operational systems  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1326"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 1326</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are more fully developed we cannot predict reliably the final costs of potential administrative burdens. There is no evidence at this stage that financial support would be appropriate for small employers. It would therefore be unwise to commit future Governments to spending taxpayers&#146; money in this way.</p>

<a name="80623-0016.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="08062349000288"></a>I should like to re-emphasise our belief that we have taken and will continue to take the necessary steps to get the design of the reforms and the scheme right. Any decision that financial support for employers was necessary should rightly be left for future Governments to make based on the evidence available at the time.</p>

We will continue to work constructively with these groups to design the system with small employers in mind.</p>

He gave me quite a lot of information on how the department&#146;s working party, or inter-departmental group, looked at costs and what information it used. But he did not really answer the point about why there were no business representatives on that group. It is one thing to carry out surveys of businesses, but it is another thing to invite business into your deliberations as a part of it. The Minister should not be surprised that the result is disputed by business. He can tell me all he likes that it will cost &#163;70 in administration costs on an ongoing basis. Those figures simply are not recognised by business. That is a big problem because the gap in ongoing costs, as I said earlier, is a three-fold difference. Businesses think that it costs three times as much as the Government suggest. Potentially, this is a very big problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="08062349000292"></a>Let us put the quantum to one side. The Minister talked about phasing and staging. The burden of what he was saying is that he is not going to tell us how phasing or staging will work in practice because the Government have not made up their mind. The Minister did not even say that the Government would use staging for smaller enterprises. He just said that, in the past, it has been done by size of company, but he did not say that smaller businesses would be the beneficiaries of this scheme.</p>

Between now and Report, we will want to go away and look again at whether this Bill correctly reflects the desire to ensure that the small and medium-sized business community is adequately covered and protected by what are potentially very disruptive changes that could be introduced when personal accounts are first brought forward. We do not want them to be disruptive and I am sure that the Government do not want that

<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="08062349000299"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 2 establishes the right of a jobholder to remain an active participant in workplace pension saving by requiring employers to maintain active qualifying scheme membership. This government amendment enables a scheme to retain its qualifying status under the employer duty when the pension protection fund or the pensions regulator has become involved and the benefit accrual is frozen. A freeze in a scheme is a way of effectively pressing a pause button on the scheme activity so that an assessment can be made about the risk to security of members&#146; benefits and to the PPF. Amendment No. 83 makes clear that in such cases the jobholders continue to be active members and that the scheme does not cease to qualify. Therefore the employer continues to meet the employer duty in respect of jobholders in that frozen scheme.</p>

<a name="80623-0017.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="08062349000300"></a>Without this protection, the employer would have to designate alternative qualifying provision at least for the duration of the period that the accruals were frozen. This is likely to be a relatively short period and doing so would disrupt scheme membership, increase the administrative costs for the employers who may be already financially vulnerable or, more likely, encourage employers to level down. Once the freezing order is lifted or the PPF assessment ends, the employer duties continue as normal in respect of jobholders who must be enrolled into qualifying pension provision. I beg to move.</p>

On this occasion, however, I fully understand why it has been necessary to table a new clause on the effect of a freezing order. The new clause, however, which I have read very carefully several times, applies only to freezing orders and what happens during that period. Although the relevant provision in paragraph (b) refers to &#147;an assessment period&#148;, it is not terribly helpful. Before the next stage of the Bill, will the Minister perhaps think about expanding this as it does not appear to me to be particularly clear, despite what he said just now?

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08062326000129"></a> Clause 293, page 124, line 19, leave out from &#147;ballot&#148; to  &#147;; or&#148; in line 20 and insert &#147;in accordance with the code of practice set out in section (Consultation principles);&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000009"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment takes us into slightly different territory, which I have raised in the House on a couple of occasions; namely, that of ballots. I am very grateful to the Government for the provision in the Bill requiring ballots in relation to stock transfer. Previously, the requirement to hold ballots was at best obscure and was followed in some cases but not others. I should have liked the ballots to be broader in scope and to cover allocation of local authority stock to an ALMO or the re-awarding of such management contracts. I welcome the provision so far as it goes.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000010"></a>The problem with ballots is their fairness. Some basic principles of democracy are involved here. Ballots have been conducted by councils or landowners that wish to transfer their stock. They have been in charge of the propaganda in favour of a yes vote. Their staff have been used to agitate in favour of a yes vote, their publications have been distributed&#151;in many cases several times&#151;in favour of a yes vote and council premises have sometimes been used to present inducements in favour of a yes vote such as showing videos.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000011"></a>Parliament has on many occasions laid down rules for the conduct of elections and referenda. They provide for equivalence of information, equivalence of status between yes and no votes or of all the candidates in an election, and non-interference and equal access to the ballot box and the list of voters. That has occurred with many&#151;I do not say all&#151;ballots that have operated in this regard.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000012"></a>I and others have drawn attention to some abuses in the system, which include the imbalance of information. There have been cases in which one side is able to produce three or four glossy leaflets but the other side is refused access to the same facility. In the case that I am talking about&#151;that of Merseyside&#151;there was still a no vote but another ballot was held. That is reminiscent of more difficult areas of democracy. There have also been cases&#151;I have details with me about one in County  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC496"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC496</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Durham&#151;in which the side that advocated a no vote was denied access to the list of those entitled to vote until the final two or three days. There have been allegations that council officials in a voting booth wear stickers supporting a yes vote. There have also been more direct inducements and intimidation. We have an example in the Tower Hamlets case of ballot papers being for sale and acquired by the <I>Evening Standard</I>. That shows, as a minimum, that there is a lack of firmness about the rules; in fact, there are not many rules. I am asking through the amendment that the Government take on board the need to provide for fairness of rules here.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000013"></a>It should be pretty obvious from my presentation that, by and large, I am not in favour of transfers out of local authority stock unless the local authority has absolutely failed in its management. I am partisan in that respect, but I recognise the need to ensure that local authorities keep up to the mark and that there is therefore the possibility of transfer out of local authority control to keep local authority management on its toes. I should say that here I am not speaking on behalf of the National Consumer Council, which is in favour of all forms of provision in whatever circumstances, but I have a prejudice that is no doubt evident in my interventions on the issue.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000014"></a>The issue is fairness. Whatever question is put to tenants, they need to feel that it is put to them fairly, that they are not being pressurised&#151;there are allegations in the opposite direction of intimidation and buying votes. This whole area needs some serious cleaning up. I am therefore asking the Government, if they are not prepared to accept my amendment as it stands, at least to accept the principle that where ballots on stock transfer are conducted, there will be clear rules that provide for equality, fairness and equal access to the ballot box and the electoral list. That is an absolute minimum of effective democracy.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000015"></a>We have to bear in mind that the tenants who are asked to vote in these ballots are probably those who are least likely to vote in a general election or a local election, and this is their most direct experience of our democracy. If they find a democratic vote that is so close to their central interests being corrupted in one form or another, their belief in the democratic system as a whole suffers. Therefore, it is incumbent on the Government, having rightly included a provision for ballots in the Bill, also to provide for the way in which the ballots will be conducted. I beg to move.</p>

A well conducted ballot is widely thought to be the best way to interpret existing transfer legislation. The proposal is now to write the requirement for a transfer ballot more directly into the Bill. The value of ballots is hard to argue with, but it is worth considering wider unintended consequences and what often happens on the ground in housing estates.</p>

<p><a name="08062326000017"></a>In east London, we have had nine years of experience of dealing with mandatory stock transfer ballots, nearly all of which we have won with resounding majorities. However, the housing company of which I am a director&#151;I must declare that interest&#151;has experienced appalling delays in the refurbishment of the homes of very vulnerable families; that has resulted from the  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC497"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC497</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>political knockabout that has so often surrounded the ballot process. Not only have those ballots often undermined public confidence, they have also for many months or even years distracted staff and resident directors from the core task of running a &#163;300 million housing company on behalf of the residents.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000018"></a>At Poplar HARCA, we have counted the many hundreds of thousands of pounds that the ballot exercise has cost and have witnessed the confusion created among local residents who have so often felt consulted to death as a result of the process. The amendments are intended to save many housing estates across the country from that unhelpful experience and to leave the decision as to exactly how to test local opinion to those in the local context. There are different mechanisms available now to do that. What works in the London Borough of Newham may be quite different from what works or does not work in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets next door. It all depends on local circumstances. The amendments seek to recognise that fact and to leave it to those in the local context to decide which method of testing local opinion is best for their residents. In some cases, they will choose a stock transfer ballot and that is fine.</p>

<p><a name="08062326000021"></a><a name="80623-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80623-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08062326000161"></a>Lord Mawson:</b> Before I was interrupted by the Division Bell, I suggested that there are now different ways to test local opinion. In some cases we will choose a stock transfer ballot, and that is fine, but the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, was correct to point out that if we do that, it has to be very well run. However, there are practical reasons why it is very difficult to do. Why not let the decision be made locally rather than introduce legislation which dictates that one size fits all? Housing transfers have become an established part of the regeneration scene. However, they are now highly politicised affairs. This means that often the ballot is not just an occasion where the residents assess a scheme and give their view. My experience is that people from all over the country come to these ballots with a particular axe to grind. They have become highly tangled, tortuous affairs full of accusation and acrimony.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000022"></a>What happens when a good scheme goes down or is delayed? There are resource issues for housing associations, so it is not just the cost of the ballot itself or the promotional material. To work up an offer, an association will have to invest many hundreds of thousands of pounds to develop a viable scheme for an estate or neighbourhood in need of comprehensive regeneration and redesign. There are unavoidable costs for surveying, master planning, pre-planning application discussions with the planning authority, business planning and financial forecasting. These resources are lost in the case of a negative ballot, however good the scheme and however necessary the regeneration. Where does the money come from? In the end, it comes from the existing tenants&#146; rent. Then there is the even greater loss of the regeneration resources transfer would bring. For example, in Tower Hamlets, the cost of negative ballots has been estimated at over &#163;600 million of resources for deprived neighbourhoods.</p>

<p><a name="08062326000023"></a><a name="80623-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80623-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08062326000162"></a>Lord Graham of Edmonton:</b> How much?</p>

<p><a name="08062326000024"></a><a name="80623-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80623-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08062326000163"></a>Lord Mawson:</b> I repeat, over &#163;600 million. In many cases the estates are in need of complete remodelling and rebuilding, with a fresh look at how scarce land is being used, but there is now no resource to make that happen.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000025"></a>It might be argued that the association takes a known risk, one that it does not have to take. It is also argued that the ballot box gives residents an opportunity to speak. If they have spoken against a scheme, they must live with that choice. If they do not accept a scheme, they will pay the price. That is fine as far as it goes, but it is not the whole story. The voters in a transfer ballot are not the only stakeholders, and the consequences for a wider group of stakeholders must be acknowledged. Hands cannot be washed just because a particular result emerges from the ballot box. There will be a broader impact on the surrounding neighbourhoods where an estate or neighbourhood rejects an investment opportunity. The impact will be wider than the local constituency of voters. We must also consider the even greater impact on welfare costs and taxation&#151;the deprivation tariff. If neighbourhood regeneration does not take place and immovable pockets of deprivation remain, it has an inevitable social cost in terms of lower education attainment, poorer health and higher levels of worklessness. These in themselves are unhappy human outcomes, so the wider cost needs to be understood and taken into account.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000026"></a>While independent ballots are rightly seen as important, the voters are not the only stakeholders. Their views are important, but in the longer term they may not turn out to be the most vital. This is not to disparage democratic processes, but to emphasise that there are unignorable wider consequences where no investment takes place and higher social costs are sustained. These overall consequences cannot be avoided and need to be weighed when judgments, sometimes quite difficult political judgments, have to be made. A ballot may seem to be a simple way to test local opinion, but experience shows that it may not tell the whole story, or even enough of the story, about an area. The Government need to reserve a wider range of instruments to ensure that change can take place in circumstances where the cost of no change is too high. Such decisions cannot be taken centrally; they have to be taken in the local context by people who are aware of all the complex needs and realities of an area. The amendments seek to leave the power of decision with local people; I commend them to noble Lords.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000027"></a>Finally, the amendments seek to alert the Government to the practical consequences of their present approach; while it is apparently laudable, that restricted approach will, if our experience in east London is anything to go by, ensure that the Government&#146;s policy aspirations will not in many cases be carried through in practice. The budget that they have set aside for improved housing provision will not be spent. I hope that I am wrong, but history may prove otherwise. It might be good in a few years for us all to return to this Room and look at what the practical aspirations were and what actually happened to some of the poorest families in this country.</p>

I apologise for my voice. I hope that I will remain more or less intelligible&#151;at least audibly, if not politically&#151;for the rest of the day. My noble friend has kept his cold in Pendle and sends his apologies. He emailed me about those amendments&#151;he is obviously in support of them&#151;and said that good councils of course do all the things that are spelt out in the second amendment. He said that the mention of notice boards in subsection (2)(e) of Amendment No. 114 is curiously old-fashioned and that if the council is using its website, opponents should have a right to equal space there. That is probably covered by &#147;other relevant resources&#148;, in any event. My noble friend concludes his note by saying that,</p>
<ul><a name="08062326000155"></a>&#147;many ballots at present are like an election in Russia (or worse)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08062326000127"></a>I, like the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, am partisan, but I share the view that if there are to be ballots, they should be well conducted.</p>

<p><a name="08062326000029"></a><a name="80623-gc0001.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80623-gc0001.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08062326000165"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> The noble Baroness said the key words. While it is clearly useful to have tenant ballots if only tenants are involved, the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, had a point when he said that if a council has made this matter an electoral issue and the election has been clear, open and everyone understands what is going on, that is a fair process. We do not have to worry about that. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, is discussing different circumstances in which, if there is a somewhat unscrupulous council&#151;which is not unknown&#151;it is possible to have a one-sided election.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000030"></a>The difficulty is how we establish a system that provides the flexibility that the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, rightly asked for and the security that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, rightly asked for. At the moment, the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews has the job and the responsibility. All I would say to the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, is that he needs to remember that when the country votes in a general election, it gets the result it gets and has to live with it. You cannot complain if you have a ballot purely on a housing issue and you do not get the result you want. You have to live with it, because that is democracy, I am afraid. It may be tough, but democracy needs to be a tough and harsh discipline. It is good that it works.</p>

My noble friend Lord Whitty has a lot of passion and experience in this field. We have listened to him carefully regarding the instances he cited. I also listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, who described the wider context and implications. He gave a useful account of what is frail in the system. That is why we support the intention behind my noble friend&#146;s amendments, because we can do better than we have done. I do not feel that his prescription is the right one&#151;and I think that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, may have been hinting at that&#151;but I have come up with an alternative, which I hope noble Lords will accept.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC500"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC500</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="08062326000156"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000032"></a>The amendment would impose on councils an overly prescriptive procedure. They would be compelled to follow it, regardless of the nature of the proposal and, indeed, regardless of whether a council wanted to pass a few management responsibilities for, say, 25 or so homes to a group of tenants or to pass ownership of an estate of 500 or more homes to an RSL.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000033"></a>The code of practice has a very different effect, whether one is talking about a change of management or a change of landlord, and it is worth unpacking that a little. Councils seek to pass management responsibilities to other bodies where they believe that doing so will provide better value for money and a better service to their tenants. Sometimes management responsibilities are passed on to tenants because that is what they have asked for. Under a change of management, however, homes remain in council ownership and tenants remain council tenants. Tenancies do not change and tenants are less affected than under a change of landlord. That is right, and we encourage councils to keep their tenants fully informed where they propose a change of management and actively to seek their views. Equally, it is right that councils are free to manage this process as they think most appropriate, given the homes in question. It is obviously wrong to force a process on them.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000034"></a>However, a change of landlord is significantly different. The terms of people&#146;s tenancies do change and therefore it is right that they are involved to a far greater degree. For that reason, we introduced Clause 293. However, I do not believe that in addition to a statutory ballot, which is the burden of Clause 293, a statutory code of practice is necessary, not least because much of what is proposed in the amendments is already part of the process and we encourage it through the existing guidance.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000035"></a>The guidance that we issue to councils on stock transfers is very clear about how tenants should be consulted. I am not convinced that councils are neglecting to follow it but I am concerned about the sort of experiences that my noble friend has relayed. I am concerned that he and others have the impression that some councils do not follow the guidance, and we need to address that. Equally, we need a transparent, fair, open, robust and flexible process. I very much take on board what the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, said about the need for flexibility and local character.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000036"></a>I hope that my noble friend and others will draw some comfort from the fact that we intend to table an amendment to this clause that would provide powers to the Secretary of State to issue statutory guidance on stock transfers. I hope that that will meet noble Lords&#146; concerns in a more focused way. It is not our intention to make the current guidance statutory. It is more than 250 pages long and much of it relates to best practice. It is this guidance that the Homes and Communities Agency will in future be responsible for producing.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000037"></a>To complement the work of the agency, we aim to consult on short, statutory guidance that focuses on the key issues that my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, highlighted, including what might

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000038"></a>I hope that that will satisfy my noble friend and I now turn to the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Mawson. I am very grateful for his insight and he was extremely eloquent in describing the relationship between the ballot and the wider form of democracy that he would advocate. However, I cannot accept the amendment because there is a larger issue at stake here. The amendment seeks to remove the requirement to hold a ballot from authorities that have signalled their intent to seek consent to transfer in the manifesto upon which they were elected.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000039"></a>I also have a problem there with fairness. How would we know that any of the tenants in question had voted for the party in power? How could it be fair that people who did not live in the homes in question could decide the fate of those who did? I would have no objection&#151;indeed, I would welcome it&#151;if political parties made clear in their manifestos what they intended to do if elected, including how they would manage their housing, but essentially that should be the start of the process, not the process itself. Tenants must have the final say, and this clause as it stands provides that.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000040"></a>The amendment also seeks to exclude local authorities that can demonstrate by means other than a ballot the opinion of their tenants. All local authorities seeking to transfer stock currently carry out voluntary ballots because they recognise it is the clearest way of both demonstrating tenants&#146; opinion and ensuring that all tenants are involved. We concur with that and that is why we are ensuring such protection for tenants is enshrined in law. It is hard to imagine what other process could achieve the same result. It cannot be right that tenants of one authority are invited to take part in a properly conducted ballot, the result of which would be clear and unambiguous, while their neighbours across the border are subject to a different process.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000041"></a>I hope that what we have come forward with addresses the concerns and is acceptable. It will meet the critical criteria of fairness and robustness. It is also possible to craft it in such a way that it is flexible enough for local authorities to use it to their own benefit and to the benefit of their tenants.</p>

I hope both the noble Lord and the noble Baroness will soon recover.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000043"></a>Most noble Lords who have contributed to the debate recognise that there is a problem. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, has, in one sense, let the cat out of the bag. I did not address the biggest imbalance&#151;that if you vote yes you get the money; if you vote no, you do not. In the old days that used to be known as &#147;treating&#148; and was an electoral offence. However, I will put that to one side. But it demonstrates that the whole operation is in the context of a national policy which both major parties broadly support. It is therefore not sensible that the impact of the national

I do not accept the need for flexibility in that respect.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000044"></a>Even in relation to local authority manifestos, the local authorities are operating within a national policy and, as the Minister said, it is by no means certain that the tenants of the estates in question voted for the majority party when it came to its execution on those particular premises.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000045"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for suggesting a road to statutory guidance. It is difficult to see the present guidance being put on a statutory basis but if it enshrines the kinds of principles that I am talking about, statutory guidance would go a considerable way towards cleaning up the balance. It would address the situation that the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, referred to in terms of outside interference&#151;on the no side, generally speaking&#151;as well as the imbalance in favour of a yes vote that I was concerned with. That means that this will become a proper, cleaned-up form of democracy, rather than something which is subject to abuse and undermines the whole basis on which our democratic society should be run.</p>

<p><a name="08062326000056"></a>In moving Amendment No. 114A I shall speak also to Amendment Nos. 114B and 114C. There are others in this group, which is concerned with family intervention tenancies. The amendment essentially seeks to deal with what I would describe as a rather thin definition of behaviour support services and references to what those are, in a clause that I certainly do not oppose but which could have considerable consequences for the small number of people who may be offered, and who may take up, a family intervention tenancy.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000057"></a>The first of the amendments seeks to introduce a more prescriptive definition of &#147;behaviour support services&#148; to ensure that, when a family moves from a secure tenancy, it receives the services that anyone reading this clause would expect it to receive. Voluntarily giving up a secure or assured social rented tenancy should not be taken lightly. Relinquishing a secure home on the basis&#151;I apologise for my cough; I am not going to do justice to this brief&#151;of receiving intensive and good quality support is significant.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000060"></a>Shelter, which has promoted these amendments, makes the important point that family intervention tenancies should not be used as a form of punishment for anti-social families. It talks about its experience&#151;I am so sorry; my cough must be really irritating for everyone&#151;in its projects where it has come across very variable standards, and argues for the need to safeguard against that. If the Committee will forgive me, I hope that the amendments will speak for themselves. My explanations are very abbreviated.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000061"></a>The third amendment would protect families living in such tenancies from being unfairly evicted. All these amendments are more flexible than those that were tabled in the Commons. I hope therefore that the Minister can assist in responding.

She is being heroic in speaking. I can tell her in response to her amendment that I met the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, to discuss the concerns raised by Shelter. The last thing we want is to set up family intervention tenancies to fail because so much depends on the work the family itself is prepared to do, and the effort family members are prepared to put into it. Essentially we want FITs to provide a platform by which families can regain a footing in the community without causing further damage and distress to their neighbours. Any eviction from a FIT due to a family not having been given the

However, the amendments go too far in seeking to address matters beyond tenancy law.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000064"></a>I explained to my noble friend that while we could not accept the amendments, we take the notion described as the &#147;thin definition&#148; in behaviour support, and that we intend to see how we can prevent the social situation the noble Lord drew attention to. We have therefore undertaken to look at how we can ensure that family intervention tenancies are used only to aid the delivery of behaviour support services that are intensive in nature. I think that my noble friend has already said that this meets the concerns expressed by her and by Shelter, and I am happy that that is the case.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000065"></a>I turn briefly to the other amendments tabled in the group. As the noble Lord said, we have tabled an amendment to achieve the same purpose as his, and indeed our amendment goes a little further. It requires us to take the affirmative route when seeking to vary as well as remove any of the requirements set out in the Bill. In doing this we are responding to a recommendation made by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000066"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 114C. Again I can tell my noble friend Lady Jones that we support the spirit of the amendment in that we want evictions from family intervention tenancies to be rare events. What is encouraging is that the work that has been done so far with intensive support projects suggests that families remain engaged with the support. These are extremely expensive and intensive projects, but they do work. The amendment addresses the nature of the review procedure we are providing. Tenants of a local authority would be entitled to a review where a landlord decides to take possession under a family intervention tenancy. We are taking a power to lay regulations that will make provision for the procedure to be followed in connection with such a review so that landlords and tenants are clear on how such a review should be conducted. Normally, a review of this nature would simply involve the landlord reappraising his decision to take possession in the light of representations made by the tenants or their representatives, but in the case of these tenancies, we think it is sensible&#151;as the amendment also proposes&#151;that the professionals involved in delivering the support programme should feed in their views to inform the landlord&#146;s final decision. I want to make it clear that we would expect the landlord and the support programme to work closely together from the outset. Any decision to take possession would normally be agreed between the two, and if other agencies had an interest in the case, we would want them to be involved as well. A scenario where the landlord seeks repossession against the professional judgment of the support workers is, frankly, most unlikely, so it follows that in the vast majority of cases, any evidence brought forward by support workers at a review would strongly support the landlord&#146;s decision.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000067"></a>I am happy to put on the record my view that future regulations should address the issue of the type of evidence that the review should consider, and that that may include evidence from those who may have been

On that basis, I hope noble Lords will agree that it is unnecessary to highlight this issue in the Bill. The power to make review regulations is already broad enough to allow us to cover the points to which I have referred.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000068"></a>Turning briefly to my own amendments in this group, Amendments Nos. 114AZA, 114AZB, 114BA and 114BB concern identical provisions, albeit that they apply to the two different types of social landlords, local authorities and RSLs. We want to make sure that families are clear about what a family intervention tenancy is, why it is being proposed that they should accept it and what the consequences might be if they do not abide by its conditions. This is obviously heavily linked to their support programme. Our aim is to make sure that a family will sign such a tenancy only having properly considered their options; they must know, they must agree, they must be fully informed and fully signed up.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000069"></a>Accordingly, provisions require that a family be served a notice before they sign a family intervention tenancy agreement. Clause 296 provides details of our requirements as to what the notice must contain. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has accepted that the negative procedure is appropriate for regulations which add further requirements. However, in recognising the importance of the requirements we wish to fix on the face of the Bill, it wants to make sure that any regulations which seek to remove or amend them should attract the affirmative procedure. It is unlikely that we would want to make regulations to this effect but it is sensible that we take the power that would enable us to do so. We are very happy to accept the committee&#146;s recommendations.</p>

On the first amendment, I was not entirely clear how ensuring that high quality services will be available is going to be achieved. Is it the guidance or the practice that will suggest that before the family intervention tenancy is offered there must be certainty that there will be high quality support services? Have I understood that correctly?</p>

These are carefully designed projects. I am sure my officials will correct me if I am wrong but the Dundee project, for example, was a model for this kind of programme. It involved negotiated arrangements that included all the relevant support services. It was made clear to the family that these services would be involved. We have had a lot of successful practice in designing, communicating and managing this project with the family itself. We are looking again at the definition in the Bill. We will cover these kinds of points in the guidance so that people will be in absolutely no doubt about the right processes and the right relationships that we want to see.</p>

Clause 298 and Schedule 10 deal with the issue of tolerated trespassers. The provisions in Schedule 10 will prevent the creation of further tolerated trespassers in the future and will remedy the position for existing tolerated trespassers. We would be forgiven for not knowing what tolerated trespassers are and I shall come to that in a minute. These provisions received widespread support in the responses to the consultation  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC507"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC507</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>paper on tolerated trespassers which was published by the Department for Communities and Local Government last August. Landlords and housing and legal professionals who responded to the consultation strongly supported remedying the situation for future tolerated trespassers and existing tolerated trespassers, not simply those who have complied with the terms of a possession order, provided that landlords are protected from liability for damages.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000087"></a>Let me explain briefly why this change is necessary. Tolerated trespassers are people who have lost their status as tenants after the court has granted the landlord a possession order, but who remain in the property, either by agreement with the landlord or by further order of the court. In the vast majority of cases, they are people in social housing. Our statistics suggest that at least 250,000 to 300,000 people could fall into this category. Being a tolerated trespasser causes serious problems for tenants and landlords alike. In the first place, neither landlord nor tenant can rely on the provisions in the relevant housing Acts or the terms of the tenancy agreement. For the tenant, possibly the most serious consequence is that no succession will be possible on death. For the landlord, problems include uncertainty about entitlement to annual increases in rent and about whether tolerated trespassers should be allowed to vote in stock transfer and tenant management ballots.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000088"></a>We want to put that right for the future and to help existing tolerated trespassers. Part 1 of Schedule 10 will ensure that in future where a person is subject to a possession order, unless they voluntarily move out, they will retain their tenant status until the court bailiff evicts them. Part 2 of Schedule 10 will restore tenancy status to existing tolerated trespassers by creating a new tenancy from the date that the Bill comes into force.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000089"></a>I stress that the Government&#146;s aim is to provide as far as possible that landlord and tenant are in the same position as they would have been had the tenant not become a tolerated trespasser and that neither are disadvantaged by the changes. So it is important to clarify that restoring tenancy status to tolerated trespassers will not affect their landlords&#146; rights to ask the court to order eviction where this is appropriate. In most cases it is at the court&#146;s discretion whether to do so and these discretionary powers are not changed by our proposals.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000090"></a>Our proposals mean that in future people who live in social rented housing will maintain their rights as tenants until they leave their homes and landlords will no longer face the confusion and uncertainty which has been caused by the development of the tolerated trespasser doctrine for the past 20-odd years. These provisions will resolve the contradictions in the current law to make it consistent with the wide discretionary powers that Parliament gave to the courts to protect tenants.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000091"></a>We are also introducing minor amendments to the tolerated trespasser provisions in Schedule 10 and consequential amendments to Schedule 14 which deals with repeals. I shall briefly outline the most important of those amendments. They seek to tighten up and clarify the existing provisions, rather than to expand  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC508"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC508</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>them. In particular, Amendments Nos. 114CD, 114CE and 114CF clarify the territorial divide between England and Wales. The tolerated trespasser doctrine is a complex area of law and we have in several instances added delegated powers to make further provision if the need should arise. Paragraph 25 provides that these powers are exercisable in England by the Secretary of State and in Wales by Welsh Ministers.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000092"></a>My officials have been working closely with colleagues in the Welsh Assembly Government and will continue to do so, so that as far as possible the position in England and Wales continues to be the same. Nevertheless, we want to avoid a situation whereby, if the order-making powers are ever exercised differently, a dispute may arise as to whether the English or Welsh rules apply in a particular case.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000093"></a>So Amendments Nos. 114CD and 114CE clarify what is meant by England and Wales in this context and provide that that is determined by where the dwelling house which is the subject of the possession order is situated. I fear that that has begged the question of what happens with those properties which straddle the border between England and Wales. Although that situation is likely to be rare, it makes sense to provide for it in the Bill to give certainty and obviate the need for further interpretation by the courts.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000094"></a>We consider that the most sensible approach would be to provide that a cross-border property will be deemed to be in England or in Wales depending on the country in which council tax is paid. That will always be a question of fact, because each cross-border property will already be within a local authority&#146;s area for the purposes of council tax, and each local authority is wholly within Wales or England.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000095"></a>Amendments Nos. 114CA and 114CB amend Schedule 10(3) and (8) by inserting two new subsections. Those remove from the Housing Act 1985 and the Housing Act 1988 two very similar sets of subsections which assist the resident partners of tolerated trespassers. As we are getting rid of tolerated trespassers for the future, we believe that those provisions are now redundant. Under the new proposals, the court&#146;s discretionary powers and the tenancy will end together when the possession order is executed. Where partners or ex-partners with occupation rights remain in the property after the tenant has departed, they will be able to ask the court to exercise all relevant powers so long as the tenancy continues, and will not need to rely on the provisions.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000096"></a>Amendment No. 114CC amends Schedule 10(20). Part 2 of Schedule 10 will restore tenancy status to existing tolerated trespassers by creating a new tenancy from the date on which the provisions come into force. Paragraph 20 provides that the possession order and other court orders made in respect of the possession proceedings will apply as far as practicable to the new tenancy. This amendment clarifies that paragraph 20 applies only to those court orders which are in force on the commencement date.</p>

<p><a name="08062326000105"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment deals with the exercise by the Secretary of State and Welsh Ministers of the regulation-making powers that they will be given in the Bill to make provision about the service charge information that landlords will have to supply to their tenants. It provides that the first use of this power shall be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000106"></a>It may help the Committee if I set out the background to those regulation-making powers. Section 21 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 currently provides that tenants paying variable service charges are entitled to request certain accounting information about those charges from their landlords. Service charges are the sums that tenants are required to pay to their landlords for things such as the maintenance and repair of the common parts of the buildings and other common areas. However, it was decided that the rights of tenants in this area could and should be improved on. Specifically, it was decided that there was a need to ensure that all service charge payers were provided with a minimum level of transparency about the moneys that they were required to pay and any balances of such funds held on their behalf.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000107"></a>That would be done by prescribing that certain accounting information should be supplied by landlords as a matter of course, within a period of time from the end of each accounting period. Further, that would be backed by a right to withhold service charges where the information was not provided.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC510"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC510</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000108"></a>Other related provisions will also be introduced, dealing with the holding of service charge money in designated accounts. Provisions were subsequently included in the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002, which set out certain requirements for the service charge statement of accounting and the accompanying accountant&#146;s report. Following extensive consultation with stakeholders about the more detailed requirements for these provisions, it became clear that amendments were needed to the new Section 21 of the 1985 Act, in order to ensure that when regulations are made they can provide more effectively for detailed service charge information to be supplied that is more appropriate to different sets of circumstances.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000109"></a>Therefore, the amended Section 21 will now provide a broader framework than under the original proposals for the regulation-making power to be used. In the light of the wider regulation-making power being provided, and following the advice of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, it is being proposed that the first set of regulations to be made under that power should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure of both Houses. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08062326000117"></a>The noble Lord said: It will take me a little longer to move these amendments, but they are important because they build on a measure that was introduced by the Housing Act 2004 to tackle exploitation of the right-to-buy and compulsory purchase compensation rules by some tenants. They amend Schedule 12 to the Bill, which is given effect by Clause 304, in two different ways.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000118"></a>The 2004 Act enabled landlords to end a tenant&#146;s right to buy a property that was scheduled for demolition&#151;for example, under a regeneration scheme. It did so by adding properties that are to be demolished during the next two years to the exceptions that apply  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC511"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC511</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the right to buy under Schedule 5 of the Housing Act 1985. That means in effect that the right to buy is no longer available on properties where the landlord has served a final demolition notice and followed the prescribed notification process. The 2004 Act also added Schedule 5A to the Housing Act 1985, giving landlords a power to serve an initial demolition notice suspending the right to buy for up to five years. Again, landlords who do so must follow a notification process. Notification of either initial or final demolition notices must set out the reasons and the intended date for demolition. Landlords must also publicise those provisions locally.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000119"></a>The aim of allowing landlords to suspend or end the right to buy in such circumstances was to address a loophole in previous legislation. Prior to the 2004 Act, when a tenant knew that demolition was likely, he or she was able to buy their home under the right to buy at a discount, knowing that it would have to be repurchased using compulsory powers and that they would then be entitled to full market value plus home loss compensation. In other words, they could make a profit at the expense of taxpayers. In areas where the maximum &#163;38,000 right to buy discount was available, a tenant could make a profit of up to &#163;48,000. That affected the financial viability of regeneration schemes. Landlords had to find the money to buy these right-to-buy owners out.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000120"></a>The demolition notice procedure means that landlords can prevent tenants from taking financial advantage of the length of time that it may take to plan and implement a large regeneration scheme. But, of course, there are safeguards for tenants. Landlords must notify them of when and why they intend to demolish. An initial demolition notice expires after five years, and another demolition notice, initial or final, cannot then be served in respect of the same property for a further five years unless the Secretary of State agrees. An initial notice can be extended, but again only with the agreement of the Secretary of State. Similarly, once a final demolition notice has expired, another final notice cannot be served in respect of the same property for five years unless the Secretary of State consents.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000121"></a>If a tenant has incurred conveyancing costs prior to a demolition notice being served, he is entitled to compensation. A final demolition notice cannot be served unless arrangements are in place to acquire any neighbouring properties that might also need to be demolished. These provisions are also available if the landlord employs another body, for example an arm&#146;s-length management organisation, to manage the demolition scheme on his behalf while retaining ownership of the property, but they are not currently available if the landlord sells or transfers the property. Clause 304 and Schedule 12 to the Bill would enable initial or final demolition notices to remain in effect if the landlord sells or transfers the property to another landlord who intends to continue with the demolition plans.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000122"></a>Of course, all the safeguards for tenants that I mentioned earlier will remain in place. This will work as follows. Unless the second landlord serves a continuation notice confirming that he intends to continue with the demolition plans, he will have to  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC512"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC512</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>revoke any demolition notice served by the first landlord. The continuation notice must be justified on one of the same grounds as the original demolition notice, and it must be served and publicised in the same way. It may not vary the planned demolition date or the date on which the original notice will expire. The intention is to enable social landlords to manage demolition and regeneration schemes with flexibility.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000123"></a>I turn now to the amendments. As I said, they are designed to do two things. The purpose of Amendments Nos. 114CG and 114CH is to add further provisions to Schedule 5 to the Housing Act 1985 in order to close a loophole which arises from the combined effect of provisions in Schedules 5 and 5A to that Act. The demolition notices scheme envisages that a landlord may serve an initial demolition notice valid for a maximum of five years, and that while the notice is still valid, it may be replaced by a final demolition notice valid for a maximum of two years, giving the landlord an accumulated maximum of seven years during which the right to buy is either suspended or terminated. As I mentioned earlier, once an initial demolition notice has ceased to be in force, there is a five-year ban on serving either a further initial notice or a final notice, unless of course with the consent of the Secretary of State. The ban is imposed by paragraphs 4(2) and (3) of Schedule 5A, while paragraph 15(8) of Schedule 5 provides that once a demolition notice has ceased to be in force for any reason, no further notice may be served within five years unless, again, with the consent of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000124"></a>However, at present nothing in Schedule 5A prevents a landlord serving an initial demolition notice immediately after a final notice has ceased to be in force. This means that a landlord who wished to do so could in effect prevent or suspend the right to buy for nine years by serving a final demolition notice for the maximum of two years and then shortly afterwards serving an initial demolition notice lasting a further five years, and finally, just before that notice expires, serving another final demolition notice for two years. The effect of the first two amendments before us is to prevent a landlord doing exactly that. This was not the intention of the Government or of Parliament when it passed the 2004 Act, nor is it clear to tenants that this can be done. The aim of the amendments is to improve the transparency of the process.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000125"></a>The third amendment picks up a suggestion made by London Councils, the representative body of London boroughs. It extends the maximum permitted lifetime to an initial demolition notice from the present five years to seven years. We agree with London Councils that the complexity of some regeneration schemes is such that it takes longer than five years to put them in place. However, we also wish to ensure that tenants are not deprived of the right to buy for longer than is necessary. To us, seven years seems reasonable.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08062326000126"></a>These amendments are designed to make existing provisions work more transparently and effectively to the benefit of tenants and landlords alike, and I hope that Members of the Committee will agree to them. I beg to move.</p>

</ul>
<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000007"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 305 amends Section 128 of the Housing Act 1985, introduces new Sections 128A and 128B and makes other consequential amendments to that Act. These changes are designed to make the operation of the right-to-buy valuation procedure more responsive to circumstances. The two amendments that we have tabled are intended to clarify that any fresh determination of value arising from the review procedure introduced by Clause 305 must relate to the date on which the tenant in question applied to exercise his or her right to buy.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000008"></a>The background to Clause 305 and to these amendments is that, at present, wrong valuations based on errors of fact cannot be corrected without court action, which is time-consuming and costly for landlords and tenants alike. Under Section 125 of the Housing Act 1985, when a tenant exercises the right to buy, the landlord must state the price at which it will sell the property to him or her. It must show how it has arrived at that price, which must be based on its assessment of the market value of the property at the time when the tenant applied to exercise the right to buy. If the tenant is dissatisfied with the landlord&#146;s valuation, he may require that the value be determined by a district valuer, an employee of the Valuation Office Agency, a government agency, under Section 128 of the Housing Act 1985. The district valuer&#146;s determination is binding on both sides.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000009"></a>The Valuation Office Agency is concerned that in a few cases every year&#151;usually no more than 10&#151;it is subsequently found that valuations were flawed because of errors of fact. Such errors usually arise because the valuers used a recently sold property for comparison. They do not usually visit that property, but rely on a database. That is where errors can creep in&#151;for example, such a property may be recorded as having two bedrooms when in fact it has three. Both landlord and tenant see all the details on which the district valuer bases the valuation, and one or the other is often able to spot such an error through local knowledge.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000010"></a>Flawed valuations are unfair. If they are too high, the tenant needs an unnecessarily high mortgage or  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC514"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC514</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>may be unable to afford to buy, while valuations that are too low mean that the landlord and the taxpayer receive a lower receipt than is justified. The new sections added to the 1985 Act by Clause 305 will allow district valuers to withdraw determinations of value and make new ones instead if they decide that their original valuation was flawed, acting either on their own initiative or in response to a request from either the landlord or the tenant. This is not a means for the parties simply to continue arguing about the price&#151;only errors of fact that affect the price by at least 5 per cent will be able to trigger a fresh determination&#151;nor will district valuers be able to withdraw a valuation at any time. Clause 305 provides that the landlord or the tenant may ask for a valuation to be withdrawn only within 28 days from notification of the district valuer&#146;s original valuation. The valuer may decide to review his valuation only within 42 days from that original notification. No review can take place if the right-to-buy sale has actually been completed.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000011"></a>The amendments we are looking at today are intended to ensure that if a district valuer reviews a determination of value, he or she revalues the property as it was on the date when the tenant applied for the right to buy. That is in line with the existing provisions that ensure that all right-to-buy valuation issues refer to &#147;the relevant time&#148;&#151;that is, the date of the application.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000012"></a>Clause 305 is intended to allow a right-to-buy valuation by a district valuer to be revised but only if the facts on which it is based are shown to be significantly wrong&#151;and within a reasonable timescale. Now, the only way of doing this is, as I said earlier, via some form of judicial review&#151;an unnecessarily lengthy and costly procedure to correct fact-based errors. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08062331000022"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment was brought to me by Shelter and is supported by Crisis and the Housing Law Practitioners Association. I understand that the Law Commission has also recently expressed concern about the subject. The short point of the amendment is to allow discretion to the court when an application is made for possession on the ground of rent arrears because of delays in housing benefit.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80623-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000023"></a>Ground 8&#151;the ground seeking possession&#151;can be used by private landlords and housing associations in connection with an assured tenancy or an assured shorthold tenancy where a tenant has arrears of more than two months&#146; rent. However, unlike the other rent arrears grounds, ground 8 is mandatory and the court has no discretion to determine whether or not it would be reasonable to make an order for possession.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000024"></a>Ground 8 was originally aimed at stimulating the private rented sector but since 1993 private landlords have been able to gain possession quickly and without a hearing for assured shorthold tenancies. In practice, therefore, they tend to use not ground 8 but the accelerated possession procedure. Therefore, the concern here is primarily with the use of ground 8 by housing associations.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000025"></a>In cases where the tenant&#146;s problem is a delay or some issue relating to the claiming of housing benefit&#151;and those in about 2.5 million social tenancies are claiming housing benefit&#151;clearly they will have problems with debt, of which rent arrears are a major item. Of course, it is understood that there have to be measures to combat fraud&#151;one cannot simply put in a claim for housing benefit and expect to have it paid immediately&#151;but in general terms in social housing the Government have been promoting a preventive and supportive approach, with possession action being taken only as a last resort. In Scotland, the Scottish Executive has introduced measures to prevent eviction of tenants for rent arrears caused by housing benefit problems. So that can be done.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000026"></a>I was taken by the description of the situation by the right honourable Member for Greenwich, Nick Raynsford, when the matter was discussed in the Commons, who talked about the fundamental objectives of the regulator, one of which is to ensure that tenants  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC516"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC516</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or potential tenants have an appropriate degree of choice and protection. Ground 8 seems to go very much against that.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000027"></a>I understand that there have been discussions since then with Shelter and that the Government have asked the Housing Corporation to undertake research into how, why and when ground 8 is used. I hope that the Minister can confirm that and explain, given the transition to a new agency, what will happen with this research. It would be good to have on the record as much explanation of what is being undertaken by the Government as they are able to give.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000028"></a>I was shocked when I understood that there is a mandatory provision for a landlord to claim possession and I had intended to use an example used by Sir George Young in the Commons. I shall not repeat the details, but I will refer, as he did, to Lord Justice Dyson in the Court of Appeal, who said that the statutory scheme is potentially draconian in its application. I look forward to hearing from the Minister. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08062331000029"></a><a name="80623-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80623-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08062331000084"></a>Lord Best:</b> I have sympathy with the amendment. It cannot be right that tenants could lose their home because the local authority has failed to pay housing benefit on their behalf. That seems utterly unfair. Housing associations have served notice using this ground 8 often because, unless they do so, the local authority has not come up with the housing benefit money. Very long delays in the payment of housing benefit have meant that housing associations have used these grounds, not always with any great intention of following them through. This cannot be the way to proceed. It must be right that local authorities pay much more promptly, so that we do not get into this mess. Having this power in the Bill is an offence against justice.</p>

<p><a name="08062331000030"></a><a name="80623-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80623-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08062331000085"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> This is indeed an important issue and I shall update the Committee on where the Government are. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for moving the amendment, which would have two effects. First, it would prevent registered providers of social housing from using ground 8; secondly, it would prevent the court granting possession under ground 8 to any landlord if any of the rent arrears was due to a delay or failure to pay housing benefit, unless the court considered it reasonable to do so. The amendment specifies that this would apply only where the delay or failure to pay housing benefit was not due to a wilful act or omission on the part of the tenant&#151;which would obviously be right.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000031"></a>The noble Baroness expressed a range of concerns about ground 8. They are familiar and are well authenticated in terms of the groups and bodies working in the field. As the noble Baroness pointed out, similar views were expressed in the other place during earlier stages of the Bill. We recognise those concerns and the noble Lord, Lord Best, was absolutely right&#151;serving notice in such circumstances is an affront to justice. We are eager to find a way to address those concerns.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000032"></a>In April, therefore, following the debate in the other place, we established a stakeholder working group to consider the concerns about ground 8 in more detail,  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC517"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC517</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>so I can confirm that that has happened. It is required to report back to Ministers in the summer. The groups on it include Shelter, Citizens Advice and the Charted Institute of Housing, which are all familiar at first-hand with the matter, and we appreciate the constructive contribution that they are making.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000033"></a>On the wider point, we have seen some improvements on housing benefit performance. Between 2002-03 and 2007-08, the average time taken to process a new claim for housing benefit or council tax benefit fell from 55 to 28 days. It is still not very good, but it is half what it was. The latest figures for the second half of 2007-08 suggest that the improvements continue: it is now, on average, 26 days. I do not defend that, but considering where we were, it is an improvement.</p>
<h5><a name="08062331000079"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000034"></a>To return to the burden of the amendment, I fully appreciate the point that the noble Baroness is making, but I suggest that it would be preferable to let the working group complete its work before we change the law in the Bill as she proposes. A lot of work is still to be done. The working group agrees unanimously that there is a lack of systematic evidence about the use of ground 8 by housing associations. A wealth of evidence can no doubt be collated&#151;the term &#147;anecdotal evidence&#148; sounds pejorative but it is not meant to be&#151;but we need a proper evidence base for this.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000035"></a>Given the range of stakeholder views on the subject, it is important that any changes to legislation&#151;which would be profound&#151;are made on a full understanding of current practice and the effects that those changes would have. In order to address that evidence gap, the Housing Corporation will be undertaking research into housing associations&#146; rent arrears management practice, including their use of ground 8. That will be presented to the working group for its consideration in due course.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000036"></a>I now turn to a few of the specific points that the noble Baroness raised. I clearly have sympathy with her concerns, because ground 8 has given rise to some very hard cases. That is one of the principal reasons why we have brought those people together: to try to assemble the evidence and find a proper way forward.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000037"></a>It is also important to have in mind the scale of this issue. Citizens Advice commissioned a report recently that acknowledged that only a small minority of RSLs use ground 8. The broader context is extremely positive. The overall rate of evictions in the RSL sector remains low, at 0.6 per cent of stock. The total number of evictions carried out by RSLs has fallen over recent years, despite the growth of the sector. So we are looking at better, more careful practice. According to Housing Corporation figures, the total number of evictions carried out by RSLs fell by nearly 15 per cent between 2004-05 and 2006-07; and RSL evictions related to rent arrears declined by more than 17 per cent during the same period.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000038"></a>That reflects excellent work by the RSLs to improve how they manage rent arrears. Together with a number of reforms that we and the Housing Corporation have put in place, that is creating a much more positive and productive climate, a much more holistic approach to  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC518"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC518</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>dealing with tenant circumstances when rent arrears arise and more proactive working between the RSLs and the local authorities.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000039"></a>The noble Baroness referred to this being a last resort. Let me briefly expand on that for the record, because it is important to explain how we have arrived at our position. The Housing Corporation made clear that eviction should only be used by RSLs as a last resort in rent arrears cases&#151;particularly where those arrears have arisen as a result of delays in housing benefit payments. That was reflected in the review of the Housing Corporation&#146;s regulatory code and guidance in August 2005. The Government published good practice guidance in June 2005 on improving the effectiveness of rent arrears management, which included advice and best practice on early intervention policies and proactive approaches.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000040"></a>In 2007 the Housing Corporation issued housing management guidance stating that possession proceedings for rent arrears should not be started against tenants who can demonstrate that they have a reasonable expectation of eligibility for housing benefit, have provided the local authority with all the evidence required to process a housing benefit claim and paid required personal contributions towards the charge. A pre-action protocol for rent arrears was also established as part of the civil procedure rules with the aim of ensuring that eviction is the last resort for all landlords in rent arrears cases. So we have a combination of agency which is very productive. Nevertheless, the noble Baroness is absolutely right, as are the agencies, that there are concerns about the actions of a small minority of RSLs who might not be following the guidance. We are keen to ensure that these concerns are resolved, whether through legislation or regulation. That is one of the reasons we have established the group.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000041"></a>The noble Baroness argued that it is wrong in principle that the court cannot take the tenant&#146;s wider circumstances into account in ground 8 cases and I understand that argument. But, again, the regulatory guidance exists to ensure that ground 8 is used only as a last resort. It puts the onus on the RSL to ensure that wider issues that might affect the rent arrears, such as housing benefit problems, are resolved before seeking eviction.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000042"></a>There is a more subtle point about current practice. I understand that some of the RSLs that use ground 8 do so precisely in order to resolve their rent arrears problems. If those RSLs had to rely on discretionary grounds alone, they might seek proceedings for possession much earlier to prevent the level of rent arrears from becoming unmanageable. I understand the process tends to take longer when you use discretionary grounds and that the final outcome is much less certain. By contrast, the mandatory nature of ground 8 gives the RSLs greater confidence to hold back formal proceedings until as late as possible in order that they may spend time working with tenants and trying to resolve the problem. I am not necessarily endorsing that approach. My only point is that the noble Baroness rightly argues that the certainty associated with ground 8 is  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC519"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC519</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>injurious to the interests of tenants while others argue that that certainty can be used creatively in order to arrive at a better position.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000043"></a>I also understand that some RSLs use ground 8 only when tenants are unwilling to engage with them on a rent arrears problem. In such cases I have some sympathy with the RSLs, particularly the smaller ones, because of the threat that poses for their viability. I do not want that to be seen as a staunch defence of the status quo because I am not defending it. We would not have set up the stakeholder group otherwise.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000044"></a>My purpose is to illustrate that this issue is very complex. So, before we rush to a legislative solution, we should allow the working group to continue with its thorough work, including the research exercise to which I referred earlier. The noble Baroness asked me how that now links in with the regulator. That information will be passed on to the regulator in the context of his work in setting standards and so on. The regulator will have a statutory objective to ensure that tenants have choice and protection and I see it fitting squarely into that. It will be a matter for the regulator to determine in consultation with representatives of registered providers and social housing tenants. We have got somewhere to go with that and I look forward to seeing the group&#146;s report and recommendations, and to following through on them.</p>

<p><a name="08062331000045"></a><a name="80623-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80623-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08062331000086"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Best, for filling in the many gaps that I left. Of course some local authorities should certainly do better with housing benefit administration but the problem in this instance is that it is the tenants who suffer. The noble Baroness quite rightly balanced her response by referring to the position of the RSL, and I understand that. My amendment seeks to give the court discretion, which should be a protection for the RSL.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000046"></a>I shall, of course, withdraw the amendment. I am glad to hear about the stakeholder group. I will make the point that a regulatory approach cannot be enforced unless it is so extreme that standards are breached under the new regime. It is unlikely, however, that that would come about.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000047"></a>This needs primary legislation. I hope that when the stakeholder group has done its work&#151;assuming that the outcome is acceptance by the Government that there needs to be a change; after all, this has not just come up out of the blue&#151;I hope there will be an opportunity for that legislation. I do not see that it could be done other than through primary legislation. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC520"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC520</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>court has said that the rules committee at the High Court&#151;or maybe the county court&#151;should look at this, but that has not happened. This is to bring a little pressure. The point of the amendment is to align county court procedure with High Court procedure. The clause deals with the manner in which an order for possession is enforced.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000051"></a>The bulk of orders where there are arrears of rent or of mortgage are suspended or postponed on terms that provide that the order is not enforceable so long as the occupier complies with certain conditions, which often would be to pay mortgage instalments or comply with other tenancy conditions. A lender or a landlord that wants to enforce an unconditional or a postponed order can obtain a bailiff&#146;s warrant for eviction in the county court simply by completing a form, so it is merely an administrative matter. That may mean that the order is enforced without notice to the occupier and without the lender, in the case of a mortgage or the landlord, ever actually having to give them notice of the breach. The practice in the High Court has been that the party seeking to enforce a possession order has to apply for permission. The amendment&#151;as I say, it may seem odd to put it into primary legislation, but this is our opportunity to raise the issue&#151;would align procedures across the courts. I beg to move.</p>

I understand where the amendment has come from, because of the concerns that have been raised by the Housing Law Practitioners Association. As the noble Baroness demonstrated, the key point is that different procedures apply in county courts and the High Court where a landlord seeks to enforce a possession order by asking the court to issue a warrant of possession.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08062331000053"></a>This may seem a simple matter to address, but is actually much more complex and involved. What would happen as a result of the amendment is that all warrants of possession would require the court&#146;s permission before issue. That would have a wide and significant effect on all possession cases, not just social housing cases. The noble Baroness has provoked us into taking some interest in this, however, so it was worth doing. If she can allow us more time to look in a bit more detail at the issues and implications that have been raised, I am happy to return to the matter on Report. I hope that will make her feel better.</p>

Because they are very complex, I should have preferred to have given notice of them and to have sent a copy, together with some notes, to noble Lords, but I was not able to do so.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000004"></a>I thank the JCR for its work on this complex issue and I also thank the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, for bringing forward her amendment, as it enables me to put on the record what we are doing and why. If she will allow me, I shall address her amendment in the context of my amendments, because it does not make sense to separate them. That will allow me to explain why we prefer the solution that we have arrived at.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000005"></a>The amendments tabled in my name make changes to homelessness legislation across the UK. Their principal purpose is to remedy Section 185(4) of the Housing Act 1996, which applies to England and Wales and which has been declared incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights by the UK courts. They also amend Section 119(1) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, which makes similar provision in respect of Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000006"></a>This is a complex area of law. In summary, the issue at stake is what help British citizens whose household includes members with different immigration status should get if they become homeless. We do not have specific numbers available but the information that we have shows that we are talking about a very small number of people. The amendments will ensure that households in these circumstances are provided with suitable housing, while continuing to ensure that people from abroad with no claim to UK public resources cannot be conferred with entitlement to social housing.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000007"></a>The amendments amend the Housing Act 1996 and the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, together with other provisions, so that the requirement that local housing authorities in England, Wales and Scotland and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive disregard, or do not take into account, ineligible household members, including dependent children, when considering whether an eligible housing applicant is homeless or has a priority need for accommodation will no longer apply in respect of eligible applicants who are British citizens, EEA nationals or Commonwealth citizens with a right of abode in the UK.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000008"></a>However, in these cases, where an eligible applicant who is a British citizen, an EEA national or a Commonwealth citizen with a right of abode in the UK is owed a main homelessness duty only because homelessness or priority need is conveyed on him by an ineligible member of his household who requires leave to stay and does not have it, or who has leave, but with a condition of &#147;no recourse to public funds&#148;&#151;referred to in the amendments as &#147;restricted persons&#148;&#151;then the local authority will be required, so far as practicable, to discharge the homelessness duty by arranging an offer of accommodation in the private rented sector. That is new.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>

I know that this is complex, so I shall try to explain the background in a way that will be perfectly clear to noble Lords.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000010"></a>We have taken some time to bring these amendments forward, for which I apologise, but the delay has been due to the very difficult policy issues raised by the declaration. They are difficult because they bear on the interface between immigration policy and the provision of social welfare assistance. Although we are absolutely committed to remedying legislation as quickly as possible, we also have a duty to maintain a strong and fair immigration policy.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000011"></a>Perhaps I may summarise the background to the amendments and then go on to explain their effect and provide a more detailed explanation of how they will operate. I shall be very happy to write to any noble Lords, providing my full speaking notes with footnotes, if that would be helpful.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0004.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000012"></a>In setting the context for the amendments, perhaps I may say a word about the framework of homelessness legislation and what we mean by the &#147;main homelessness duty&#148;. When families with children and people who are vulnerable become homeless through no fault of their own, local authorities must secure housing for them, provided that they are eligible for assistance. Eligibility is determined by the immigration status of the applicants. For example, all British citizens settled and habitually resident here are eligible to be considered for homelessness assistance, but whether they have any entitlement to that will obviously depend on their circumstances. Applicants have an entitlement to the homelessness duty when three key criteria are met: first, that they are eligible; secondly, that they are homeless through no fault of their own; and, thirdly, that they have a priority need for accommodation&#151;for example, because they have dependent children or are vulnerable.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80623-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000013"></a>Under the legislation, there is a critical difference between eligibility and entitlement. It can be confusing, but being eligible for homelessness assistance does not mean necessarily that someone is entitled to be assisted. For example, Members of the Committee are almost certainly eligible for assistance, but I think it is unlikely that we would meet the statutory criteria for help and we would not be entitled to it. I could be wrong, but I am making that assumption.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000014"></a>Entitlement for homelessness assistance, therefore, depends crucially upon whether the applicant has a priority need. It is significant that in around 70 per cent of homelessness acceptances in England, the household includes a dependent child or spouse, and priority of need is conveyed on the individual applicant because of this family factor. The family circumstances convey the priority need and therefore the entitlement to help. I am labouring the point because it is critical to the debate and central to the declaration of incompatibility that we are seeking to remedy.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000015"></a>There are people who are not eligible for homelessness assistance. The main category of people not eligible is those subject to immigration control, usually nationals of countries outside the European Economic Area.  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC523"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC523</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>People subject to immigration control become eligible only if they are granted a form of leave which allows recourse to public funds. The people in this category clearly have refugee status or humanitarian protection. Illegal immigrants, people who require leave to remain in the UK and do not have it&#151;for example, someone who has evaded immigration control on arrival or overstayed a period of limited leave&#151;are not eligible for homelessness assistance. In that way, the rules on eligibility have given effect to a fair immigration policy and legislation.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000016"></a>Given how entitlement to homelessness assistance works, the issue at stake is: what should happen if the applicant is eligible for assistance but the dependent child or pregnant partner is not, even if under other circumstances the dependent child would confer entitlement to assistance? The present law states under Section 185(4) of the 1996 Act and Section 119(1) of the 1999 Act that the whole family is currently denied housing assistance because household members who are not eligible cannot be taken into account when deciding if an applicant is homeless or in priority need. In 2005-06, the court ruled that the application of that section to British citizenship applicants is incompatible with human rights legislation because it discriminates against the British citizens who are affected&#151;that is to say, it denies them the help that other British citizens who are not affected will get&#151;and the discrimination is not justified.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000017"></a>In a case that illustrates this&#151;Morris v Westminster City Council&#151;the dependent who was disregarded was a young child; in another, Gabaj v Bristol City Council, the dependent was a pregnant spouse. In both cases, the applicant for homelessness assistance was an eligible British citizen. We have acknowledged the court&#146;s declarations in these cases and we are now bringing forward the necessary changes in these amendments to ensure that such British citizens and their families who are currently not getting help will be entitled to accommodation.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000018"></a>The effect of the amendments is that Sections 185(4) and 119(1) will no longer apply to applicants who are British citizens. Nor will they apply to applicants with specific rights to live in the UK&#151;for example, Commonwealth citizens with a right to abode or with an EU treaty right to reside. That means that such applicants will, from now on, be owed a duty to have accommodation secured for them, provided that they meet all the normal entitlement criteria, even if their application relies on a dependent who is ineligible.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000019"></a>When Ms Morris and her daughter came to the UK as visitors, both were subject to immigration control. She was entitled to British citizenship by descent, but her daughter was not. She applied for homelessness assistance while her daughter&#146;s application for citizenship was still pending. She was unable to rely on her daughter to convey priority need because the daughter was still subject to immigration control and had overstayed her visitor&#146;s leave. Ms Morris was therefore not entitled to accommodation. Under these amendments, she would be.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000020"></a>However, while the Government recognise that applicants with specific rights to live in the UK must not be denied homelessness assistance, we remain  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC524"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC524</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>concerned that dependants and other household members who are ineligible because they are here illegally or on condition that they will have &#147;no recourse to public funds&#148; should not be able to confer priority or entitlement for long-term social housing. The amendments refer to these dependants and household members as &#147;restricted persons&#148;. As I have said, these persons include two categories of ineligible people: first, those who have leave to stay but only on condition of &#147;no recourse to public funds&#148;, and those who require leave to stay but do not have it. The latter will include illegal entrants, asylum seekers, failed asylum seekers and people who entered the UK on a visitor&#146;s visa and have overstayed.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000021"></a>The effect of the amendments is therefore that where a homelessness duty is owed in a restricted case&#151;that is, where the applicant is owed the duty only through reliance on a restricted person&#151;then, so far as possible, the duty must be discharged by arranging an offer of accommodation in the private rented sector. This housing will need to be made available for at least 12 months and must be suitable for the applicant. It will also need to be reasonable for the applicant to accept the offer. If for any reason the local authority, or the Housing Executive in Northern Ireland, is unable to arrange a suitable private sector offer, it would be open to the authority to bring the duty to an end with an offer of social housing.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000022"></a>The amendments also provide that the preference or priority for an allocation of social housing normally awarded to someone owed the homelessness duty will be withheld. The amendments will not apply to applicants who are eligible for homelessness assistance but are subject to immigration control; that is, for example, someone granted refugee status, humanitarian protection or discretionary leave and who has recourse to public funds. The current restrictions in Sections 185(4) and 119(1) will continue to apply to these applicants. As now, they will not be able to rely on any ineligible household members to confer priority need or homelessness. The Government consider that this difference in treatment is justified because people subject to immigration control who are eligible for housing do not have an unqualified right to be in the UK, only permission, and their claim to homelessness assistance should not be capable of relying on someone else who has no claim to it at all. We have to bear in mind that social housing is a very scarce and expensive resource.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000023"></a>To sum up, while we accept that British citizens and others with an absolute right to be here must be provided with some form of housing assistance if they become homeless through no fault of their own and are relying on a restricted person to convey homelessness or priority need, we do not consider that that assistance should convey priority for social housing. The important point is that they will not be left homeless, as they could be under the current provisions. They will have access to private provision. I hope noble Lords will agree that these amendments, complex though they are, remedy the current incompatibility and set a fair balance between the interests of UK taxpayers and the rights of migrants who come to the country with no claim to public funds.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000024"></a>I turn briefly to the amendment tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, who is not in his place, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. It seeks to remedy the same incompatibility as the amendments in my name. While the simplicity of the amendment may be attractive, the implication is not, because it would be extended to everyone and allow restricted persons to convey priority and in some cases entitlement for long-term social housing. That cannot be right. As I have said, social housing is a scarce and expensive public resource.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000025"></a>I am grateful for the patience of the Committee, but before I conclude let me add that the Government intend to open discussions with local authorities to explore how they can in future collect and share data with the UK Border Agency to identify housing applicants whose household includes a person who requires leave to be in the UK but does not have it. This will discourage applications from households with family members who are here illegally and it will assist the UK Border Agency in the enforcement of a fair and firm immigration policy.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000026"></a>Again, I am sorry that I was not able to give noble Lords advance word about these amendments, and I am sure that they will want to read <I>Hansard </I>on them.

I wonder, though, since this is a matter that the Joint Committee on Human Rights asked to be remedied by the Bill, whether there would be an opportunity&#151;I have no idea what the committee&#146;s timetable is; had the noble Earl been here, he might have been able to tell us&#151;to consider the amendments before the Bill comes to an end.

</ul>&#147;(e) a person without dependent children who has been subject to domestic violence, is at risk of such violence or, if he or she were to return home, would be at risk of domestic violence.&#148;&#148;
<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000033"></a>The noble Baroness said: An amendment of a similar form to Amendment No. 115B was moved in the Commons. I have tabled it again in the hope of some up-to-date news from the Government on the issue. The amendment would enable a person&#151;often a woman, but not necessarily&#151;who is experiencing domestic violence not to have to choose between staying in a violent relationship on the one hand or homelessness&#151;or even, at worst, rooflessness&#151;on the other, by giving priority need to a person who has been subject to domestic violence, or is at risk of it, but who does not have dependent children. Perhaps I should declare an interest&#151;not a current interest, but one that is very much in my heart. For many years I was a member of the board of Refuge, the domestic violence agency, and chaired it for some time.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000034"></a>The current law provides for a person who is vulnerable as a result of ceasing to occupy accommodation by reason of violence. The definition of &#147;vulnerability&#148; in this context is whether the person is less able to fend for himself than an ordinary homeless person. I have selected some words from the briefing I have been sent, without intending to distort the meaning.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000035"></a>It is almost impossible at the moment to ensure consistency in decision-making, whether between different kinds of cases or different authorities. The concept of vulnerability, although it is intended to be applied as an absolute test, tends to be applied, I understand, in a way that is resource-driven; it is regarded as a matter of degree.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000036"></a>Domestic violence is often hidden. The victim may not have spoken to anyone about it. I accept that that in itself could mean that applying provisions such as this could be difficult. Giving evidence is a difficult matter, but there has been a change in Wales; if the Welsh can do it, the English should be able to.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000037"></a>At Third Reading in the Commons, the Minister, fulfilling the commitment in Committee that he would consider the matter, said that the Government are working on a review on the subject. I therefore hope that the Minister can today give us some news of what is going on in that connection.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000038"></a>I do not want to take the Committee's time by describing either the extent of domestic violence or the effects on individuals, because I am sure that everyone in this Room will understand without it having to be spelt out in great detail. I beg to move.</p>

The answer is: it is not there. Last year, there were about 1.7 million applications for affordable housing. At Second Reading, I said that I thought that the figure would be nearer 2 million; I think that the National Housing Association about a week or two ago said that it would be somewhere over 2 million.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000041"></a>What happens with prioritisation is a leapfrogging effect. Some people get housed because they tick the boxes; if you do not tick the boxes, you do not get housed; end of story. The problem is that we are just not building affordable housing. From those people who are told, &#147;You are not going to get housing for five or 10 years&#148;, there is resentment. They are living in their communities and they find themselves needing a house but they find housing being given to other people coming into their communities while they are not being given a house. That is not being addressed at all. Okay, prioritisation maybe one thing, but a huge number of people want to stay in their communities but cannot.</p>

I could not agree more with the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart. We were taken back to the beginning of the Bill by what he said about the need for affordable homes, the investment that is needed and the effort that must be made to achieve those ambitions, particularly for vulnerable people&#151;and we have discussed many different sorts of vulnerability during this Committee. It is important that the context has been framed for us.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000045"></a>The issue of domestic violence is extremely serious. As the noble Baroness explained, the principal purpose of the amendment is to bring those who have been subject to domestic violence, or who are at risk of such violence, within the category of persons who will be given priority need under the homelessness legislation.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000046"></a>I take my cue from the noble Baroness. She said that she did not think it was necessary to go into the detail of what we mean by domestic violence or its impact on people, their families and the whole community. As I said, the Government take the issue extremely seriously. It is a pernicious and prevalent crime that has devastating personal consequences, and it crosses classes and cultures. It has a major impact on our national economy and the health of our society, as well as on the criminal justice system and statutory services. Domestic violence will affect one in four women and one in six men. On average, two women are killed every week by a current or former male partner. Those statistics are extraordinary. Domestic violence is rarely a one-off incident. More often, it is part of a pattern of abusive and controlling behaviour, which is pathological.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000047"></a>That is why we are absolutely committed to tackling this nasty, and depressingly prevalent, crime, and we work on many fronts to do that. For example, recent  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC528"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC528</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>investment in specialist domestic violence courts has been very successful. Outcomes have shown that domestic violence prosecutions rose from 46 per cent in December 2003 to 67 per cent in June 2006. There is a growing culture of intolerance and a feeling that people should not get away with it. I am sure that noble Lords are familiar with the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, which included a number of new powers and amendments. My department takes domestic violence extremely seriously; in particular, there is a need to ensure that victims of violence get the help and support that they need.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000048"></a>Under current legislation, people who do not have dependent children will have priority need if they are vulnerable as a result of having to leave their home because of violence&#151;not just domestic violence&#151;from another person or because of threats of such violence which are likely to be carried out. Thus, if they have suffered domestic violence, they will already have priority need under this broader violence category. The principle of linking priority need to vulnerability is central to the homelessness legislation and the premise that it is only homeless people with a priority need for whom the local authority should have an obligation to secure accommodation. Other examples of such people include those who are vulnerable as a result of old age or mental disability, and those aged 21 years or over who are vulnerable as a result of having been in care and so on.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000049"></a>I cannot stress enough how seriously we take this matter, but we are also aware of a concern that, despite the robust systems in place, in practice not all vulnerable people who have had to leave their homes because of violence may be accepted as being owed the main homelessness duty. Reflecting other debates that we have had this afternoon, we need certain evidence of that so as to be able to make a policy change, because that change would be very wide in its effect. At the moment, we do not have the necessary evidence to make a proper evaluation of the issue. The noble Baroness has already referred to what happened following the debate on a similar amendment in the other place: my colleague Iain Wright committed to an in-depth review to assess in more detail the likely impact, cost and realistic timeframe for implementation and to assess whether other ways of meeting the housing needs of this group could be effective in the context of broader housing reform. The principal aim of that review will be to provide a sound basis for the Government to consider what changes, if any, need to be made to ensure that no one is expected to return to accommodation where they would be at risk of violence. It is a broader issue and we need to look creatively and thoroughly at the options that we have.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000050"></a>The noble Baroness asked me where we are with that. Arrangements for commissioning the review are currently under way and I shall be happy to keep her closely informed with more details once the work is more advanced. I cannot add more to that at the moment and I hope that it will be sufficient for now. I reiterate the commitment we have to putting an end as best we can to this abhorrent behaviour.</p>

To answer the point made by the noble Earl and the noble Baroness, of course I appreciate the demands on social housing and that not everyone can be a priority. However, the amendment would have the benefit of freeing-up refuge places. Some problems occur&#151;I do not want to refer to &#147;silting up&#148;, which sounds so impersonal and unkind&#151;that are caused by people not being able to move on because they do not have accommodation to go to. Of course, if they were able to move on, that would help others in turn. So there is an answer to the point, which might not be the case with other currently non-priority groups.</p>

<p><a name="08062340000058"></a>The noble Baroness said: Although I am a vice-chair of the All-Party Group on Gypsies and Travellers, it is fair to say that the amendment is in the interests of all mobile home dwellers. The new clause seeks to amend the Mobile Homes Act 1983 to remedy a clear discrimination against all tenants of mobile home sites, whether Gypsy, Traveller or any other caravan dweller. All other tenants have the right ultimately to go to the courts to seek redress if there is a dispute with the landlord. Only mobile home park tenants have to put up with the site owners&#146; choice of arbitrator. The most welcome extension of security of tenure to Gypsy and Traveller residents of such sites, on which I congratulate my noble friend, nevertheless brought them to share this unjust situation with other mobile home residents.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000059"></a>The amendments are supported by the Traveller Law Reform Project and meet concerns expressed many times by groups representing mobile home residents. The concern is, briefly, that technically, under the  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC530"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC530</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>present Section 4 of the Mobile Homes Act 1983, read with Section 5(1)(a), a &#147;court&#148; can be defined as &#147;arbitrator&#148; if there is an arbitration clause in the site tenancy agreement. The terms of such agreement are proposed by the landlord and, indeed, usually follow the national model form. Such agreements are very likely to be signed or marked by a Gypsy or a Traveller without their being fully aware of the implications. I do not need to explain to the Committee that the landlord&#146;s choice of arbitrator is not quite justice being seen to be done. In this country we have the courts as a last resort, not someone paid by one of the parties.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000060"></a>It is a matter of straightforward justice to incorporate these amendments in the Bill. They do not, of course, preclude alternative dispute resolution. The new civil procedure rules of 1998 make it quite clear that the court must actively manage the case by,</p>
<ul><a name="08062340000090"></a>&#147;encouraging the parties to use an alternative dispute resolution procedure if the court considers that appropriate and facilitating the use of such procedure&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08062340000073"></a>The amendments provide only that, like everyone else, mobile home tenants can have recourse to the courts if all else fails. I hope that my noble friend will respect the wide support that the amendments have, and will accommodate them.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000061"></a>Recently the Department for Communities and Local Government published a consultation document on a new approach for resolving the disputes of mobile home tenants, no doubt aware of the unsatisfactory nature of the whole regime. The document recommends putting such disputes within the framework of the residential property tribunals. In theory, tribunals are an economical and accessible form of justice, in that lawyers are not required and the panoply of the judges&#146; courts can be dispensed with. That is the theory and it is attractive, but I have sat on tribunals and the fact is that at least one of the parties will be legally represented if they can afford it, which already creates an imbalance of expertise. Tribunals can be very drawn out, being much closer in nature to an inquisitorial process. The experience and the briskness of a judge have considerable advantages when we are dealing with a court of last instance and all other recourse has been tried. Although I commend the department&#146;s recognition that the present system is not right, our solution has much more to be said for it. I beg to move.</p>

As the noble Baroness has explained, that applies not only to the Gypsies and Travellers, who come under these provisions for the first time&#151;and I welcome that as a member of the all-party group&#151;but to all residents of mobile homes.

I sincerely hope that the Government will listen carefully to what the noble Baroness has said and come up with either a solution that meets this particular need or something that restores the jurisdiction of the court over all these cases.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000063"></a>I take this opportunity to refer to the situation in Hackney, where, as the Minister may know, Gypsies and Travellers have had some problems because they were displaced from the site they occupied for the needs of the Olympic Games. For a long time there was no proper solution to the question of where they should go. Now there are alternative sites, but another problem has arisen: the people have moved on to sites that are governed under different provisions. Some of them are in bungalows that in Ireland are called &#147;group housing&#148;, where they have facilities for caravans next to the buildings and are no different from anyone else who wants to live in a house or bungalow. I invite the noble Lord to consider whether, even within one borough, it is a satisfactory outcome of the move of the Gypsies and Travellers from the sites they formerly occupied that they will come under different regimes according to the type of dwelling where they live. That may be a subject that we should come back to on another occasion rather than under the clause, but as the issue has been raised with me by the organisation representing Gypsies and Travellers in Hackney, I thought I would take the opportunity of mentioning it. However, I warmly support the noble Baroness in her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08062340000064"></a><a name="80623-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80623-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08062340000109"></a>Lord Best:</b> I, too, have added my name in support of this amendment. The occupiers of all other homes have recourse to the courts and most also have access to an independent arbitration scheme to sort out disputes with their landlord or superior owner. The tenants of mobile homes on sites must be unique both in having arbitration scheme based on the landlord deciding on who the arbitrator shall be and in not having any recourse to the courts if they are dissatisfied at the end of the process. The Housing Ombudsman is there for disputes involving housing association and social housing tenants, and indeed for some private landlords&#146; tenants. I hope that, in the review by Sir Bryan Carsberg that came out last week, we shall see similar redress and ombudsman services extended to the tenants of private landlords. People who buy their own homes will have access to the redress and ombudsman scheme that will become compulsory later in the year under the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007. However, in all these cases people also have recourse to the courts if dissatisfied with the arbitration proceedings. It is strange that this one group is denied protection either by the independent arbitration system or recourse to the courts. I hope that the Minister will be able to give me some reassurance that this position will change.</p>

But the Committee should be under no illusion that while for us it is an academic exercise and a political discussion, the people involved are sometimes subject to a reign of terror. Their lives are made thankless, so the problem is real and in earnest. Since last September, I have received 125 letters from residents in mobile homes, all of which I have sent on to the Department for Communities and Local Government; the latest batch went off only last week. I have done that because it is ultimately the department that these people have to rely on.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000066"></a>Members of the Committee know the situation. It might be thought that people enjoyed the protection of the local council, along with the protection offered by environmental health officers. One would have thought there would be the aid of councillors, Members of Parliament, and advice from the BH&amp;HPA, the NCC and various others. At the end of the day, when there is a serious dispute, very often the elderly, frail or disabled person, who has moved to a mobile home for the last period of their life, is told, &#147;Well, if you are not satisfied you can go to court&#148;.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000067"></a>I received a letter this morning in which the Committee will be interested. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08062340000088"></a>&#147;Going to court could cost &#163;20,000&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062340000074"></a>so it could cost an ordinary person &#163;20,000&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08062340000091"></a>&#147;and of course is risky, so it is not something to take on lightly. However my feelings are very strong on this matter. Especially that this could have been resolved much sooner, had the PO&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08062340000075"></a>the park owner&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08062340000092"></a>&#147;followed the code of practice and initiated arbitration. However, if I prove breach of contract, this of course would have huge implications for all those on the park. In essence it would mean you would have a clearer right to compensation, and possibly the retraction of unfair rules&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000068"></a>The letter continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08062340000089"></a>&#147;We have a right to enjoy the holiday park and caravan that we pay nearly &#163;3,000 for every year&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062340000076"></a>I presume that that is the pitch fee.</p>
<ul><a name="08062340000093"></a>&#147;The definition of a holiday is &#145;Leisure time away from work; devoted to rest or pleasure&#146;. Where is our rest and pleasure? When rules are imposed ad hoc, and we are caused greater inconvenience or even loss of facilities. NO! this is definitely not restful and pleasurable experience. Quite the contrary. PO management methods have caused distress, anxiety and alarm. If he feels that he can get away with his behaviour, unchallenged, then what are we to expect next year?&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000069"></a>Many of the illustrations that I have received&#151;there are no details&#151;show that the names of some unscrupulous park owners are as well known inside the department as outside it. Some of them know what the law is, blatantly disregard it and ignore the claims made by councils and so on. They are very defiant. The Minister has seriously to consider&#151;but not in this debate&#151;when these unscrupulous site owners are to be taken on. They are laughing.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000070"></a>I have had letters from people who say that they do not think much of the arbitration route because the uneducated and the distressed&#151;the people with a good case&#151;will stand on one side of the court and the owner will be represented by a brief, someone who receives thousands of pounds as a daily fee. As my noble friend Lady Whitaker pointed out, the idea that this is an informal process whereby disputes can be

These people who are acting criminally by terrorising their parks are quite prepared to spend a lot of money because a lot of money is at stake.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000071"></a>I have got no answer as to whether the amendment will be a better way of solving the problem. I am grateful to the Minister and the Ministry for having gone as far as they have. We are in a period of consultation. The stakeholders, in particular, have a responsibility not only to come up with a solution but with the evidence for their solution so that the department can give it serious consideration. I hope that the very least that the Minister will tell my noble friend today is not only that she has been heard but that her points have been taken on board and will be taken into consideration with other aspects. I will say to my all-party group&#151;I declare an interest as the secretary&#151;that the tide has turned and the department, after a long period of cogitation on these matters, is now becoming more militant than it ever was before. However, there is much more work to be done&#151;we are never going to be, satisfied&#151;and these villains will always be there. In my view, there are people who should now be in prison awaiting trial. In one case, when the owner did not get his own way, he simply set fire to caravans with people inside them. The case is well known to some Members of the Committee. There are some terrible people about; I do not know the numbers but their names come up time and time again. Bear in mind that we are not talking just about a site owner; it is someone who owns 30 or 40 sites. The villains are making a business out of this, and they are quite unscrupulous.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08062340000072"></a>I have got that off my chest. I support the amendment, of course I do, and I know that the Minister and her colleagues understand full well what we are getting at. There are literally thousands of people out there&#151;thousands out of more than 200,000, that is; I am not talking about a majority, or even a sizeable number, but there are many&#151;who thought that they were buying themselves a little bit of paradise, only to find that unfortunately that was not the case, partly due to their not reading the rules and not understanding the situation, but mainly due to villains taking them for a ride.

Acceptance of the amendment or something very like it would be helpful in addressing those concerns, as it would mean that all such site residents could always take a dispute with their site owner to the county court, should they need to. I suggest that that is preferable to another option that I understand is being proposed in the consultation document produced by the Department for Communities and Local Government: that tenants of mobile parks should have their disputes taken to residential property tribunals. Referral of disputes to such a tribunal may well be an improvement over compulsory arbitration  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC534"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC534</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by an arbitrator chosen by the site owner, although I recognise that a particular arbitrator may, in a particular case, make a fair judgment. However, for the majority of site residents that proposal could well be very detrimental.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000003"></a>It must be wrong to force residents to argue their own case on complex matters of law before a formal tribunal without the benefit of representation unless they pay for it themselves. My understanding is that legal aid is not available for tribunals. I also believe that DCLG is wrong to claim that residential property tribunals are more informal than courts. Tribunals are formal bodies. The key difference between a tribunal and a court being, as I said, that legal aid is unavailable for representation at a tribunal. Moreover, it is not clear why tenants in similar circumstances should be able to take the matter to court, whereas mobile home site residents would be precluded from that opportunity.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000004"></a>I am the bishop of a diocese that, together with its neighbouring diocese of Salisbury, has appointed a full-time chaplain to Gypsies and Travellers, so I am kept well informed of their worries about this matter. I wonder whether the Government have carried out a race equality or human rights impact assessment of the DCLG&#146;s proposals, given that Gypsies and Irish Travellers on non-local authority sites, and that all Gypsies and Travellers on rented sites, are soon going to be affected by virtue of the impact of this measure.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000005"></a>It is important to get this provision right. I hope that the amendment will be given the serious consideration it deserves.</p>

<p><a name="0806242000006"></a><a name="80623-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80623-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0806242000411"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am grateful to all noble Lords who have entered into the spirit of this debate. I congratulate my noble friend Lady Whitaker, who is a strong and effective advocate for Gypsy and Traveller issues, as is the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. I share their concerns about the potential for abuse to occur in respect of pitch agreements for local authority Gypsy and Traveller sites once the provisions in the Mobile Homes Act apply in respect of such sites when Clause 316 of the Bill is brought into force. However, we would expect local authorities, as public bodies, to act reasonably and responsibly in agreeing the use of arbitration in resolving disputes that may arise with Gypsy and Traveller residents on their sites. If the existing power is abused at all, therefore, it is far more likely to be abused by unscrupulous private site owners than by local authority site owners.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000007"></a>My noble friend Lady Whitaker was kind in her comments on reforms to the dispute resolution system under the Mobile Homes Act and referred to our proposal to transfer the jurisdiction of county courts to hear disputes, apart from possession proceedings, to residential property tribunals established under the Housing Act 2004. As part of that proposal, pitch agreements will no longer be able to require the use of arbitration for dispute resolution, so that injustice is particularly dealt with.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000008"></a>She was also right to identify the pressing need to reform the current system of dispute resolution under the Mobile Homes Act. That is why the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Welsh Assembly are consulting very carefully on reform. It  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC535"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC535</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would be wrong for me to pre-empt the conclusions that we will draw from that consultation exercise and I heard clearly what the right reverend Prelate said in this regard. There is an interesting debate to be had about the most preferential outcome and the potential costs in court as opposed to the informal but nevertheless proper procedures of a tribunal. The point he made about legal aid is also well understood.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000009"></a>Comments have been invited from a wide sector of the community, including from those living, working with and owning homes in this residential sector, because it covers a variety of circumstances of which, of course, Travellers and Gypsies are an important part. No doubt my noble friend will be aware that the All-Party Parliamentary Group for the Welfare of Park Home Owners has long campaigned for reform in dispute resolution, and our consultation seeks to meet the concerns felt by many in the sector that the current system does not work as well or as fairly and proportionately as it should.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000010"></a>We also understand the concern about the imbalance in tribunal proceedings between those who can afford to be legally represented and those who cannot. If such an inequality exists, it manifests itself through the courts as well because the complaint we often hear is that park home residents cannot afford to bring or defend proceedings for fear of having costs awarded against them, and of course not all residents will have access to legal aid funding. But residential property tribunals have a wealth of experience in the field of adjudication in landlord and tenant legislation and it is quite normal for parties to represent themselves at dispute resolution hearings.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000011"></a>I say to all contributors to the debate that there is a consultation exercise in progress and I strongly advocate participating in it and making sure that the views which have been voiced today are expressed as part of that formal consultation. I will certainly ensure that those views are passed on.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000012"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, is reminding me about his question on Hackney.</p>

<p><a name="0806242000013"></a><a name="80623-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80623-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0806242000412"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I was actually going to ask whether the Minister would ensure that the views that have been expressed today were fed into the consultation.</p>

<p><a name="0806242000014"></a><a name="80623-gc0006.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80623-gc0006.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="0806242000413"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I was just saying that as the noble Lord rose to his feet. Of course those views will be fed into the consultation. The noble Lord knows that we have officials here, and we will ensure that those views are carefully noted. There is still some debate to be had and the consultation exercise may well lead to some further reflection.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000015"></a>I cannot answer the noble Lord&#146;s question about Hackney. The noble Lord has referred in the past to the case and to the displacement issue at an earlier stage. This is clearly an issue. I need to go away and find out what the latest position is and I will be more than happy to write to him about it.</p>

I understand that there could be hundreds. The discussion paper talks in terms of 160, based upon experience; there could be more.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000017"></a>Is the Minister satisfied that there is a fund of knowledge or expertise available that is waiting to be tapped and used? One of the concerns that has been expressed to me is whether you are going to get what you might call a lay person&#151;someone representing the element of the park home owner&#151;into this nexus. We do not want to find that it is just a professional body doing a professional job; these people really need to have a feel for the issues they are going to look at.</p>

<p><a name="0806242000018"></a><a name="80623-gc0006.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80623-gc0006.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="0806242000415"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> We are aware that a wide-ranging number of issues could be brought before the tribunal. That is obviously an issue and we have to look at resource allocation. We are talking about an existing body, the remit of which would be widened. It has an existing source of expertise and professionalism that is very valuable. It is certainly respected in the areas that it currently covers. There is a resource issue. My guess is that if that is the eventual outcome and we go with that route, some further thought will have to be given to resourcing the tribunal. I cannot prejudge any of this because we are in the middle of a consultation and we need to listen to many voices and come to a fair view. I am grateful to the noble Lord for the opportunity to respond to the point and to all those who have contributed to this short debate. It has been useful to have it during the consultation period and I will ensure that views fairly expressed are passed on.</p>

In declaring that interest, I commend to the consultation exercise the concept of having an ombudsman and redress scheme, which works so well for the Housing Ombudsman and will work well for estate agents. In fact it already works well for estate agents but it will be compulsory in the future. There are useful parallels there. In both cases, however, it should be remembered that there is always recourse to the courts as well.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000024"></a>The noble Baroness said: I apologise that illness prevented me from speaking to the amendments in my name last week. The Committee no doubt welcomed the chance to speed up proceedings, but the bad news is that I hope to speak to them on Report.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000025"></a>The purpose of this amendment is to place a statutory duty on local housing authorities to set up and maintain a choice-based disability housing register. Everything is in favour of the amendment except one thing. It has the virtue of ensuring that disabled people are housed in suitable homes as quickly as possible, thereby saving substantial costs to the health service when people cannot be discharged home. It prevents disabled people from becoming unnecessarily dependent on our overstretched care services. It saves thousands of pounds for local authorities being spent on disabled facilities grants, and makes best use of a scarce and valuable resource. What is more, both the Government and the Opposition support the establishment of disability housing registers. The only thing against the amendment is that it requires local authorities to do something to help disabled people when they might prefer to spend our council tax on other priorities.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000026"></a>The Committee will have read the depressing statistics in the briefings from RADAR, Care and Repair and Habinteg. Today, 1.5 million disabled people are in need of accessible accommodation, with 371,000 living in completely unsuitable housing. Approximately half of all disabled children live in unsuitable housing. One-quarter of all households in non-decent homes include someone who is long-term ill or disabled. A survey by the John Grooms charity revealed that 40 per cent of disabled respondents said that their housing made them unnecessarily dependent on other people.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC538"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC538</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="0806242000407"></a>6.30 pm</h5>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000027"></a>That means that among those 1.5 million disabled people are those like James, who was in his late 40s when he had a stroke. He had a wife and two children but he was then in a wheelchair and his family home was not accessible. His local authority was able to offer only residential care as an option, separating him from his family. James is now 50, divorced and unable to move out of the care home and back to work. Had the authority had a disabled housing register to ensure that he was moved quickly to the next available wheelchair-friendly home, it would have saved money&#151;and possibly a marriage and family&#151;as well as enabling James to stay in work.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000028"></a>Accessible housing is a scarce resource, yet a recent analysis of lettings in the social housing sector found that, on average, only one in six wheelchair-standard dwellings was let to a household containing a wheelchair user. What an appalling waste; yet there is a solution, and that is the choice-based disability housing register, which provides a mechanism for matching accessible housing stock with the disabled people who desperately need that accommodation. Not only does it mean that the appalling human cost in diminished lives, strained and broken relationships, extra hospital admissions and increasing but unnecessary demand on the social care services will be avoided but that local authorities will save millions of pounds.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000029"></a>The example of Cardiff was cited in the Government&#146;s recent <I>National Strategy for Housing in an Ageing Society</I>. Within three years of establishing an accessible housing register, successfully rehousing 300 disabled people between 2002 and 2005, the city saved &#163;1 million from the disabled facilities grant. If all local authorities in England had operated a register last year, more than &#163;70 million could have been saved from the health, social care and adaptations budgets.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000030"></a>Accessible housing registers have strong cross-party support, and the ageing strategy has said that the Department for Communities and Local Government will encourage the adoption of accessible housing registers. However, that is not enough. Unless local housing authorities are statutorily required to set up choice-based accessible housing registers, they will never get the political priority they require and there will always be some councillor&#146;s pet scheme to edge them out of the way. Our homes are the essential foundation&#151;the building block&#151;of independent living. The principles of choice and control form the policy of all the main political parties. However, unless the Government are willing to require that scarce accessible housing stock is matched to the disabled people who need it, there is small hope that any real progress will be made. I beg to move.</p>

To have discussed the earlier amendments without her would have been <I>Hamlet</I> without the Prince of Denmark, and we are delighted to have her back for this one. I wish to reinforce one important point that she made. Only one in six wheelchair-standard dwellings is let to a household containing a wheelchair user. That extraordinary statistic means that, when a home that  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC539"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC539</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is fully equipped and ready to go for someone who uses a wheelchair becomes vacant, it is being let to someone else. We are not matching the people with the accommodation. A register would achieve that and ensure that everyone knew where those homes were so that they could be filled by people who really needed them.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000032"></a>The subject of disability housing registers was first raised, I think, about 12 years ago in Joseph Rowntree Foundation research. They represent an ideal and incredibly important way of saving money and matching people with disabilities with the homes that they need. I strongly support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="0806242000033"></a><a name="80623-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80623-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0806242000420"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I, too, am very pleased to see the noble Baroness back in her place. We look forward to the debate on Report, because by that time she will have had the advantage of seeing how much support there is around the Chamber for the kinds of things she so passionately and powerfully advocates, of which the amendment is an example.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000034"></a>I sympathise entirely with the intention behind the amendment. It is obviously vitally important that people with disabilities are matched with housing that fits their needs&#151;there is no argument against that&#151;and that they get the priority they deserve for accessible housing. The noble Baroness will know that we are committed to both those aims. I do not want to labour the point because she has already referred to the ageing strategy, but she will also know that we have now, for the first time, a proper programme of adaptation of lifetime homes and building for a lifetime. This will make a difference in being able to count on homes where people with disabilities know they can be properly and safely housed. It will also make it easier to build wheelchair adaptations for later stages of disability, which we cannot do at the moment with our housing stock. So we have made a modest start there.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000035"></a>We have also been able to invest more in the disability facilities grant. In a very tight spending round, I was very pleased that we were able to get a significant amount of extra money for that grant because it is incredibly important, not only to elderly people but to children as well. When it comes to making expensive adaptations, it could make all the difference between people being able to stay in their homes or not. There is no question between us that registers can be exceptionally useful. We have to strive in all the ways that we can to put the systems in place which will make it easier in the future for people with disabilities to have access to the homes that they need and that will suit them.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000036"></a>It is important, however, that local authorities and other social landlords have better information on, and are able to quantify, their existing stock of accessible housing. That is why the disability quality scheme, which we published in December 2006, is also committed to the development of a National Register Of Social Housing. It has the hopeless acronym of &#147;NROSH&#148;. In addition to collecting basic dwelling attributes, NROSH sets a national standard for measuring accessibility and calls on social housing landlords to produce consistent accessibility to information on each dwelling by April 2010. So we are accumulating and articulating the evidence now.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC540"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC540</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000037"></a>That process, which will take us a long way forward, sits alongside the development of choice-based lettings as a principle. This has been one of the most significant changes in recent years. I agree that choice-based lettings is key to helping disabled people access accommodation that meets their needs. Not least, it gives existing and aspiring social housing tenants more control over where they live. We have also set a target for all local authorities to have adopted a CBL scheme by 2010. Under that approach, landlords should determine the accessibility of a dwelling as it becomes vacant, using the standard criteria developed by NROSH, and ensure that when the vacancy is advertised the advert specifies both the type and level of adaptations and who, in terms of their type or level of disability, is allowed to bid for the property. That will provide a way of prioritising accessible housing for disabled people and will give the local authorities a much more target-specific tool than they have at the moment. That means that people with disabilities can choose housing that meets their individual needs using a standardised classification. To have those two systems converging in that way is an efficient and practical way forward and will get results.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000038"></a>Crucially, CBL also already offers a key opportunity to improve information about available accessible housing. It is pleasing&#151;and not really surprising&#151;that some CBL schemes already incorporate an accessible housing register, and the number of accessible housing registers will increase under both the single authority CBL schemes and the growing number of larger CBL schemes that bring together a number of local authorities and housing association partners. That is certainly the way to go because it gives us an ability to move across boundaries, and sometimes homes are much more accessible in a neighbouring borough. We need that flexibility.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000039"></a>The noble Baroness spoke about the benefits that had accrued in Cardiff. I was interested in that example; it was new to me and I was taken with it. A London-wide accessible housing register is being developed alongside a pan-London choice and mobility scheme. To help that along, we have made available &#163;168,000 to assist London boroughs and RSLs to implement the London-wide accessible housing register. Our officials in CLG are working closely with those who are taking forward the scheme to ensure that it is consistent with the National Register of Social Housing and that they are mutually supportive. We will watch that very closely, because if that model works we can encourage it through good practice.</p>

<p><a name="0806242000040"></a>We also need to develop our knowledge of how accessible housing registers might be made most useful. The Disability Equality Scheme also includes a commitment to examine the role and effectiveness of accessible housing registers within the context of our choice-based lettings policy. Several times in the past few hours I have asked noble Lords to wait for the results of this or that review or inquiry but, once again, I ask the noble Baroness to have a little patience, because building up the evidence base is complicated. We have recently appointed Heriot-Watt University to look at the role and effectiveness of accessible housing registers within CBL policy. That will be part of a wider study of how choice-based lettings impact on

Our aim is to ensure that the researchers are thorough and that the study is an impartial and complete examination of the costs and effectiveness of registers that operate within the context of choice-based lettings. The results should be available early next year.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000041"></a>I suggest to my noble friend that it would not be appropriate to take any steps that would tie local authorities&#146; hands at the moment. We should wait for that evidence and then make a judgment on how we can make the evidence work in terms of policy and practice. We are fully cognisant of the fact that accessible housing registers can be really useful. I am of the opinion, which I share with my honourable friend in another place, that forcing local authorities to compile registers as a matter of routine may not be the best way forward in terms of what is right for their areas, and they should be free to decide for themselves whether a register would best meet their local needs. There are some outstanding examples.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000042"></a>Although we will not compel local authorities to compile registers as a matter of routine, we will continue to encourage the adoption of accessible housing registers through, for example, the statutory guidance on choice-based lettings, which will be published shortly. We will also watch closely how the London model is developing. We will support the dissemination of good-practice models and see where they can be grown elsewhere. We will encourage social landlords and assist them in implementing an accessible housing register in that way. We will certainly look very closely at what the Heriot-Watt research produces and take the steps that seem appropriate to get the best results for local authorities in their communities.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000043"></a>I am sure that my noble friend will not be entirely happy with that response, but I hope she recognises that it represents progress. It certainly represents a better way of compiling evidence and policymaking than we have had in the past.</p>

</ul>
<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000047"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 116AB and 116AC. The amendments are all about overcrowding and would provide that the Secretary of State should instigate a review within five years and every five years thereafter and include a new formula for the number of bedrooms, with particular reference to the way in which children are counted for the purposes of assessing overcrowding. It is extraordinary that, in 2001, a child could still be reckoned not to exist for this purpose and to account only for a bit when a little older.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000048"></a>I know that noble Lords are very aware of the huge impact of overcrowding on health and education. The other day, I was listening to some comments on the radio about quality of sleep. The comment was made that, many years ago, a bed would have accommodated as many people as could get into it and that people then must have had a terrible quality of sleep. That rang true with me. We have largely got away from that, but we are not there yet. The amendments are designed to probe the Minister on the extent to which she anticipates raising standards on overcrowding.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000049"></a>It is not necessary to have primary legislation for this but the opportunity is irresistible, with 500,000 households estimated to be overcrowded and almost 1 million children living in overcrowded conditions. I can understand that local authorities might be concerned about the extra pressure on housing caused by raising standards, but overcrowded households, even those that are statutorily overcrowded, are entitled only to a reasonable preference on the waiting list, not to extra priority; nor will statutory overcrowding be anything more than a relevant consideration in dealing with an application.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000050"></a>When the matter was raised in the Commons, an explanation was given about the pathfinders exercise, which was starting in April just gone. As the pathfinders exercise was essentially being piloted, the Minister there said that he did not want to commit himself too much but thought that he saw something coming on board by around 2009. It is pretty much six months since those comments were made, and I hope that the Minister can update the Committee on the efforts to bring us up to the modern standards that, I am sure, we would all like to see. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0806242000051"></a><a name="80623-gc0007.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80623-gc0007.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0806242000423"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> I have a lot of sympathy with this. Clearly, one does not want to have people living in overcrowded conditions. Unfortunately, the housing market being what it is, it will be a long time before we get away from it.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000052"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will forgive me for saying that proposed new subsection (4)(a) in Amendment No. 116AB seriously needs to be amended. It refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="0806242000405"></a>&#147;a person living together with another as husband and wife (whether that other person is of the same sex or the opposite sex)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0806242000222"></a>Reference to a couple living together I can understand, but more acceptable wording would be &#147;whether they are husband and wife or of the same sex&#148;. The current wording is not acceptable.</p>

In Part 2 we were concerned with the fine detail and with looking at technical issues, whereas in Part 3 we come to broader matters. Our debates today have ranged far and wide over issues that are work-in-progress for my department and others. I am grateful for the opportunity to address this matter, which is why I keep returning so often to what is happening in terms of building the evidence base, policy developments and so forth, rather than outlining immediate reactions in legislation in areas where we want to see improvements. We are perhaps a little inhibited by the state of our own policy developments and knowledge base, and that is true for local authorities as well. This issue is a classic example of it.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000054"></a>The noble Baroness is right: the current definition of overcrowding has remained unchanged for far too long but, rather than tackle the definition, we are committed to tackling overcrowding itself. My fundamental point here is that, however much comfort it might give us and those who campaign for better housing, if we were simply to change the definition of the term, that would not bring with it the agency or resources that are needed to make a real difference on the ground. At a time when there is so much cynicism about whether as politicians we can deliver on what we say, this sort of challenge has to be taken seriously. We have to be able to do the things we say we can do, so that people can see and feel a difference, rather than express an aspiration which lends itself to being exposed as not being able to realise what lies behind it. The noble Baroness and I both want to ensure that local authorities have the right tools in place to tackle the issue.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000055"></a>We are already committed to an updated standard. In January, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State confirmed the commitment to amend the 1985 Act during consideration of this Bill in Committee in another place, and indeed we have debated many times in this House the impact of overcrowding on the health and well-being of children, not least on their educational prospects and personal health, as well as the risk of dysfunction in family life that goes along with overcrowded conditions. There is no doubt that we are committed to addressing the issue of children in bad housing. However, the real challenge is to ensure that local authorities have the tangible means to do something about it and that they have real solutions to offer.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000056"></a>As a first step, we addressed this issue earlier in considering the provision of new supply in the form of affordable housing. Some &#163;8 billion is going into building more homes. The first part of our debates was very much about that and about the contribution that the Homes and Communities Agency can make. We are increasing outputs of new affordable housing to 70,000 by 2010-11, 45,000 of which will be for new social rented homes. We have done what Shelter has urged us to do in this respect: the figures represent an increase of 50 per cent over last year. We also need different sorts of homes, and larger units are needed. When I travel around the country to look at what we are doing in housing market renewal areas, one of the problems is that the housing stock built in the 19th century was  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC544"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC544</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for small families. Those terraced houses are totally inadequate for large families that can no longer access large homes. We have to build different sorts of homes. We are increasing the national percentage of social rented homes delivered through the Affordable Housing Programme from 25 to 30 per cent in 2008-09, rising to 33 per cent in 2010-11. That will mean more family-sized homes of three or more bedrooms, which will help.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000057"></a>New supply is only one side of the coin: we have to look at making better use of the available stock. We estimate that there are currently about 228,000 overcrowded households in social housing, but also some 445,000 social homes are under-occupied&#151;that is, households with two or more bedrooms than are needed.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80623-gc0008.htm"/>


<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000058"></a>Local authorities have discretion to give reasonable preference to those households that want to downsize. We are encouraging, not least through example and support, housing authorities to make better use of those flexibilities. That is good customer service because it addresses part of the housing and ageing strategies: we need homes to be appropriate in size for the people who live in them&#151;what they can manage, whatever age they are and whatever they need, whatever age they are and whatever their family conditions.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000059"></a>For example, tenants may wish to move closer to family for support, to reduce their rent, and so on. That is good housing management in making best use of stock. We also need to be smarter; local authorities need to be smarter; and we need to find new ways to solve the problem. Therefore, we are helping local authorities to find new ways to solve the problem. That is where the pilot schemes come in. We have put &#163;35 million into pilot schemes in London that are considering underoccupation using the private sector, developing adaptions more effectively.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000060"></a>In particular, in the capital, to take the use of the private rented sector, some pilots have been successful in securing accommodation in the private sector for overcrowded households. Since April, the introduction of the local housing allowance has given private renters on lower incomes a greater degree of choice and flexibility in accessing more suitably sized homes in the private sector.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000061"></a>Another pilot has been able to increase the quality of life of overcrowded households by making simple adaptions to their existing property if they want to stay where they are. Sometimes what you really need is a bit of help from someone coming from outside who says, &#147;If you take a wall down there, we can make a bit of space here&#148;. It needs some help and intelligence with the pressure points where space becomes a real issue&#151;for example, if children cannot do their homework. That may mean anything from more storage space to additional hand basins, or whatever. We can make a difference even within unpromising circumstances.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000062"></a>All that fed into our action plan in CLG, which we published last December. That sets out a number of ways in which social housing providers&#151;both local authorities and RSLs&#151;can manage their existing staff in innovative and proactive ways. That action plan sits alongside the evidence from the pathfinder project, to which the noble Baroness referred. We are investing a further &#163;15m over the next three years, starting with  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC545"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC545</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the 38 pathfinder chains, who between them account for more than half of overcrowded social tenants, so they are really important.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000063"></a>Each pathfinder has had &#163;110,000 this year to develop their own action plans based on good advice, good practice and innovative approaches developed by pilots. We have published an advice note  setting out the lessons learnt. We are asking the  pathfinders to improve the data that they hold on overcrowded households and improve their mapping of underoccupation.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000064"></a>On the next steps, wider implementation through the 38 pathfinders of schemes such as those piloted in London will have an immediate effect on securing better accommodation. During the course of the next year we will be seeking data that will enable us to look at the impact these schemes have on providing better housing solutions for overcrowded households. This will also provide the crucial evidence we need on the cost and impact of updating the overcrowding standard. Once we have that evidence, we will be able to devise a phased and manageable move to a new national standard, with authorities well positioned to manage a new definition positively.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000065"></a>I hope that the Committee will be reassured that we are committed to ensuring that families who are living in overcrowded conditions have the right advice and support from their local housing providers to enable them to secure more suitably sized accommodation. Local housing authorities need to be able to act to be prepared for a change in the overcrowding standard.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000066"></a>I am not complacent; I accept and agree with so much of what the noble Lady said and her entire sentiment. I confirm that the Government are committed to changing the statutory overcrowding standard. I cannot accept the amendment because, as I said, we already have powers to amend the definition of overcrowding by regulation; we have already given a clear commitment to modernising the standard; we have already published an action plan that will go a long way to tackling the problem; and it would be untimely to introduce a new standard without evidence on the cost or impact. Much the same argument applies to her amendments about the bedroom standard and her final amendment. With that response, which I hope is sufficiently full, I hope that she can reassure the people whom she knows who are really concerned about this.</p>

That links in with the earlier debate on priority groups. The reason you have to have priority groups is that you do not have enough housing for everyone, so you have to prioritise. It gets down to the same issue. Although the &#163;8 billion is obviously welcome, and we have talked about this before, it is going to solve only a small part of the problem. There are nearly 2 million applications for social housing, but &#163;8 billion will build about 100,000 homes over the next three years, which is barely sufficient. It all links in to the point about the lack of sufficient affordable housing.  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC546"></a><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column GC546</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Quite what the Government are going to do about that, I do not know; it is their problem. There are better ways of spending the &#163;8 billion&#151;for instance, getting empty homes back into service.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000068"></a>The Minister slightly slipped up on one point, in my view. When we talked earlier in Committee, I mentioned that I had been to the dentist, where a receptionist had been talking to another patient about how their children had broken up their marriages and were having to live in their houses. One was saying that their son had to live in a box cupboard with a bed in it, while the other had a daughter with two children who were living on the sofa downstairs. If they were in private housing, how would the Minister&#146;s department get to find out that there was overcrowding there as well? I asked them if they were on the social housing list. They said, &#147;No, there&#146;s absolutely no point in going there because we need our housing now. We need a roof over our head tonight, not in five or 10 years&#146; time&#148;. There are a lot of people out there who just have not tried to get on to the housing list because they think, &#147;What&#146;s the point? We&#146;re just going to be a gun number at the end. The priority people are going to get the housing, and we will be left in the queue for years&#148;. That may get worse as people get married and cannot afford a house. Last year, first-time buyers accounted for only 300,000 homebuyers, which I think was the lowest figure for many years; before, it was 450,000 or 500,000. Where are they going to go in the next year or two? They are going to need affordable housing, or they will be cramming up with one of their parents. This is a major issue.</p>

<p><a name="0806242000069"></a><a name="80623-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80623-gc0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0806242000426"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> It is a major issue. It reminds me that, if you go back 50 years, that rented accommodation was the most usual choice and people lived there for most of their lives&#151;in overcrowded conditions, too. One of the reasons why the house-building programmes of the 1950s and 1960s were so important was that they gave people a home of their own for the first time. The noble Lord is right; it is not just a question of building our way out of lack of affordability or overcrowding, but we need to look at the whole of the housing stock coherently to see what else we can do. That brings us back to our debates on social accessibility.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000070"></a>The private rented sector is often the most invisible and often, frankly, the worst served sector because it is managed by market. The review by Julie Rugg of that sector that we have commissioned should look at a whole range of situations, including the extent to which the sector may be soaking up some people in ways that the noble Earl described. However, because we need more supply and mobility across the sector&#151;and that goes for social housing as well&#151;we need people to have aspiration and opportunity to move out of social housing if they so wish and into owner occupation so that we can get more vulnerable people into social housing and away from the very worst of the private rented sector.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000071"></a>Essentially, we are aiming to create a vicious circle which is powered by notions of access, equality and affordability. The virtue of having the HCA in place is that we can have that single conversation with people who are responsible for land and with those across the

Although there is one set of very technical amendments to go, that seems to be what we have been addressing throughout the whole Bill&#151;all these issues relate to each other. I am grateful for the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment, which has given us an opportunity to open up our debate.</p>

<p><a name="0806242000072"></a><a name="80623-gc0008.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80623-gc0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0806242000427"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I think that the Minister is aiming for a virtuous circle, rather than the vicious circle to which she referred&#151;this has been a very long Committee stage. I am grateful for her reply. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, about the drafting. He will not be surprised if I confess that I did not draft these three or four pages of amendments. My drafting has been much less expert and much shorter. I noticed that phrase this morning and thought, &#147;I know what it means but it could perhaps have been expressed differently&#148;.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000073"></a>In regard to a virtuous circle, with the domestic violence amendment I was talking about releasing refuge spaces. As the noble Lord was talking, I wrote down &#147;Release three and four-bedroomed housing&#148; before the Minister said it. I know that that is very much in her mind and that of her department. I am very grateful for her explanation, which was a much more positive take on the issue than I have heard for a very long time. Of course, the solutions will not come overnight.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000074"></a>The definition is important. I understand the noble Baroness&#146;s point about trying to avoid cynicism, and the noble Earl made a similar point. The converse of that is setting a target with the aim of working towards it. It is certainly important that the work that is going on now&#151;the piloting or pathfinder, or whatever one calls it&#151;and the action plan do not delay countrywide change.</p>

<p><a name="0806242000075"></a>Despite their length, these were probing amendments. They came from Shelter, which I know is involved in the debates and will keep an eagle eye on the work being done.

<p><a name="0806242000082"></a>The noble Baroness said: Before I move the lead amendment in the final group, perhaps I may say that the Committee stage has been exceptionally productive. I am very grateful for noble Lords&#146; patience and understanding as we have ploughed through a long and sometimes very technical Committee stage. I hope they will agree that it has been a positive experience

Between now and the next stage, I should be very happy to meet any noble Lord who has any problems. I look forward to continuing the dialogue.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000083"></a>This is a group of government amendments. They are technical and give effect to a recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Regulated Reform Committee in respect of the power to make consequential amendments under Clause 319.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000084"></a>If the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, will allow me, I shall speak to his amendment at the same time. At present, all orders under Clause 319 are subject to the affirmative procedure. The committee&#146;s view is that this procedure is appropriate only when an Act is amended, and we agree with that assessment. The amendments before us, Amendments Nos. 116D, 117AB, 117ABA, 117AC and 117AD will do that. For technical reasons, the amendments are being made to Clause 318 because it sets out the procedures that will apply to all the powers to make subordinate legislation.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000085"></a>The mea culpa part of my explanation is that it was not our intention to agree to Amendment No. 110XD during our sitting last Wednesday. As I recall there was a bit of mayhem around the Committee&#151;</p>

<p><a name="0806242000086"></a><a name="80623-gc0008.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80623-gc0008.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0806242000429"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> It was my fault.</p>

But as a result of the mix-up, we have withdrawn two government amendments that we had intended to move in this group because they would conflict with Amendment No. 110XD. I hope that noble Lords will permit me to rectify the matter at the Report stage.</p>

<a name="80623-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0806242000088"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 117BZA tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith. This is a technical amendment which gives effect to a recommendation of the DPRR Committee in respect of the power to make consequential amendments. As I have said, all orders under Clause 319 are subject to the affirmative procedure. This is explicitly required under Clause 318(3)(b). The committee&#146;s view was that this procedure was only appropriate when an Act is amended, and we agree with that. We have already discussed the government amendments which have a similar effect. With that explanation, I hope that I will be forgiven for getting this wrong and that we can move swiftly to conclude the Committee&#146;s proceedings.</p>

<a name="80623-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08062310000007"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (David Miliband) and I represented the UK at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg.</p>

<a name="80623-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08062310000008"></a>The agenda items covered were as follows:</p>

<a name="80623-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08062310000011"></a>Foreign Ministers discussed the agenda of the June European Council, including freedom, security and justice; the policy implications of high global food and oil prices; economic, social and environmental issues; the western Balkans (covered separately below); and external relations issues, in particular the European neighbourhood policy; and the millennium development goals (MDGs).</p>

<a name="80623-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08062310000012"></a>My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary broadly supported the draft European Council conclusions on food and oil prices, and called for the reiteration of commitments on carbon capture and storage. He also supported the text on MDGs, but asked that it include both the full text of the overseas development aid targets agreed at the Development Council in May and language supporting the EU agenda for action on the MDGs.</p>

<a name="80623-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08062310000013"></a>Ministers discussed follow-up to the Irish referendum on the Lisbon treaty. I refer honourable Members to the Statement that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs made to the House on 16 June.</p>

<a name="80623-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08062310000014"></a>Foreign Ministers will meet at the European Council. The agenda will cover Kosovo, Cuba, Zimbabwe, Sudan, China/Tibet and transatlantic relations.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08062310000016"></a>France, Sweden and the Czech Republic presented a programme setting out the joint priorities for their presidencies, running from July 2008 to the end of 2009. These priorities included reassessing the EU budget; climate change; ensuring secure, competitive and environmentally sustainable energy; implementing the Lisbon strategy for jobs and growth; promoting the EU&#146;s competitiveness; sustainable development; reviewing the common agricultural policy; developing an area of freedom, security and justice; enlargement; the western Balkans; strengthening relations with the EU&#146;s eastern and southern neighbours; the relationship with Africa; the European security strategy and meeting the MDGs. The Government broadly support the programme.</p>

<a name="80623-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08062310000019"></a>Ministers agreed council conclusions, which the Government support, reiterating the EU&#146;s commitment to the western Balkans&#146; European perspective and encouraging the countries of that region to meet the necessary conditions. The council also condemned the violence during the 1 June elections in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), and regretted shortcomings in the conduct of those elections. It called on the authorities to investigate these incidents and take appropriate action.</p>

<a name="80623-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08062310000020"></a>Ministers also discussed draft European council conclusions on a range of western Balkans issues and signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), which the Government welcome. The council encouraged BiH to sustain the reform momentum by implementing the agreement and the priorities set out in its European partnership. Ministers further welcomed visa liberalisation roadmaps setting out requirements for western Balkans countries working towards visa-free travel to the Schengen area. These do not impact on the UK, which is not a party to the Schengen agreement.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08062310000025"></a>Ministers approved without discussion conclusions that acknowledged the progress made towards peace in the region in recent months; and reaffirmed the EU&#146;s contribution to reform of the security sector in DRC through two ESDP missions and Commission activity, which will help protect civilians by curtailing human rights abuses, upholding respect for the rule of law and ending the culture of impunity.</p>

<a name="80623-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08062310000027"></a>International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Ocampo briefed Ministers on the ICC&#146;s activities concerning Sudan. Ministers adopted council conclusions that reiterated the EU&#146;s support for the work of the ICC, deeply deplored the Government of Sudan&#146;s continued non-co-operation with the ICC and noted that the council stood ready to consider measures against individuals responsible for not co-operating, should the obligation under the UNSC Resolution 1593 on co-operation with the ICC continue to be disregarded.   The conclusions expressed concern over the recent fighting between north and south Sudan armed forces in the disputed border region of Abyei, welcomed the Abyei roadmap agreed on 8 June, and called on both sides to fulfil the obligations under the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA).  The conclusions condemned the Justice and Equality Movement's attack on Omdurman on 10 May; reiterated the council's readiness to take further measures against any party impeding UNAMID, obstructing humanitarian access, or failing constructively to engage in the Darfur political process; and called on the Governments of Chad and Sudan to adhere to the Dakar agreement.  </p>

<a name="80623-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="08062310000039"></a>I attended the second Transport Council of the Slovenian presidency, in Luxembourg on 13 June.</p>

<a name="80623-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="08062310000040"></a>In road transport, the council reached a political agreement on each of three legislative proposals: the recast regulation on common rules for access to the international road haulage market; the regulation on common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator; and the recast regulation on common rules for access to the market for coach and bus services. Presidency compromise texts took into account the concerns of several member states, including the UK, in relation to cabotage and the Commission's report in June 2009 on the future inclusion of vehicle registration data on the national registers of operators. The agreed texts of all three proposals are acceptable to the UK.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="08062310000041"></a>The council reached a general approach on a recast directive on roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers. The text was acceptable to the UK.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="08062310000042"></a>The council adopted conclusions, acceptable to the UK, on multi-annual contracts for rail infrastructure quality.</p>

<a name="80623-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="08062310000043"></a>The council reached a general approach on a directive on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles. We support the principle of using public procurement to help stimulate the market for greener vehicles. The revised text presented to council, which we were able to accept, is a significant improvement over the original. However, I informed the council that we regret the lack of a formal impact assessment. We will want, with the Commission, to keep the costs and benefits of the proposed measures under review.</p>

<a name="80623-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="08062310000044"></a>The council adopted a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations towards an EU/western Balkans transport treaty.

This is the first FAB to be established within the framework of the European single European sky legislation. It is a demonstration of the two countries&#146; commitment to delivering the single European sky initiative. The FAB is designed to deliver real operational efficiencies irrespective of existing national airspace boundaries.</p>
