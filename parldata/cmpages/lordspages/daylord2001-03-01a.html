<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Why methane gas derived from landfill sites counts as part of the renewables obligation for electricity producers while methane gas from abandoned mines does not.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister for Science, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  My Lords, coalmine methane is a fossil fuel produced in rock strata over millions of years. Methane at landfill sites is produced from recently deposited biodegradable material, and is replaceable within a generation. The statutory definitions of "fossil fuel" and "renewable sources" in the Utilities Act reflect this, and preclude the inclusion of fossil fuel in the renewables obligation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that, at present, out of about 900 abandoned mines, there are only five where operators are harnessing and burning methane gas? As this is a waste product which is over 20 times more damaging to the environment in terms of global warming than carbon dioxide, is there not an overwhelming case for giving operators more incentives to harness and use this noxious and dangerous gas, which at present escapes into the atmosphere?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is right about the harmful effects of coalmine methane. It is some 21 times worse than carbon dioxide. However, it cannot be said to be a renewable source of energy; I agree, therefore, that it cannot come under that category. There is an environmental case for seeing whether there are ways of encouraging greater use of methane by the industry. Indeed, my department and the DETR are examining, with the Association of Coal Mine Methane Operators, ways in which the Government might encourage industry to develop more sites. It may be an area in which the Coalfields Task Force and the Carbon Trust could be helpful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath: </B>   My Lords, would it not be most consistent in terms of energy production, and environmentally sensible, if methane from closed collieries were treated in a similarly advantageous way to methane from landfill sites? It is the same gas; and, as the noble Lord said, it is very noxious.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I must disagree: it is not the same kind of gas. Both come from <P>


<a name="column_1391"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1391</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the bacterial breakdown of organic material, but coalmine methane is produced through carbonisation over millions of years and therefore cannot be treated in terms of renewable energy. If we were to do that, it would be difficult to argue that either coal or natural gas should also not be included as renewable energy. That would clearly be a farcical situation. However, as I said, there are good environmental reasons for examining this area, and that is what we are doing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord referred to the coalfield areas. Are the Government giving special consideration in connection with this issue to stimulating the exploitation of methane from disused mines as a way of bringing more investment and employment into the coalfield areas?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, that is exactly what my department and the DETR are doing. We are examining possible ways of encouraging greater use of methane. The main argument is environmental. At present, there are five plants. The number would have to rise to 300 before it began to make any difference at all in terms of electricity generation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew6"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, has any work been done on recovering methane from farm slurry tanks?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I am not aware of any. I shall look into the matter and find out whether such work is being done.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Nicol: </B>   My Lords, there is world-wide interest in the technology for using methane from coalmines. Will the Minister accept that if the Government are seen to support that industry in this country it would bring great benefits to the industry as a whole? Therefore, I should be relieved to hear that he is considering the creation of a new category for this operation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, it is not a question of a different category. We should look at whether there are appropriate incentives for this product. We have major programmes relating to clean coal technology, encouraging its exportation to other parts of the world.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Oxburgh: </B>   My Lords, on rigorous scientific criteria about which there is no question, methane from coalmines is a fossil fuel. Accepting that, is the Minister aware that this gas is steadily and continuously diffusing through the ground and leaking into the atmosphere by natural processes? Is he further aware that methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, but that during the chemical reactions involved in combustion--in burning it and extracting energy from it--it is converted into carbon dioxide and water vapour, which are much less harmful greenhouse gases? Does the Minister agree that this is a rare opportunity both to extract energy and to help the environment, and that it would be desirable to extend favourable tax treatment to endeavours to extract methane from mines?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I am indeed aware that methane is an extremely powerful greenhouse gas. One way of dealing with its harmful effects is to use it for the generation of energy. Therefore, as I said, there are strong environmental reasons for doing this, even if in terms of diversity of energy generation the arguments are not very strong.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that Germany changed its legislation on 28th March last year to ensure that methane gas from mines could be used towards the renewable objectives of the electricity producers; and that under those circumstances his Answer does not make sense?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, any country is perfectly entitled to do something which is illogical and stupid. That is no reason for this country to follow that particular path.

<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What steps they have taken to strengthen resources directed to law enforcement in the road haulage industry as part of a package concurrent with the introduction of 44-tonne lorries.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Lord Whitty): </B>  My Lords, the Government have been working on a package of additional lorry enforcement measures in consultation with industry and unions in the Road Haulage Forum and its sub-group on compliance and enforcement. The package, which will cost £6 million over three years, includes projects: to increase the number of examiners available for roadside and other checks; to provide equipment to increase the scope and mobility of roadside checks, including weighing machines; to augment advice and education initiatives to prevent offending; to enhance data collection and analysis for targeting purposes; and to improve roadside inspection facilities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. I declare an interest as a member of the Commission for Integrated Transport, which recommended to the Government that 44-tonne lorries should be introduced--which I believe is happening this month. At the same time, the commission said that enforcement measures should be enhanced. Can the Minister confirm that the receipts from O-licences are running ahead of expenditure on enforcement?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is correct: 44-tonne lorries have been allowed on roads since 1st February, in line with the recommendations from the Commission for Integrated Transport. So far as concerns income and expenditure for Vehicle <P>


<a name="column_1393"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1393</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Inspectorate enforcement, the VI operates on a basis of revenue equalling costs. It is intended that, following consultation, the full cost of the additional enforcement to which I referred will fall on the O-licence income after a transitional period.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the extra enforcement measures that my noble friend the Minister just announced. Can he tell the House who will pay this £6 billion over three years--will it be the industry or the Government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I believe that my noble friend misheard me rather grossly arithmetically: I said £6 million, not £6 billion. The figure is for the administration of the various enforcement enhancement measures to which I referred for extra examiners and equipment, as well as more adequate road-side facilities and their administration. The cost, which will eventually be an ongoing cost, will be covered by the income from the O-licences. We shall obviously have to have a fee review in order to achieve that aim. Such a review will take place later this year.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-01_spnew18"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the Home Office consultation paper on road traffic offences is not very encouraging, as it concentrates on penalties rather than the prevention of accidents in the first place? Why is the Minister not paying greater attention to the compulsory re-training of errant drivers?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010301/text/10301-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, it is possible that the noble Earl has not read the Home Office consultation paper as carefully as he normally reads such documents. It deals largely with penalties, but included in the latter are options for requiring retraining or the retaking of the driving licence for substantial offences. I agree with the thinking behind the noble Earl's question that, clearly, the whole point of deterrents as regards road traffic management and road safety issues is to ensure that we have better drivers on the road. Therefore, those options are included in the Home Office paper to that end.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, the Minister mentioned inspection in the package outlined in his Answer. We have recently seen what astonishing damage can be done by a Land-Rover and trailer getting on to a railway track through a crash barrier. Can the noble Lord say whether there is any programme for inspection of crash barriers to ascertain whether they are up to the standard required as regards the 44-tonne weight to which this Question refers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I should, first, stress that anything that I, or anyone else, may say in this respect has no bearing on the tragic accident that took place yesterday. As my noble friend Lord Macdonald made clear last night, the facts of that accident will be subject to some very detailed inquiries. Until we receive the results of those inquiries, any conclusions on that particular incident are matters only of speculation.
<P>


<a name="column_1394"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1394</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-02_para0"></a>In relation to crash barriers, I can tell the House that there are standards relating to barriers over railways, as applies to bridges in other areas. The Highways Agency and the local highway authorities meet those standards. Clearly there is a continuous upgrading of those standards. Continuous assessments are also made to ascertain whether or not those standards are adequate in relation not only to normal traffic but also to larger lorries. The possibility of a major incident involving a 44-tonne lorry must be taken into account in terms of all road safety measures, including barriers and others.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, in terms of vehicle miles travelled, does the Minister agree that, in general, heavy goods vehicles are probably less likely to be involved in accidents but more likely to be involved in serious accidents? Further, can the noble Lord say whether anything is being done by way of this new supervisory package about driver practices such as, for example, tailgating on motorways, and so on?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is correct to suggest that driving of HGVs is relatively safe. Nevertheless, because of the nature of the vehicle, when there is an accident it can have very serious consequences. The question of professional drivers was addressed in the road safety strategy that we produced last year. A working party investigating that issue has just produced an interim report relating to the management of professional drivers, including HGV drivers, van drivers and those who drive company cars. It recommended that those concerned should take more responsibility for the way in which their drivers operate on the road, and that, in effect, the kind of requirements on health and safety that are evident in factories and offices should also apply to the management and the practices of employed drivers who are using the road. The statistics for company car drivers are the opposite of that which applies to lorries. Therefore, those findings make the report very important.

<P>
<UL>Whether they consider that their continuing failure to publish the documents disclosed for the purpose of the Factortame litigation and referred to in the English courts' decisions to be compatible with the principles contained in the Government's Code of Practice on Access to Government Information and in the Freedom of Information Act 2000.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  My Lords, the Government are firmly committed to the principles contained in the code of practice and in the Act to which the noble Lord refers. This particular request <P>


<a name="column_1395"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1395</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has raised several complex issues, which have taken longer than anticipated to resolve. However, we expect to be in a position to release the documents referred to in the Question before the end of next week.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister, not only for her reply but also for being here today to deliver it in view of the other matters of pressing concern to both her and her department. Can the Minister confirm the dismal background to this matter? Is not the position as follows: that the documents in question cover the period 1973-91 and are of historic interest; that they relate to the passing of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988; that the Government waived legal, professional privilege in respect of them in 1997 in the English proceedings; that all of the documents were before the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords in the Factortame litigation and were, in some cases, read out; and that most of them are government documents and not EC Commission documents? Can the Minister explain why the government documents have not been released since I first asked for them in 1999, and why the EU documents were not requested from the Commission many months ago?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, when I looked at the chronology of this particular case, I undoubtedly had some sympathy with the noble Lord, Lord Lester, because it has taken a long time to resolve. I have to point out to the noble Lord that there were a number of unusual and complex issues that had to be resolved. They include whether, aside from the code, the disclosures that had taken place in the Factortame litigation had placed the Government under a legal duty of disclosure; how the policy and the code should be applied in the case of requests for publication of those documents, given that the code expressly excludes a commitment to provide documents; how the code should be applied in the case of documents recording the deliberations of a previous administration; which documents were covered by legal, professional privilege and whether that privilege still existed after so much detail, as the noble Lord suggests, had been given out in the hearings and in the judgments; what were the key principles for deciding where the balance of public interest lay for the elements of the documents; and which documents required the agreement of other parties as regards disclosure. All that has taken time, but it is all now virtually resolved. I hope that all the documents will be disclosed within the next week.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe: </B>   My Lords, it is possible that I am the only person who does not understand what this Question is all about. However, bearing in mind that there may be more than a handful of us who do not understand it, could the Minister in future liaise beforehand with the questioner, like the noble Lord, Lord Lester, so that we can appreciate the "dismal background" to such matters, and, therefore, take more part in the proceedings?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, to put it in simple language: the noble Lord, Lord Lester, asked for these <P>


<a name="column_1396"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1396</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>documents a long time ago, and it has taken an awful long time to get them released to him. Perhaps that explains the situation to my noble friend. I was trying to explain that the issues were not quite as clear-cut as being a case of anyone trying to be obstructive or deliberately dilatory. It was necessary to resolve a number of issues, some of which were novel. Having resolved the process issues in this case, I hope that the resolution of any future issues will not prove to be such a long, drawn-out process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, the Minister did not mention the EC Commission. Can I take it that the problem did not involve the secretiveness of the Commission as regards its documents?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   Yes, my Lords. The noble Lord may take it that way. In the case of at least one of the documents, the EC Commission has been one of the bodies with which we have had to consult. However, there is no way in which it has been obstructive in this respect.

<P>
<UL>From which date the recently announced repayment of student loans by the Government on behalf of teachers of shortage subjects will come into operation.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-02_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment   (Baroness Blackstone): </B>  My Lords, we said in the Green Paper, Schools: Building on Success, that we would explore a scheme to pay off the student loans of new teachers who begin teaching shortage subjects in the state education sector. We are still considering details but we currently plan that a scheme should be in place for those who enter teaching in September 2002. This is one of a package of measures which we believe will significantly enhance schools' ability to recruit and retain teachers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that the scheme does nothing to solve the immediate crisis which we thought was the aim of its introduction? Would the scheme require legislation? Is it right that a teacher of one of the listed subjects for the scheme would have a student loan repaid but a student teacher of a subject for which there is an equal shortage, for example, religious education and/or music, would not? Is that position consistent with the Human Rights Act?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness referred to the immediate crisis, but this is a case of the Government thinking ahead and considering various different ways to try to ensure that we retain teachers once they start to teach. There are a lot of schemes, of which I think the noble Baroness is aware, to try to <P>


<a name="column_1397"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1397</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>solve the immediate crisis, including paying a salary to student teachers on PGCE courses and the "golden hello" scheme for teachers of shortage subjects. So far, they are having an impact on the immediate situation. In paying off the student loans of teachers of shortage subjects the scheme would not in any way contravene the Human Rights Act. It constitutes the kind of retention measure that any employer might institute when desperately short of people with particular skills.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that this measure has the potential to be divisive within the profession and to demoralise young teachers already in post who may be heavily burdened with student debt and who will not have the help we are discussing? Does the Minister further accept that it would be much more effective in terms of bringing into the profession the high-quality graduates that we seek to pay a substantial training salary equivalent to point zero on the teachers' pay scale rather than the small training grant which the Government currently pay?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the Liberal Democrats have previously raised the issue of paying teachers a large training salary before they are qualified. I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, suggested a training salary of £15,000. As I have said before, I believe that that is unrealistic and that it would not be right to pay a salary at that level before someone is qualified. In any case, the current practice of paying a salary of £6,000 is having a substantial impact.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend give an indication of applications for teacher training? Has she any idea of the numbers for this autumn compared with previous years?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, there is a substantial increase in the number applying for teacher training. I said that only last week when we debated the whole issue of the supply of teachers. Of course, it is a little early to say what the final figure will be. More figures are due to be released next week. However, the latest figures show that PGCE applications are up by 12 per cent on the same time last year. It is particularly pleasing to note that applications for science are up by 20 per cent and for technology by 53 per cent. Those are two key shortage areas.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   My Lords, speaking as a former secondary school teacher who enjoyed the odd free period, does the proposal to award privileges to teachers of shortage subjects not reflect badly on hard working junior schoolteachers who have to teach from nine in the morning until four and who will not obtain any of the privileges to be offered to teachers of shortage subjects? Junior school teachers are as important as people who teach physics and mathematics. Has a sense of proportion been applied in this matter?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, of course it has. As the noble Lord knows, we do not have the same <P>


<a name="column_1398"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1398</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>shortages in primary schools as in secondary schools. However, we are considering whether primary school teachers who specialise in providing mathematics across the curriculum should be included in the scheme to repay the student loans of those teachers who remain in the profession once they have joined it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, why is it inappropriate to pay a training salary to those entering the teaching profession as graduates when that technique is widely used in the accountancy and the legal professions, which are extremely successful in recruiting new graduates?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I do not want to comment on what other professions do. As regards teaching, it is important that we pay those who are qualified a decent salary. The Government have substantially increased the pay for teachers. Each year they have had an above inflation pay rise. Moreover, the introduction of performance related pay will mean substantial increases for those teachers who have passed the threshold and who have demonstrated the quality of their work in the classroom.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, would the Minister agree that passing all the way through this problem is the basic fact that teacher salaries are grossly uncompetitive as compared with those in commerce or industry? Given that gap, there seems little point in continuing to agonise as to why one cannot get highly qualified teachers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, this Government have raised teacher salaries by a great deal more than our predecessor. Of course there is a gap between the salaries of people in the private sector and those of many people in the public sector, not just teachers. However, fortunately, large numbers of people see teaching as an honourable profession. They want to be teachers and are coming forward. Although we must not be complacent, I do not think that we should exaggerate the degree of the problem. The vacancy rate is still below 1 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, is not one way of tackling teacher shortages to encourage recently retired teachers to come back to the classroom? Does not my noble friend agree that that would be helpful and constructive?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   Yes, my Lords, I certainly do. There are people who have retired early and there are some who may have retired at the normal retirement age who would like to teach part-time or on a supply basis. We have made a number of changes to the teachers' pension scheme to make it more financially attractive for retired teachers to come back into the classroom. Currently there are some 7,000 recently retired teachers who are back in teaching, mainly on a supply basis or in a part-time capacity.

<FONT SIZE=3>loans of some teachers they must have thought carefully about its possibilities. I presume that it is not just "spin". First, can the noble Baroness answer the question of my noble friend on the Front Bench; namely, does the scheme require legislation? Secondly, is a student loan a formal contract which would have to be broken?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the scheme would require legislation. However, I do not believe that a student loan constitutes a formal contract that would have to be broken if it were decided that the employer would write off the loan by repaying it on behalf of the employee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, have the Government considered extending the scheme for the repayment of student loans to people entering university teaching in view of the considerable shortages in some key subjects in universities?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord always speaks up on behalf of university teachers. The answer to his question is no, because there are not the same shortages of people coming forward to teach in universities as there are for certain key subjects in secondary education.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, the figures for science and technology are good news. That is a beam of light on the horizon. This year, starting in September, is science year. Does the Minister see a prospect of being able to encourage more young people to study science this year and to ensure that they view a career teaching science as an extremely attractive one?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew18"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I very much hope that science year will encourage more young people who take degrees in science to consider teaching as a profession. The numbers coming forward to do science degrees is still buoyant in the UK. Indeed, we have a higher proportion of undergraduate students in science and technology than in many other OECD countries. We should build on that and make it clear and apparent to young people when they are making these decisions that it is a popular area to study.

<A NAME="10301-03_spnew19"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I was glad to hear the Minister say that she was not complacent. Will she confirm that the percentage of GDP spent on education is now 4.6 per cent? On the day that John Major went off to watch the cricket at The Oval the figure was 5 per cent. Will the noble Baroness confirm that that gives her good reason not to be complacent?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-03_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, when John Major went off to watch cricket at The Oval, the economic position of this country was considerably less favourable than it is today. As a result, the GDP was far lower, so the proportion spent on education appeared to be somewhat higher.

("( ) the best interests of the child,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment seeks to amend Clause 1 of the Bill. The objective of Clause 1 is to secure that as far as possible all children with special educational needs or disabilities are educated in mainstream schools. I acknowledge and respect the Government's commitment to greater inclusion of disabled children. I acknowledge, respect and welcome the commitment they are making to include more disabled children in mainstream schools. There is no difference between us on that issue. But if inclusion is to be worth while and a success, it must be a positive experience for the child. If it proves to be yet another experience of rejection and failure, it will be worse than useless.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para1"></a>Other clauses of the Bill, and Section 317 of the 1996 Act, make provision for mainstream schools to move towards being able to provide the equipment and trained staff that they will need to cope effectively with children with special educational needs. That is a wholly desirable objective, but it will inevitably take time to achieve. In the mean time, there is a danger that children who are sent to mainstream schools which do not yet have the facilities may suffer. Sadly, the children who will suffer are likely to be the most vulnerable children. I shall return to that issue later.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para2"></a>Clause 1 of the Bill is very prescriptive. In effect it states that from the date on which the Bill comes into force schools and local education authorities will have less scope to place a child in the best available school for the child's needs. The proposed subsections are extremely inflexible. New Section 316(2) lays down in primary legislation that all children who do not have a statement must go to a mainstream school. There is no option. The only flexibility is that the local authority can start the process of assessment and statementing of that child and that it can be in a special school. I am not happy about the inflexibility of the clause but I reluctantly accept it and have not retabled my amendments on it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para3"></a>Amendment No. 1 relates to new Section 316(3) which I believe contains the seeds of considerably greater potential damage. It lays down that even in the case of a child with a statement, he must go to a mainstream school. There are only two exceptions: <P>


<a name="column_1401"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1401</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unless it would be incompatible with his parents' wishes or with the satisfactory education of other children in the school. This subsection imposes a new and inflexible restriction on schools and LEAs. It prevents them taking into account local considerations or the welfare of the child when making a decision about his placement. If, as a result of professional and local knowledge, they were convinced that the child needed a special school, they could not send him to one unless his parents agreed or unless he were disruptive and therefore fell into the second category. I suggest that parents are not always the best judge of their children's needs. Some parents are humiliated by having a child at a special school. Some do not want to believe that their child has the degree of disability that he has.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para4"></a>There is a further problem about new Section 316(3). I am advised by a noble and learned friend on these Benches that the proposed new Section 316(3) would even prevent an LEA sending a statemented child to the special school mentioned in his statement unless the parents agree or he is disruptive.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para5"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for her two letters and for the full answers she gave on Report on these issues. However, the noble Baroness has not convinced me. There is nothing between us on the ultimate objective. However, I do not believe that this clause is the best way to achieve that objective.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para6"></a>The noble Baroness made the point that LEAs will have discretion under Schedule 27 to the 1996 Act. I am advised that if the new Section 316(3) were in place, there would be a conflict between it and Schedule 27: LEAs would no longer have that flexibility under Schedule 27.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para7"></a>The noble Baroness has stated repeatedly in debates that in the past LEAs have misused their discretion in relation to the "best interests of the child" to frustrate the Government's policy of inclusion. I know this to be a concern of the Special Educational Consortium. The dangers of this happening in the future are greatly exaggerated. The Government are preparing new guidelines: Ofsted will inspect the inclusion policies of schools. It does not seem likely that LEAs will be able to get away with cheating under those circumstances. We have to balance that risk against the risk of damage to vulnerable children arising from the Bill as drafted.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para8"></a>The children who will be hurt will not be the middle-class children with articulate and well-informed parents. The children who will suffer will be vulnerable children who do not have articulate and supportive parents who understand their needs and are able to argue their case. Those children are likely to be most in need of help. They will be damaged by being plunged into a large school that is not yet able to give them the support they need.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para9"></a>In many cases, such a child will end up sitting at the back of the class, not understanding what is being taught because he has fallen too far behind and traumatised by the social demands of a large and perhaps unfriendly group. He will experience failure and rejection yet again in his life--the failure and rejection to which he has learned to become <P>


<a name="column_1402"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1402</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>accustomed in the family since he was born. That experience leads on almost automatically to truanting, exclusion, drugs, crime, unemployability and social exclusion.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para10"></a>If the proposed Section 316(3) proves to be a disaster, it will take primary legislation to change it. If those provisions were in guidelines, it would be a different matter. The amendment would introduce some flexibility, which could be regulated by guidelines or a code of conduct that would be checked by Ofsted. That is the route that the Government should take, in the best interests of all children. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, has made a powerful case, delivered emotionally and passionately. I support him wholeheartedly.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para11"></a>The primary aim of the Bill is to serve the best interests of the child with special educational needs. I have yet to hear a coherent argument against that from the Government. We have had this debate at each stage of the Bill and Members of all parties have argued in favour of serving the best interests of the child.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para12"></a>The amendment was included in a large group on Report. The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, had some reservations about some of the amendments in that group, particularly the reference to adequate support in mainstream education to provide effectively for the special educational needs of the child, but there are no amendments to that effect today. However, she was unequivocal in support of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, and his wish to include a reference to the best interests of the child in the Bill. She said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There are three reasons why the Bill would be improved if some move were made in the direction of taking account of the needs or best interests of the child. First, the words, 'the best interests of the child' are used in the Children Act. Those interests should be paramount".--[Official Report, 20/2/01; col. 615.]

<A NAME = "10301-04_para13"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para14"></a>The noble Baroness has not tabled amendments on Third Reading, as she suggested she might, but the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, has deservedly received support from all who have been involved in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para15"></a>The best interests of the child should not be compromised in any way. Clause 1 has created confusion. The Minister has been hugely helpful since Report and has written a number of letters, copying them to all interested parties, but the issue of making a fundamental statement in the Bill of its main objective that the interests of the child should be served has not been addressed. That is the rationale for the Bill, even if there is no other. I wholeheartedly support the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, in his attempt to get the words on the face of the Bill.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, I, too, support the amendment. It is obviously necessary and desirable. The trouble with Clause 1 is that subsection (3)(a) ignores the interests of the child by assuming that parents will always make the right decision. I speak as <P>


<a name="column_1403"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1403</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the parent of a severely mentally and physically handicapped child. Parents do not always make the right decision and cannot be relied on to do so. Some parents may even assume that their child with learning difficulties is normal. That is wishful thinking on their part. Some personal pride may be involved sometimes. They may want people to think that their child is fully normal when that is not the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para16"></a>Subsection (3)(b) should not be overlooked. It says that a child must be educated in a mainstream school unless that is incompatible with,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the provision of efficient education for other children".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-04_para17"></a>
That incompatibility is rightly to be avoided, but the interests of the child should be considered as a separate issue when the decision has to be made.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para18"></a>On Report, I said that the needs of the child were paramount. Strangely, the Minister told me that I was out of touch. I was a little surprised, but not offended by her comment. The needs and the interests of the child are virtually synonymous. The interests of the child are paramount.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para19"></a>The proposition that I have put before your Lordships, following the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, is reinforced by the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is a massive document, but I need only trouble your Lordships with one or two brief references. Article 3 says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-04_para20"></a>
That is another way of saying that the interests of the child are paramount. The Government are committed to that proposition because their predecessors, with the approval of Parliament, very properly supported the convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para21"></a>Article 18.1 says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"State parties"--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-04_para22"></a>
that means governments--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall use their best efforts to ensure recognition of the principle that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of the child. Parents or, as the case may be, legal guardians, have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of the child".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-04_para23"></a>
That includes education. It then says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The best interests of the child will be their basic concern".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-04_para24"></a>
I hope that they will be the basic concern of the Government, too.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-04_para25"></a>I could refer in detail to Articles 28 and 29, which deal with education, but there is no need to do so. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, and my noble friend Lady Blatch have put forward strong arguments. I hope that the Government will bear them in mind.

<P>
<A NAME="10301-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the House will allow me to make a short intervention. I introduced the Private Member's Bill which was concerned with the amendments of the 1991 Act in the context of special educational needs. It was withdrawn on Report at the request of my noble friend Lady Blatch and subsumed in the 1996 Act. As it stands, this <P>


<a name="column_1404"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1404</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>clause derogates from the spirit of the Private Member's Bill and from what was put into the 1996 Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-05_para0"></a>From a practical point of view, as a lawyer who was concerned, as I was then, in many such cases, I can tell your Lordships that very often the best interests of the child are in conflict with the evidence given as to the wishes of parents or as to the provision of efficient education for other children. It is idle to pretend that that is not the case. In effect, that is what this draft asserts, and it is an inhumane nonsense.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-05_para1"></a>Perhaps your Lordships will forgive me, but I have been involved in three other Bills in the Chamber and could not attend to this one. However, my noble friend Lady Blatch will tell the House that I took up this point with her at the outset. It stands out immediately as one of the most important defects in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-05_para2"></a>One has only to think of the position in which one found oneself when dealing with these cases in practice at the Bar. The LEA must consider the evidence of the experts--the educational psychologists and educational "this and that". If reports are produced which support A and B but a report from an expert states that certain recommendations are not in the interests of the child, that puts the local education authority in an impossible position and it also puts the courts in an impossible position because of the Children Act. The whole thing is an errant nonsense. I beg the Government to attend to this matter and to do the right thing by the children.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, my name has already been used in support of this amendment but it has been noted that it has not been added to the list of those who support the amendment. In Committee I argued strongly that we should include an extra caveat in Clause 1(3)(b). Having read the Bill, and taking what I consider to be a commonsense view of it, it seemed to me that the issue at the centre of this matter--that of inclusion--required that the best interests of the child should be considered.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-05_para3"></a>After I had spoken out so clearly in Committee, I was somewhat disconcerted to discover that that was not the view of the consortium. Indeed, the consortium lobbied hard and put it to me that the phrase "the best interests of the child" had been abused by local education authorities, which pushed children into education that was not suitable for them.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-05_para4"></a>I listened to what they had to say. Nevertheless, I returned on Report and argued that we should support the concept of "the best interests of the child". On that occasion I put forward three arguments. First, I said that I was, as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, mentioned, concerned that the two caveats that were included could be diametrically opposed. I said that we needed what one might call an "intermediating" caveat and that "the best interests of the child" was the appropriate one.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-05_para5"></a>Secondly, I argued--here I picked up the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Baker; I was, and still am, in agreement with him--that we do not believe that <P>


<a name="column_1405"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1405</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sufficient resources are being put into financing special needs in schools. Therefore, if resources were insufficient, it was again necessary for the best interests of the child to be considered.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-05_para6"></a>Lastly, I was worried by the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, in relation to vulnerable children, many of whom would perhaps benefit from a special education. If there were to be a presumption in favour of mainstream schools, such children would be overwhelmed in those schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-05_para7"></a>Yes, we have shifted our position, and there are three reasons why we have done so. First, we have received assurances from the Minister, which I hope she will repeat today, that the agenda behind these subsections is not to shut down special schools and special support units for those who need them. The interests of vulnerable children, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, are best served by a more sheltered educational environment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-05_para8"></a>Secondly, from the discussions that I have had with lawyers, I understand that this Bill is overridden by the Children Act and by Schedule 27 to the Education Act 1996, which deals with the statementing process and puts the best interests of the child at the forefront. Therefore, it is unnecessary for the issue of the best interests of the child to be included on the face of this Bill because--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I should be obliged if the noble Baroness would give way for a moment. Yes, technically it is overridden. But cannot the noble Baroness see that a conflict arises and that that conflict creates a practical problem to which I rather ineffectively sought to refer? That is the difficulty.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, the advice that I have received is that there is no conflict. As I said, this Bill is overridden. We should also take into account the fact that this issue is overridden by the implications for the interests of the child as set out in the European Convention on Human Rights. Given the weight of legislation which points in this direction, from a totally practical point of view I still find it somewhat illogical that we cannot have the issue set out on the face of the Bill. However--this brings me to the final, and, so far as I am concerned, clinching, point--the advice that I have been given from the consortium and from the disabilities lobby is that this clause has been used as a let-out time and again by local education authorities and has been abused--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-05_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. Does she agree that some parts of the disability sector, particularly the RNIB, have supported quite strongly, and have appealed to us all to support so far as possible this afternoon, the best interests of the child and have urged us to ensure that that is included on the face of the Bill?

<A NAME="10301-05_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I agree that the RNIB is anxious that we support this amendment. However, that is not the case in respect of other parts of the disability lobby.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-05_para9"></a>A considerable majority of those who were consulted in the consultation process that the Government undertook felt that the "needs of the child" caveat should be dropped. I cannot say that the decision to shift our ground has been easy because there are strong arguments on both sides that have to be balanced. The balance that we reached is that we are not going to support the amendment because the Government have given appropriate assurances--the relevant provision is already in place to ensure that the best interests of the child will be taken account of; that will be the paramount consideration when decisions are taken. There is not an unwritten agenda in the provisions to get rid of special schools.

<A NAME="10301-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, I had intended not to take part in this debate but I sat through the first part of it. I will not comment on the merits of the case because I have insufficient knowledge of it but I am bound to say that having spent 20 years in this place, I have never heard such a total recantation from a Front Bench spokesman in relation to an issue as important as this between Committee stage and Third Reading. Frankly, the complete change of view is bewildering.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Baker of Dorking: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, for tabling the amendment and congratulate him on moving it so eloquently. I also thank the Minister for the letter that she sent me after the Bill's Report stage. Her letter dealt with some of the anxieties that I had raised in Committee and on Report.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-05_para10"></a>I wish that I could be as grateful to the Liberal party. Few noble Lords spoke more eloquently in Committee about the best interests of the child than the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. On Report, she surpassed herself and spoke with even greater eloquence about the best interests of the child. Why this sudden change? She said that she met some lobbyists who said that the proposal would be a major source of abuse and that if the amendment were agreed to, local education authorities would resist inclusion in schools. What evidence does she have to support that claim? I was a Member of Parliament for 30 years and in all of the cases involving special educational needs that I dealt with, the situation was always the other way round. Parents used to come to me and say, "I have not got my child into a special school". I did not come across one case in more than 30 years in the three constituencies that I represented in which the situation was the other way round; parents did not ask, "Could I please have my child sent to a mainstream school?".
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-05_para11"></a>I do not know what evidence persuaded the noble Baroness or how many cases she came across that convinced her that a major area of abuse was involved. I can only echo the words of the noble Lord, Lord Marsh. The House inevitably has the impression that the Government have whistled and that the Liberals <P>


<a name="column_1407"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1407</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have come to heel. We expected them to support this amendment on Third Reading. Was not it Lloyd George who referred to a person who had sat for so long on the fence that the iron had entered the soul? Such leadership on the part of the Liberal party is simply dither and wither. The noble Baroness has not shifted her position slightly; she has totally reversed it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-05_para12"></a>I want to explain why it is important to agree to the amendment. Those of us who raised this matter in Committee and on Report are particularly concerned about seriously disabled children; that is, those who, in the jargon, suffer from low-incidence disability. That refers to those who are hard of hearing to the extent of being deaf, those who are visually impaired to the extent of being blind, those who suffer from congenital diseases such as cerebral palsy or Asperger's syndrome and those who are very severely physically disabled. By any standard, those children need special education of one sort or another. In Committee and on Report, I set out the degree of support that such children need. It involves very expensive education. Those children tend to be statemented--nearly all of them are--and about half of them are provided for by special schools. It is the other half--those who are provided for by LEAs--with whom we are concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-05_para13"></a>I am not against inclusion so long as LEAs provide the support and help that those children need. Some LEAs can provide that, but I say to the Minister that there is a mass of evidence to show that many do not do so. She knows that that is the case. I suspect that the Minister will resist that consideration on two grounds. First, she will say that it is unnecessary to include in the Bill the phrase,

She is nodding, so I anticipate that that will be one of her arguments. She will point to the code, which is infused with the phrase. In that case, why cannot it be in the Bill? Page after page of the code is about the best interests of the child. However, the code is only a code, and it does not have a statutory obligation attached to it. Our approach--we have argued this before--is to give a statutory entitlement to the parents of a severely disabled child to take into account the best interests of that child. I cannot see why the Minister does not want to agree to the amendment. I hope that she will jump up and say, "Of course I accept the proposal", but I doubt whether she will. Her failure to do so conflicts with the rest of her policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-05_para15"></a>We must secure a statutory obligation in the Bill to support the code. The Minister knows perfectly well that a code is only a code and that LEAs are expected to observe it. If they fail to do so, there is an elaborate procedure--it amounts to a great palaver--which eventually involves complaining to the Secretary of State. Most parents of disabled children would not want to take that on. The amendment would be an added protection to severely disabled children and their parents.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-05_para16"></a>The second argument that the Minister will use is that used by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp; namely, that abuse of the Bill will be involved. I do not think that that will happen. The procedures that the Minister <P>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1408</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will set up under the code, which has no statutory significance, will give parents the right to appeal and complain and to go to a "newer" person--an IPS or parental support adviser.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-05_para17"></a>I fail to understand why the Minister cannot agree to the amendment. It is clear to many people in the disability lobby that it contains a necessary right that all children should have. I hope that we shall win today and that the Government will have a change of heart in this regard. I fail to see why they object to the proposal. The Minister knows as well as I do that we share the same interests; we both want to secure the best interests of the child. However, we want the amendment to be added to the Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="10301-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, I want to make one or two brief points about the position that we on these Benches are adopting.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-06_para0"></a>We entered into discussions with the rest of the educational needs consortium about our position with an open mind and we did not expect to emerge in the position that we have adopted. Our minds were changed by open discussion. To be perfectly honest, that was rather tougher than what we are going through today. It is not pleasant to be told that you have got it wrong, even if one is told that by a knowledgeable group of people.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-06_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Baker, said that he had not come across people who said, "I do not want my child to be entered into a special school". My experience is the other way round. I do not claim to have had that experience for as long a period as the noble Lord mentioned and it may have been in relation to other disabilities. However, I suggest to him that we are arguing over inches; but such fights are always some of the dirtiest and nastiest, because one is in close, using elbows and teeth.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-06_para2"></a>The fact is that we adopted our position in response to the arguments. My noble friend said that there were reservations and doubts in this context. This is probably one of the most honest positions that we have ever found ourselves adopting. It is uncomfortable. I hope that noble Lords appreciate that we did not adopt this position to get a short-term political advantage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, has the noble Lord the Minister or one of his Front Bench colleagues had a meeting since Report with the Minister?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure about being promoted to Minister at such short notice!
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-06_para3"></a>We have had meetings but not on this subject; I certainly have not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, "The best interests of the child count for nothing"; that is a pretty extraordinary statement to make, but that is exactly what the Bill currently maintains. If a local authority and an army of wonderful, well qualified and well intentioned advisers say that the best thing for a child is to go to a <P>


<a name="column_1409"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1409</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>particular special school but the parents say no, the best interests of that child will count for nothing. This Bill is absolutely explicit about that. There can be as much as one wants in the code but it cannot stand against Section 316(3). There can be as much as one wants in Schedule 27 but Section 316(3) stands in its way. I find it an astonishing proposition that a piece of legislation allows the parent to say, "No, that is absolute", whatever the best interests of the child may be.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-06_para4"></a>Complaint has been made that local authorities abused the earlier provision. Perhaps they did. If the best interests of the child are abused, then the tribunal is there to set it right. There are mechanisms in this Bill beyond the tribunal for settling such things by calm discussion. There are plenty of ways in which the best interests of the child can be enforced by someone other than the local education authority which may be dragging its heels because of financial interests.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-06_para5"></a>To put ourselves in the position where the best interests of the child count for nothing and where a parental whim stands in the way of proper education of a child is breathtaking. I am not astonished that the Liberal Party espouses it. I have been involved in Bills before where the Liberal Party has sold its principles, such as they are, extremely cheaply to the Government. I suspect that we will see many other occasions when that happens.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-06_para6"></a>I am saddened that the Government are taking this attitude. I had a greater regard for the attitude and sincerity of the Government in respect of educational needs and their care for the child. I know that they are plagued by the bad behaviour of local education authorities from time to time. We should not take that out on the child. What we do for the child should come first. If local education authorities behave badly, there must be a mechanism--and there is a mechanism in this Bill--for things to be set right. To provide no way out if parents behave badly and choose some course other than what is clearly best for their child--just in case authorities behave badly or because it may take a month or two to set things right through the tribunal--is truly regrettable. I hope that the noble Baroness has reconsidered and will find herself able to support the amendment.

<A NAME="10301-06_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Darcy de Knayth: </B>   My Lords, I have not spoken on Clause 1 before. My excuse for speaking now is that, having been in at the birth of Section 2 of the 1981 Act, I feel a certain concern about its progress.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-06_para7"></a>The 1981 Act was to ensure that, where possible, a child with special educational needs should be educated in a mainstream school. I acknowledge that my noble friend Lord Northbourne has said that he is totally supportive of the principle of inclusion. The caveats in Section 2 were that a child, where possible, should be educated in a mainstream school provided that this was compatible with the efficient education of that child, the efficient education of other children and the efficient use of resources.

<A NAME = "10301-06_para8"></a>It was in the 1993 Act--piloted through by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, in response to the Private Member's Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway--that the wishes of the parents were introduced. When the noble Baroness, Lady Young, explained Clause 2 at the Second Reading of what became the 1981 Act, she said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The pace of integration will continue to be gradual but I have every hope that the provisions in this clause will give it added impetus, for in the longer term it is only through educating children together that society's attitudes towards the handicapped will be fundamentally changed".

<A NAME = "10301-06_para9"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10301-06_para10"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has already spoken about the views of the Special Educational Consortium, which feels that there has been 20 years' experience rather than impetus. This caveat relating to the needs of the child has been a significant obstacle in obtaining a mainstream place. It has been used by LEAs as an excuse. Equally, it has been used by LEAs as an excuse to send children to special schools when parents preferred a mainstream placement. It contributes to the postcode lottery whereby it is much easier for a child in one LEA area to attend a mainstream school when their parents so wish it than in another. We all feel that the postcode lottery is very wrong. I stress that in no way is the Special Educational Consortium against special schools where appropriate and where the parents wish it. We all want the individual needs of children to be met more closely within the educational system.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-06_para11"></a>Many large organisations are part of the Special Educational Consortium. Many of those organisations, for example Barnardo's, are concerned with the welfare of the child primarily even before education. They are convinced that the legal framework is already in place; that it is sufficiently clear; and that the caveat provides a sticking point. The raison d'etre of those organisations, surely, is the needs of the child.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-06_para12"></a>I respect my noble friend Lord Northbourne and his knowledge and commitment. The problem is that special educational needs cover a hugely disparate group of people. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, knows more than anyone about special educational law. So do the noble Lords, Lord Baker of Dorking and Lord Campbell of Alloway. I hope that the Minister can convince my noble friend that his amendment is not necessary; that putting the needs of the child in that particular place is not a good thing; and that there is provision elsewhere. I hope that my noble friend will not insist upon his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-06_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness not agree that if there is a legal obligation on the face of the Bill to meet the best interests of the child, and that that can be challenged at the tribunal if there were abuse, there would be no scope for abuse? It would be a legal obligation to do no more or no less than meet the best interests of the child.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-06_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Darcy de Knayth: </B>   My Lords, as I understand it, that is provided for elsewhere in the Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="10301-06_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, we have heard some strong language and a great deal of laughter. I suggest that we pause for thought before we accept the strong words and the laughter at face value. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, spoke extremely well. The purpose of his amendment is admirable. I congratulate him and those who have made such an outstanding contribution to this Bill--the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, and the noble Lords, Lord Baker of Dorking and Lord Renton. There have been significant contributions from people who know what they are talking about. Those contributions have been very helpful. I have not always agreed with them and I have often disagreed with the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. The easy phrase,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the best interests of the child",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-06_para13"></a>
sounds great. Is it necessarily so? There has been incredulity expressed about how people can change their minds. In a democracy people can change their minds. How can one argue with the phrase,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the best interests of the child"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-06_para14"></a>
The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, made a very brave speech. I disagree with all the mockery. It takes a lot of courage to come to this Chamber and say, "I have been persuaded. I was wrong. I have changed my mind". I admire what the noble Baroness said and what she has done.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-06_para15"></a>The noble Baroness was persuaded by the Special Educational Consortium. The consortium consists of a group of people who have practically devoted their lives to disability. They know the problems intimately and are deeply concerned. They have briefed Members on both sides of the House in order to help with this Bill. If the consortium, in its considered view, believes that this amendment is not the right way forward, we should at least consider that view carefully, without the laughter, the mockery and the derision.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-06_para16"></a>If the phrase,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the best interests of the child",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-06_para17"></a>
has been abused by local authorities and others, we should be extremely careful and pause for thought on this matter. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, more or less said, "so be it". But if children are discriminated against by local authorities through the abuse of that phrase, then that should be a matter of serious concern to this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-06_para18"></a>My conclusion is that there is no point in being upset and indignant about an amendment, attacking the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, as though they are doing something wrong. The whole thrust of this Bill is to help disabled children. It is an admirable Bill. It has been welcomed on all sides of the House. So those allegations that the Bill attacks disabled children are preposterous. I shall give way to the noble Lord.

<A NAME = "10301-07_para1"></a>But if that happens, the courts have jurisdiction and have exercised that jurisdiction in many cases in which I have been concerned. If the phrase appears on the face of the Bill, parents have the prerogative to take the matter to the courts. That is why we want it on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord raises a fine technical legal point. Trust a barrister or solicitor to bring up such a point. In fact, when children's rights are abused, the parents are afraid of the law. They often do not go to the law and the abuse stands. It does not help to point out the fine legal definitions. The fact is that abuse takes place and it is up to us to stop it. If this amendment helps that abuse to take place, we should not accept it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-07_para2"></a>I do not condemn the amendment. I admire the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne. But I suggest that we should pause for thought and not mock the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, for changing her mind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-07_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I want to begin by reiterating what the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, and my noble friend Lord Ashley of Stoke said. I greatly admire the contribution that the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, makes to this House generally on this kind of issue, and in particular the contribution that he has made to the passage of this Bill through this House. I hugely respect the passion and conviction with which he spoke on this amendment. However, I am afraid that I shall disappoint both him and noble Lords on the Conservative Benches.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-07_para3"></a>The Government will resist this amendment. We have given a huge amount of thought to this issue. It is not a matter we have simply entered into without considering the pros and cons. It is deeply unfair of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, to suggest that the best interests of the child can go for nothing. Of course they cannot and of course they should not; nor do they.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-07_para4"></a>The whole of this Bill is about the best interests of the child and meeting them. It is about making special educational needs provision better. It is about improving the tribunal system. It is about ensuring that more resources are available in our schools for children with disabilities or special educational needs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I entirely accept that. I totally agree with the Minister. I admire this Bill and this Government for introducing it. But why, in that case, is the phrase,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the best interests of the child",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-07_para5"></a>
specifically excluded from this part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-07_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, let me try to explain. It will be helpful if I can go through the issues without too many interruptions; it will make for a clearer exposition.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-07_para6"></a>Amendment No. 1 is presented as a measure to ensure the right response for children who have statements. As I have already said, that is what we all <P>


<a name="column_1413"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1413</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>want and I respect the motivation behind it. But it suggests by implication that the Government are not concerned about the interests of children with statements. Perhaps I can say to the noble Lords, Lord Baker and Lord Lucas, that I can understand that superficially it might appear contradictory for the Government, who have campaigned ceaselessly to raise standards for all children and especially those with special educational needs, to oppose this amendment. But the amendment reinstates a provision equivalent to the first caveat of the existing Section 316.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-07_para7"></a>As was said by the noble Baronesses, Lady Sharp and Lady Darcy de Knayth, that particular caveat has been gravely abused. If we accepted the amendment, we believe that the practical impact on the ground would be that children who should and could benefit from inclusion will be prevented from gaining a mainstream place. My noble friend Lord Ashley of Stoke was absolutely right in making that clear.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-07_para8"></a>Perhaps I can also say at this stage of the debate that I support my noble friend Lord Ashley in what he said on the Liberal Democrat position. It is grossly unfair when we go through debates in this House--it is a courteous institution--we listen to each other, we consider the arguments and we sometimes change our position, and then are derided for so doing. I have changed my position on a number of matters in relation to this Bill and brought forward concessions. That is how we operate in this House. It is unfortunate that a political party which changes its mind should be derided for so doing.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-07_para9"></a>It is wrong to suggest that we are pursuing an aggressive inclusion policy that fails to safeguard children with SEN. Our proposals provide for both excellence and choice; they ensure that inclusion is based on sound foundations; they protect the interests of individual children with SEN and all pupils.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-07_para10"></a>Perhaps I can reiterate what I have said on several earlier occasions during the passage of this Bill. Inclusion is not an agenda to close all special schools, or indeed special schools in general. We have signalled a vital and continuing role for that sector. Its overall size has remained more or less static since January 1996. It continues to take around 1.2 per cent of pupils who have special educational needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-07_para11"></a>The needs of children who have statements are not jeopardised by dropping the first caveat of the existing Section 316. I explained on Report that it would be wrong for Section 316(3) to refer directly to the needs or best interests of the child because that could be abused. Equally, we firmly believe that safeguards exist elsewhere to protect children with statements.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-07_para12"></a>Let me take one example of how the caveat has been abused. The Special Educational Consortium highlighted the case of a girl with Down's syndrome. Her inclusion at a primary school was extremely successful. But when she came to transfer to secondary school, the LEA directed her towards a special school, one which happened to be miles away. It claimed that the mainstream school could not cope with the needs of that child. The LEA did not consider what could be <P>


<a name="column_1414"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1414</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>done to facilitate a mainstream case. That child's parents had to battle for a whole year to persuade the LEA that a mainstream school could cope. Eventually the child was welcomed into a mainstream school.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-07_time0"></A><H5>4.30 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-07_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness not agree that that makes our point that the LEA did not meet the best interests of that child? At the end of the day the best interests of the child were met. If the provision was on the face of the Bill it would be unequivocal and there as a statement in support of the best interests of the child.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-07_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   No, my Lords, I do not agree with that because the LEA sheltered behind this caveat. It took the wrong position about the best interests of the child against the primary school experience of that child and against the parents' wishes. I believe that everyone concerned now agrees that the mainstream can provide for some children's needs effectively. If the amendment were accepted, an LEA would be able to use it to argue--I return to the girl with Down's syndrome--that it was not in the best interests of the girl to attend a mainstream school because it could not cope with her. That was its claim. Not all parents are well placed to challenge such judgments. Vulnerable parents are often intimidated by professionals. That is a fact we should always bear in mind.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-07_para13"></a>Our proposals require maintained schools and LEAs to justify why a child cannot be included. In future they will have to demonstrate that reasonable steps could not be taken to prevent inclusion being incompatible with the efficient education of others. When parents object to mainstream provision or want a special school place, the duty imposed by Section 316 to educate their child in the mainstream is immediately lifted. Clause 1 does not make it harder to gain a place in a special school, whether maintained or non-maintained.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-07_para14"></a>I return to the position mentioned by the noble Baronesses, Lady Sharp and Lady Darcy de Knayth, of the Special Educational Consortium. The position is clear. As my noble friend Lord Ashley of Stoke stated, the SEC believes that the amendment is unnecessary. It feels that the retention of a provision similar to the existing first caveat would be open to further misuse. In Committee the Opposition were keen to highlight what the NUT had to say. Perhaps I may draw the attention of noble Lords to the NUT's briefing for Report, which stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Union believes that the proposal to strengthen the right of a child with special educational needs to a place in mainstream education strikes the right balance ... The Union believes that if these proposals are weakened or removed the process of inclusion could be set in reverse".

Reference has been made to the RNIB. The RNIB has been alone among all the disability groups in being concerned about this matter. I understand that it has now also changed its position. As I understand it, it wants reassurances, which I have repeatedly given, <P>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1415</B></P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, perhaps there is a misunderstanding. I received that information from the Special Educational Consortium, which I understand has been in touch with the RNIB about that matter. It is again unfortunate that notes of derision should enter into a debate on an important matter, and one which we can all discuss.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-08_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-08_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may continue, otherwise we shall never get through what is an important day of discussion. Let me be absolutely clear and review again the safeguards that protect the interests of individual children who have statements. The whole point of the statementing process is to ensure that children receive the provision which their learning difficulties call for.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-08_para0"></a>Statements specify the provision to be made. LEAs are then under a duty to arrange for provision to be made. We intend to enhance the guidance in the revised SEN code of practice to make clear that a statement could describe clearly all a child's special educational needs in full; set out the main objectives that the special educational provision aims to meet; specify clearly the provision required to meet each of the child's needs and describe the arrangements for setting short-term objectives for the child and any special arrangements for the annual review of the statement.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-08_para1"></a>It is important that we look at the 1996 Act, which the Bill seeks to amend. That Act has, at its heart, the needs of the child. Section 1 sits alongside the rest of Part IV and should not be read in isolation. Perhaps at this point I should mention to the noble Lord, Lord Renton, something which I said at Second Reading, as I do not think he was able to be present. The noble Lord mentioned the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. We believe that the changes to the SEN framework, of which the Bill forms a part, will ensure that the framework fully complies with the convention. Indeed, that is the legal advice we have been given. The noble Lord shakes his head. However, I want to give him that reassurance. Lawyers with expertise in this area have provided us with that reassurance.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-08_para2"></a>I return to Schedule 27 to the 1996 Act, which ensures that the individual needs of the child are taken into account in deciding whether to name a parent's choice of maintained school. Section 9 sets out the general principle that pupils are to be educated in <P>


<a name="column_1416"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1416</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>accordance with the wishes of their parents so far as that is compatible with the provision of efficient instruction and training. It enables local education authorities to safeguard a child's interest if they consider the provision suggested by a child's parents is incompatible with their efficient education or training.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-08_para3"></a>Where parents believe that an authority is providing inappropriate or insufficient provision or have not named a school that can meet the needs of their child, they have the right of redress to the SEN tribunal. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools has been asked to monitor the new inclusion framework. Once confirmed, that will help prevent any potential abuses and ensure that the needs of the child are safeguarded. Perhaps I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, that I thought he was being unduly pessimistic about the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-08_para4"></a>I also indicated on Report that the statutory guidance on the new inclusion framework will underline the need to ensure that the interests of individual children with SEN are protected and will set out the safeguards I have again explained today. We believe that our proposals strike the right balance and protect the interests of children. We therefore do not believe that it would be right to reinsert provisions that might be seen as equivalent to the old first caveat. I very much hope--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Baker of Dorking: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for giving way. The nub of her argument is that this could be a loophole for local education authorities to abuse the purpose of the Act. She quoted one example of Down's syndrome. With all the resources available to her department, perhaps I may ask how many other cases she or her department know about. Every Member of Parliament, including her ministerial colleague who was a Member of Parliament, will assure her that they know of dozens if not scores of cases in which LEAs have denied the best interests of the child by insisting that the child should go to a mainstream school where the provision is inadequate and when they should have gone to a special school. The abuse is mostly the other way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-08_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Baker, are not consistent with the consultation process and its outcome. We have consulted widely. We consulted those who represent the parents of children with special educational needs and statements. I cannot give a specific number; I do not know precisely how many cases there are. However, I know that those who have expertise in this area, those who have been affected by the previous legislation, take a different view from the Conservative Opposition. The noble Lord, Lord Baker, also referred to my noble friend Lord Davies of Oldham. He did say that he had had letters in the past from parents who wanted a special school place, but he has also said to me on more than one occasion that he believes that there is a change in what many parents want; that more and more parents want their children to be educated in a mainstream school if possible, and if the child can get a decent education.

<P>

<A NAME = "10301-08_para5"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, provided some examples of children sitting at the back of the class, not benefiting, being excluded and getting into trouble with the law, and so on. The whole statementing process is designed to ensure that children get the support that their SEN calls for.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-08_para6"></a>Section 317 requires governors at maintained schools to use their best endeavours to provide the special educational provision that children need. That means that children with SEN certainly should not be sitting at the back of the class, languishing and having their needs overlooked. I should be as concerned as he is if that happened. I do not believe that that will happen. Everything that we are putting in place, including substantial additional funding and extra training for teachers, should prevent that happening.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-08_para7"></a>In the light of the reassurance that I have been able to give, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, I have a short but important question. I want to ask the noble Baroness, as a Minister at the Dispatch Box, whether it is her understanding that if the LEA makes a wrong decision in the interest of the child, the tribunal may set it aside and quash it. If that is her understanding, what is the objection to including it on the face of the statute? It is a very simple question: I do not understand the objection.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-08_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I have already said that there are many parents who do not have the skills and knowledge of the law of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. To be put in a position where they have to fight an LEA in this way is very difficult. Let me end by reiterating yet again that the Bill has at its centre--just as the 1996 Act did--the needs of the child. That is why the amendment is not necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-08_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister, but, with the greatest of respect, she has not said anything new. I should like to try to be positive. We all want to achieve the same benefits for children. The problem is that many of us believe that the Bill does not say what we want to achieve. It is a badly drafted Bill, or, if it is not badly drafted, something is wrong with it. Sections 316(2) and (3) use the word "must". Several noble Lords have said, "But that is overruled by this and that is overruled by Section 27". I do not understand how the word "must" can be overruled in law. Perhaps someone can explain that to me.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-08_para8"></a>The Bill must be made to say what we all want; the Bill must be made to say what the Government want. I accept that the Government want what the Minister has said they want, but the Bill does not say so. I recognise that my amendment is by no means the only way in which the problem could be solved, but my amendment is before the House. I believe that there are a number of your Lordships who would like to express their feelings on this subject by voting. I want to test the opinion of the House.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is similar to one that I moved on Report. All I wanted then and all I want now from the Minister is a simple dictionary definition of the phrase, "education in a mainstream school". I did not receive a reply at the previous stage, but I hope to receive one now. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, seeks to define what constitutes mainstream schooling to ensure that dual placements are permitted. I have given many assurances that the existing arrangements, and indeed Clause 1 of the Bill, do allow for dual placements. The flexibility is there for children to be educated at a mainstream school, but to receive part of their education at another school.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para1"></a>I do not know whether I can give the noble Lord a dictionary definition of the term, but I believe that a mainstream school is any school which does not have special provisions for those with special educational needs. However, this amendment states that a child should be considered to be receiving education in a mainstream school if he is registered at that school and attends regularly. In return, perhaps the noble Lord could say what "regularly" means. The problem is that that term is awfully imprecise. It could be said that a child attends a school regularly if he does so only once a term, so long as he does that on a regular basis. This could be abused and could provide a significant loophole to block real inclusion. As the noble Lord knows, we are trying to encourage greater inclusion where parents want it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para2"></a>Noble Lords will remember the discussion we had on Report concerning the term "registered". We oppose the use of the term "registered" because it would allow a child to be registered at one school but taught at a totally different school. That is not inclusion. As we argued then, we believe that it is right for the vast majority of children with special educational needs to be educated in mainstream schools. We also believe that it is common sense for a child normally only to be considered as being educated in a mainstream school if he spends the majority of his time in that mainstream school.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para3"></a>I have already promised that we shall provide further advice on the use of dual placements--both for children who have statements and for those who do not--within the guidance that will back up the new inclusion framework. I should like now, again, to give an assurance that this Bill, as it stands, allows for dual placements. I hope that, having heard those assurances, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, it is clear that I am not going to be given what I want. It has never disturbed me if I cannot explain the exact meaning of my amendments, but if the Government cannot explain the exact meaning of their own Bill, that is not to be encouraged. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para4"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<A NAME="10301-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch </B>   moved Amendment No. 3:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, leave out lines 9 and 10.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-09_para5"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, unfortunately, the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, has been called away and thus is not able to move the amendment. As my name has been added to it, I shall do so on his behalf. I have given notice that I shall speak at the same time to Amendment No. 5.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para7"></a>I have brought back Amendment No. 5 for two reasons but, first, I should like to thank the noble Baroness for the way in which her staff have made themselves available to talk to my noble friend Lord Pearson of Rannoch, who has expressed concern about this matter. Unfortunately, he is out of the country. My noble friend sought a letter from the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, which has been forthcoming. In the absence of my noble friend, I should now like to record formally the contents of that letter in Hansard for Pepper v. Hart purposes in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para8"></a>Secondly, and more disturbing, is the legal advice I have received as a result of our previous debate in which we argued that the interests of the child should be made paramount in the wording of the Bill. We believe that, despite what the noble Baroness said about this clause and how it interacts with section 316 of the 1996 Act, the conflict has not been resolved. That is why my noble friend Lord Pearson of Rannoch said that he would be grateful to receive a letter from the noble Baroness to confirm that, while the Bill will make it easier for children with special needs to attend a mainstream school, it will also not make it any more difficult for statemented children with special educational needs to be supported by local education authorities at independent schools, if that is what their parents want and, of course, if that would meet appropriately the special educational needs of the child.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para9"></a>The noble Baroness sent a letter confirming that. For the purposes of expressing my aims in these amendments, I shall repeat the main body of the letter. It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Clause 1 of the Bill makes it clear that section 316 does not affect the requirement in section 348 of the Education Act 1996 that local education authorities should fund the placement of children with special educational needs at non-maintained schools if those schools are named in their statements, or if the authority believe that provision in a non-maintained school is necessary and the particular school is appropriate."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-09_para10"></a><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If a parent wants their child to attend an independent school, the duty to educate that child in a mainstream school imposed by section 316(3) is immediately lifted. If the LEA agrees that the child should be educated in a non-maintained school and name that school in the child's statement, the LEA will, under section 348, have to pay for that school. Nothing in section 316A is capable of affecting this. Section 316A qualifies section 316. It does not impose 'independent' rights or duties to the effect that a child can only be educated in a non-maintained school if the LEA is not funding that placement. It does not affect the operation of section 348 and there is therefore no need to make provision to that effect."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-09_para11"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para12"></a>My Lords, it is important that that is put on the record and that it is confirmed by the Minister as the Government's view.
<P>


<a name="column_1425"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1425</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para13"></a>I want to move on to the more disturbing advice that I have. My noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway, who is not in his place, has come to the same view, and he has more legal qualifications than I do. I am very much in the hands of others to advise me. If, as the noble Baroness has said, Section 348 will not be affected, why is Section 316A part of it, if the cost will be met otherwise than by a local education authority? What are the conditions under which that provision would apply if the local authority believes that it is in the best interests of the child, it is consistent with the wishes of the parent and the educational needs of the child, that an independent place is sought and the LEA is free to pay for that place? There is no getting away from the words in the Bill. They are either not necessary, or they are necessary because of the situation that the Government envisage, and the LEA would like to send a child to an independent school. Clause 1 states that
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'mainstream school' means any school other than ... a special school, or ... an independent school which is not ... a city technology college ... a city college for the technology of the arts, or ... a city academy. ... Section 316 does not prevent a child from being educated in ... an independent school which is not a mainstream school, or ... a school approved under section 342, if the cost is met otherwise than by a local education authority."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-09_para14"></a>
In other words, the local education authority is not permitted to spend money on a place in an independent special school. What will prevent a local authority from paying for a place in an independent school, especially if that is what the LEA wishes to do? The position is totally baffling. I sought advice from an eminent QC who said that the Government have it wrong and that my interpretation of the Bill and that of my noble friend Lord Pearson of Rannoch is right. There is a serious conflict. The noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches will almost certainly hold the Government's hand in the Division Lobby, so the chances of beginning to resolve the matter in favour of the legal advice that I have is pretty remote. At least we could have the fall-back position of including these words in the Bill, so that a legal challenge could be successful in court. I beg to move.

<A NAME="10301-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I can be reasonably brief in response to Amendment No. 3 because the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, read out the letter accurately, which has now been put on the record. That was largely the substance of the reply that I would have given, so she has already extracted that from the letter, dated 27 February.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para15"></a>We have visited these matters before, and she will know our anxiety about the amendment and why we oppose it. Amendment No. 3 would fatally undermine Clause 1 and new Section 316. The amendment would have virtually the same effect as including independent schools, including those approved to cater for children with SEN and non-maintained special schools in the definition of mainstream schools. Clearly, they are far from what we mean by mainstream school in the context of Clause 1. How can we say that a child is being educated in a mainstream school as part of the general inclusive perspective of the legislation, if he is <P>


<a name="column_1426"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1426</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sent to a non-maintained special school? Clearly, that would not be inclusion. The reason that we are resisting the amendment is because it would produce that effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para16"></a>The rest of the issues raised by the noble Baroness were largely answered by her when she quoted the letter from my noble friend the Minister. I can reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, that if parents want their child to attend an independent school, the duty to educate that child in a mainstream school imposed by Section 316(3) is immediately lifted. If the LEA agrees that the child should be educated in a non-maintained school and names the school in the child statement, under Section 348, the LEA will have to pay for that school. Nothing in Section 316A can affect that. That section qualifies Section 316. It does not impose independent rights or duties to the effect that a child can be educated only in a non-maintained school if the LEA is not funding that placement. The provision does not affect the operation of Section 348.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para17"></a>I hope that I have succeeded in clarifying the issues raised by Amendment No. 3, which was grouped with Amendment No. 5 by the noble Baroness. Amendment No. 5 has rather more substance. I know the intention behind the amendment because we have had these debates before. I shall touch briefly on its technical deficiencies, not that that is the main thrust of my argument. The amendment refers to "disproportionate expenditure", which is a phrase that does not have much meaning in legislation relevant to SEN. When it deals with financial matters, it is generally phrased in terms of "efficient use of resources" and "unreasonable public expenditure". Even if we were to accept the amendment, it would be of doubtful use in construing provisions couched in those terms.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para18"></a>When looking at what the amendment is designed to achieve, I believe that LEAs must be allowed to decide what would be most suitable for each child. Less costly provision can often serve the child as well as, and sometimes even better than, a more expensive alternative. Provided that the LEA can meet the child's needs in full at a more reasonable cost, surely it should be free to do so. LEAs are not required to make Utopian provision for some children but are obliged to make suitable provision for all children with SEN who need it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para19"></a>If the amendment's intention is to ensure that LEAs do not simply refuse a parental preference on the grounds that the place was more expensive than comparable provision, it is not needed. Under Section 27 of the Education Act 1996, which the noble Baroness knows very well indeed, a parent is free to express a preference for any maintained school, including a special school. Parents can also make representations for any non-maintained school to be named in their child's statement. LEAs must comply with a parental preference unless the school is unsuitable to the child's age, ability, aptitude or special educational needs, or the placement would be incompatible with the efficient education of the other children with whom the child would be educated, or with the efficient use of resources.
<P>


<a name="column_1427"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1427</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para20"></a>So cost is clearly not the only factor. The cost of an individual placement, compared with other appropriate placements, will be one of the elements when considering whether the placement represents an efficient use of resources--but only one. That ensures that an LEA does not simply refuse a parent's preferred choice of school because it is more expensive than other types of provision. If a school is unsuitable for a child, an LEA could not make it suitable by demonstrating that it was cheaper than the other options.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para21"></a>Where a child's needs can be appropriately and effectively supported in more than one type of provision--for example, either in a mainstream school or in a maintained or non-maintained special school--it is important that we listen to what parents want.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para22"></a>It is important also that the cost implications are considered. We believe that it is right that LEAs should seek to use their resources efficiently. Whether determining a parental preference made in accordance with Schedule 27 or the representations made by parents for an independent school, cost must be considered. If it were not, the interests of all children could be jeopardised. Excessive or inappropriate expenditure on one child could come only at the expense of the learning opportunities of other children.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para23"></a>I should point out also that LEAs seeking to make an efficient use of resources do not necessarily have to settle on the least expensive provision available for a child. The one does not always equate to the other; for example, it might be an efficient use of resources to opt for more expensive provision in the short term so that a child needs less help, and therefore, of course, less funding, in the longer term. It is right that LEAs should be able to consider each case on its merits.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para24"></a>There are safeguards where parents feel that a local education authority may be abusing the system and refusing even to consider a more expensive option. Where they consider the content of a statement of special educational needs to be unacceptable, then they may appeal to the SEN tribunal. The Secretary of State for Education and Employment may investigate other complaints about possible unreasonableness or failure to act in accordance with a statutory duty. We would hope, however, that the new arrangements for resolving disputes between parents and local authorities will help to ensure that practical solutions acceptable to all parties are reached informally and quickly.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-09_para25"></a>This amendment, therefore, would impose a quite unnecessary straitjacket on LEAs and I hope that in the light of what I have said, the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="10301-10_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, it is difficult to come back on this amendment without reminding the House that we have just voted against including, as a primary aim of the Bill, the best interests of the child. The whole import behind my amendment and that tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, is to say that local <P>


<a name="column_1428"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1428</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>education authorities should be entirely free--with the criteria in the Bill that it must be consistent with the educational needs of the child and the wishes of the parent--to make appropriate provision, whether in the independent or mainstream sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-10_para0"></a>Teachers and head teachers have already said that they want to achieve the Government's aim in this Bill. In moving these amendments, my intention is that we should not give way to the dogmatists one way or the other--those people who believe that there should be more specialist, special schools in the independent sector or those who believe that there should be more inclusion in mainstream schools. We should always be interested in what is consistent with the educational needs of the child.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-10_para1"></a>The noble Lord did not answer the specific question which I asked him to address. What is the purpose of the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if the cost is met otherwise than by a local education authority"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-10_para2"></a>
What situation is that intended to address?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the point of that is to allow parents to send their children to an independent or a non-maintained specialist school when the LEA does not agree that they should go there. It leaves that position clear and that is the point of it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-10_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, there is nothing in law that prevents parents from sending their children, with or without special needs, to an independent school. We do not live in that kind of state. In this country, parents are allowed to make a free choice. There is absolutely nothing in the law, past or present, to prevent parents, trustees or third parties, if they are paying, from doing that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-10_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I need to remind the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, that we are at Third Reading. The Minister has answered the questions which were put. The noble Baroness appears to be waiting and I believe that the Minister feels that the reply has been given.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-10_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the reply was not complete. I was hoping that the Minister would complete his reply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, first, we are in danger of going back to a Committee discussion on this Bill. The point that I was seeking to make is that without Section 316A(1), Section 316 would prevent that. So Section 316A is needed to ensure that it does not obstruct the rights of parents, which is exactly the point which the noble Baroness was seeking to make.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-10_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, that has cleared in my mind what I should do. We live in a country which allows any parents in the land to send their child to any school they wish. If that school is not in the maintained sector, they are free to pay for an independent place without an LEA preventing that. Trustees and third <P>


<a name="column_1429"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>parties are also free to do that. The Government appear to have included in the statute a provision which prevents parents from doing that and they are now devising another caveat which allows parents to do that. I wish to test the opinion of the House.

<A NAME = "10301-10_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 4, I should also like to speak to Amendments Nos. 6, 8, 12, 13, 43 and 45 to 68. They respond to commitments that we gave on Report.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-10_para7"></a>Amendment No. 4 responds to an amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, on Report. The noble Lord sought to ensure that the guidance referred to at Section 316A(8) includes advice on the reasonable steps referred to at Section 316A (5) and (6). The guidance will explain the kinds of reasonable steps that maintained schools and LEAs could need to consider in order to prevent inclusion being incompatible with the efficient education of others.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-10_para8"></a>Amendments Nos. 6, 43 and 45 to 68 all relate to changes to Schedule 27 to the 1996 Education Act brought about by Amendment No. 152 tabled in my name on Report. Amendments Nos. 6, 43 and 65 to 68 are technical and consequential. Amendments Nos. 45 to 64 respond positively to further discussions that we have had with the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, about the consequences of the changes made on Report.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-10_para9"></a>The amendments require LEAs to follow the procedures in Schedule 27 to the 1996 Act, as amended by Schedule 1 of the Bill, whenever they propose changes to a child's statement. This will ensure that changes cannot be made without parents first having a right to a meeting with an officer of the LEA or, in cases where changes are proposed to Part 4 of their child's statement, typically in relation to the school named in the statement, to express a preference for a maintained school. They also cut down on the paperwork that would have been involved for LEAs, by not requiring them to issue a proposed amended statement following a periodic review.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-10_para10"></a>Amendment No. 8 responds to an amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. It amends Clause 5 to make clear that where an LEA concedes the parents' wishes on an appeal to the SEN tribunal, this should not be classed as a withdrawn case but as a case "resolved in the parent's favour". As I indicated on Report, we were considering how the clause might be amended to give this effect. I hope that we have fully met that request. The government amendment now being put forward will replace the word "withdrawn" with,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"determined in favour of the appellant".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-10_para11"></a>
The tribunal will not be required to make an order to this effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-10_para12"></a>Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 fulfil the commitments that I gave on Report to extend the ability to request an assessment of a child's special educational needs to providers of relevant nursery education covered by the early years development plans. The responsible body for such providers will be whoever is responsible for the management of the provider in question. Nursery education at maintained nursery schools is not covered by the amendment, as it is already covered under Clause 8.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-10_para13"></a>Amendment No. 13 also fulfils the commitment that I made on Report to add head teachers to the list of responsible bodies who can request assessments on behalf of schools.

<A NAME = "10301-10_para14"></a>These amendments will ensure that all those who make provision for children with special educational needs will have a common right to request an assessment where they believe a child to require it and LEAs will have a duty to consider all such requests.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for reacting to the amendments that we moved. Amendment No. 4 relates to being able to find out exactly where guidance is required. The same is true in relation to nursery education and access to information.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness for responding so positively to some of our concerns. Perhaps she will be able clarify some outstanding questions on the early years provisions. I hope that my understanding is right and that the points are covered.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-11_para0"></a>The first point relates to bodies in receipt of a grant. Will a provider of relevant nursery education be able to request a statutory assessment for a child under three, although a nursery education grant has not been received for a particular child? For example, child minders are not in receipt of a nursery education grant and may not all receive finance under an LEA's early years childcare development plan. Will the amendment allow them to request a statutory assessment of needs? If early years settings have been excluded, it would be good to know the rationale behind that. My understanding is that all early years settings are included. Is that with or without receipt of a government grant?

<A NAME="10301-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, Amendment No. 48 seems to have been included for the sole purpose of infuriating me. Its only other function is to make the legislation less clear. Under the schedule as presently drafted, sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) of new paragraph 2 contain the reference:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Before making a statement, a local education authority shall",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-11_para1"></a>
do various things,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If, following a statutory review, a local education authority propose to amend",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-11_para2"></a>
etc; and sub-paragraph (3) reads:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"But sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) are subject to sub-paragraphs (4) and (5).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-11_para3"></a>
That is not the most beautiful of drafting, but it is clear. Sub-paragraph (3) is now to be amended to exclude the reference to sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) and to read: "That is subject to sub-paragraphs (4) and (5)".
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-11_para4"></a>But what is "that"? "That" is usually taken to apply to a singular object, but we have two sub-paragraphs immediately preceding sub-paragraph (3). Does "that" mean sub-paragraph (2); or does it mean sub-paragraph (1)? Or does it mean both? It is inexact. It does not say what it means. I do not know how anyone interpreting the Bill is to begin to find out what "that" is.

<A NAME = "10301-11_para5"></a>The purpose of drafting, although it may not be in the ordinary English that we use, is to be exact. It is meant to be clear to someone reading the Bill exactly what is intended. All Amendment No. 48 does is make the intent unclear. I hope that the Minister can justify this change. I do not really see how she can. If the intention of the amendment is "But sub-paragraph (2) is subject to sub-paragraphs (4) and (5)", why not say so? If it means something else, how is anyone supposed to know that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-11_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Darcy de Knayth: </B>   My Lords, I do not know whether to welcome the amendments before the noble Baroness explains that point. I warmly welcome Amendments Nos. 45 to 64, including, for the moment, Amendment No. 48. The Independent Panel for Special Education Advice (IPSEA), of which I am a member, will be delighted with them. I thank the Minister for listening and for reflecting further on the points raised and for coming up with even more. I should particularly like to thank the officials in her department for the extraordinary amount of help and co-operation that they have given on these amendments. It is an immensely complex web of amendments. According to IPSEA's original suggestion, the provision for amending a statement and the provision for amending a statement following a fresh assessment would have been set out separately in the Bill. Possibly, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, would have been happier. However, I look forward to the Minister's explanation and I thank her and her department very much indeed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-11_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Addington, and to the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, for their remarks. We have tried to reflect their concerns in the amendments. I am glad that they are able to welcome them.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-11_para6"></a>In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, yes, the provision will apply to all early settings, regardless of whether they have a grant.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-11_para7"></a>Turning to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, the last thing I want to do is to infuriate him. That would be a great mistake. I want to try to please him wherever possible. I agree with his remark that drafting should always be exact.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-11_para8"></a>As I understand it, Amendment No. 48 simply removes the reference to statutory reviews, leaving new paragraph 2 to concentrate on the proposed first statements. I hope that that answers the noble Lord's question and that he will accept that we are only doing a bit of tidying up here and that we are not attempting in any way to irritate him or to make the provision less easy to follow.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10301-11_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, with this amendment we return to a theme that has been discussed previously, but one about which I feel strongly; namely, the independence of anyone who is to hear an appeal. It should not be accepted as read that a person hearing an appeal would be independent in terms of their connections with both sides of the appeal, those prosecuting and those hearing it. It is important that the person should not only be deemed to be independent, but that there is a requirement on the face of the Bill to that effect. The wording of my amendment may not be perfect, but there should be an obligation in law, on the face of the statute, for a person in that situation to be independent. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-11_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Baker of Dorking: </B>   My Lords, I should like to make a few points about this amendment. I very much support what my noble friend Lady Blatch said about the importance of an independent supporter. The interesting passages on the parent partnership services on pages 10 and 11 of the code of practice refer to the fact that a new arrangement is due to be introduced. I should be grateful to know when the Minister envisages that sort of arrangement will be established.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-11_para17"></a>Part and parcel of that arrangement will be the appointment of an "independent parental supporter". There is a small section on this in the code of practice at page 12. I fully support the appointment of this sort of person; it is, indeed, a very interesting appointment. It means that access to an independent parental supporter should be made available to all families who need one; for example, to support parents meetings or reviews and to provide a wide range of information on special educational needs--an aim that I fully support. It also says that the role of the independent parental supporter may be particularly helpful in enabling parents to make their contribution to the assessment in the statement and that it will help them understand the implications of any objective set within the assessment process.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-11_para18"></a>So here we have an independent person who will have no connection with the LEA or the child's school, someone who will in fact act as a sort of parent's friend. I am sure that that is welcomed on all sides of the House. The code goes on to say that that person should be fully informed about local and national policies. Can the Minister tell us how many people are likely to be appointed to this role? Clearly, it will have to involve more than one LEA, because 20 per cent of children are now registered as having special educational needs. That is an enormous proportion, but it is the average for LEAs. I imagine that there would have to be a team of independent parental <P>


<a name="column_1441"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1441</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>supporters. Can the noble Baroness give me some idea of how many she envisages will be needed after the system comes into operation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-11_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I have to confess that I am a little disappointed that we have returned yet again to this issue. I believe that our proposals to set up informal arrangements to resolve disputes have received widespread support. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Baker, for his support for this set of new arrangements. I should point out to him that the statutory parent partnerships will be started in September 2001, which is quite soon. However, there are already a great many informal, non-statutory systems in existence.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-11_para19"></a>The amendment calls for the independent person to have,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"no previous connection with the parents and the child, nor of any of the authorities involved in the dispute".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-11_para20"></a>
This means that LEAs will have continually to seek out and train new independent persons, which I do not believe would be terribly desirable. The role of the independent person is to try to move discussion along and help those in dispute to reach an agreement that is acceptable to everyone. It is the parties, not the facilitator, who decide on the terms of the agreement.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-11_para21"></a>Facilitating dispute resolution is all about chairing a meeting, managing the process, not the content, and encouraging people to express their views, as well as ensuring that everyone has his or her say in the matter. The facilitator does not determine who is right or wrong. Although many parents see these skills as being more important than the independence of the individual or his or her expertise in SEN, independent research carried out by the department indicated that they also want an independent third party involved. So parents want independence. We believe that our proposals will deliver that aim.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-11_para22"></a>The minimum standards in the revised code of practice will set out that the independent person must have no role in the decision taken about a particular child's case; and that he or she is unbiased and has the appropriate skills, knowledge and expertise, including an understanding of SEN. Guidance will also emphasise that the independent persons must be acceptable to all the parties involved. I believe that that is the real thinking behind the amendment, and that that is what the noble Baroness is seeking.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-11_para23"></a>However, if the noble Baroness looks at Clause 3 carefully, she will see that it places a duty on LEAs to make arrangements for avoiding or resolving disputes. That means that LEAs do not have to carry out dispute resolution themselves. We are encouraging them to work with other organisations in providing this sort of dispute resolution. We know that many LEAs are actively thinking about this in anticipation of the new duty. The noble Lord, Lord Baker, asked how many people we thought would need to be appointed. At present, the average number of independent parental supporters per LEA is about 10.

<A NAME = "10301-11_para24"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, also argued that independence will not be a defence against partiality. I argue that no one can legislate against an individual's partiality. We are all entitled to our own views; but what we must not do in these circumstances is to allow our personal prejudices to influence our professional roles. That is what we expect from anyone in public service. Should we now assume, from what the noble Baroness has said, that all these people bring their personal views to work with them? I do not believe that they do. They are professional people. I am sure that they leave those views behind. In the light of what I have said, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel--

I should like further information as to who appoints them, who will employ them, and so on.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-12_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness was helpful with that response. Again, it was slightly more unequivocal this time than it was previously. The noble Baroness picked up a point from what I said during the last stage of the Bill. I refer to the issue of partiality. You can have someone who is independent but you can also have someone who is partial. The example that I should like to put forward is that you could have someone who is publicly known as a fiercely strong supporter of integration at all costs. I have certainly received at least one missive from a part of the special needs sector saying, "Please support the eventual abolition of independence of specialist schools". Therefore, someone could be on record as holding that view: conversely, you could have someone who holds entirely the opposite view and who believes that all children should be in special schools and not in mainstream schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-12_para0"></a>The idea is to ensure that the independence goes a little further than someone who has the material contact, or a conflict of interest, with the local authority and/or a child. It is a matter of making sure that the partiality--the philosophical view that that person holds--is a case in point. I should point out to the Minister that some people who have been appointed by the Government over the past three years have very publicly known philosophical views about education and are in positions of judgment on local authorities. That creates an atmosphere of mistrust among people receiving those services. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10301-12_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the amendment now before us deals with something about which I feel most strongly. In fact, after re-reading what was said during the last stage of the Bill, I believe that my point has been overlooked. The main thrust of the Government's argument was that it would cause delay and, therefore, provision for a child would be delayed.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-12_para8"></a>I believe that it would be very much a minority of parents who find themselves in this position. However, I have in mind a situation where the actual drafting of a statement has taken so long, or is taking so long, that the parent scrapes together enough resources and manages to find a third party who will make special provision for the child in an independent school in the interim. However, the parents have, all along, wanted a mainstream place for the child. Finally, when the decision is made, the mainstream place has not been kept open because the authority wishes to fill it and because provision has been made in the independent sector, albeit that the parents can barely afford it or are making enormous sacrifices in order to sustain it. But nevertheless they would still like a place in a mainstream school. The LEA may disregard that. I am speaking to the wrong amendments. I am speaking to my next group of amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-12_para9"></a>I shall now address Amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11 which concern giving information to parents of children for whom no statement is made. We all know--many of us have had children in this position--of cases where a school identifies that a child has special educational needs which fall short of needing a statement. A typical example is a child who is having real difficulties learning to read. The school may decide that, given the difficulties that the child is experiencing, the child will be withdrawn from mainstream classes on a regular basis. Help is brought in from outside to help that child in special classes and the child is later fed back into the mainstream class.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-12_para10"></a>If special provision is to be made by a school for a child for whom no statement is maintained, the parent has a right to be told that that provision will be made. Often children who have difficulties learning to read are sensitive. It is important to discuss the fact that a child is to be withdrawn for special provision. I should have thought it goes without saying that the parent should be informed of that. If the parent has an objection to that, it is right that that objection should be heard. That process does not have to take a long time. A school can inform a parent that it is worried about a child and plans to make special provision for <P>


<a name="column_1444"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1444</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that child and would like to discuss the matter. If a parent disagrees with that, at least the informal resolution procedures can be used to establish what is in the best interests of the child. It is important to have that information. I should like to see that measure on the face of the Bill. I do not believe--as the noble Lord claimed at the previous stage of the Bill--that such a process would cause unnecessary delays for the child. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, as I said on Report, we would expect schools to inform parents at the time they begin making SEN provision so that if parents have concerns they can make them known early in that process. In that respect we are at one with the noble Baroness. I recall that on Report the phrase "Stalinist" was used with regard to our approach to these issues. I sought to rebut that remark on that occasion. I emphasise again today that, of course, we take seriously the interest of parents in the education of their children. The whole purpose of Clause 7 is to ensure that parents are aware that special provision is being made for their children so that they can contribute to that process and raise any concerns that they may have. However, our approach differs from that of the noble Baroness in that we believe that there has to be a sensible balance between parents' rights to express a view on their children's education and the obligations of schools to meet children's special educational needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-12_para11"></a>Parents of course have an important role to play in the education of all children, not just those with special educational needs. But except in particular circumstances--for example, in relation to sex education--parents do not have a statutory right to exempt their children from provision. Teachers do not have to agree their lesson plans with parents before taking classes. Were this group of amendments to be accepted, parents of children with SEN but without statements would be given exceptional responsibility in deciding the provision made for their children.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-12_para12"></a>To point that out is not to be dismissive of the role parents can and should play in the education of their children. However, I cannot agree with the way in which the noble Baroness emphasised--as she did on Report--that the parent
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"should be entitled to challenge and, if necessary, object to such provision if, for whatever reason, the parent disapproves".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-12_para13"></a>
That is not a balanced approach. The noble Baroness referred to abusing or neglectful parents who would be debarred from objecting to such provision. However, the amendments make no provision for that. Nevertheless, she suggests that all other parents affected by the provisions of Clause 7 should be able to object to the SEN provision for their children if they consider that provision--as she said--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to be unnecessary, unhelpful or just plain wrong".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-12_para14"></a>
The amendments would not only allow parents to object but would also allow them to prevent the provision being made until their objections are resolved. Unfortunately it is not just abusing or neglectful parents who can misjudge their children's best interests. What would a school be expected to do <P>


<a name="column_1445"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1445</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in such a circumstance, sit on its hands and leave a child's special needs unaddressed because "for whatever reason" a parent disapproves of the special provision that the school proposes?
Of course, where parents have special concerns--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, that is exactly what the Government are doing in new Section 316(3). They are saying that if the parent does not want the special provision to be made it shall not be made. If the Government think that that is how the matter should be dealt with, why not be consistent?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, contrary to what the noble Lord asserts, I maintain that the Government are being consistent. We are considering the identification of special needs and the way in which a school responds to that. The group of amendments that we are discussing concern that early phase of the process. I merely contend that at that stage it is important that a school should be able to consider the interests and views of parents. However, the decision to be taken on the provision of special educational needs should not be delayed unnecessarily, if only because--as I think the noble Lord would recognise--some special educational needs may require substantial provision. We also seek to ensure that there is adequate provision in schools for those whose special educational needs are fairly minor. Yet these amendments would establish a substantial degree of bureaucracy in cases where a school was taking relatively minor decisions on a child's educational needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-12_para15"></a>We are discussing the provision of education within a school. The noble Lord discussed the type of school, not the provision being made within a school. We are now discussing the education being provided within a school. We contend that the amendments, if accepted, would introduce an imbalance into a situation where one has to balance the needs of parents with the proper provision of education. A school, of course, also has considerable obligations in that regard.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010301/text/10301-13.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-13_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, first, the Government cannot have it both ways. When we have asked for time-scales to be tightened, the Government have always argued that they are realistic and sufficiently tight for LEAs to meet their obligation to children with special educational needs. Therefore, delay cannot be an issue. The Government are satisfied that those who are charged with resolving disputes can do so within a short time-scale.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-13_para0"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord ascribes to my amendments powers that are simply not there. We say that parents have a right to information about their child. I believe that in the case of any child who receives education which is different from that of the average child in a school, a parent has an absolute right to be informed that his or her child is receiving different provision. A parent also should have a right to ask why that is being done and, if they object to it, to challenge that provision. Some parents may find <P>


<a name="column_1446"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1446</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>another way to resolve the issue. When they know the problem, after amicable discussion they may seek another solution. That may take the pressure off the school to provide additional resources for special provision for the child. There are sensible reasons for parents to have the right to know that their child is being treated differently and to be given the opportunity to make other provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-13_para1"></a>Thirdly, the noble Lord spoke as though the parent has a veto. The parent does not have a veto. There will be a delay if the matter goes as far as the resolution procedure. However, the resolution procedure set out in Clause 3 is the informal in-house LEA resolution procedure, rather than the tribunal procedure, which could be completed within a week. The parents, school and/or the advisory service from the LEA could discuss the best interests of the child. The dispute can be discussed, the objections of the parents heard, and any alternative provision that the parents wish to make put forward. The notion that parents have a veto is not true. It is not the first time that the noble Lord has ascribed to amendments in my name on the Order Paper powers which are not contained within them. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<A NAME = "10301-13_para12"></a>On Report I referred to the catch-22 situation for parents. They wait so long for procedures to be completed which provide a statement for a child that at great expense, or having begged and borrowed from third parties, they make provision in the independent sector while awaiting a place in a maintained school. <P>


<a name="column_1447"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1447</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Those parents have a preference for a mainstream place. My amendments are modest. They recognise the LEA's difficulty in keeping a place open indefinitely or until the process is completed. The time limit proposed is that the LEA keep a place open for one half of a school term.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-13_para13"></a>After huge expense to the parents, great distress to the family, and perhaps to a third party which started to pay for the provision and cannot sustain such payment, the parents are placed in a difficult position if the LEA decides that the parents have chosen independent provision and it no longer feels an obligation to make provision. The amendment covers a situation which occurs only rarely; but when it does it causes distress.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-13_para14"></a>When a statement is made which illustrates that the child's needs are severe, provision should be made as quickly as possible. If the process takes a long time and the parent makes provision in the independent sector but wishes for a place in the mainstream school, some accommodation should be made. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Baker of Dorking: </B>   My Lords, on these Benches we failed to enshrine in the Bill a statutory entitlement for a child to a specific degree of provision. It is only fair to say that the Government are trying to gain that end, possibly by other means. I have received two helpful letters from the Minister since Report stage which are pertinent to this group and the previous grouping. They are inter-linked.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-13_para15"></a>Much of the detail is in the code of practice which is not debated. I do not suggest that we should do so now because there will be an opportunity to debate the code later although not to amend it, as Ministers know. We at least know the Minister's intentions. In her letter of 26th February, the noble Baroness said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"You asked particularly about what the final version would say on specifying the special educational provision for a child with a statement of special educational needs. I can confirm ... that the guidance will make clear that a statement should describe clearly all of the child's special educational needs in full"--
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-13_para16"></a>
it does so now; we accept that--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"set out the main objectives that the special educational provision aims to meet; specify clearly and in detail the provision required to meet each of the child's needs and describe the arrangements for setting shorter-term objectives for the child and any special arrangements for the annual review of the statement".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-13_para17"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10301-13_para18"></a>I had written to the noble Baroness, so I received another letter the following day. One has quick ministerial replies when the Bill is before the House. The letter of 27th February took us a little further and should also be on the record. It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"On the question of provision for children with special educational needs, Bryan Davies was, of course, responding to the particular circumstances you described. Decisions about the provision to be made for each child must always relate to their individual needs. I hope I explained in my earlier letter how we aim to develop the guidance in the final version of the revised SEN Code of Practice on specifying provision in children's statements".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-13_para19"></a>
This is important. These are the obligations which will be placed upon an LEA. The letter continues:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-13_para22"></a>
I am glad to see that the noble Lord the Minister nods. This will be a considerable obligation in future on education authorities.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Individual Education Plans are generally reviewed each term".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-13_para23"></a>
That should read "must be reviewed each term". The special school with which I am involved, and others, do so automatically. That should be strengthened in that regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-13_para24"></a>I have read out those consequences. They are now available to a wider audience. We cannot amend the code but anyone interested in special education now knows what the Minister has in mind. The implications are interesting. We on this side of the House, or those interested in special schools, are not against inclusion provided that the facilities, teachers and teacher support services are available. For children with acute physical and mental disabilities, this is a very expensive process. I know that the Government's mantra is that they will provide £220 million over the next three years. I think that I have the correct figure. It has been stated enough times by the Minister. It sounds an enormous sum of money. There are over 30,000 schools. That sum represents £7,300 per school spread over three years; £2,000 a year for all that I have just read out--special education for hard-of-hearing, blind or physically disabled children.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-13_para25"></a>We wish to flag up, without making it a matter of controversy, that we consider the Government have totally underestimated the financial consequences of this measure. It will be an enormous time bomb under any future Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer who will have to meet the obligations implicit in the Bill. I am not against that, because I believe that our society should give disadvantaged children the best education available, but the Government have not faced up to the issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-13_para26"></a>We now have on the record in Hansard what the Government are going to do. We shall make sure that they live up to it.

<A NAME="10301-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I shall reply to the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. However, following the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Baker, it is an interesting constitutional point whether one can amend a ministerial letter to change the law. He seemed to be doing that in part of his <P>


<a name="column_1449"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1449</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contribution. He will recognise that the aim of the letter was to explain as clearly as we can the obligations that we expect to put on schools. The issue of resources came up many times in Committee and on Report. We all know that the ideal world is never arrived at,because none of us has the resources required to bring it about, but we shall do the best that we can against the resources that need to be made available. As the noble Lord said, significant resources have already been made available. The noble Lord takes considerable pleasure in having received letters about that from us. I do not remember receiving a letter in such a short space of time under previous Conservative administrations. The noble Lord may have more persuasive techniques than I have, or we may be a more efficient and competent Government. I leave the House to judge.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-14_para0"></a>We continue to view the amendments as unnecessary. Clause 9 relieves LEAs of the duty to name a school in a statement only if parents have made suitable alternative arrangements. The intention is to make available to children who need them places that LEAs might otherwise have to hold open indefinitely, even though the children concerned may never take them up. As I have explained in previous debates, nothing in Clause 9 changes the fact that if parents cease to make suitable alternative arrangements for their children, the LEA will continue to be responsible for arranging special educational provision for the child.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-14_para1"></a>Nothing in the clause is intended to reduce the availability of maintained sector places for children with SEN. The noble Baroness has repeated the argument that she made on Report that parents may be in a catch-22 situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-14_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, on a matter of factual information, the amendments would not require places to be kept open indefinitely. I have specified half a school term.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I withdraw the word, "indefinitely", but for a period of time the place would not be available to another child who might need it. The burden of the case that we have presented in Committee and on Report is that local authorities are under an obligation to use their resources efficiently. Part of that must be to make available places for children with those needs and to ensure that, as far as possible, places are not kept open unnecessarily, although I accept the point that the noble Baroness has just made about the change from her previous suggestion.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-14_para2"></a>If parents disagree with the provision or school proposed by the LEA, they will make either stopgap arrangements or alternative suitable arrangements. Case law indicates that suitable arrangements must be intended to continue and be capable of continuing for a reasonable period. LEAs will be able to rely on the provision in the clause only if parents have made suitable arrangements. Otherwise the arrangements will be considered stopgap arrangements and the responsibility will remain on the local authority.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-14_para3"></a>If parents in that situation disagree with the provision or school proposed by the LEA and place their child in another school--as the noble Baroness said, it might be an independent school at their own cost--and then appeal to the tribunal to try to have that school named, they may be worried that any school place proposed by the LEA would be lost. However, if the tribunal agrees with the parents' choice of school, the LEA will be obliged to include that school formally in the statement. If the parents lose, the tribunal will be able to order the name of a different school proposed by the LEA or parent, including the original school, to be included in the statement. The original school may not be available, but requiring an LEA not to fill that place just in case, even for a short period--if the case went to the tribunal it would be a longer period--would be unfair to other parents who might want and need the place for their child.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-14_para4"></a>We do not accept that the amendments are necessary or desirable. As we have said before, the LEA will be under a statutory duty to make suitable provision in all cases if the parents are not making suitable arrangements of their own. By definition, stopgap arrangements do not count as suitable arrangements.

<A NAME="10301-14_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, again I am grateful to the Minister for his answer. We shall have to agree to disagree about this issue. I have two points. First, the department has been incredibly good about answering letters since Report. I record my thanks for that. However, I have had a request in for 18 months for information about education action zones. I am still waiting for the evaluation report.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-14_para5"></a>Secondly, like my noble friend Lord Baker, I am pleased that there is something on the record about resources that gives some reassurance. However, my noble friend had a Written Question printed in yesterday's Hansard asking for an estimate of the number of extra teachers and teacher assistants trained in special educational needs skills that will be needed to implement the Bill. There is a very long Answer, but it does not give the number of teachers that will be needed, or even an estimate. That may well link with the fact that a parent could be denied a place in a mainstream school simply because the financial appraisal of the Bill says that no extra staff will be required. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="column_1451"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1451</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be permitted in statute. The purpose of statute is to be clear. The use of the word "that" to link two clauses is perfectly good conversational English if there are two reasonably short clauses fairly close together. For example, one might say, "Noble Lords on the red Benches may have their eyes closed. That does not mean that they are asleep". Everyone understands that. However, if there is a larger or more complex clause in front, the only way to handle it in conversational English and still be understood is to repeat the subject of the clause rather than to use "that".
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-14_para11"></a>In statute, the convention has largely been to refer to a subsection by name. Indeed, in Clause 13, subsection (1) is referred to on two subsequent occasions. On both occasions, the word "that" could be substituted and, with much thought, someone could work out that "that" meant subsection (1). If someone applies a lot of thought and care to the matter, no exactness will be lost, but it causes people to stop and think about why the word "that" is being used rather than "subsection (1)", which is the way in which statutes are usually written.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-14_para12"></a>We employ a rather unusual version of English in statute. There may be something to be said for trying to write statutes in more ordinary English, but the Government have randomly decided that "subsection (1)" should be substituted by "that" if it appears at the beginning of subsection (2)--and only then--and that otherwise it is called subsection (1). That merely causes confusion. If the word "that" means "subsection (1)" and "subsection (1)" is the usual way in which such a reference would be made in statute, we should call it subsection (1) so that everyone knows that that is what is meant. Using the word "That", as is proposed, merely makes one pause and wonder whether it could mean anything else. After much thought, one decides that it must mean subsection (1). However, everyone could have been saved five minutes' work if the words "Subsection (1)" had been used in the first place. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-14_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I am rather surprised that the noble Lord has chosen to bring back this amendment yet again at Third Reading. As I explained on Report, "That" in new Section 28C(2) under Clause 13 refers to the duty on schools to take reasonable steps to ensure that disabled pupils are not placed at a substantial disadvantage. That is perfectly clear.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-14_para13"></a>I could take up the time of the House by giving other examples of where this drafting style has been used in recent legislation, but I shall not do so. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME = "10301-14_para15"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10301-14_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 18, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 35. These two amendments relate to the reasonable steps that need to be taken either by a school or, in relation to Amendment No. 35, by a further or higher education institution in order to comply with their obligations under Part II of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-14_para17"></a>We argued this issue both in Committee and on Report, and I do not want to repeat the arguments that I made then. However, I shall summarise them briefly. First, I have argued previously that it is unnecessary to have on the face of the Bill this detailed listing of the factors which underlie what "reasonable steps" will be. I have argued that the wording, and in particular that in subsection (4)(a), which relates to Amendment No. 19 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, is objectionable. In the words of the noble Lord, Lord Rix, in Committee, it provides, a "cop out" for both schools and further education institutions in relation to their obligations here.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-14_para18"></a>On Report, the Minister responded to my request by quoting a letter from the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, which dealt with the position of universities and encouraged her to keep the wording on the face of the Bill. My response to that was, "Well, she would do that, wouldn't she?". Coming, as I do, from the university sector, I know how poorly universities are placed in relation to disability. They need to do a great deal and I do not believe that they should be let off the hook in terms of those obligations. I fear that subsection (4)(a) does let them off the hook. Similarly, we argue that subsection (4)(g) is unnecessary because it duplicates the caveat which already appears in Clause 1(3)(b).
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-14_para19"></a>Finally, we argue that, in so far as it is necessary to spell out these matters, it is much better that they are put into the code of practice. That is what these two amendments seek to achieve. That is done in the case of the SEN part of the Bill. I am delighted that the amendment that we put forward in that respect, which suggested that there should be explicit mention of the guidance, is now incorporated into the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-14_para20"></a>The Minister said that one reason for wanting the guidance to appear at that stage and for rejecting the amendments that we put forward in Committee, where there might be an illustration of what "reasonable steps" were, was that any illustration would become out of date and that one needed flexibility. Again, we argue that putting the wording into the code of practice provides a degree of flexibility. Therefore, I repeat that this detailed guidance should not be on the face of the Bill but should appear in the code of practice. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="10301-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, many amendments have been moved today. The question that arises from them is whether the requirements should be on the face of the Bill or in the code of practice. Throughout the Bill, sometimes the Government have favoured one option; sometimes they have favoured the other. I can quite understand that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-15_para1"></a>My noble friend's opposition to Amendment No. 1 concerning whether the needs of the child should be placed on the face of the Bill was that it provided an excuse for local education authorities to abuse it. We all know that that abuse has taken place. However, that argument applies equally to these amendments--at least, I believe that to be the case. The duties on local education authorities and schools should not be prescribed rigidly on the face of the Bill. I believe that it is far better that they appear in a code of practice. That will encourage rather than discourage action and will provide the essential flexibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-15_para2"></a>I believe that the provision for disabled children in mainstream schools will improve enormously after this Bill is enacted, thanks to my noble friend and her many efforts. What is inappropriate or unreasonable today will become routine tomorrow. I believe that we need to allow for changes in the expectation of both schools and parents. We should not conceal the difficulties of the future but neither should we highlight them on the face of the Bill. Therefore, I believe that the best means are those spelt out in the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-15_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Wilkins: </B>   My Lords, I strongly support this amendment, argued so ably by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, and added to by the noble Lord, Lord Ashley. It seems that the right place for the guidance is in the code of practice. I strongly support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-15_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Darcy de Knayth: </B>   My Lords, I, too, briefly give my warm support to the amendment. In particular, I support Amendment No. 35 because SKILL, the National Bureau for Students with Disabilities, of which I am president, was particularly keen that the guidance should appear in the code of practice rather than on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="10301-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I gather from those paeons of praise that this is the coin for which the Liberal Democrats sold Amendment No. 1.

<FONT SIZE=3>No. 19, to be dealt with in another, and perhaps better, way. Therefore, my gloom will be lightened slightly if this amendment is agreed to by the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-15_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, for once I shall be able to please everyone who has spoken in this debate. When considering whether it is reasonable to have to make a particular adjustment, we firmly believe that it is right that a school or post-16 institution should have regard to any of the factors currently set out in new Sections 28C(4) and 28T(2) respectively.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-15_para3"></a>However, although we believe that there is no problem in those factors appearing on the face of the Bill, I accept that there has been much debate on the issue. We have listened very carefully to the points raised both in Committee and on Report. Given the strength of feeling and the fact that the DRC has confirmed that all those factors will be covered in the code of practice, we have decided that we can accept Amendments Nos. 18 and 35 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. Of course, that will have the effect of incorporating Amendment No. 19 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-15_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may pose one question. I do not object to such a meeting, but why was time found to have a meeting with the Front Bench of the Liberal Democrat Party when a meeting was denied to the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, to discuss matters in relation to this Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-15_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the reason was that the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, had already held a number of discussions on the issue that he raised on Clause 1. There have been no discussions either with officials or with Ministers about the matter raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford. Therefore, it seemed perfectly reasonable to agree to a meeting on that issue.

<P>

<A NAME="10301-15_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister very much indeed. We are obviously extremely grateful to her for conceding these amendments. I believe that the Bill will be the better for them.

<A NAME = "10301-15_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall be brief. The amendment relates to proposed new Section 28C(6), which makes no sense whatever. It is entirely otiose and the Bill would not lose anything if it were removed; in fact, throughout our deliberations on the Bill no Minister has given any explanation of the provision's importance. For the last time, I shall read it out. It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In determining whether it is reasonable for the responsible body to have to take a particular step in relation to that person in order to comply with its duty under subsection (1), regard shall be had to the extent to which taking the step in question is consistent with compliance with that request".

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1455</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
That provision should be taken out of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-15_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I believe that my noble friend explained in a letter that she sent to the noble Baroness that removing proposed new Section 28C(6), as Amendment No. 20 proposes, would nullify the effects of Amendment No. 21, which is tabled in the name of my noble friend and which I know the noble Baroness supports.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-15_para9"></a>It may be helpful to noble Lords if I make it clear that new subsections (5) to (7) of new Section 28C should be read together, as should subsections (3) to (5) of new Section 28T. When they are read together, the subsection to which the noble Baroness objects becomes much clearer. She insists on looking at such provisions in isolation; I am not sure why she does so.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-15_para10"></a>In addition, I reiterate to noble Lords what was said on Report. We want to make it completely clear to schools and institutions that, in discharging their duties under Clauses 13 and 28 to make reasonable adjustments, they should take into account any request that has been made to maintain confidentiality. The provisions in question--that is, new subsections (5) to (7) of new Section 28C and new subsections (3) to (5) of new Section 28T--will deliver that effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-15_para11"></a>For the two reasons that I have highlighted, we cannot agree to the amendment. We hope that the noble Baroness will agree that it is not necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-15_para12"></a>I shall also speak to the government amendments that are grouped with Amendment No. 20. Government Amendment No. 21, which appears on the Marshalled List in the name of my noble friend, takes forward the commitment that we made on Report to introduce an amendment to ensure that schools take account of requests that are made by disabled children to keep their disability confidential when considering whether it is reasonable to make a particular adjustment. The amendment takes forward the commitment that we made to noble Lords on Report.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-15_para13"></a>Government Amendment No. 21 will ensure that when considering a reasonable adjustment schools take account of a disabled child's confidentiality request, provided that the school reasonably believes that the child has sufficient understanding of the nature of the request and its effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-15_para14"></a>Government Amendment No. 37 mirrors for the post-16 sector the wording of Amendment No. 21. As noble Lords will recognise, that is being done purely to achieve consistency in the drafting of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-15_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, when I moved the amendment, I should have said how much I welcome Amendments Nos. 21 and 37. I did not regard them as being connected with Amendment No. 20 because confidentiality is a different issue. I am grateful to the Government for tabling them; they are much welcomed. Many noble Lords have spoken in favour of such amendments during the Bill's passage through the House.

<A NAME = "10301-15_para15"></a>I have read the Bill and Clause 13 very carefully. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The responsible body for a school must take such steps as it is reasonable for it to have to ensure that"--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-15_para16"></a>
various duties, which are set out in the clause, are complied with. However, subsection (4) states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In considering whether it is reasonable for it to have to take a particular step in order to comply with its duty under subsection (1), the factors to which a responsible body may have regard include"--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-15_para17"></a>
a whole list of provisions, which are set out in the Bill. The degree to which a body has complied or been seen to comply is implicit in subsection (4).
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-15_para18"></a>I continue to believe that subsection (6) is a gobbledegook passage. No doubt the Government's arm would be strengthened by the support of the Liberals if I tested the opinion of the House. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham </B>   moved Amendment No. 22:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 12, leave out lines 16 to 25 and insert ("must prepare, in relation to schools for which they are the responsible body--

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10301-16_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment and those grouped with it are largely technical, with the exception of Amendments Nos. 22 and 24, which fulfil commitments that we made on Report to extend the planning duty.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-16_para5"></a>Amendments Nos. 22 and 24 will widen the planning duty and help to meet the needs of all disabled children. The planning duty will now have three elements. First, LEAs and schools will have to plan to increase the extent to which disabled pupils can <P>


<a name="column_1457"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1457</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>participate in the curriculum. That will go beyond teaching and learning arrangements to include classroom organisation, timetabling and staff training. That is our response to the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, on Report. I understand that unfortunately he cannot be here today, but he has let my noble friend know that he is more than happy with the amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-16_para6"></a>Secondly, LEAs and schools will have to plan to improve the physical environment of the school for the purpose of increasing the extent to which disabled pupils can take advantage of education and associated services that are provided or offered by the school. I have already explained that that duty involves much more than providing ramps and lifts.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-16_para7"></a>Thirdly, and in response to amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, and the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, on Report, LEAs and schools will have to plan to improve the extent to which disabled pupils receive written information in an accessible way. Some noble Lords had concerns about the extension of the planning duty in that way. Let me make it clear that the new planning duty will not be burdensome. It reflects best practice on the part of some schools. For individual children who have statements of SEN, LEAs will have to arrange provision to meet their special educational needs. Under the reasonable adjustments duty, LEAs and schools will be required to think about the needs of individual disabled children. The planning duty will ensure that LEAs and schools take a strategic look at their provision for disabled pupils in general and will also cover matters which are not covered by the reasonable adjustments duty. We will produce guidance that will explain further what we expect LEAs and schools to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-16_para8"></a>Amendments Nos. 29, 30 and 31 are in response to an amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, on Report. They relate to the enforcement of the planning duty by the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales. They will remove unnecessary references to "powers" in proposed new Section 28M(1) and (4).
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-16_para9"></a>Amendment No. 32 is simply a technical amendment to Clause 25; it relates to the "Interpretation of Chapter I". It provides a definition of the term "parent" in Scotland, to mirror that which is already provided for England and Wales. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, I find this situation rather strange. A strategy is normally a plan for fighting a battle but the word is being used differently in this context. Amendment No. 22 uses the phrase, "an accessibility strategy", which one would expect, on first sight, to be a method of approaching a particular building or place. However, the amendment goes on to state:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An accessibility strategy is a strategy for, over a prescribed period ... increasing the extent to which disabled pupils can participate in the schools' curriculums"--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<a name="column_1458"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1458</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
and in other matters involving education. It goes on to state that such a strategy is for,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"improving the delivery to disabled pupils ... of information which is provided in writing for pupils who are not disabled ... An accessibility strategy must be in writing".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-16_para11"></a>
That is fair enough.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-16_para12"></a>I find this very unusual. I wonder if the noble Lord could tell us whether there is a precedent for using the concept of strategies that can be found in other statutes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-16_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Darcy de Knayth: </B>   I thank the Minister most warmly for Amendments Nos. 22 and 24 responding to an amendment moved and withdrawn by my noble friend Lord Rix in Committee and on Report. My noble friend is in Morocco and he trailed me as a most elegant and effective understudy at column 765 on 20th February--I am not sure that your Lordships are getting that. He also said that I would graciously accept the amendment as proffered by the Government. I am delighted to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-16_para13"></a>I can say that the Special Educational Consortium warmly welcomes the fact that the planning duty has now been widened to cover planning for access to the curriculum, to the physical environment and for access to information. This will benefit schools and LEAs by consolidating and building upon existing requirements, notably the inclusion statement in the national curriculum. The re-drafting of the clause by the Government creates a positive new emphasis placing a primary focus on access to the curriculum. I hope that the guidance will explain that this might include changes to teaching and learning arrangements, pupil groupings, arrangements for classroom support, curriculum organisation and adaptation, timetabling, staff training, school organisations and materials. This will allow LEAs and schools to plan to welcome children with a diverse range of disabilities. We also recognise the fact that there is significant funding via the Standards Fund and the Schools Access Initiative to support schools in welcoming young people with disabilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-16_para14"></a>I pay tribute to the persistence of my noble friend and thank the noble Baroness, the noble Lord, Lord Davies, and the Minister in another place for having listened and reacted so positively to these extremely useful and welcome amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-16_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Wilkins: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the Minister for the Government's amendment to Clause 14. The inclusion of provision for accessibility strategies and plans to include improvement of the delivery of information in alternative formats to disabled children within a reasonable time and taking into account their preferences is extremely welcome. It will achieve everything that the RNIB had hoped the accessible information policies would do.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-16_para15"></a>The combination of physical access, curriculum access in the widest sense and explicit reference to accessible information is a major step forward. Indirectly, the duties to plan to improve accessible <P>


<a name="column_1459"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>information for children will mean LEAs and schools are in a better position to meet the needs of parents for accessible information.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-16_para16"></a>I am grateful to the Government for this amendment that will help thousands of visually impaired and other print-impaired children. It will be a great support to teachers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-16_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, we endorsed both sets of amendments in Committee and at Report stage. I add my thanks to the Minister for responding so ably to them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, when the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and I were discussing our respective amendments before Report stage I told him that he would be lucky; that the Government would never go that far. The Government have gone further. I am delighted. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Rix, on his achievement. I am thankful for the small changes the Government have made at my prompting.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-16_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, there is never un-hallowed joy, is there? I delight in the commendations from the House for the amendments we have brought forward. I am utterly and totally stumped by the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, as to whether the word "strategy" appears in any other statute. I do not know the answer. I shall write to the noble Lord if our researches prove positive. I assure him--and he will have heard from noble Lords who have contributed to our intensive debates over a substantial period of time--that the amendments I propose are in response to widespread needs outside, well articulated at various stages of the Bill. We are responding to those needs and expressions of opinion.
<P>

("( ) In preparing their accessibility strategy, each local education authority must include the estimated costs, at current prices, of the implementation of such improvements, and must if the cost cannot be found locally, forward to the Secretary of State these estimated costs with a request for capital grant to cover those costs for the years in question.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I speak to Amendments Nos. 23 and 25. This is still on the issue of planning for planning authorities. At Report stage the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, said he feared that the effect of my amendments would be to erect barriers to increased accessibility to schools for pupils with disabilities. I asked him what that meant and I did not receive an answer. It would be helpful to know what are the barriers. If one is to plan and validate the plan--in other words, for the plan to materialise, and it requires resources to do that--the only way in which it will happen is to have a realistic view about what those resources are and at the end of the day to have those resources.
<P>


<a name="column_1460"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1460</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Davies, went on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The duty is to plan within the resources available to the responsible body".--[Official Report, 20/2/2001; col. 771.] 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-17_para2"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para3"></a>The very meaning of the word "plan" is that one is engaging in a planning duty to effect activity on into the future. It is not about the here and now. I know from my local authority experience and from colleagues who are still there grappling with so many issues that they do not know what their resources will be in the future. The noble Lord says that they do know. He went on to say that they have to plan within the resources available--although they do not know what they are--and that that is implicit in the Bill. It is not implicit in the Bill. There is nothing in the Bill that spells that out. The noble Lord said it did not need to be spelt out. To those who will have to implement the Bill in local authorities it does need to be spelled out.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para4"></a>The noble Lord also said that what was proposed would delay things and would be bureaucratic. That is not so. If the local authorities have to prepare plans and produce an accessibility strategy it is right that they should have some knowledge in order to be able to let parents know that this is what they intend over time. They ought to have some view as to what the costs are. If they do not know what the costs are, it becomes an aspirational plan only. If it is to be a realistic plan with a view to implementation, they ought to have a view about the costs. The noble Lord gives the game away by saying that they have to plan within the resources available. I believe the noble Lord is wrong. However, if he is right and is about to say it again, then the resources are known and they should be part of the information set out in the plan.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para5"></a>Finally, the noble Lord said at col. 771 that I had suggested in Committee that we were raising the hopes of people only to dash them. If we are only indulging in planning; if we disregard the actual costing of those plans; and if, at the end of the day, because they were not costed, they are not capable of being delivered because the resources are not there--I know we will have a reiteration of how much money is being made available but I am talking about the LEA's ability to plan and to deliver a plan--then hopes will be raised only to be dashed. I should like to think that it is consistent with what the noble Lord is saying; that what we are doing is creating a new duty and applying it in a commonsense way that reflects the reality of the schools. The reality of the schools is that they need to know that their local authorities are planning in such a way that they, as schools, can deliver. That means knowing the cost of what it is they are planning to do. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, clearly I did not persuade the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, in Committee or on Report of the Government's case on this important issue. I will strive to do so today by indicating that she upbraided me for saying that the amendments would create a barrier.
<P>


<a name="column_1461"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1461</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para6"></a>Our problem with the amendments is straightforward. We were concerned that the amendments would offer an excuse to some LEAs and schools not to act. They could blame their lack of action or will on the fact that the Government had not made a direct payment to them to carry out the work. That would undercut the planning duty and work against the inclusion of disabled children in schools, which is the whole basis of the Bill before the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para7"></a>We have said a number of times that we want LEAs and schools to plan for increasing access to schools for disabled children and to implement those plans. But we have been realistic. We require LEAs and schools to plan to improve access over time and from within the resources available to them. That is surely the best way of securing access to schools for disabled children in a way which meets the recommendation of the Disability Rights Task Force.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para8"></a>LEAs and schools have a number of sources of funding available to them and it is from within the total funding available to them that they should plan. As was said on Report, and as has been repeated by the noble Lord, Lord Baker of Dorking, who graphically recounted the precise sum, we are making available £220 million through the Schools Access Initiative for improving access to maintained schools. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, seemed somewhat unimpressed by that sum. But we had no complaints from schools, LEAs, the lobby or their representatives. In fact, the level of our commitment has been warmly welcomed by all in the field. I must point out also that this money will be used strategically by LEAs in partnership with their schools--the burden of part of the noble Baroness's representation was that schools needed to know that the local authority was planning intelligently, sensibly and creating the opportunities for them to meet requirements.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para9"></a>It is not the case that every school will receive a share of the money, regardless of need; it will depend on the plans that they put forward. For example, LEAs might plan each year to adapt another school in a particular area to allow children with a range of disabilities to attend; or they might adapt all their schools for a particular disability; or they might choose one of those approaches and also give themselves the flexibility to respond to emergencies; for example, when a child becomes disabled while at school and wishes to remain at their present school. They may decide to carry out access work on the back of other refurbishment at a school. That is a matter for each area and not for prescription.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para10"></a>It is wrong to say that LEAs cannot plan without first having the money in the bank. The Government are the first to have given LEAs notice of their future allocations. When we announce the breakdown of the £50 million School Access Initiative for 2001-02 later this month, we will give LEAs information about how we will allocate the grant for the subsequent two years when £70 million and £100 million become available. That will give LEAs an unprecedented forward view of the resources that they have to spend on access to their schools.
<P>


<a name="column_1462"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1462</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para11"></a>I understand that some will regard that amount as being inadequate. It cannot be adequate because the needs are enormous, and we all recognise that. But it is a clear basis upon which local authorities and schools can intelligently plan their improved access. We believe our planning duty will improve access by disabled children in every sector of schools education, and it will do so in a manageable way. That is the basis on which I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-17_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, it is not the first time, either today or on other occasions when we have been discussing this Bill, that the noble Lord ascribes to my amendments something which is not there.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para12"></a>First, in answer to my question on barriers, it was said that it would give the LEAs an excuse not to act. But they have no excuse not to act; they have a legal obligation to act. This Bill puts the LEAs under an obligation in law to produce plans. In fact Clause 14(4) also says that those plans will be inspected to monitor the degree to which they meet that obligation under the law. So there is no hiding place for LEAs in that respect and nothing in my amendment which will allow them to ignore their duty to provide an accessibility plan.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para13"></a>Secondly, accessibility is not only about ramps and means of accessing a building; if we accept the previous amendments, it is also about access to the curriculum and support staff. I have two points to make on that. The first is that paragraph 141 of the financial appraisal actually says that the special educational needs provisions of this Bill will have few manpower implications. So the Government already envisage that there will be practically no manpower implications.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para14"></a>I would argue that for children to be moved into mainstream schools they will need physical as well as financial support; they will need support staff; but there is no mention of that in the Bill. My noble friend asked the question in written form. He received a Written Answer. But the question still has not been fully answered. I ask formally at this Dispatch Box for the Minister to write to me, as the Opposition spokesman, with an estimate of the manpower implications of implementing the Bill. The plans will have to include the manpower implications.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para15"></a>The other point raised by the noble Lord is that LEAs will be given a period of time over which to achieve the plans. I accept that. That is what the Bill proposes. But the time is prescribed. At this moment LEAs have no idea what that prescription will be. I imagine that it will come from Whitehall and will therefore be Whitehall's view as to how long a school and an LEA will need to plan.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para16"></a>The noble Lord said that I am not impressed by additional resources. I have not said that at any stage of this Bill. I simply say that the noble Lord continually uses the extra finance as a defence. But he says it will not be spent on manpower because there are no manpower implications for meeting the special educational needs provisions in the Bill.
<P>


<a name="column_1463"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1463</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para17"></a>The noble Lord also talks about forward information to local authorities so that they will know on a school by school basis the precise sums of money they are to receive over the next two years. This is money that has been announced a number of times already and I have read all the information that went with each announcement. My understanding is that those announcements refer to physical alterations to buildings which will allow more access to people with special educational needs, particularly those with physical disabilities. So again I return to the point on manpower.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-17_para18"></a>It was not a satisfactory answer. The plans should be costed in the interests of the LEAs themselves and certainly in the interests of the schools. It is in the interests of government to know what they want to happen at the community level for young people with special educational needs. Because the Government have set their face against the plans being costed, I believe that they are in the business of raising the hopes of young people, possibly only to be dashed because they cannot be realised. But I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "10301-18_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I can be brief. The idea was put forward that the ultimate form of compensation should not be allowed to those who are discriminated against within the school system. I do not agree.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para6"></a>When looking at the amendments on the Marshalled List I feel that Amendment No. 27 is slightly more appropriate to this point than my Amendment No. 26.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the comment made by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, who has been helpful on this issue. Perhaps I may remind the House that the original amendment was for financial compensation in addition to the educational remedy. Because I always try to oblige my noble friend the Minister, and lean over backwards to oblige her, I have narrowed it down so that now it merely asks for financial compensation to be paid in exceptional circumstances; in other words, when there is no educational remedy available.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para7"></a>My noble friend's response on Report was uncharacteristically feeble. I was astonished that she put it forward. I am hoping for a different response this evening. I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Wilkins for moving my amendment, as I was unwell at that time. However, I am not grateful to my noble friend the Minister, who exaggerated some points and ignored others. She said that allowing for financial compensation would fatally undermine the ability of the tribunal to continue successfully. That is a tremendous charge. To fatally undermine a tribunal means to destroy it. That is what my noble friend claimed on Report.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para8"></a>Here we have a case where the tribunal awards a few thousand pounds to a disabled child because it suffered discrimination. The self-destruct button is pressed and the tribunal goes up in flames because it is fatally undermined, according to my noble friend. That is the end of the tribunal system. Does my noble friend really believe that payments or financial compensation in exceptional circumstances, a limited number, would fatally undermine the tribunal? I do not believe that. If she does, she should tell us what she thinks about the other tribunals which give awards without fatal consequences.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para9"></a>She put forward another argument on Report, in that there would be a tendency to focus on the financial remedy, rather than the educational one. But in virtually all the cases, it is only when the educational remedy is not possible that financial compensation will be considered. So that point has no real substance. Surely, the focus should be on the discrimination or the alleged discrimination. If that is proved, it is up to the tribunal to decide the appropriate remedy. If my noble friend really envisages parents rejecting an educational remedy and wanting cash, I put it to her that it would be bizarre for them to debate the type of remedy that they want. That is a matter entirely for the tribunal.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para10"></a>As to my noble friend ignoring some of the points, nowhere has she responded to repeated questions from noble Lords as to why there should be different policies for students and schoolchildren. I shall listen eagerly tonight in case she has simply forgotten those questions. But she also ignored the question of human rights. She claims that there would be few cases where the educational remedy is not possible for individual children. So, my noble friend acknowledges that there will be some cases. That is an important admission. We have been saying all along that there will be a number of cases where it is not possible to prescribe the educational remedy. Although that will concern only a few children, what about their human rights? Is my noble friend seriously suggesting that because there are only a few of them, we flout their human rights? If she is on that tack, I am afraid that she is sadly mistaken.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para11"></a>It is probable that there will be human rights cases concerning some of those children. If a case is brought in future, as it will be, and is lost by the Government, what will my noble friend do then? She is ignoring those questions but she cannot ignore a judge's ruling. I think that new legislation will be urgently required when that human rights decision is made because the current wording is specific. That leaves the Government up a gum tree. If they do not accept the amendment, they will be in trouble in future. As usual, I am trying to help my noble friend and save a lot of trouble. I hope that she appreciates that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para12"></a>I apologise for speaking for so long. My final point is made in the interests of flexibility. I suggest that the ability to pay financial compensation in the few cases I mention should be a matter for regulation and not on the face of the Bill. That degree of flexibility would help the Government and the children. I therefore commend the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-18_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Wilkins: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Ashley of Stoke put the argument comprehensively. I warmly support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I rise to speak to Amendment No. 28, which is a slightly different amendment. I do so on behalf of the Special Educational Consortium, which put it forward. On the last occasion the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, spoke to the amendment. However, on Tuesday afternoon when time was getting late she could not be found and I was asked to table it at the behest of the SEC.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para13"></a>The aim of tabling the amendment again is to try to tease out further the response given by the Minister on Report. The remedy available under the SEN and Disability Rights Tribunal could include taking account of personal hurt or experiences denied to a child who has been discriminated against or deciding on any changes that may be needed in the accessibility strategies and plans. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the discrimination does not happen again.
<P>


<a name="column_1466"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1466</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para14"></a>On Report, the Minister gave further reassurances that although the SEN and Disability Rights Tribunal had no power to order alterations to accessibility strategies and plans, the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales would have the power to call in an LEA's strategy or a school's plan and ultimately direct it to take the necessary action if it were acting unreasonably and had not carried out its duties. If necessary, it would be able to apply to the court for a mandatory order to enforce its directions. She also made it clear that Ofsted and the DRC would have a role in that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para15"></a>The Special Educational Consortium welcomed the reassurances but was concerned as to how the Secretary of State would come to hear of the inadequacies in the plans and strategies that would rectify individual instances of unlawful discrimination. Would it be left to individual parents to write to the Secretary of State or to the National Assembly following a successful appeal to the SEN and Disability Tribunal?
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para16"></a>How would such a referral from the tribunal be made where it considers that there is an instance of unlawful discrimination? Would that be a referral to the Secretary of State? Would the Secretary of State refer it on to Ofsted and the Disability Rights Commission? In sum, how would the communication work between the different parties with responsibility and oversight for those actions? We would be grateful for further clarification.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-18_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may briefly return to the subject of compensation. I need to persist in my fear that one exceptional circumstance can only possibly be dealt with financially. I refer to the situation in which a child has already been removed from a school. In that circumstance there is no educational remedy. I believe that a financial remedy is probably the only one available.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-18_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I am afraid that I shall disappoint my noble friend Lord Ashley of Stoke. We still believe that practical and educational remedies are the best form of redress for disability discrimination in schools. School-based education is the bedrock of what we do in later life, so it is vital that any educational problems are put right. Disabled pupils in schools are not being offered a second-best form of redress, and they are not being treated worse than disabled pupils and students in further, higher or adult education; they are just being treated differently.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para17"></a>My noble friend asked for the reasons for that different treatment. We have taken an institutional approach to disability duties. The nature of the relationship between a pupil and his or her school and that of a student and his or her college are rather different. Schools have a SEN framework that provides for special educational needs. Colleges have no such formal framework. Therefore, the disability provisions must provide relatively greater protection. There is no SEN tribunal operating as far as the post-school sector is concerned.
<P>


<a name="column_1467"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1467</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para18"></a>As I explained on Report, we believe that allowing for the possibility of financial compensation, even in exceptional circumstances, would undermine the ability of the tribunal to operate as successfully in disability cases as it has done in SEN cases. My noble friend Lord Ashley will perhaps note that I am not using the word "fatally" this time; I am simply saying that it would undermine it. Perhaps I went a little too far on the previous occasion. If financial compensation were available in addition to other remedies, the tendency would be to focus on the financial rather than the educational remedy and make less likely any positive change to the child's educational experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para19"></a>Where discrimination occurs in a school setting, we agree that there must be an appropriate remedy which takes account of the discriminatory behaviour. But there is another consideration--how best to ensure that people will seek that remedy. The importance of school education is such that the forum in which the remedy is to be sought must be one in which parents feel empowered to exercise their rights to challenge discrimination. Discrimination is destructive whenever it happens, but the repercussions of discrimination suffered whilst at school may last a lifetime. We must ensure that parents feel able to seek a remedy for their child. That is a necessary precursor to obtaining the remedy.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para20"></a>As I have said before, we want to make sure that the informality and user-friendliness of the tribunal is preserved. Giving the tribunal the power to award any kind of financial compensation would threaten to overturn the concept of the tribunal being user-friendly and being informal. Educational remedies will ensure that the money spent by LEAs and schools will go to benefit the child in the best possible way by directly improving his or her educational experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para21"></a>There will be very few cases where no educational remedy for the individual child is possible. But even in these cases, the tribunal can acknowledge their experience by making a declaration that unlawful discrimination has occurred--I hope that responds to the noble Earl--and direct an apology and a change to policies, practices and procedures to ensure that the school or the LEA does not discriminate in that way again. Children who have been discriminated against have said to me and to others that they want two things: first, an apology, and the Bill allows for that; and, secondly, they are concerned that the discrimination should not happen again. The Bill also allows for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para22"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 28. The first two factors that the amendment seeks to insert are matters for which the Bill already provides. The third factor is different. The tribunal will not have the power to order LEAs or schools to make changes to their strategies and plans. The tribunal operates in a child-centred and informal way, and asking it to review the operation of a strategic duty, such as the duty to plan, would sit badly with this.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para23"></a>There are three mechanisms that relate either to the enforcement or to the monitoring of the planning duty. I hope this answers the question of the noble Baroness. First, enforcement of the duty to plan will, in the first instance, be by the Secretary of State in relation to England, and the National Assembly for Wales in relation to Wales. The Secretary of State or the National Assembly will have the power to call in an LEA's strategy or a school's plan and will ultimately direct it to take the necessary action if it is acting unreasonably or has not carried out its duties. If necessary, they will be able to apply to the court for a mandatory order to enforce their directions.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para24"></a>The noble Baroness wondered who might refer cases to the Secretary of State. Parents and others can look at the plan and complain directly to the Secretary of State. The DRC could decide to carry out an investigation. Plans will be monitored by the department. Therefore, the Secretary of State's attention could also be drawn to deficient plans by officials.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para25"></a>Secondly, the Ofsted and other relevant inspection frameworks for LEAs and schools will form another layer of monitoring the duty.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para26"></a>Thirdly, the DRC will have a role in monitoring the duty too. As I have just mentioned, it could, if it thought fit, conduct a general investigation into the operation of the duty which could lead to recommendations for change.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-18_para27"></a>I hope that what I have said will persuade the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<A NAME = "10301-19_para15"></a>Most colleges and universities should have, and indeed already do have, procedures in place to try and ascertain if a student or prospective student has any disabilities or requirements. In many instances there are opportunities on the admissions form, such as a tick-box or at the admissions interview, to declare a disability or the need for extra support. This self-identification can then form the basis for a discussion with a student as regards his or her needs and how they will be met.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-19_para16"></a>I am happy to endorse such practices and to state our expectation that they should become universal. I accept the view expressed by the noble Lord that they are not universal at present and that more could be done. We would like the Disability Rights Commission to include relevant examples of good practice in the code. However, we should also look beyond the effects of this Act. To that end, I am now making a commitment that my department will commission good practice guidance to post-16 providers on what steps to take to ascertain the disabilities of their students. We shall involve bodies with expertise in this area in the drawing up of such guidance and seek to ensure that it is widely disseminated, including through relevant guidance produced by other appropriate bodies.

Since then, the noble Baroness has written to me explaining why the words, "as the case may be" are more appropriate than my amending words, "in Scotland". The noble Baroness stated that there will be "no ambiguity" about the powers of which courts are being described. She is correct, at least in the mind of a constitutionally well-informed reader. However, I would respond by insisting that it would be more helpful to general readers to insert the words "in Scotland".
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-19_para30"></a>It is likely that a Scottish reader would recognise the term "Court of Session" to describe the highest civil court in Scotland and would not confuse it with the High Court of Justiciary. However, although the use of the term, "High Court" is meaningful to English and Welsh readers, the use of "Court of Session" may not be so. Rather than use the unhelpful phrase, "as the case may be", why will not the Minister adopt the term, "in Scotland"? It would ensure absolute clarity.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-19_para31"></a>The term has been used earlier in the Bill, specifically in Clause 30(1) at line 23. Here the words have been used to differentiate legal terminology used in the two distinct legal systems:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"claim in tort or (in Scotland) in reparation for breach of statutory duty".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-19_para32"></a>
I hope that the Minister will relent for the sake of clarity.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-19_para33"></a>Further amendments tabled in my name have been grouped with Amendment No. 38. Amendments Nos. 40 and 42 return us to the question of how the codes of practice will be written. I fully accept that the Disability Rights Commission will write the codes of practice for schools and, separately, those for universities and colleges. At the end of our earlier debate, I expressed the view that there should be separate chapters for the three countries in both of the codes of practice for the purpose of ensuring that a <P>


<a name="column_1472"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1472</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>coherent description of the new anti-discrimination procedures will be fully understood in the context and the terminology of the three systems of education.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-19_para34"></a>I am anxious about the composition of the working groups charged with drawing up the codes within the DRC. Can the Minister give an assurance that there will be a separate Scottish working group rather than merely a couple of Scots tacked on to the English and Welsh working group? Furthermore, I hope that the working group will be instructed to write in the codes separate chapters covering Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-19_para35"></a>I shall not move Amendment No. 41, which has been included in this grouping.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-19_para36"></a>Finally, I shall turn to Amendment No. 44. First, I must confess to an error in the text. The amendment should refer to Sections 14 and 15. I apologise to the House that this amendment was not correctly retabled, but I hope that we shall be able to discuss the principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-19_para37"></a>The amendment returns us to an earlier debate in Grand Committee concerning whether it would be a good idea to make clear on the face of the Bill the fact that Sections 14 and 15, which impose a duty to plan ahead for accessibility, do not apply in Scotland. I contend that it makes good sense to ensure that the reader is absolutely clear about the status of Sections 14 and 15. At present they apply only to England and Wales, but they lie marooned in a sea of United Kingdom legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-19_para38"></a>When replying to this amendment in Grand Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, was at pains to point out that it was clear from the content and context of the sections that they could apply only to England and Wales. I can accept that argument as being technically correct, but it is far too obscure. A similar argument was advanced as regards Part I of the Bill; that is, that it can apply only to England and Wales because it amends England and Wales education Acts. I can accept that explanation as being technically correct but, once again, it is obscure.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-19_para39"></a>I have limited experience of the subtleties of legislation, but the position is now clear because the Minister has explained it to me. However, not only do most people not have much experience of reading legislation, the Bill is obscure as regards the legislative task that appears to await the Scottish Parliament, should it wish to legislate for such a planning duty--although so far the Scottish Executive has not committed itself. The only way that a citizen would know that Sections 14 and 15 do not apply to Scotland would be by having an in-depth knowledge of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998 and thus being able to determine that education is not one of the many areas reserved for the United Kingdom Parliament. Furthermore, an in-depth knowledge of education Acts would also be necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-19_para40"></a>Why do not Ministers want people in Scotland to be able to understand easily and accurately this piece of United Kingdom legislation? What advantage could possibly be gained by denying this straightforward clarification? I beg to move.

<A NAME="10301-19_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, may I say that I warmly support Amendment No. 38? The words "as the case may be" leaves the matter a little obscure. Obviously, Scotland should be referred to, and the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, is correct in moving his amendment, which I hope the Government will accept. The noble Earl has also tabled Amendments Nos. 40 and 42, and I hope that the Government will consider them sympathetically.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I, too, rise to support the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, first, because he has made a powerful case and, secondly, because those who have to read the legalese are left in great confusion about what does and what does not apply to Scotland. As the noble Earl said, people need to have an acute knowledge of the small print of the schedules before the matter makes any sense. His points on Clauses 14 and 15 were well made, and would make explicit what does and what does not apply in Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, for the considerate way in which he spoke to his amendments. I remember that he exercised a self-denying audience one early morning, for which all noble Lords were duly grateful. He certainly deserves as full a response to his amendments as I can give. My noble friend wrote to him about Amendment No. 38, following the Committee stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-20_para0"></a>The phrase "as the case may be" is in the Disability Discrimination Act, which is why it has been replicated in the Bill. I understand the point made by the noble Earl that things could be made a little clearer by referring specifically to Scotland. We have been guided by the Disability Discrimination Act, and there is a general presumption in statutory construction that Acts passed by the United Kingdom Parliament are intended to extend to the whole of the UK, unless there is an express or implied provision that part of the UK is to be excluded. Clearly, Scotland is not intended to be excluded from this legislation, which is why the phrase appears in the Bill in that way. I respect the support of the noble Lord, Lord Renton, for the amendment. He may be suggesting that the phrase is perhaps a little less felicitous than it might be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-20_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, may I say that the Disability Discrimination Act was passed in 1995, which preceded devolution.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, indeed it did, but we have followed the phraseology of the Disability Discrimination Act in this Bill because it relates to the main principles behind that Act, in so far as it refers to education.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-20_para1"></a>Remedies in cases of alleged discrimination on grounds of disability should be available in the Court of Session in Scotland and in the High Court in England and Wales. The amendment is intended to remove a supposed ambiguity in the reference to the "High Court" on the grounds that such a court also <P>


<a name="column_1474"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1474</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>exists in Scotland. However, we do not think that there is a possibility of confusion. The High Court in Scotland is the nation's supreme criminal court, and does not hear civil actions. On the other hand, the Court of Session is concerned only with civil proceedings, such as may arise out of the provisions of Clause 30 of the Bill. The term "Court of Session" is specific to the Scottish legal system, rendering the possibility of anyone being misled even more unlikely.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-20_para2"></a>Turning to Amendments Nos. 40 and 42, the Bill already confers power on the Disability Rights Commission to produce either Great Britain-wide codes, separate codes for England and Wales and for Scotland, or Great Britain-wide codes with separate chapters for Scotland. Disability discrimination legislation in education is new, so we need flexibility to ensure that we can pursue the option that will give the most sensible and effective result. However, as I explained in Committee, our present intention is to have two Great Britain wide codes, with one covering schools duties and the other covering post-16 duties.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-20_para3"></a>The codes will underpin Great Britain-wide legislation. While the education and legal systems in which the new duties apply are different, the duties themselves will be the same.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-20_para4"></a>I do not think that there is a fundamental difference between us. We both want codes that are relevant and which can easily be understood by users. However, there is a difference as to the best starting point to enable us to achieve this. A separate Scottish code would not be substantively different in legal terms from an England and Wales code. Therefore, we think that the best way to ensure the necessary coherence is to begin with codes for Great Britain. I know that the Minister for Disabled People has recently met with the lobby group, Children in Scotland, and others to discuss that point and that they were reassured about our intentions. I understand that Children in Scotland was particularly attracted to the possibility of having Scottish chapters in a Great Britain code.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-20_para5"></a>The noble Earl also asked about the preparation of these codes. The DRC is a Great Britain-wide body with a commissioner appointed specifically to represent Scottish interests. We have asked the DRC to consider how to ensure that the codes are made relevant to users in different educational systems. That might include the language used and the choice of examples. Experts in Scotland will certainly be on the drafting groups for both codes. My experience of Scottish contributions to any deliberations is that they are never sold short in their presentation of the needs of that country. There will be a Great Britain-wide consultation on the draft codes.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-20_para6"></a>We do not rule out the possibility that the DRC might produce separate codes for Scotland, or that Great Britain codes might include separate chapters for Scotland. The need for that will emerge as part of the drafting process. We want to retain the flexibility that exists in the Bill to allow us to consider the most sensible option.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-20_para7"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 44, I fully understand its intention. The noble Earl was extremely articulate in Committee about the necessity for it, and I responded to his representations at the time. Of course, we considered his further representations very carefully, but we do not accept that the amendment is necessary. The extent of the various provisions in the Bill is entirely clear. On the basis of my explanation, I hope that the noble Earl will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-20_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his full reply and the support given to my amendments by the noble Lord, Lord Renton and the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-20_para8"></a>I received the answers that I expected, and I am sure that the Minister is technically correct. It is true that the term "Court of Session" is well known. It is not only pre-devolution, but pre-Union. I am weakly reassured about the Scottish element in the codes of practice. I fully take the point that the duties will be the same, but they need to be expressed in a Scottish context. Again, I am weakly reassured that there will be Scots in the drafting groups. These codes of practice will eventually come before us for approval, so we shall have the opportunity to say what we think about the handiwork of the DRC.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-20_para9"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 44, I conclude by saying that the struggle for clarity in reserved powers legislation must go on. The Minister is undoubtedly technically correct but not clear. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-20_para10"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<A NAME="10301-20_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch </B>   moved Amendment No. 39:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-20_para12"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10301-20_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, government Ministers and noble Lords will know that I have some reservations about this clause. I was not involved in the detailed discussions on the Disability Discrimination Act nor the detailed discussions on this particular part of the Bill. Nevertheless, I remain concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-20_para14"></a>The clause allows for owners of buildings which are let for educational purposes to be compelled to make alterations to their buildings, even in situations where they disagree and, for one reason or another, do not want to make those alterations. Many defences are available but they are somewhat obscure as they are spelt out in legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-20_para15"></a>The noble Baroness was kind enough to write to me on this issue and she even included some of the extracts from the Disability Discrimination Act code. I have one or two questions on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-20_para16"></a>In the noble Baroness's letter, there is the following sentence:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Guidance contained in the existing Code of Practice on Part II of the DDA makes it clear that it would almost certainly be reasonable for the landlord of a building to withhold his consent to a particular adjustment which was likely to result in a substantial permanent reduction in the value of the landlord's interest in the premises".
<P>

<a name="column_1476"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1476</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Some five years on, we should have some knowledge of the working of the Act. In the light of that, what is "substantial", how is it judged and who makes that judgment?
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-20_para18"></a>I turn to the code itself. Paragraph 4.37 deals with the need to obtain statutory consent for some building changes. It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Employers might have to obtain statutory consent before making adjustments involving changes to premises. Such consents include planning permission, listed building consent, scheduled monument consent and fire regulations approval. The Act does not override the need to obtain such consents ... Therefore, an employer does not have to make an adjustment if it requires a statutory consent which has not been given".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-20_para19"></a>
Is there a statutory obligation on the owner of the property to seek such consent?
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-20_para20"></a>My final point is on the final paragraph of the noble Baroness's letter. She said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"You also asked whether the existing provisions of the DDA cover only minor alterations",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-20_para21"></a>
and then there is a full stop in the letter, which is the point of my question because the next sentence says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The answer is that these provisions are not so limited".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-20_para22"></a>
Does "these provisions" refer to the provisions of the DDA act or the provisions of this Bill? In other words, was I right in my assumption that the DDA act deals with only minor alterations and the provisions of this legislation deal with both minor and major alterations? I beg to move.

<A NAME="10301-20_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, this Bill consists mainly of legislation by reference to previous legislation. It is an amending Bill on a large scale.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-21_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry that the noble Baroness is still not quite satisfied with my responses. As I explained on Report and in my letters, Section 28W in Clause 31 is essential to ensure that a provider of post-16 education cannot use the fact that a building is leased as an excuse not to make reasonable adjustments. Without this clause, the physical adjustment duty really would be very much weaker. As regards leasehold premises, the provisions in new Section 28W mirror those contained in Parts II and III of the DDA.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-21_para0"></a>During our discussions on Report, the noble Baroness was particularly concerned that the provisions in Clause 31 would allow a college to make major changes to the structure of a leased building; for example, the major strengthening of floors or the <P>


<a name="column_1477"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1477</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>removal of Victorian architectural features. As I explained subsection (2)(c) of new Section 28W allows for a landlord to withhold his consent to the proposed alteration if it is reasonable for him to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-21_para1"></a>The existing code of practice on Part II of the DDA includes guidance which makes it clear that it would almost certainly be reasonable for the landlord of a building to withhold his consent where it was likely to result in a substantial permanent reduction in the value of the landlord's interest.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-21_para2"></a>I know that the noble Baroness is concerned to know how that provision has operated under the DDA. I am afraid that I cannot provide her with very much information about that but I am happy to write to her about it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-21_para3"></a>The code also clearly states that where a particular adjustment would cause considerable disruption or inconvenience to other tenants, the landlord would be likely to be acting reasonably in withholding consent. We expect the DRC to want to follow the guidance which it has already given in the Part II code when preparing the new disability code of practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-21_para4"></a>The noble Baroness also asked whether the existing provisions of the DDA cover only minor alterations. The existing provisions are not limited to minor alterations.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-21_para5"></a>As I have tried to make clear, whether consent can be withheld or whether conditions can be imposed where consent is given are governed under the existing DDA provisions by the test of reasonableness. I hope that all the detailed information that I have provided here will enable the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment. However, I shall write to her about that issue to which I do not have an answer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-21_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I should be grateful for a fuller written response to those questions which have not been answered. But "these provisions" being more limited refers to the provisions of the DDA as opposed to those contained in this legislation. They are mirrored and there is no distinction between the two. Secondly, I should be grateful if the noble Baroness will also cover in the letter whether there is a statutory obligation to seek consent. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 1, line 13, at end insert ("and to consult representatives of the security industry")
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-22_para3"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10301-22_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 1, with which it is suggested that we should discuss also Nos. 2, 2A and 12. These amendments seek in different ways to put into the Bill a requirement that the security industry authority, when set up, should have an obligation to consult the industry. They seek to insert the requirement into Clauses 1 and 6.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-22_para5"></a>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2A make it a general requirement, as one of the functions of the new authority, that it should consult. Amendment No. 2 provides specially for consultation when the authority is using its power to make representations and proposals for the improvement of standards in the industry and so on. Amendment No. 12 contains a specific requirement that it should consult when dealing with and publishing the licensing criteria. This is a vital matter, about which we have not heard very much so far.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-22_para6"></a>In fact, the specific question of consultation has been the one that has been most raised, to us at any rate, by representatives of the industry. That is not surprising. The Bill is very complex and it covers an extremely wide area: the licensing of guards, night watchmen, commissionaires, night club bouncers, private detectives, investigators, wheel clampers and so on. Many different sorts of people will be covered by the licensing regime, and it is difficult to see how the <P>


<a name="column_1481"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1481</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>authority will be able to have among its members representatives of each of these sections of the security industry, as well as independents. I think this is fully recognised. There is also a general assumption that it should have representatives of the police, who are much involved in all this. Local government also wants to be represented regarding its own responsibilities, and many people want consumers also to be represented.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-22_para7"></a>On St. David's day I think it is appropriate to say that the Welsh will surely want to have some representatives on the authority because Wales is included as well as England. Fortunately, Scotland is not involved and so it would not be included in this particular matter. It is right for the authority to have as members all these representatives, which is why the various bodies concerned are keen to be consulted and feel that there should be this obligation written into the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-22_para8"></a>There is a second point, which is that the Bill leaves an awful lot fairly vague. There is nothing in the Bill about the criteria. There are some general remarks about "fit and proper persons" and that sort of thing, but there is nothing at all that is specific. Many things are being left to regulations and future decisions, either by the Secretary of State, with order-making powers and so on to bring before Parliament, or for the authority to bring forward itself. Of course we are assuming that no criminals need apply, but there is not much to go on beyond that. We do not know what sorts of directions the Secretary of State will make; but we will touch on that matter in later amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-22_para9"></a>We do not know who the Secretary of State will leave out of these licensing requirements under Clause 4. He has the power to leave out whole varieties of people from these and other arrangements. The terms of the licence are also left to future decision. We do not know what fees will be charged, except that the suggested amount has already been trebled by the Government and there is nervousness on that account. Some of these matters will be for decision by the Secretary of State and incorporated into regulations and orders that will come before Parliament under the negative procedure. However, others will not; and so consultation will be required.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-22_para10"></a>The British Security Industry Association is concerned about the consultation. Indeed, it is more than keen to ensure that there is consultation on the matters to be decided by the Secretary of State because it hopes to be represented on the authority, I suppose. Of course there are numerous other bodies but they cannot all be represented on the authority. There is a Joint Security Industry Council and there has recently been set up, with the blessing of the Minister concerned, Charles Clarke, a National Security Inspectorate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-22_para11"></a>We all know that there are people in the Civil Service who are very secretive about what they are doing. The fear is that if there is no statutory requirement to consult such as would be inserted by these amendments, they might advise that there is no need for consultation and that it would best be avoided. <P>


<a name="column_1482"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1482</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>There is also nervousness on the part of some people who wonder whether they will be allowed to contribute to the consultation. I have had a note from the Association of British Investigators, a professional body, and also from the Institute of Professional Investigators, which is essentially a standard-setting body. They had attempted to feed in their thoughts on these matters and Mr. Clarke said that he was not prepared to talk to two bodies in this field. He said that they really ought to come together. Certainly there are strong links between them but they have slightly separate roles. They are now nervous about not being consulted in the future if they are not consulted now.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-22_para12"></a>Amendment No. 2A is a slightly more elaborate formulation: it is really a variation of Amendment No. 1. It provides in the first place for regular consultation with the industry and its stakeholders: we are not thinking solely of the directors. The word "stakeholders" is not actually defined but we know what is meant. It includes others within the industry, and they believe this would help to achieve the maximum consensus in the work of the authority. That would include, of course, the matters covered by Amendment No. 2: that is to say, proposing amendments to the law and also conducting research within the industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-22_para13"></a>Amendment No. 2A also provides that there should be a duty to promote the best practice within the industry. I believe everyone wants the authority to set the tone, as it were, for the industry and to work to improve standards within the industry as time goes on, particularly among the smaller and medium-sized enterprises.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-22_para14"></a>Lastly, Amendment No. 12 is of particular importance because it refers to Clause 6, which lays upon the authority the duty to prepare and publish a document setting out the criteria it is going to use. The question of the criteria, after all, is fundamental to the standards, and it is also fundamental as to whether a business can continue to function. So it is very important to people, and that is why I am suggesting that consultation on the criteria to be used is of the first importance.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Gladwin of Clee: </B>   My Lords, I have a great deal of sympathy with the intent behind the amendments. It is right that the authority should consult on how it will carry out the functions set out in the Bill. However, I am not sure that such a requirement should be on the face of the Bill. I am not sure that consultation should be restricted to the functions set out in paragraphs (b), (f) and (g) of Clause 1(2). There should be a well understood and transparent mechanism for carrying out effective consultation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-22_para15"></a>There are three ways in which this could be achieved. First, the authority could consult itself by having as its members representatives of the industry. I do not think that that would be enough, or effective. This is a disparate industry. The second choice is to have a committee of the authority, under paragraph 8 of Schedule 1, to which representatives of the industry <P>


<a name="column_1483"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1483</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would be appointed. But it would be a committee of the authority. A third choice would be to set up a separate advisory committee which was representative of the industry but independent of the authority, and which would be seen as the mechanism through which the authority would consult the industry and the industry would make representations to the authority--a two-way traffic.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-22_para16"></a>Will my noble friend the Minister agree to seek the views of the industry at an early stage as to what mechanism it would prefer? We can all make proposals, but at the end of the day it is for the industry to indicate to the Minister and to the authority the kind of mechanism that is needed. I should be against a loose, non-mechanistic way of consulting the industry. With this industry, it would mean that some people were left out. I believe that there should be a mechanism which is well understood and transparent so that people would know how to make their views felt to the authority; and there would be a requirement on the authority to consult the industry through an agreed mechanism.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-22_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, I support my noble friend's amendments relating to consultation. It is probably fair to say that the advent of governments consulting widely and fully has been one of the better developments in terms of open government and better regulation. Casting our minds back to the passage of the Regulatory Reform Bill through this House recently, we recall that a great deal of the debate related to the detail of how consultation exercises should be taken forward. Questions arose as to how detailed the provision on the face of the Bill should be as regards the mechanics of the consultation exercise, or whether it should simply occur.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-22_para17"></a>My noble friend's amendments are helpful in not being overly prescriptive. Amendment No. 12, for example, would provide that before issuing any licences the authority should consult with representatives of the security industry. That leaves considerable latitude as to how the consultation process should be taken forward. During the passage of the Regulatory Reform Bill, the Minister was concerned not to set the process in stone too early; he felt that circumstances could change, the Government's guidance on how the wider consultation processes should be taken forward might change and, therefore, one might be locking into the Bill what might become an outdated set of procedures. My noble friend has not followed that route.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-22_para18"></a>By including a duty on the authority to consult before it issues the criteria for licences--probably one of the most important decisions that it will make--it should consult with the industry. That much should be written on to the face of the Bill. It would make for stronger decisions--ones that would be less likely to be challenged, for example, in a court of law. Producing a document to indicate exactly what the criteria will be is of fundamental importance.
<P>


<a name="column_1484"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1484</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-22_para19"></a>Indeed, I would take the matter one step further. I suggest that if my noble friend receives a positive indication from the Minister, as I hope he will, he might also look at imposing a duty on the authority to consult before it issues revised criteria. If the amendment is good as regards the production of the original document, I am sure that the same arguments might well apply. There is often some resistance to consultation because of the effort and the burden that it places on those who have to perform the exercise. However, under these circumstances it is important that the authority gets the matter right.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-22_para20"></a>Whether, and to what extent, there is industry representation on the board of the authority is an interesting and important issue. Whatever degree of representation the industry has, the board will never, and should never, consist entirely of members from the industry. The authority must perform its proper statutory duty as a regulator. Therefore, it needs to obtain information from those who are at the cutting edge of what is going on in the industry on a day-to-day basis. Yes, it will include the industry's interests, and the authority's job will be to weigh those against the duties that are imposed on it by the Bill and by the Secretary of State. I support my noble friend's amendments.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-23_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Bassam of Brighton): </B>  My Lords, I am grateful to the three noble Lords who have contributed to this discussion. It has been useful and will help us later on. The noble Lord, Lord Gladwin of Clee has set out three ways in which he thinks consultation could take place. The noble Lord urges us to consult about consultation. That is helpful, as are the proposals of the noble Lord, Lord Cope, which in a sense indicate the areas about which we should consult.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-23_para0"></a>Perhaps I may move through the constituent parts of the amendments. In Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 12 and the first part of Amendment No. 2A, the establishment of the security industry authority as the central and authoritative regulatory authority for the industry means that it will need to consult in any event probably with all sectors of the industry to enable it to do all of the things referred to in the amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-23_para1"></a>In preparing to introduce the licensing regime and the approved contractor scheme in an efficient and effective manner, it will be essential for the authority to pay due regard to what is both practicable and achievable; and the industry will, as ever, be one of the prime sources of the information, as it has been during the generation of this piece of legislation. We have arrived at where we are through consensus.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-23_para2"></a>Similarly, the authority will be required to keep the work of the industry under review so that the Secretary of State can be advised on the effectiveness of regulation and make recommendations for improvements if and when they are necessary. Again, that would be absolutely impossible without an open line of dialogue with all parties of the industry. It has to be said that the Secretary of State will also work very closely with the authority and consider any <P>


<a name="column_1485"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1485</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>recommendations that it makes. We should certainly expect such recommendations to take appropriate account of the views of the industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-23_para3"></a>It may be helpful if I also take this opportunity of reassuring your Lordships' House that the Secretary of State will not be making any regulations without considering the views of both the authority and the security industry as a whole. Indeed, to attempt to do so would run the risk of introducing unworkable proposals. I do not believe that any of us would wish to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-23_para4"></a>We have made clear on many occasions that we see it as important for the board of the security industry authority to have one representative--perhaps more--of the security industry sitting on it. That will allow the industry a direct input into the workings of the authority, and will also have the benefit of ensuring that appropriate consultations take place. I believe that that deals with one limb of the suggestions made by my noble friend Lord Gladwin of Clee.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-23_para5"></a>The authority may also create committees in order to help it in its work. The committee structure is another way in which the voice of the industry will, and can, be heard. It may also be through that channel that it is most appropriate for the authority to hear the voice of employees in the industry--an issue, which, again, my noble friend raised directly with myself and officials. As the noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, observed, it will be important for the authority to ensure that it receives a balance of views now that its independence is not comprised or measured in any way.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-23_para6"></a>In order to achieve all of its aims the security industry authority will naturally need to work closely with all sectors of industry and listen. The second part of Amendment No. 2A places a duty on the authority to promote best practice. The authority has already been given a duty under the provisions of Clause 1(2) to set and approve standards and to make recommendations for their improvement. As part of those functions, it is inevitable that the authority will be promoting best practice. I am afraid that I am not convinced that this part of Amendment No. 2A adds anything to what is already a significant function for the authority; in other words, we believe that it is already there.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-23_para7"></a>The Government believe that adequate assurance already exists in the Bill as regards the points made in these amendments, in the way that I described. For those reasons, we do not consider it necessary to have such specific requirements spelt out on the face of the Bill, as suggested in the amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-23_para8"></a>One or two further points were raised during the debate in respect of which I should like to offer some reassurance. The noble Lord, Lord Cope, suggested that the licence fee had trebled during our considerations on the Bill. I do not believe that it has. We made it clear during the consultations on the White <P>


<a name="column_1486"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1486</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Paper that the estimate would be £23 for a licence. The current estimate is somewhere between £35 and £40, so the figure has not trebled--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   It has doubled!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   No, my Lords; I do not believe that it has doubled. Even at the upper limit it has not quite doubled. It has perhaps been increased by one-third. It will depend very much on how expensive the SIA becomes. I should like to correct one other misimpression that I do not believe the noble Lord intentionally created. He referred to discussions that Charles Clarke had with the Association of British Investigators and the Institute of Professional Investigators. The suggestion was that he had only talked to them together. He certainly met them so that they could discuss these matters together, and thereby submit any views that they wished to express. He was not seeking to make them merge or bring their views together in one view. I am sure that that was just a slip, metaphorically, on the part of the noble Lord.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-23_para9"></a>Again, I should like to reassure my noble friend Lord Gladwin. He asked whether the views of industry would be sought at an early stage on the form of mechanism that it would prefer to see. The answer is yes. I believe that that is obvious from everything that I have said this evening. We should want to consult about the nature of future consultation. Although we cannot fix these matters in primary legislation--indeed, the noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, made the point that that is, perhaps, less wise--we want to hear from the industry very plainly as to how it best sees consultation being established--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-23_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, I am obliged. The Minister is correct. I said that we should not put overly-detailed descriptions of exactly how this should work into the legislation. However, as my noble friend Lord Cope said, I still believe that it should be written on the face of the Bill that the authority "shall" have a duty to consult before, for example, producing the document containing the criteria.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the noble Viscount's clarification. However, the point remains that we do need to consult and discuss on how the various mechanisms might work, regardless of what that mechanism might then cover and the quality of its consultation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-23_para10"></a>I hope that I have answered the various points that were raised, and that I have given noble Lords sufficient reassurance. I trust that your Lordships' House will provide for the Bill to retain its current level of flexibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-23_time0"></A><H5>8.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, we have had a useful short debate. I should tell the noble Lord, Lord Gladwin, that I certainly value his experience, and the <P>


<a name="column_1487"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1487</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suggestions that he put forward as to how the consultation might be achieved. I do not seek in the amendments to lay down how it should be done. Indeed, for exactly the reasons that the noble Lord set out, I do not believe that the Bill should lay that down. However, I do suggest that there should be a duty to consult in some form. Such a form would obviously evolve as the authority got going. As my noble friend Lord Goschen said, it might change over time in the future, and should not, therefore, be nailed down absolutely in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-23_para11"></a>My noble friend said that he would go further and require consultation on revised criteria. I did not actually put that requirement in the amendments because I assumed that the criteria would be published, consulted upon and then revised criteria that took the consultation into account would be issued. If we make the industry consult on the revised criteria, it would become a circular process in which it would go on and on doing the same thing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-23_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is entirely correct. We would not want an endless circle of consultation. However, if in due course it was decided that the criteria were not working very well and that new ones should be considered, the authority could then consult on them. I did not mean that we should have further consultation immediately after the first criteria were introduced.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-23_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I believe that we are at one in that respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-23_para12"></a>The Minister said that the authority will need to consult, and that it was essential that it should do so--with all of which I agree. However, he admitted that there was likely to be only one representative of the industry, or thereabouts, on the authority itself. It is an extremely diverse industry. It is not one industry: it is a whole series of different and smaller industries. The Minister also referred to the committee system that might solve the problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-23_para13"></a>I should point out to the Minister that what I said about the Association of British Investigators and the Institute of Professional Investigators was not a slip; it was almost a direct quotation from the letter that I received from senior representatives of those two bodies. However, I take it from what the noble Lord said that it is not the intention to cut them out of consultations, which is a good thing. They are not the only bodies of that character. There are also other bodies involved; for example--EPIC (ex-police in industry and commerce), and so on. It is necessary to talk to all the bodies.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-23_para14"></a>The Minister made clear that he regards it as essential for the authority to consult, and that is the main point. I am sorry that he is not prepared to put such a provision in the Bill. However, I shall not press the amendment, which I beg leave to withdraw.

<A NAME="10301-24_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Astor </B>   moved Amendment No. 3:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, line 23, at end insert--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-24_para0"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
("( ) The Secretary of State shall lay a copy of any such directions before each House of Parliament.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10301-24_para1"></a>The noble Viscount said: My Lords, it will be remembered that I moved this amendment in Committee. At that time, the Minister gave a reasonably helpful answer; but, unfortunately, he has had time to reconsider the thoughts that he expressed in Committee and has come forward with what I can only describe as an extremely unhelpful and rather retrograde step with regard to this clause and my amendments. I shall explain to your Lordships how and why.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-24_para2"></a>Your Lordships are aware that Clause 2 gives the power to the Secretary of State to give general or specific directions in writing to the authority. It also gives him the power to request information about activities that he may require.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-24_para3"></a>In Committee I asked the Minister why directions were required and whether they would be a matter of public record. He replied,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I believe that the standard arrangement is for the Secretary of State to be able to give directions to non-departmental public bodies. If necessary, that could include the placing of a cap on fees. Therefore, they are general reserve powers ... Directions are not statutory instruments; they are merely a mechanism for a more informal way of establishing priorities and registering concerns".--[Official Report, 30/1/01; col. 591.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-24_para4"></a>
In Committee the Minister was helpful. He further stated at col. 592:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I would hope that such directions would be a matter of public record because they would be helpful to all concerned. It is important that we are clear about what we are trying to do with orders and directions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-24_para5"></a>
At that stage the Minister was kind enough to say that he would reflect on the matter. Unfortunately when the Minister went back to the Home Office all his natural inclinations for open and reasonable government and all his years of saying that the Labour Party wanted more openness in government deserted him. I am afraid that he was totally subverted by the system. He was kind enough to write to me, as he said he would. However, his letter was extraordinary as it seemed to be a total denial of what I thought he ever stood for. He reminded me that he had acknowledged the arguments in favour of a general presumption of openness. However, he further stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I remain of the view that there may be very limited circumstances in which the use of a confidential direction may be necessary, for example, directions naming individuals or particular companies and consequently we should not place a requirement on the face of the Bill for all directions under Clause 2 to be published".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-24_para6"></a>
That is the most extraordinary statement, as the Minister said in Committee that the directions could include such matters as the placing of a cap on fees, how the authority should conduct itself, or what issues <P>


<a name="column_1489"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1489</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it should take into account. He said that those were the kind of matters on which the Home Secretary could give directions. But now we see that the Home Secretary has no confidence in the authority that he is creating, even before he has created it. He can say to the authority, "You are the authority. You will decide who gets a licence and who does not. But in certain circumstances I will direct you not to give someone a licence because I do not think that you should". Therefore, the Home Secretary and the Home Office will pre-empt the role of the authority even before it is created.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-24_para7"></a>What is even worse, the directions will be secret. Apart from the Home Secretary and the authority, no one will know what the directions state or the names contained in them. We have a situation where the Home Secretary will by-pass the very authority he is creating. However, the position is worse than that because if one is denied a licence because the Home Secretary or someone in the Home Office considers that you should not have one, how do you appeal? There is a detailed appeal mechanism in Clause 10. Indeed, the Minister will move Amendment No. 19 to Clause 10 to make the appeal process clearer. If someone has been turned down for a licence not because the new authority says that he cannot have one, but because the authority has received a secret direction from the Home Secretary to that effect, how does that affect that person's rights of appeal? I am not a lawyer and I very much hope that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, will come to my aid and tell me whether an appellant's rights will be affected in such circumstances. How will the authority explain that that person cannot be given a licence when it has been given some secret direction from the Home Secretary to that effect? How does such a person appeal against that decision? It seems to me that there is a denial of basic rights here.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-24_para8"></a>However, the position is yet worse. The Home Secretary may discover reasons why someone should not be given a licence, for example, because that person has a criminal record. Under the Bill the authority will have the right to acquire that information. It will be able to hold informal discussions with the Home Office and agree with the Home Secretary not to issue a licence. Central government have reserved the power to issue these directions.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-24_para9"></a>The Minister tried to move an inch, but, I am afraid, only an inch. He stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the overwhelming majority of circumstances it would be right for directions to be a matter of public record. I am happy to place this on the record again at Report stage if you would find it helpful".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-24_para10"></a>
We always find the Minister helpful when he wants to be helpful. He further stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I plan to establish an authority on the assumption that openness in this area would be a presumption unless sensitive circumstances (which I would expect to be extremely rare) suggest otherwise".
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
Those are helpful words but, as your Lordships know, they are only useful if some lawyer in court is able to quote Pepper v. Hart on some specific point of law with regard to how one interprets the Bill. A lawyer may be able to say, "We know what the Minister meant on Report and therefore this is how the measure should be interpreted". However, that does not help the person when the authority turns down his application for a licence. In those circumstances he can appeal only on the basis of his own perceived or actual personal circumstances. Pepper v. Hart concerns how someone defines the Bill and how the authority should act under the terms of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-24_para12"></a>I am extremely concerned by the directions. They seem to go against natural justice. The noble Lord referred to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"directions naming individuals or particular companies".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-24_para13"></a>
This is not a case of stating that one person should have a licence but not another or stating the terms on which a licence should be given. It is a case of telling the authority whom not to give a licence to. Why would the Home Secretary ever use that power? There is only one reason; namely, to allow the Home Secretary to override the authority's decision to give someone a licence. He would only give a direction if he disputed a licence decision of the authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-24_para14"></a>That seems to me an even more extraordinary state of affairs. This is an extremely important issue and one that is extremely worrying. It contravenes all the Government's pledges on openness and the Minister's comments on Second Reading and in Committee that the new authority would operate in an open and fair way. I hope that the Minister will think carefully about the matter and give a more helpful answer than he did in his letter. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, we have to sympathise with the Minister that his natural liberal instincts are swallowed up in the Home Office by the Secretary of State who is proud not to be liberal but to be reactionary, as he demonstrates week in week out in the policies that he announces.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-24_para15"></a>The Minister wrote to all noble Lords concerned with the Bill. However, I did not understand what was meant by the expression--the noble Viscount quoted it--that the Minister remains of the view that there may be very limited circumstances in which the use of a confidential direction may be necessary--for example, directions naming individuals or particular companies--and that consequently the Government should not place a requirement on the face of the Bill for all directions under Clause 2 to be published.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-24_para16"></a>I could not understand what was meant by,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"directions naming individuals or particular companies".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-24_para17"></a>
Having listened to the noble Viscount, I begin to have some idea of the concept underlying it. It can mean only that the Secretary of State gives a direction to the <P>


<a name="column_1491"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1491</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>authority not to grant a licence for a particular activity to a named individual or to a particular company. If that should happen without the named individual or particular company knowing that it has happened--if it is done "under the carpet", as it were--and reasons were not given, there would undoubtedly be a breach of natural justice. The first principle of natural justice is that a person against whom an adverse decision is made should know the reasons for it. If he does not know what the reasons are he cannot properly appeal.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-24_para18"></a>I support fully the noble Viscount's argument. I look forward to hearing whether the Minister can resurrect those instincts which he so clearly displayed in Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-24_time0"></A><H5>8.30 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-24_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, I, too, regret that the Minister was mugged on his way through the portals of the Home Office. He must be more careful next time.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-24_para19"></a>I agree with all the points made by my noble friend Lord Astor. The most interesting relates to appeals and how the appeals process can work if a secret order has been given that someone should not receive a licence. Clause 10(1) states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may by order make provision for the bringing of appeals".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-24_para20"></a>
I was not clear whether that meant that only the Secretary of State was able to do so. If he had made the original secret direction, presumably he would not bring such an appeal.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-24_para21"></a>Clause 2(2) states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Before giving directions under subsection (1), the Secretary of State shall consult the Authority".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-24_para22"></a>
The authority is trusted to consult without a duty on the face of the Bill to do so. However, the Secretary of State has to have his duty written on the face of the Bill. Does that imply that Parliament trusts the authority but not the Secretary of State? Some clarification from the Minister would be helpful.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-24_para23"></a>I understand the natural desire of Home Office officials to issue the Minister with a "get out of gaol free card" to sew into the lining of the back pocket of his coat for some eventuality that may arise in the future which had not been considered. There seems a conflict between the Secretary of State and the authority; otherwise the Secretary of State, the Home Office, would be able to have informal discussions with the authority, saying, "It has come to our notice through our various agencies that intelligence (or whatever) has been gathered and such a person is an unfit person according to the criteria to hold a licence. Here is a summary of the information". The authority could act on that through its own investigative powers. If an appeal were brought it could rely on its own judgment. But for the Secretary of State to give a direction about a specific case can mean only that the authority has rejected informal advice and is now being told what to do.
<P>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1492</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-24_para24"></a>There are circumstances in which non-departmental public bodies are given directions. For example, the Rail Regulator is given directions on how he should exercise the powers of his office. They refer to general matters about the carrying out of his duty rather than specifics.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-24_para25"></a>We need more information from the Minister. I, too, welcomed his 42-paragraph letter. From my experience, it is the all-time record for a communication from a Minister. Clearly he was saving on stamps. We need further explanation of the type of circumstances beyond those discussed by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, and my noble friend Lord Astor which warrant this somewhat nuclear power.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I am intrigued by this savaging of the Minister: the strange death of liberal Bassam! I shall attempt to dispel the idea. I am also much amused by the notion that my honourable friend the Home Secretary is not liberal. I understand that he has some concerns about liberals living in Hampstead. However, we put that to one side and I shall seek to reassure noble Lords who raise concerns about the matter. I thought that I had dealt with them in Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-25_para0"></a>The points raised in Committee revealed concerns to ensure that directions from the Secretary of State to the authority should always be made public. I remind the House that I indicated that there was no absolute obligation to make them public. I acknowledged the arguments in favour of a general presumption of openness. I abide by that. I remain of the view that there will be very limited circumstances in which these confidential directions might be necessary. Yes, they might relate to directions naming individuals or companies. For that reason, it would not be wise for us to place a requirement on the face of the Bill for all directions under Clause 2 to be laid before Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-25_para1"></a>I do not think that that makes the Government illiberal. I do not think that it makes the legislation illiberal. It is not a back-door attempt to become more secretive. That is not the intention. This must be remembered. The licensing function belongs to the SIA. The Secretary of State cannot subvert that function by taking the decision himself that an individual may or may not have a licence and, therefore, directing the authority on what decision to take.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-25_para2"></a>For those reasons, the directions will always be ancillary to the SIA's functions. They will not, and cannot, be used to take over the authority's functions. I hope that that clarifies the point. The noble Viscount seeks further clarification.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-25_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister give an example of when the Home Secretary would give a direction relating to an individual? The circumstances pertaining to that individual could not be taken into account by the licensing authority in deciding whether the licence should be granted.
<P>


<a name="column_1493"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords that is the point to which I hope that I am moving inexorably. The direction would not be: "Thou"--the SIA--"shalt not give a licence to". In very limited circumstances the Secretary of State may ask for investigations to be made on sensitive issues with regard to companies about which there is concern. The Secretary of State may use that power to direct the SIA to carry out an investigation into a specific company where there is concern--perhaps a PSI equivalent of BCCI.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, is that not a black spot?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   No, my Lords, I do not think that it is. The noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, has raised concerns about rogue companies. Concerns about a particular company may well come to the attention of the Secretary of State. It does not seem wrong that the Secretary of State may direct, if he thinks that it is appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-25_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, I am trying to help the Minister on this argument rather than to interfere with his train of thought. He is correct that I have concerns about rogue firms, but I cannot get my mind round why the Secretary of State would have to issue a direction. Surely he could simply tell the authority that there was a problem with a particular firm. Not every communication between the Secretary of State and the authority has to take the form of a direction. Can the Minister explain why I am wrong in saying that a direction can mean only that there is a conflict or disagreement between the Secretary of State and the authority because the authority is refusing to investigate or to do whatever the Secretary of State wants?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-25_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, that raises another interesting question. I had the impression that the Conservatives wanted things to be plainly set out and understood and for there to be little confusion about the role of the Secretary of State or the ability of the SIA to consult. Everything that the Secretary of State can do should be set out in legislation. That is what the issue comes down to. There should be no confusion about whether the Secretary of State may issue a direction. In the majority of cases--probably 99 per cent--there will be transparency, but on some occasions, if a highly sensitive investigation is needed, the Secretary of State may have to give a direction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-25_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, if the authority is a responsible authority, why would a direction be needed? Surely the Home Secretary could just write a letter setting out his concerns about a particular company and asking the SIA to investigate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-25_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I suspect that that may well happen in most cases, but there may be one or two cases--it is difficult to estimate the effect of the legislation at this distance--in which the Secretary of State needs to give a direction because he has a particular concern. We are talking about those limited circumstances.
<P>


<a name="column_1494"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1494</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-25_para3"></a>I am convinced by the arguments put forward in Committee that in the majority of circumstances the directions should be a matter of public record. I am happy to make that plain on the record. We plan to establish the authority on the basis of a presumption of openness on the issue except in the limited and very sensitive circumstances that I have described.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-25_para4"></a>Amendments Nos. 11 and 13 would require the authority to lay before Parliament the criteria that it draws up under Clause 6 before deciding on applications for individual licences and any draft revisions to those criteria. However, Clause 6(5) makes it clear that the authority's criteria and revised criteria shall not have effect unless the Secretary of State has approved them. The Bill already requires significant further parliamentary input to get the authority and its regimes up and running. The Government will need to ask Parliament to approve a number of regulations to give practical effect to the main provisions of the Bill. However, I am not persuaded that we need to ask Parliament to approve the level of detail that these two amendments would require.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-25_para5"></a>The main purpose of the Bill is to establish the SIA and vest in it appropriate discretion to regulate the industry, backed up by specific parliamentary sanction in its most important aspects. I am confident that we should be able to rely on the sound sense of the authority's proposals and the Secretary of State's approval of detailed but necessary and important matters such as the precise licensing criteria to apply in each type of licence. To require the laying of draft criteria--and perhaps more importantly revised criteria--before Parliament would detract from the flexibility of approach in an evolving situation, which we believe is very important for the successful operation of the Bill. I am also not persuaded that Parliament would welcome a requirement to receive documents of the detail that may be suggested on a regular basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-25_para6"></a>I understand the concerns that lie behind the amendments. We do not want to bring a large element of secrecy into the relationship between the Secretary of State and the SIA on the particular matter in the amendment. I remain a liberal--as it were--on these matters. We intend to have openness and transparency at the heart of that relationship and the way in which the legislation works.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-25_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, the extraordinary thing about the directions is that not only do they give the Secretary of State the power to direct that someone should not be given a licence, but they give him the power to give a secret direction to the authority to give someone a licence. Someone could get a licence because, on a whim, the Secretary of State feels that it is necessary. We will never know. The authority might be against the decision, but there will be nothing that it can do about it. It will have to comply.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-25_para7"></a>If the Labour Party were in opposition and we attempted to introduce such a measure, there would be the most unholy row. My noble friend Lord Goschen <P>


<a name="column_1495"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column 1495</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>said that the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, was mugged. I am afraid that he was and he is still suffering dizzy spells. That is the only way to explain his attitude on the issue. He tried to be helpful. I asked why the Home Secretary could not just write a letter if he had concerns about a particular company. The authority would have to take account of such a letter. It could not just chuck it into the waste paper basket. It has to take account of all the evidence put to it. That is why it is there. It would have a duty to take account of the letter and could not dismiss it. The Minister said that there might be certain circumstances in which the Government wanted to make a direction. I have asked him to suggest such circumstances, but he cannot suggest anything beyond saying that the Government need the reserve power just in case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-25_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Viscount agree that a direction implies that the Secretary of State disagrees with the decision that the authority wishes to make?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-25_spnew11"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is entirely right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-25_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I must correct that point. The Secretary of State cannot interfere in the judgment of the SIA. That is not the point. The noble Viscount is assuming that the Secretary of State will simply tell the SIA not to give a licence. That is not what I am saying. I was very careful not to say that. That is the authority's judgment alone.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-26_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, that is a very helpful comment from the Minister, but the Bill does not say that. Clause 2 says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In carrying out its functions the Authority shall comply with any general or specific directions given to it in writing by the Secretary of State".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-26_para0"></a>
Perhaps the Minister would rather that the Bill did not say that, but that is what it says.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-26_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, is entirely right. The only circumstances in which the Secretary of State would be forced to give a direction would be if there was a dispute with the authority. If there is a dispute, Parliament ought to know, because otherwise the Secretary of State will be able to give secret directions that nobody knows about. The public will not know about them, Parliament will not know about them and presumably the authority will not be allowed to publicise the situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-26_para2"></a>That is an extraordinary state of affairs. The Minister has tried his best to defend the reserve powers, but he has failed to come up with any convincing reason why they are necessary or any convincing scenario in which they would be used. He has not proved his case. Unfortunately, the Minister has not even been able to say that he will take away the matter and reconsider it. In those circumstances, I must seek the opinion of the House.

("( ) The appropriate national authority shall provide RTM companies with explanatory material setting out the responsibilities and risks associated with right to manage.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10301-26_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: I can deal with this amendment very briefly. The decision to exercise the right to manage should not be taken lightly. It is vitally important that the tenants are fully aware of the responsibilities they face in forming an RTM company. The amendment would ensure that the appropriate national authority provides clear information about the RTM and the potential risks associated with it. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I should like to speak to Amendment No. 111A moved by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 125A, 128 and 133A. I do not propose--and nor does the noble Earl, Lord Caithness--to speak to Amendment No. 116, which covers a rather different point. We will take that amendment in its place on the Marshalled List.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-26_para15"></a>Members of the Committee will be aware that at Second Reading I raised the point that people should not go into the management of premises unaware of the problems involved. At a previous stage of the Committee, the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, explained that he personally had been involved in the management of premises. I can say that I personally have been involved in the management of premises. Many years ago, I and eight other leaseholders took over the freehold of our property in South Kensington, and we tried to run it. We were totally unaware of the problems of running a property of that nature. We had to be instructed by lawyers that we had responsibility for civil liability. If a slate fell off the roof onto someone in the street, it was our responsibility. None of us knew that, and in the end we decided to sell the freehold on to a trust which already had a managing agent, simply in order to get a proper managing agent in control of the premises.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-26_para16"></a>This is a subject of fundamental importance. I have received many letters on it as I am sure have other Members of the Committee. People cannot go into the management of premises without being aware of the problems involved. Whether it should be through the formula of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, or the formula that I and the noble Earl suggest, is a matter for debate. I accept that there are disadvantages with both formulae.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-26_para17"></a>The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, would impose something of a burden on a national authority. As to my amendment, I recognise that there may be a chicken and egg situation in that you cannot have an invitation to participate without having a company, and you cannot have a company without an invitation to participate. Having said that, there are many ways around that chicken and egg problem. But <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I support strongly what the noble Lords, Lord Williams and Lord Kingsland, have said. The difficulties involved in the management of leasehold property are very considerable. It could be that many leaseholders who would be better off leaving things as they are now, could undertake management themselves and get their fingers badly burnt as a result. It is very important that the right-to-manage scheme, which in principle we wholly support, should start on a proper footing. This would undoubtedly involve making the leaseholders who are contemplating a right-to-manage scheme aware of both the problems they potentially face and the quite considerable amount of work they will have to undertake if they are to be successful.. I hope that the Government will accept that there is a need for something of this kind without being in any way prescriptive about how it is to be achieved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-27_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   I rise to support the amendment of my noble friend Lord Kingsland and to speak to Amendment No. 128, to which I have added my name.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-27_para0"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Williams and Lord Goodhart, have covered most of the points but, from my experience, I would re-iterate that the most difficult situations one was put into as an agent were those where leaseholders felt that they could run the property better than a landlord; that anybody could run it better than a landlord and his agents. They would say, "This is all terribly easy. Let us form our own management company". One then had to go in after the event to firefight; to try to put it on the right lines and manage it properly. They found it incredibly more difficult and complex and much more time consuming than they had originally bargained for. As I said, that is the stage where the leaseholders start to drift away and do not turn up for meetings--except for one or two who, if they are still willing, try to run the company and hold it together.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-27_para1"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 128 is not to frustrate the Government's efforts but to try to make the right to manage more practical and workable. It is therefore important that anyone who wants to participate in a right to manage scheme must be given the appropriate information in advance. They must be told what the assets and liabilities are, and what the potential downsides are, of running a right-to-manage company. I hope that the Minister will understand that this a serious and constructive way to improve the legislation and to make it better for all potential right-to-manage companies, which I thoroughly support.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I apologise for rising again--I must have been suffering from advanced myopia because I had assumed, when the amendment was called, that Amendment No. 111A was on its own. In fact, I see that it is standing in a group with some other amendments of mine and with the very important <P>


<a name="column_CWH1506"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1506</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Amendment No. 116, which has been tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, and my noble friend Lord Caithness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Williams, has made it clear that that amendment will be debated separately.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I am much obliged. Perhaps I may speak to my Amendment No. 125A. We on this side of the Committee are concerned that those who seek to exercise the right to manage should be fully aware of what they take on. Block management can be a difficult and complex task, particularly in larger buildings, and the RTM company will assume considerable responsibilities. It is important that prospective members of the company realise that from the outset.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-27_para2"></a>A major concern in relation to the right to manage is that it will place the management of a building in the hands of those who may not have the necessary skills to perform the task. We are also concerned that, whereas a good professional landlord will regard a building as a long-term investment and seek to maintain the value and quality of that investment through a planned programme of maintenance, leaseholders may in certain circumstances take a more short-term view, not least because they are likely to hold a lease for a shorter period before moving on to another property.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-27_para3"></a>Landlords, understandably, wish to have confidence that, if they are no longer responsible for the management, they are assured proper stewardship of their assets. The nightmare scenario for landlords is that the leaseholders acquire the right to manage in order to reduce to the minimum the level of service charges. The building consequently declines and, with it, the value of the landlord's investment and, ultimately, the value of the leaseholder's investment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-27_para4"></a>The Bill provides that anyone who is dissatisfied with the quality of management by an RTM company will be able to seek the appointment of a manager in its place, following the existing rights of leaseholders under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. However, we believe that it is more effective, and in the interests of all parties involved, to seek prevention by minimising the prospect of poor management from the start rather than to rely on the efficacy of the cure.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-27_para5"></a>In discussions during the period leading up to the arrival of the Bill in your Lordships' House, the Government resisted the suggestion that the RTM company should demonstrate that it is competent to manage, not least because it wishes to minimise the potential for freeholders to obstruct a rightful claim by questioning whether the level of competence is adequate. We quite understand the position. Nevertheless, we would be much reassured if the RTM company was required to make some formal demonstration to indicate that it could be expected to manage competently, even if that was not subject to any greater test.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH1507"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1507</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-27_para6"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 128 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Williams. Is the noble Lord to speak to that amendment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-27_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   The noble Earl has spoken to it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-27_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I am happy to leave it at that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-27_time0"></A><H5>4.15 p.m.</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-27_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Lord Whitty) </B> : We all recognise it is important that those who take on the responsibilities under the right to manage have access to expertise and properly understand the management responsibility of an RTM company. However, we do not believe that to prescribe exactly how they do that in the form of this group of amendments is the most sensible way to spell it out. For example, Amendment No. 125A tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, refers to "principal responsibilities and obligations", but the Bill already provides an outline definition of the management functions of the RTM. As it stands the Bill also makes clear that the company needs to look beyond that definition and see what is provided for under the terms of the individual leases.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-27_para7"></a>Broadly speaking, if the lease makes anyone other than the tenant responsible for doing something, the acquisition of the right to manage will make that the responsibility of the RTM company. The individual leases will therefore already spell out pretty clearly what the RTM company will be required to do, in addition to any requirements imposed by statute. It should, therefore, be sufficiently clear to anyone what the RTM company's principal responsibilities will be without introducing the quite burdensome requirement of having to detail all of them in every claim notice.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-27_para8"></a>The problem of prescribing it in the legislation is evident. If we are required to spell out detailed requirements in the notices that the RTM company must serve we need to turn to our experience under the existing enfranchisement rights which regrettably shows that landlords are quick to look for any excuse to allege that the relevant procedures have not been complied with. We do not want to set out detailed and slightly unclear statutory provisions that afford landlords the opportunity to try to use them as a way to avoid the consequences of the Bill. That would need substantial adjudication and the process would undoubtedly be slowed down.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-27_para9"></a>Having said that, it is not sensible to prescribe it on the face of the Bill. We recognise the importance of producing guidance to support the right to manage and inform those who are thinking of undertaking the right to manage. Our view is that such guidance would need to cover not only the basic mechanics of exercising the right but more general matters, which I believe to be the motivation behind the amendments, relating to good management of the property. There may well be merit in producing guidance on good leasehold management more generally than in this <P>


<a name="column_CWH1508"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1508</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>situation, but we do not see any need for a statutory requirement such as that provided for in the amendments; indeed, it could be counter-productive.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-27_para10"></a>Amendment No. 128, to which my noble friend Lord Williams has spoken, proposes that the RTM company be required to circulate a prospectus at the beginning of the process. We appreciate that sometimes leaseholders who enfranchise, or are members of a management company provided for in the lease, will inevitably fail to grasp the difficulties and complexities of the management task, lack the skills and resources needed to make a success of it and, therefore, fall down on the job. I understand why it is suggested that we should make a fledgling RTM face up to its responsibilities right at the outset, confront its difficulties and give to those whom it invites to participate some account of how it proposes to tackle the issues. Again, it is not sensible to set that down on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-27_para11"></a>The idea of a statutory requirement on the RTM company to provide information on what it will do under the right to manage, alongside the invitation to participate, has some serious objections. It would be good practice for the company to give qualifying tenants, who had not yet decided whether to join, an indication of the way in which it proposed to manage the building. If it failed to do so it would be wise for tenants to question the company closely before deciding to join. Nevertheless, we should be wary of imposing formal procedural requisites on the acquisition of the right to manage on the face of the Bill. It would only open up for those who were trying to get a consensus within a particular block, or with the landlord, the possibility of challenge at an early stage of the process. It would give an ill-disposed landlord additional opportunities to trump up a challenge and to appeal to the LVT in the hope of delaying the acquisition or deterring the lessees from pursuing the matter further. That would itself lead to substantial scope for dispute as to whether the prospectus matched up to the detailed statutory requirements.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-27_para12"></a>In practice, the nature of what is required to inform those who might participate needs to be simple and straightforward. The detail will vary from block to block and case to case. It is not suitable, therefore, for specification on the face of the Bill, as the amendments suggest. The message is best conveyed in a manual of guidance which will undoubtedly be needed for those leaseholders who think of embarking on RTM. We would prefer that way forward rather than the kind of statutory obligation set out in the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-28_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   I found the Minister's answer rather disappointing. His first sentence was constructive and I thought we were going to get somewhere. But then he became very negative and was digging in deeper and deeper the more he spoke. Will the Minister think again and perhaps incorporate in regulations what we are trying to achieve? I understand his point about the difficulty of having the matter on the face of the Bill, but I should have thought that it could be included in some form of <P>


<a name="column_CWH1509"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1509</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>documentation that people have to be aware of what they are going to go into and the complications and financial implications involved in that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-28_para0"></a>What we propose is certainly not a plank on which we want any objections to be raised by the landlord. That is not the point of what we propose. I am sure that the Minister and his advisers could construct something that does not allow the landlord to object to a right to manage. With regard to the guidance, will the Minister confirm that he will be consulting bodies such as the RICS so that a common format is issued by the professional bodies and by the department?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I support the noble Earl's contention. There are various forms of guidance, as I am sure my noble friend is aware. There is guidance that means you can take it or leave it but this is the sort of thing we like; there is rather more formal guidance saying that this is what you should be doing; and there is guidance that is introduced by law; in other words, X is required to pay attention to or have regard to the guidance. We have had that in many statutes in the past. Will my noble friend consider that third possibility of putting in statute that the RTM company and anyone who is involved should have regard to the guidance? There are plenty of examples of that in law. I hope that my noble friend will consider it as a possibility.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   What my noble friend Lord Williams indicates is what normally in local government legislation is referred to as statutory guidance, which at first sight always appears a contradiction in terms, but which nevertheless does embody the code of practice or whatever with some degree of legal precision. I do not think that is particularly appropriate here.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-28_para1"></a>To answer the noble Earl's point about regulation, there may be some aspects of what is covered by these amendments which it might be appropriate to put into regulations, but the degree of detail as to what is required in an invitation in a prospectus and in a statement of claim is more appropriate for a form of guidance that is relatively flexible but clearly gives an indication of the responsibilities and the kind of expertise on which the company will need to call. I do not think that that kind of guidance would be appropriate for statutory guidance in the way suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Williams.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-28_para2"></a>We are, however, considering a form of guidance which, if not complied with, could constitute grounds for appointment of a replacement manager under the legislation which already exists under the 1987 Act. In other words, if someone failed to take note of that guidance, that could be one of the grounds on which a replacement manager could be sought. However, the nature of these documents may vary from case to case, and what is appropriate may vary from case to case. Apart from the basic requirements on the face of the Bill, possibly enhanced slightly within the regulatory framework, the rest of it should be fairly broad but <P>


<a name="column_CWH1510"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1510</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>directional guidance, if I may put it that way. That is what we have in mind for people taking on the RTM responsibilities in a variety of different situations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   We acknowledge that the Government wish to avoid creating a situation where the claim for the right to manage is anything more than a formal demonstration of compliance with the requirements. I also appreciate that the Government are unwilling for the competence of management to be tested. Nevertheless, I still think it important to reassure freeholders that the RTM company should be expected to manage competently and that freeholders can feel secure in that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-28_para3"></a>I strongly support what the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, and my noble friend Lord Caithness have said about the importance of guidance. In the circumstances of the Bill, the right to manage can be initiated by leaseholders even though a freeholder is conducting himself or herself impeccably; even though the freeholder is faultless; and there may be circumstances in which the result will be a much less competent stewardship than existed before.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-28_para4"></a>The Bill ought to have in mind the overall desirability of maintaining the fabric of our buildings as well as possible. If there are circumstances in which worse can replace better, then I submit that they ought to be addressed in the Bill now; we should not wait until it is enacted and have to learn by harsh experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-28_para5"></a>I hope that between now and Report stage the Minister will give further thought to his reflections at the Dispatch Box and perhaps introduce a government amendment. Otherwise I suspect that Members of the Committee will wish to return to this matter. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
REGULATION OF MANAGING AGENTS
<BR>
(" .--(1) A person who wishes to practice as a managing agent and hold the service charge trust fund shall be required to--
<BR>
(a) be subject to a code of practice,
<BR>
(b) undergo yearly auditing of accounts,
<BR>
(c) be covered by professional indemnity and fidelity insurance, and

(d) undergo a minimum quota of annual management training.

<A NAME = "10301-28_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: Let us suppose that we have an RTM company, successfully set up, and it has taken over the management of the premises. The company then states, after a while or immediately, "We need somebody to help us run this operation". If it has paid attention to the guidance which I have no doubt the wise government will produce, it will do that on day <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>one rather than on day 30. To whom does the company turn? Who is qualified, and how are they qualified, to run buildings of this nature?
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-28_para11"></a>There are various codes of practice, but I would suggest that an agent who is invited and required to run a property of this nature needs to be properly regulated, properly qualified and adhere to what I suggest in the amendment. They should be subject to a code of practice; undergo yearly auditing of accounts; be covered by professional indemnity and fidelity insurance; and undergo a minimum quota of annual management training. I believe that is the only way we will get sensible management of our property.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-28_para12"></a>I know this idea has been floating around for some time--I believe it was in the Government's mind at one point--but it now seems to have got lost. This is an essential part of the jigsaw we are trying to create. I hope that the Minister will agree with me. I beg to move.

<A NAME="10301-28_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel. There is a real risk that inexperienced leaseholders who find themselves running an RTM company and come to the realisation that they are not capable of managing it themselves, may be tempted to go to a cowboy managing agent who offers them agency services at a low price. Within a few months, they will realise that it is a very bad bargain. There is a need to protect leaseholders in circumstances of that kind, and something along the lines of this amendment would be highly desirable in that regard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-28_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   I rise to support the amendment, to which I have put my name. Sadly, there are still too many bad agents about. I am disappointed about that. I very much hope that my profession will get its act together. Indeed, good agents have got their act together, but there is no bar on the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, setting up as a managing agent this afternoon and taking over the management of a block of flats. Confident though he is, is he the right man for the job and has he had the training?
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-28_para13"></a>This is a vital amendment. We need to give confidence to the right-to-manage company that it has the right kind of managing agent. The competent agent has nothing to fear from the amendment. It will not be a panacea and there will still be difficulties. The solicitors who regulate these matters at the moment cause just as many problems in property deals as agents do, with due respect to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and my noble friend Lord Kingsland. We will come on to more about that when we come to the Homes Bill in due course. Agents should be subject to a code of practice and they should have to undergo regular training. A number of bodies, such as the RICS and the Association of Residential Letting Agents, do this already. I have been on refresher courses but I know a great many of agents who have not, and who <P>


<a name="column_CWH1511"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>manage properties to a lesser standard than I would have hoped. For that reason, I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-28_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I rise to support my noble friend's comments. I am still somewhat enchanted by the view of the Minister becoming a managing agent--the prospect of him managing property, as well as the money, leaves me highly intrigued. It is the aspect of the money, apart from everything else, that is so concerning here. There will be very substantial sums of leaseholders' money and it is absolutely vital that they are looked after properly.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-28_para14"></a>It is not just the prospects of the future that one is concerned about; it is the actuality of the past and the present in terms of some managing agents, about whom a number of people who are living in blocks of flats already have considerable concerns. It is slightly surprising that this is not a part of the estate management process and that it is not regulated. Managing agents have been around for a long time and there does not seem to have been any regulation. The experience is that some are not as good as others, and some are downright shoddy. It is those from whom we must protect those seeking the right to manage.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-29_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I strongly support the amendment. Indeed, I raised this issue at the Second Reading of the Bill. I do not understand why the Government have backtracked because, in the original Bill, they thought that this was an important point.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-29_para0"></a>Today, many people expect best practice, wherever they are in life. If the Bill is to be successful, then we should promote best practice. Many people have written to us with stories about how they have suffered under leasehold. If we are to change that situation, what is proposed in the amendment seems absolutely fundamental.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-29_para1"></a>I hope the Government can explain why they have changed their mind. It is not only in this area of housing that the Government seem to have cold feet in regulation; it is in other areas. The home is the most important part of a person's life and it is our duty to ensure that he or she can remain safely in that home and understand how to deal with the problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   When the Minister responds to this important debate, can he clarify whether we are talking here about the regulation of managing agents in the context of RTM or the regulation of managing agents, period? If we are talking about the regulation of managing agents in the context solely of RTM, we could be in the position of making it more onerous to have responsibilities to be a managing agent vis-a-vis RTM than vis-a-vis a freeholder. This is a practical question, because the choice before people in a year's time will presumably be what are we going to take on, as the noble Lord, Lord Williams, has correctly identified with regard to RTM. Otherwise, we have the opportunity to carry on as we are where the managing agent is responsible solely to the freeholder. Many of the criticisms that have been made about what one <P>


<a name="column_CWH1512"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1512</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>might call the unsatisfactory tail of the profession are in regard to the present scenario. I query whether what is proposed will touch that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I rise briefly to support the amendment in principle. It has a great deal to commend it. Within the RTM company, one may have tension between the leaseholder and the freeholder. If one adds to that slightly explosive mixture an incompetent managing agent, one will have something quite difficult to handle. If we raise too high the levels which people have to achieve to become managing agents, we will shut off the supply of firms prepared to take it on. Only a small number of firms will be prepared to do it. While I can see that the outline of the regulations proposed in the amendment are thoroughly worthy, there are such things as professional indemnity and fidelity insurance which may prove extremely expensive and difficult to get. That needs to be given further thought before we wave it on its way. However, in principle, it is a worthwhile idea.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I rise to support the noble Lord, Lord Williams, my noble friend Lord Caithness and, indeed, everyone else who has spoken in this debate so far.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-29_para2"></a>The original consultation document on the reform of residential leasehold law regarded the regulation of managing agents as one of the key elements of successful reform. However, the Government have not brought forward proposals in the Bill and their absence is the greatest single gap in that part of the legislation which deals with leasehold.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-29_para3"></a>The need for greater regulation of managing agents is recognised by everyone involved in the leasehold sector. Regulation is the most effective way of ensuring that managing agents meet acceptable standards of knowledge and practice and are required to act with both professionalism and integrity. Many landlords are concerned that they may lose control of their investment to right to manage not through any fault of theirs as owners but through the inadequacies and incompetence of their managing agents.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-29_para4"></a>Is it because the Government have yet to resolve in their own mind how they can take forward the regulation of managing agents that they do not feel able to compel people to make use of them? If so, that weakens their overall proposals since, if people could be required to use professional property managers who were working to a recognised standard, freeholder landlords would be much less nervous of the implications of a right to manage for the management of their investments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Once again I have some sympathy with the objectives behind the amendment. The reason the Government are not prepared to accept it was touched upon by the noble Lords, Lord Lea and Lord Hodgson. What we would be doing here, if we were to legislate in this context, would be to require a certain standard of managing agents for RTM companies but not for anyone else. There are managing agents all over <P>


<a name="column_CWH1513"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1513</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the place who work for freeholders, for leasehold companies and for various groups or organisations. There is a case for regulation--or certainly for higher professional standards--probably through a degree of registration and standard requirements for the profession as a whole.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-29_para5"></a>Whether we are talking about landlords, leaseholders who have been enfranchised or RTM companies, we know that it is desirable to have a competent manager. We know also that all bodies under existing kinds of tenure have difficulties with management agents. We therefore indicated in the consultation paper, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, said, that we would look at the whole question of the quality of management agents and that we would produce a consultation paper on it across the board. We still intend to produce such a paper. The issue is complicated. I understand why people feel that they have had to wait a long time for the paper, but are working on the matter and we hope that its publication is not too distant.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-29_para6"></a>The options that will be considered in the consultation paper may range from a full-scale licensing scheme, which was favoured by many people who responded to the original consultation paper, to something closer to a self-regulatory system. This will include obligations of the kind to be found in the clause, to which the noble Lord, Lord Williams, referred, but will be imposed on those who employ management agents more generally.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-29_para7"></a>Each of the options within that spectrum has its own advantages and disadvantages. The consultation period will allow us to address them not only for RTM companies but also for those who seek and need the services of management agents more generally. Were we, however, to legislate in this field and establish a register of management agents solely for RTM companies, as the noble Lord, Lord Lea, said, that would of itself create a further threshold and barrier to the creation of RTM companies. The Government's view is that the issue should be addressed in the round. A consultation paper should be available within the next few months and the results of that would clearly be intended to apply right across the form of tenure for everybody employed as a managing agent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-29_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend for that reply, although I find it disappointing. As I said, this is a piece of a jigsaw and Members of the Committee--with the exception, to a certain extent, of my noble friend Lord Lea and the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson-- supported the idea that it is part of a jigsaw. It is no good giving people the right to manage property unless one controls the people who are going to manage that property.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-29_para8"></a>The Government appear to have ducked a rather important issue. We have heard of consultation papers before; they take a long time. There is a consultation period and then, as a result, there is usually a White Paper. There then follows deliberation on the White Paper and, if we are lucky, there is then legislative <P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-29_para13"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10301-29_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendments Nos. 117 and 120 deal with those who are in housing association accommodation. Amendment No. 117 deals with the situation of assured tenants in a housing association. As the Bill is drafted, it is my understanding that they would not be permitted to be members of a right-to-manage company. That being so, it would seem that they should get some rights somehow, and the amendments I have put forward would mean that the housing association under which they were assured tenants would take on that responsibility for them. That seemed to be the best way of ensuring that tenants' interests were represented in the management of the block. It may be that the Government think there is a better way of dealing with this, but it is a problem at the moment and it is something raised by housing associations. I hope that the Government can respond to that in a positive way.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-29_para15"></a>Amendment No. 120 deals with a slightly different situation, and I know from having read the housing press that the Housing Minister in another place, Nick Raynsford, certainly does not agree with this. It deals with charitable housing associations where the leasehold schemes are for a particular group of people. That may be elderly people who have a professional background. Teachers, for example, often set up blocks of this type.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-29_para16"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to put back something that was included in the original draft Bill, which will enable charitable housing trusts to be managed in the way that reflects whatever their purpose. It is fairly specific, and it would not allow all kinds of other groups to join the bandwagon. I hope that the Government will look positively at this, and if it is not the right way to do it they may be able to come forward with another way of dealing with it. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="10301-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   There are two separate concerns with the amendments. I hope I can satisfy the <P>


<a name="column_CWH1515"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1515</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, that there is no problem. The first is the fear that where there is a flat with a tenant who is not a qualifying tenant, such as one held by an assured tenant, no one could be counted as a qualifying tenant for that flat.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-30_para0"></a>I can appreciate that it is difficult because the Bill is somewhat elliptical. The situation is that we do not require leaseholders to be resident to qualify for the right to manage, so any person or organisation who holds a long lease will qualify. When a long leaseholder sublets his flat on a short lease or an assured tenancy, the long leaseholder--in this case the housing association--will be considered by the Bill to be the qualifying tenant for the flat. A registered social landlord who sublets the flat on an assured tenancy will automatically be the qualifying tenant by virtue of the long lease and there is no need to make special provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-30_para1"></a>The second proposal is that tenants of charitable housing trusts should not qualify for the right to manage. That would be consistent with the position under the right to enfranchise, but there is a very good reason why tenants of charitable housing trusts do not enjoy the right to enfranchise. They have acquired their leases on very favourable terms, designed to make home ownership affordable to those for whom it would not otherwise be a realistic option. It would be wrong to enable them to take advantage of enfranchisement and then sell on in the open market.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-30_para2"></a>The right to manage, however, does not affect the ownership of the property or the owner's ability to sublet it as he or she chooses. It merely transfers management functions to the people who have purchased the majority share in the equity. So charitable housing trusts could continue to let out other properties to tenants of the appropriate kind after exercise of the right to manage. We have discussed this with most of the people concerned and nobody came forward with any sound reason for exempting charitable housing trusts from the right to manage, as distinct from the right to enfranchise. Indeed, both the housing corporation and the Charity Commission support the application of the right to manage to such properties.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-30_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I thank the Minister for his helpful reply. It will be helpful for those who have been concerned about this to be able to read quite clearly what the position is, particularly in respect of the first amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-30_para3"></a>On the second amendment, I would like to read more carefully what the Minister said and consult again as to whether it will be satisfactory. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(b) a company controlled directly or indirectly by an individual residing in the flat or jointly by individuals both or all residing in the flat.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10301-30_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: The remarks I want to make apply equally to Amendment No. 84A. This is a central issue. The effect of the amendment is to limit the right to manage blocks of flats where the residents want to manage. The Bill as presently drafted gives the right to manage to all leaseholders, including companies and people who hold leases solely for investment purposes. These are typically those living abroad who invest in residential property with a view to letting it out.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-30_para7"></a>It does not seem right to give such investors these valuable rights to manage. The whole thrust of this legislation should be to enhance the rights of residents. Indeed, we find it strange to find such enthusiasm among the Government for the capitalist classes.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-30_para8"></a>Let me deal with the proposal that a company should be entitled to the right to manage if it is controlled by an individual residing in a flat. I have heard reports that certain landlords are refusing to grant long leases, or refusing the assignments of long leases, unless the lessees buy through the medium of a limited company. The reason for this is that the landlords wish to avoid tenants having the various rights to enfranchise and to extend leases which they are given by legislation dating from 1967 onwards.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-30_para9"></a>This is an abuse. The fact that an individual buys via the corporate vehicle of a limited company should be neither here nor there, so long as that individual is in truth a resident. Accordingly, the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that residents--and only residents--have the right to manage, but that it is irrelevant whether the residents hold the lease in their own names or the names of companies. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   In introducing Amendment No. 84 on Tuesday, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, suggested that removing the landlord's right to manage was tantamount to expropriation and might indeed fall foul of the European Convention on Human Rights, if I understood him correctly--a point of view which is widely held in his party and elsewhere. Perhaps there may be an element of expropriation here, albeit not remotely in the same league as the expropriation inherent in Clauses 123 and 124 of the Bill as it stands.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-30_para10"></a>Surely a landlord expects most of his profits to come from the ground rent, with perhaps a modest profit from managing the property as a little cream on top. If it is the other way around, with most of the landlord's net income arising from the management of the property, surely he must be abusing his monopoly position as sole provider of management services by overcharging. In this case, the Government are being neither unreasonable nor unfair in introducing an element of competition into the process, as the Bill effectively does, and as the previous administration started to do in their legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-30_para11"></a>Having said that, the ground landlord has a legitimate interest in ensuring that a property, whoever manages it, is properly maintained so that it does not <P>


<a name="column_CWH1517"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1517</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>deteriorate. As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said, somebody who is a sub-tenant, who is there for only a few months, or somebody who may be the leaseholder but is perhaps a tax exile--as many leaseholders in Belgravia, for example, may be--and is abroad for nine months of the year or more is unlikely to have either the capability or, in many respects, the incentive to manage the property as efficiently as a landlord.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-30_para12"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, said on Tuesday, and the noble Lord, Lord Williams, hinted a few minutes ago, even those who have permanent residential status are likely to have management problems if they are inexperienced in the matter. I have pleasure in supporting the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The amendment seeks to introduce a requirement that an individual must be resident in his flat in order to be a qualifying tenant for the right to manage. I understand why the amendment is moved and the noble Lord's indication that our main concern must be for those who are resident within the block. However, it would be extremely difficult to implement such a requirement. Issues of principle are involved here. The rationale behind the right is that if in effect a group of leaseholders owns the majority of the equity in the building it should have the right to exercise the right to manage it. The logic of that principle applies whether or not the owner of a lease, as an individual lessee, occupies the premises to which the lease applies.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-30_para13"></a>In any case, even if one discards that principle and says that one is acting solely on behalf of people who are resident the definition of "resident" is extremely difficult to establish. Does one have to be resident for one week, a year, or three months a year? In the "company" test, does one literally need to be a company, or can the company actually bestow at least partial residence on someone else? Even if we accept the principle of the approach, there are great complexities of definition which are not addressed in this amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-30_para14"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, indicates, practical experience of existing enfranchisement rights is that there is an abuse of the situation by recalcitrant landlords who wish to stop the rights being used. They can use it as an excuse to harry leaseholders and pry into their private lives in respect of where they reside and who resides there. We do not want to get into that area. The straightforward position is that the person who is the lessee is able to trigger the right to manage. However desirable may be the principle of looking after the residence, as a matter of principle and practicality this is not the way in which we should limit the right.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-30_para15"></a>No doubt there are some strong feelings on this matter both inside and outside the Committee. I suspect that we shall return to this matter, but I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, at least accepts some of my argument.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   Apart from me, the noble Lord the Minister was the only noble Lord to speak to this amendment. I am surprised that there were not <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>stronger feelings about it in the Committee. I beg the Committee's pardon. One other noble Lord spoke to this matter with great feeling. It is most unlike me to have the memory of an observation by the noble Lord, Lord Monson, erased so swiftly. I shall reflect on the definition of "resident". I see the validity of the Minister's criticism that that may be too ill-defined a concept. However, I must confess to having some surprise at the overall approach of the noble Lord to my amendment. I would have expected the philosophy of the Bill, generally, to have militated towards my amendment. So I shall reflect on what he said and return to the issue at the Report stage. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="10301-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart </B>   moved Amendment No. 121:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 31, line 36, leave out ("21") and insert ("7").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-31_para0"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10301-31_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: In speaking to Amendment No. 121, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 122 to 124. It is a variant on the amendment just debated and moved by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and it is directed to the same purpose: to bring the responsibility for management closer to those who are in occupation, though it does not do so by any means completely.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-31_para2"></a>The amendment changes the definition of a long lease for the purposes of the right to manage from a lease for more than 21 years to a lease for more than seven years. The question is: who should exercise the right to manage as members of an RTM company? There is a conflict of interest to some extent between the lessees under short leases and those under long leases, the occupiers as against the reversionaries. Short lease holders are obviously more concerned with the maintenance of current services and, to some extent, with the current standard of decoration. Long leaseholders will naturally be more concerned with the structure of the building.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-31_para3"></a>One of the purposes of the right to manage is, or at any rate ought to be, to ensure that the maintenance is in the hands of those who either live there themselves or have some fairly close connection with the property and are not merely very long-term investors. People who live on the premises have much more contact with each other than absentee leaseholders. They are much more likely, for example, to turn up to meetings of the RTM company and to be willing to take on the responsibilities of being a director of the RTM company.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-31_para4"></a>Surely, we do not want members of an RTM company to be absentee landlords. I accept that the right to manage should not be the responsibility of rack-rent tenants for short terms. In many parts of London, certainly in large parts of Kensington, the tenants under such tenancies are young people, highly mobile, moving in and out and with no real interest in the maintenance of the property.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-31_para5"></a>The long lease for the RTM purposes does not need to be the same length as the long lease for enfranchisement purposes. We believe that the definition of a long lease should be reduced to the shortest length at which it can reasonably be said that the members have something more than a merely transient interest in the property. That is why we have selected a lease which lasts for more than seven years. That, again, as we know is a significant dividing line because of the switch in the responsibilities for maintaining various installations under the statutory law from the landlord to the tenant.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-31_para6"></a>If a 99-year lease is subject to a sub-lease for 10 years, we believe that the sub-lessee rather than the head lessee should be the member of the RTM company and that there is a balance to be struck between short and long leaseholders. We also believe that drawing the dividing line at seven years, as we propose, is the best place at which to strike that balance. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="10301-31_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jacobs: </B>   I rise to support the amendment tabled by my noble friend. I have a feeling that it mainly applies to residential properties in London. On some of the larger estates the leases are divided between what under present law are long leases, a significant number of 20-year leases and a number of rack-rent leases. Effectively, some of the major estates have managed to arrive at a position where perhaps one-third of the tenants are on long leases as presently defined; one-third are on about 20-year leases; and the remaining one-third are on rental leases. From the point of view of management, people who have 20-year leases seem to regard themselves as living in long leases--there is no difference from their point of view.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-31_para7"></a>While seven years is not proposed as a level for enfranchisement, it may be different for management. The people have been living in the property for more than seven years, which is a reasonable time, whether under a seven or eight-year rental lease--or a nine-year rental lease which I happen to know exists--or under a 20-year lease for which they have paid a capital sum, or under a longer lease. Under all those circumstances they should not be denied the right to manage. I therefore strongly support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-31_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I want to ask the Minister about the wording of Clause 73(2)(b). Clause 73 explains what leases are long leases and paragraph (b) provides that it is for a term fixed by law, and so on, and adds in parenthesis:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(but it is not a lease by sub-demise from one which is not a long lease).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-31_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I am not capable of a smooth resumption. Before we adjourned for the Division, I was asking the Minister to explain the necessity for the words in parenthesis in Clause 73(2)(b). My reason for asking is not because I am so concerned about the repetition of the provision which appears in Clause 72(4)(a), but in case by repeating the words there is an implication that the provision and the application of Clause 72 differs from Clause 73(2)(b) as compared with the rest of Clause 73. I should have thought that Clause 73(2) is subject to Clause 72 as well as to Clause 74.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-31_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said that he thought that the amendment goes some way to achieving the objective I sought to achieve in Amendment No. 118. However, I fear that the costs that it will impose will outweigh any benefits that are gleaned.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-31_para10"></a>The effect of this amendment would be to devastate what remains of the short leasehold market. It assumes that the rental market consists only of short-term lettings where the rent is paid on a periodic basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-31_para11"></a>There is a ready market for properties for which people are prepared to pay to occupy for a limited number of years but where they would prefer to pay a lump sum for the lease rather than an annual rental. In effect, the price paid to acquire the lease is the capitalisation of the rent. It is arguable that the ability to sell short leases provided a degree of flexibility in the residential property market, particularly in central London. It requires an income of around £50,000 a year to obtain a mortgage on a flat, virtual freehold--that is to say, a 999-year lease--valued at £150,000. I estimate that a 35-year lease for the same flat would be worth about £90,000, which would require an income of £30,000 to obtain a mortgage. The value of a 21-year lease would be lower still, and therefore more affordable to those on slightly above average incomes.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-31_para12"></a>Most freeholders have ceased to sell leases of between 21 and 35 years since the 1993 Act, as those would be subject to enfranchisement. Freeholders have continued to grant short leases of less than 21 years but they would be unlikely to do so in future if this would contribute to their losing the management of their building.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-31_para13"></a>The amendment may also have an impact on how the institutional investors view the residential investment market. The institutions are beginning to return to the residential market, concentrating mainly in the letting sector. It is essential that the institutions are not deterred from this sector at this improving time.

<P>
<A NAME="10301-31_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Jacobs: </B>   I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. He is claiming that, in the rental market, people may in certain circumstances prefer to pay a capital sum rather than an annual rent, but the position is usually the other way around. The only reason we have these 20-year leases with large capital sums is as a means of raising capital for the landlord without giving the opportunity to enfranchise. That <P>


<a name="column_CWH1521"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1521</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>grew up a few years before legislation introduced by the previous government. The 20-year leases were designed just to avoid the legislation. I do not see that they have any relationship, from the tenant's point of view, as a means of living in what is notionally called a short-term rental property and paying a capital sum instead.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-31_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   Perhaps I may say that the purpose of my intervention was to indicate that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, would have an adverse effect on the supply of properties, for which there is a considerable demand.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-31_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The amendment rather cuts across the Government's aim, which is primarily to give the right to manage to those who have acquired a long-term stake in the property. In other words, it is those who see themselves as more akin to the owner-occupier than to someone who is on a rack-rent. These are the people who probably would not have chosen to buy leasehold in the first place if, under English property law, buying a freehold flat had been a practical and sensible solution at that point. It is to be hoped that when the Bill comes to full fruition the successors of such people will become commonholders.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-31_para14"></a>All leaseholders are technically tenants, irrespective of the way in which they have paid for their lease. It is quite difficult to draw a completely logical line between those who are would-be owner-occupiers and those who are would-be renters. Any test is subject to the criticism that a few people fall on the wrong side of the line. The Government came to the 21-year option, which seemed to give about the right level of balance and which, as the noble Lord, Lord Jacobs, said, is the point at which the right to enfranchise exists under current legislation. I admit that the noble Lord was pointing to some detrimental effects of that but, nevertheless, there is a consistency here.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-31_para15"></a>A number of people think that there should be shorter leases with the same rights as those of long leases. It is certainly true that in some circumstances a long-term renting tenant may pay more than a long leaseholder does as a lump sum, but that is not really the point. The question is: what is the balance of stake in the building itself that would justify tipping the balance towards giving them the right to manage? There is a difference of opinion between the noble Lords, Lord Jacobs and Lord Kingsland, as to the nature of the market, and in a sense both are right.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-31_para16"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, claims that, if we were to reduce the threshold for the right to manage below 21 years to seven years, that would destroy the existing market. The noble Lord, Lord Jacobs, said that to a large extent that market exists only to get round the existing enfranchisement provisions. I understand both those concerns but I must also say to both noble Lords that it is quite a limited part of the totality of the leasehold market, which probably <P>


<a name="column_CWH1522"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1522</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>applies only in central London. In most other parts of the country, would-be buyers would not be prepared to sink such large sums of capital into what is, after all, a fairly short-term interest with a rapid rate of depreciation. This sub-market is dominated by perhaps the kind of people whom the noble Lord just accused me of favouring--relatively well-heeled investors, purchasers and corporations.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-31_para17"></a>Although I understand the arguments put forward by the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Jacobs, it would distort the totality of the approach to the leasehold market as a whole if we were to change the threshold here. There is some merit in consistency between enfranchisement provisions and right-to-manage provisions and I am not convinced by what has been said in the past few minutes that we should depart from that consistency here.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-31_para18"></a>As regards the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee--it was a good question--the clauses are more or less lifted from the 1993 Act, which is not an excuse for me not being able to give a clear explanation. However, they are different types of lease. It is probably better if I write to the noble Baroness and leave a copy of that letter in the Library for the enlightenment of other Members of the Committee. However, I resist the proposed reduction from 21 years to seven for the reasons explained.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-32_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I am disappointed by the Minister's reply. Perhaps I may say also that I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that our proposals would damage the market. If anything, they would probably improve it, because those who wish to dispose of property for a period of anything between eight and 20 years are unlikely to want to be involved in the management of the property. Quite frankly, they would much prefer to have a clean situation whereby they get the rent and do not have to worry about the property. They would be much more likely to prefer that than to be active members of the RTM company. There is a real risk that RTM companies will end up with a number of inactive members who feel they have very little stake in the property other than to draw the rent from their sub-tenants.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-32_para0"></a>The Minister referred to the head lessees in this situation as being something akin to an owner-occupier but, quite clearly, somebody who has sub-let for a 20-year term is not an owner-occupier. It seems to me that it is much better to get the management into the hands of those who are closer to occupation of the property. However, I shall not repeat my arguments. We may well want to look at this matter again. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "10301-32_para8"></a><P>

("(4) The provisions of section 196 of the Law of Property Act 1925 as to service of notices shall apply to the service of notices under this section.
<BR>
(5) If a notice of invitation to participate is not served in accordance with this section, every director and officer of an RTM company at the time of the breach shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.
<BR>
(6) If any director or officer of an RTM intentionally fails to give notice to any qualifying tenant in accordance with this section, such director or officer shall be liable on summary conviction to not more than 3 months imprisonment and a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10301-32_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: I rise to move Amendment No. 126 and I hope that it will prove uncontroversial. Section 196 of the Law of Property Act 1925 makes some fairly simple provisions of the deemed service of notices; for example, service by recorded delivery is deemed to be good service. This plainly reduces problems of proving service on qualifying tenants, which might otherwise be the subject of potentially expensive and divided disputes.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-32_para10"></a>The other proposed subsections deal with enforcement. Problems have arisen in the past about how to enforce provisions for tenants to have notice of rights. Some Members of the Committee may recall a notorious case where the trustees of two of the biggest property-owning charities in the country decided to swap their property portfolios. In order to stop the tenants exercising their right to buy the freehold, those supposedly reputable trustees, with supposedly reputable advisers, devised a scheme which had the effect of defrauding tenants of their rights. The Court of Appeal held that the scheme in large part worked because the enforcement provisions were inadequate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-32_para11"></a>In order to avoid problems with enforcement, I therefore propose that two criminal offences be enacted. The first is an offence of strict liability which bites where notice that an RTM company intends to apply for the right to manage is not properly served. This will ensure that directors and officers of the RTM company have an incentive to ensure adherence to the proper procedures for giving notices.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-32_para12"></a>The second is a more serious offence, punishable with up to three months imprisonment, for those directors and officers who cynically avoid serving notices with the intention of preventing certain qualifying tenants from exercising their rights. There is a risk with this legislation that an RTM company will be promoted by a small group of tenants who deliberately seek to shut other tenants out of participation in the right to manage. The second offence is designed to provide a proper incentive to ensure that all qualifying tenants have an equal opportunity to participate in the RTM company.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-32_para13"></a>Amendment No. 126A would enable any of the present managers of the block to require the RTM company to prove that it had complied with the requirement to serve the notice of participation on all qualifying tenants. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-32_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Perhaps I may ask about the position if plain notices are not given. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has not proposed a sanction. What happens if the notice of invitation to participate is not given? Is the claim notice then invalidated? It seems to me that it is not. Can the Minister confirm the position?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-32_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I would draw the notice of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, to Clause 108 of the Bill which provides detailed requirements on the serving of notices under the right to manage. That is sufficient provision without in effect replicating the similar provisions of Section 196 of the Law of Property Act, as he suggests.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-32_para14"></a>The second part of the amendment relates to directors being held personally responsible where a participation notice is not properly served; we consider that somewhat unnecessary, if I have understood the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, correctly. After all, any failure to serve notices properly would in itself invalidate any attempt to exercise the right to manage and therefore, they would have to start all over again. There would be no point in having an additional penalty since no benefit would have been achieved. The intention is that not serving the invitation to participate properly would invalidate the claim notice. We think that the Bill as it stands does that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-32_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, also proposes allowing the landlord to require evidence that the notice to participate has been served. We see no need for such a provision. The invitation to participate is intended to ensure that all leaseholders know that it is proposed to acquire that right, which will also help the RTM company to sign up sufficient members. As such, the service of the notice of invitation to participate has nothing directly to do with the landlord. Giving him rights to demand information about how it has been served therefore serves no other purpose than to provide unscrupulous landlords with yet a further excuse for challenging the process.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-32_para16"></a>The interest of a leaseholder is not directly prejudiced by a failure to receive a notice of invitation. The right to manage can be acquired only if enough of the leaseholders become members of the RTM company. Anyone who had not become aware of the proposed acquisition would not have been in a position to prevent it going ahead, provided that enough of the others had signed up, but would in any event have the right to become a member of the RTM company at any time.

APPOINTMENT OF SURVEYOR
<BR>
(" .--(1) To prepare for future management, prior to the service of a notice of invitation to participate, the RTM company may appoint a surveyor in accordance with section 84 of the Housing Act 1996 (right to appoint surveyor to advise on matters relating to service charges).

I shall not press the argument on Amendment No. 127 because I believe that the Minister, when he replied to the general debate on guidance, subsumed this whole matter. I hope that he can give us some assurance that there would be facilities for an RTM company to appoint surveyors. The last thing one wants is for an RTM company to take over common parts of the building and find those common parts in total shambles. I hope that will be in the guidance. If my noble friend can assure me that it is, I shall go no further with the argument.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-32_para23"></a>Amendments Nos. 268 and 269 refer to the commencement clause of the Bill. We now know that the commonhold provisions in Part I of the Bill are essentially enabling provisions. They set out a framework under which regulations can conveniently be made. It is not precise, and I understand exactly why that is so. The Government need to consider very carefully what kind of regulations they will issue under Part I of the Bill when it becomes an Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-32_para24"></a>On the other hand, the right to manage does not require a great number of regulations. It hardly requires any regulations at all. I am persuaded by advisers that the one thing that is needed from the Bill immediately after it receives Royal Assent is the right to manage. That will be the crucial matter for the Bill. Commonhold can wait, but I do not believe that the right to manage can wait, which is why in Amendments Nos. 268 and 269 I invite my noble friend to split the clause and commence Part II, Chapter I--the right to manage--more quickly. I see no reason why the Government should not commence the whole of Part II much more quickly. They should simply specify a date for enactment, as in the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="10301-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   I have sympathy with the amendment in so far as it gives the Minister an opportunity to consider whether there may be some asymmetry between RTM and other matters. I have raised this matter in another connection. I believe that there is some asymmetry between the clauses to do with RTM and other matters in the Bill, and it may be worth while to consider that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   As regards Amendment No. 127, which allows the RTM company to appoint a surveyor prior to exercising the right to manage, my noble friend Lord Williams may be right that we can deal with this matter in guidance. I shall certainly look at that carefully. It is, however, possible that we may need something like his original amendment because that gives the surveyor right of access to the building and to relevant documents. As to that, we may need to establish a statutory right. Ideally, it should be dealt with in guidance, but if it was necessary to clarify the statutory position on access we might need to look at it further.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-33_para0"></a>As to the date of commencement, in a sense there may well be some asymmetry in the Bill, but in the area of the right to manage we are committed to a substantial period of consultation, principally in relation to the constitution of the RTM company itself. As explained earlier, we are committed to consulting before making regulations. We want to ensure that proper guidance is in place before the commencement of that right. All of that will take time. It may take six months as the amendment suggests; it may take longer or even less time, but there will certainly be a substantial period of consultation and drafting. At this stage the Government prefer to have flexibility in the Bill rather than be tied to a commencement date.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-33_para5"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10301-33_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is twofold. First, it is to limit the RTM company's powers to obtain information and, secondly, to provide sensible enforcement powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-33_para7"></a>As presently drafted, the clause gives the RTM company extensive powers to demand information from anyone whomsoever. It must be remembered that the RTM company has this power at a time when it has not yet acquired the power to manage. In other words, it is just a putative RTM company--a company that wants to acquire the right to manage.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-33_para8"></a>The main thing which the RTM company needs at this stage is a list of all the qualifying tenants in the block. The person who knows that will be the person with the right to manage. The purpose of the first two amendments is to limit the power to demand information so that, in practical terms, only the landlord need give information, and to limit the information that can be demanded to the information which needs to be put in the claim form.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-33_para9"></a>As at present drafted, Clause 76(1)(b) is extremely imprecise. What limits are to be placed on information which the RTM company may reasonably require? This is potentially an extremely intrusive provision. All sorts of confidential agreements could reasonably be demanded by the RTM company and there is no limit as to whom can be asked for information.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-33_para10"></a>A proper enforcement power is also needed. As at present drafted, I suppose an RTM company might be able to apply for an injunction, ordering the recipient of a notice to provide information. That is hardly a cheap and cheerful means of enforcing this obligation. It would be much better to have a narrow duty of disclosing the names of tenants and the details of their leases, which is imposed on the landlord and is enforceable by summary criminal proceedings in the event of breach. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-33_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, for explaining his amendments, which are as we understood them. The amendments are intended to restrict the power for RTM companies to obtain information. Under the amendment, the power could be used only to obtain information relating to certain matters which are required to be included in the claim notice which is, in turn, required by Clause 78. However, I observe that the noble Lord has tabled amendments to Clause 78 itself, which would extend the matters which would be required to be included in the claim notice.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "10301-33_para11"></a>The main purpose of Clause 76 is indeed to ensure that an RTM company can obtain this information, but the company may have a legitimate reason to obtain other information which is pertinent to the claim. It is difficult to set that out exhaustively on the face of the Bill. We have therefore decided to provide a general power to obtain other information which the company reasonably requires. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, asked me about the limitation. The answer is that the word "reasonably" should protect landlords and other managers from being faced with unnecessary or unjustified demands. Indeed, I should remind the noble Lord that he argued previously that the RTM company will need to have made all manner of management plans. If it is to do that, it will need information on the existing management. If the Bill were limited in the way suggested by the amendments, it would not achieve what the noble Lord wants.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-33_para12"></a>We have another problem with the amendment. It creates a criminal sanction for a failure to comply. We are reluctant to create new criminal offences unless there is a pressing need to do so. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, suggests that it is not enough to go for an injunction to the court, but Clause 103 provides the power to apply to the court for an order to provide the information requested. We consider that to be enough.

<P>
<A NAME="10301-33_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I thank the Minister for his response. Clause 76(1) is limited to situations before the RTM company acquires the power to manage. It refers to its power to make a claim. The Minister quite rightly drew my attention to the fact that, in another amendment, I have asked that more information be provided by the existing management of the company so that a putative RTM company can make an objective assessment about what it is taking on.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-33_para13"></a>However, those amendments sought to place an obligation on the existing management to produce that information. Here I am talking about a claim which the Minister will observe applies to any person. Therefore, with great respect, I do not believe that the two approaches are incompatible.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-33_para14"></a>I understand the Minister's desire not to introduce more criminal offences--it is very good to find a Minister who feels that way about a parliamentary Bill--and I agree with him that an injunction is a reasonable alternative, but it is much more expensive for an individual to put on foot. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "10301-33_para21"></a>Amendment No. 132A, which I shall move, would increase the minimum period of time between the service of the notice of participation and the service of the notice of claim from 14 to 28 days. We believe that 14 days is too short a period to allow the leaseholders to decide how they wish to respond to a notice to participate. What if a notice were served the day after a leaseholder left for a two-week holiday? We consider that 28 days would be more appropriate. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-33_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   As regards the proposal to increase the minimum period from 14 to 28 days, we consider that it is unnecessary and would cause another delay. The 14-day gap is intended to allow leaseholders the opportunity to reflect on whether they support the acquisition of the right to manage. If enough of them do, the notice can be served once the 14 days have expired. If they do not, the company will have to wait until sufficient members agree and it can serve the notice.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-33_para22"></a>If someone was away, it would not affect that calculation at all. When they returned they could indicate that they wished to participate. However, if there was a majority there already, their subsequent view would not be relevant. If someone was away on a holiday for longer than 14 days and there was not a majority, the whole process would have to wait anyway. I do not believe that these amendments are necessary.

("( ) It must include an offer of cover to provide for the RTM company directors' and officers' liability insurance, fidelity guarantee and professional indemnity insurance.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10301-34_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment would require the RTM company to include in its notice of claim that it had secured an offer from an insurance company to provide appropriate insurance cover. The intention of the amendment is to offer a means by <P>


<a name="column_CWH1529"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1529</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which the RTM company can demonstrate its competence to manage and reassure all parties without laying itself open to any form of challenge regarding the degree to which it would be competent.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-34_para7"></a>The amendment would require the company to obtain the three forms of insurance specified. The first is directors' and officers' liability insurance to protect those leaseholders involved in the management of the RTM company. It is already widely regarded as good practice for residents and management companies to obtain that form of insurance. The protection it offers against personal liability for the consequences of any errors on the part of a lessee who is involved in management may encourage more people to volunteer to serve.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-34_para8"></a>The second is a fidelity guarantee to protect leaseholders' funds held by third parties in service charge or reserve fund accounts against theft or embezzlement, with the intention that the moneys would be directly protected. Any loss would be restored immediately while the insurers pursued the culprit.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-34_para9"></a>The third protection is professional indemnity insurance to insure the company against the consequences of any failure in the day-to-day management of the block. It is unlikely that an insurer would agree to offer professional indemnity insurance without being certain that those undertaking the day-to-day management were competent. To give one example, insurers would wish to be certain that health and safety issues would be managed in a professional and competent manner, which would be expected of a commercial managing agent. We see no reason why an individual leaseholder should expect any less protection from the arrangements put in place by the RTM companies. The benefits to the leaseholders and the RTM company from these forms of insurance are, we believe, self-evident.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-34_para10"></a>Amendment No. 133C is also in this group. That amendment sets a deadline of two months, rather than one month, to respond to the notice of claim for the right to manage. As with Amendment No. 132A, we believe that the timeframe proposed is too short. We prefer the deadline for responses to be two months, in keeping with the parallel requirement for responses to claims, enfranchisement or lease extension.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-34_para11"></a>My noble friend Lord Caithness and the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, have tabled Amendment No. 136 which is also in this group. I support that amendment. I beg to move Amendment No. 133B.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-34_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   Perhaps I may draw the Committee's attention to Amendment No. 136 which is grouped with this amendment. I call this my "health warning provision". There is a potential liability as to costs for a right-to-manage company in various circumstances. I believe that it is only right that before--this is the important point--one enters into a right-to-manage company one's attention is drawn to these liabilities, which can be substantial. The Committee will find the liabilities in Clauses 85 and 86 of the Bill.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-34_para12"></a>It is important to remember that these are joint and several liabilities; there is not only your potential share of the liability as a member of the RTM company but the overall liability should one of the other people involved default on their share of the costs. I believe that that should be drawn to everyone's attention before the proceedings start, rather than waking up to it later, as I have experienced in my practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-34_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I have added my name to the noble Earl's amendment. It is an improvement on the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. I have very serious problems with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-34_para13"></a>Directors and liability insurance is now almost impossible to obtain. Certainly an RTM company would have enormous difficulty in obtaining this kind of insurance in the market--as it would with fidelity insurance--and even the larger firms of consultants are having difficulty in renegotiating their professional indemnity insurance. I understand that the legal profession also is having problems with this. I do not see this as a practical proposition for directors of RTM companies. I do not believe that any underwriter would accept them.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-34_para14"></a>Although the provisions of Amendment No. 136 are quite draconian, I believe, as the noble Earl said, that there should be a health warning for people going in for the right to manage. Again, it comes down to the proposition that people should go into the right to manage with their eyes fully open as to what they are letting themselves in for. When the Bill is enacted, a section such as this would be helpful in that regard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-34_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I think that the health warning in Amendment No. 136 is a very worthwhile addition to the Bill. In many cases we will be dealing with people who may be quite inexperienced in what they are taking on; therefore, what they are getting into needs to be made very clear. It is all too easy for people to be seduced into thinking that a right to manage is very attractive, but they need to be faced very clearly with the consequences.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-34_para15"></a>I also have some concerns about Amendment No. 133B. My concerns partially reflect what the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, said. The amendment as it stands seems attractive, but it is all about quantum. You could have a very low amount of cover which achieves very little other than providing something for a fig leaf of respectability. It is about the quantum cover and the nature of the wording of the cover that is to be provided. You can have wording which is sufficiently opaque and broadly drawn as to have very little impact.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-34_para16"></a>There is also another reason why we probably do not need this provision. I suspect that every director of an RTM company will want it. You therefore do not need to write it into the legislation because the directors of the RTM company will themselves be seeking it in order to protect their position. It will therefore be drawn in inexorably by the directors of the RTM company who will want to have it. Amendment No. 133B represents another hurdle which we do not need to impose.

<A NAME="10301-34_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am sorry that we cannot agree that the claim notice should have to include an offer to take out liability assurance. I am less sorry after hearing the noble Lords, Lord Hodgson and Lord Williams, because it would effectively make insurance a further qualifying criterion by the back door.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-34_para17"></a>The right to manage is designed to reflect the fact that the leaseholders hold a majority of the equity of the building and should therefore already have a say in the management of the block. We are putting leaseholders on a more even keel with other home owners. We cannot agree that that needs to be hedged around with requirements that are based on the presupposition that they will not be competent enough to take sensible decisions about the management of that property. We have heard graphic examples from a number of Members of the Committee of people who have been put in the position of managing property who are not competent to do so. However, there is no protection to be found from having a nanny state and putting on the face of the Bill things that are not appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-34_para18"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is right: the benefits of insurance are self-evident. It would be very sensible for the RTM company to consider taking out insurance of that kind. However, the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, had a valid point: the fact of saying that there should be insurance does not guarantee that there would be adequate insurance, and the problem of defining "adequate insurance" on the face of the Bill would be quite significant. We cannot agree to making them do so, therefore.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-34_para19"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, also proposes allowing two months to respond to a claim notice. The procedure for acquiring the right to manage, and particularly the timescale involved, have been the subject of much discussion with interested parties. Nobody has suggested that one month is too short, so we stick to the view that one month is enough. Adding a further month would only introduce further delay for no good purpose.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-34_para20"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, is interesting. It is intended to ensure on the face of the Bill that the parties are aware that in the event of the failure of an RTM bid the individual leaseholders, as well as the RTM company, are jointly and severally liable for the landlord's reasonable costs. I certainly agree that everybody should be aware of the respective rights and liabilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-34_para21"></a>The Bill provides that the form and content of both the notices of invitation to participate, required under Clause 75, and claim notices may be prescribed by regulation. That would provide the opportunity for us to require an appropriate statement about this matter to be included in the notices. That would meet the requirements of the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, that people should be made aware before they become members. This amendment, which refers only to claim notices, would not do that. Our power under regulations will also apply to the notice of intention to <P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-35_para4"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10301-35_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment removes the subsection that states that a claim notice for the right to manage is not invalidated by inaccuracies in the particulars required. This is intended as a probing amendment. If a claim notice is not invalidated by inaccuracy, what requirement is there to be accurate? We appreciate that the intention may be to ensure that minor errors, such as spelling mistakes, errors in the precise postcode, or mixing up the leaseholders and their flat numbers, need not invalidate a claim. However, we would be interested to know how accurate a claim should be in the light of this subsection.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-35_para6"></a>Amendment No. 136B was also in the group. This amendment requires a claim notice for the right to manage to be registered with the Land Registry, so that it will show up on any searches undertaken on behalf of the prospective purchaser of any flat or freehold. This proposal parallels the provision which is already in place for leasehold enfranchisement and lease extension, through the Leasehold Reform Regulations (1967) and the Leasehold Reform Regulations (1993), as they relate to Section 110 of the Land Registration Act 1925, which requires the vendor to ensure that all relevant information regarding title is registered with the Land Registry. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-35_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am relieved to find that Amendment No. 136A is a probing amendment. <P>


<a name="column_CWH1533"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1533</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>We think subsection (1) of Clause 79 is a very important provision which we would not wish to lose. Subsection (1) says that any inaccuracy in the claim notice does not, of itself, invalidate that notice. We know from experience that many landlords will look for any excuse to reject a claim notice. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, suggests it could be a wrong postcode, a wrong flat number, or even a mis-spelt word, but that is obstructive behaviour which subsection (1) would prevent.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-35_para7"></a>At the same time, as the Explanatory Notes to the Bill make clear, this subsection does not allow the leaseholder to get away with making a false claim. If the claim notice incorrectly claims that the leaseholders are entitled to acquire the right to manage, the landlord will be able to make a counter-notice disputing their eligibility to do so. We feel that a sensible balance has been struck.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-35_para8"></a>The next amendment requires that the RTM company be required to register a claim notice. We are not convinced that there is any need for this. It is for a potential purchaser of any landlord's interest to make appropriate inquiries about the interest he is planning to buy. Vendors of freeholds will have duties to provide relevant information to prospective purchasers. If a purchaser is not given all of the right information, such as the existence of a claim notice, that would seem to be mis-selling and the purchaser should look to the vendor for redress. We do not see this as the responsibility of the RTM company.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-35_para9"></a>Following the introduction of a right to manage, we would expect purchasers of freeholds, or their advisers, to be aware that the right may be exercisable where the property is eligible and make purchasing decisions on that basis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-35_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   Amendment No. 136A was a probing amendment and therefore I have no intention whatever of pursuing it in substance. I would like to thank the noble Lord the Minister for his very full answer.

<A NAME = "10301-35_para18"></a>The Government's approach is to give lessees an absolute right to manage. It matters not on the Government's approach that the landlord is a paragon of virtue and carries out his management functions meticulously and cheaply. It matters not on the Government's approach that the lessees' whole purpose in acquiring a right to manage may be to avoid doing vital repairs to the building. No matter how good the landlord, no matter how disastrous the lessees' intentions might be, the lessees will have the right to manage.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-35_para19"></a>It seems to us, on this side of the Committee, that the right solution is to have a much more flexible system. Everyone's objective must be to improve the quality of the country's housing stock and it is in the interests of both landlords and tenants to ensure that the management of property is the best possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-35_para20"></a>The solution, in my view, is for the leasehold valuation tribunal to carry out a balancing exercise to determine whether a particular block is likely to be better managed by the landlord or by the tenants. In some cases, it may be clear that the tenants should have the right to manage. The landlord may for years impose exorbitant service charges for repairs which are lamentably carried out. In other cases, the landlord may have been first-class, but the leases in the building have only a few years to run and the tenants want to avoid carrying out extensive structural work that is essential to keep the building in good condition. Amendment No. 139 sets out a number of matters which would be relevant to the carrying out of a sensible balancing exercise.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-35_para21"></a>If these amendments are not accepted, it seems to me that the Government will have great difficulty in showing that a landlord's human rights have not been infringed. As I said in setting out the Opposition's approach to this part of the Bill, the right to manage is a valuable one. Landlords quite legitimately, in order to manage blocks of flats, have those rights. It is justifiable to take away that right without paying compensation if the landlord is abusing his position. This kind of case would plainly satisfy the Duke of Westminster criteria set down by the European Court of Human Rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-35_para22"></a>What is not justifiable is taking away not only the profits of managing but also potentially damaging the landlord's reversionary interest in cases where necessary repairs are likely to be postponed. There is simply no pressing social need for that kind of expropriation without compensation. That is why giving the leasehold valuation tribunal the power to carry out a balancing exercise is important. The message which needs to go out from this Committee is that Parliament condemns bad landlords but supports good landlords. I beg to move.

<A NAME="10301-35_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   No doubt the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, will not be surprised to hear that we on these Benches disagree very strongly indeed with this group of amendments. We believe that the whole purpose of the right to manage in Chapter 1 of Part II <P>


<a name="column_CWH1535"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1535</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the Bill is to get over the problems that have been shown up in the past few years by the necessity for proving that there has been mismanagement by the landlord. One gets round all that by making it a right for people to take over the management. We know that in many cases, if the landlord is a good landlord, they would certainly be well advised not to take over the management themselves. However, there will be many cases in which they do. It will be infinitely simpler and a great deal cheaper for them if they come along and say that they have the necessary number of qualifying tenants who agree that they want to take it over, and they then set up their RTM company.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-35_para23"></a>These amendments would take us back to the existing system and would potentially make it enormously costly as one would need to have substantial litigation in order to establish one's right. One only has to look at Amendment No. 139 and at the list of issues that the leasehold valuation tribunal will have consider to see that the proceedings could stretch for days, if not weeks; the potential cost could be enormous. We believe that the effect of this group of amendments would be to effectively destroy the whole of the right-to-manage scheme.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-36_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   In contrast to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, this seems to me a very worthwhile group of amendments. They would introduce a highly desirable safeguard into the Bill, particularly as one could count upon the leasehold valuation tribunals to come to a fair and balanced judgment. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, may have overlooked that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-36_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jacobs: </B>   I cannot support the amendment. Of all the provisions that the Government are putting into the Bill, the one most supported by leaseholders--and the least disappointing--is the right to manage. The amendment would destroy any benefit that leaseholders will secure.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-36_para0"></a>Having said that, as I said before, I live in central London and have one of the greater landlords as the freeholder, who manages the property. In the last two or three years, he has doubled and redoubled his efforts to do the most professional job imaginable. One would need to be barking mad to consider taking over the management because it could not be done to the same standards. However, the possibility of the tenants taking over the management is a spur to good management, particularly to the landlords. I, therefore, strongly oppose the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-36_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Jacobs, are right; these amendments expose the real difference between us on Chapter I, Part II of the Bill. If they were to be agreed to, Part II of the Bill would not be worth pursuing.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-36_para1"></a>The principle behind the Bill is a "no-fault" right to manage. The criterion for the right-to-manage is that the leaseholders should have the greatest share of the equity of the building. We argue that, if they have that, they should be able to take over responsibility for managing the investment without having to prove shortcomings on the part of the landlord or to prove <P>


<a name="column_CWH1536"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1536</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that they were more suitable managers. The noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Jacobs, have made it clear that if they thought they would be conspicuously less suitable managers--and if there was no cause for complaint--they would not wish to manage, and that that is the protection.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-36_para2"></a>The phrase "just and convenient" comes from Part II of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987, which enables leaseholders to apply to a leasehold valuation tribunal for the appointment of a manager where the landlord has failed to comply with his obligations. The use of the phrase in those circumstances allows the tribunal to balance the landlord's failings against the consequences of losing management responsibility. That does not work in these circumstances. "Just" to whom? "Convenient" to whom? The question is left entirely open.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-36_para3"></a>It has been said already that Amendment No. 139 has a long list of matters which would have to be taken into account, but the list is not exhaustive. Amendment No. 139 says "shall have regard in particular" to these matters, which allows others to be involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-36_para4"></a>There are plenty of safeguards in the Bill. There are safeguards for landlords or other occupants if the RTM company fails to manage the building. This includes the right to apply to a leasehold valuation tribunal for the appointment of a new manager, to which I have already referred. The manager could be the landlord himself if the tribunal accepted that he was suitably competent to carry out this role. It is unnecessary to add a further hurdle to be overcome before the leaseholders can exercise the right in the first place.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-36_para5"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said that the landlord has a right to protect the reversionary value of his property. Clause 94(1) allows a landlord to require a right-to-manage company to carry out its management responsibilities. This, together with his right to be a member of the company, allows him to safeguard his reversionary interest. If the RTM company persistently falls down in its duties, anyone affected could seek its replacement under the 1987 Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-36_para6"></a>It would be wrong for the right to be taken away on spurious grounds. The amendment suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, would provide unscrupulous landlords with every opportunity to frustrate or obstruct leaseholders' legitimate aims. We simply cannot accept what would, in effect, destroy Chapter 1 of Part II.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-36_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   To make it absolutely clear to the Committee, we strongly support the principle of the right to manage. That is not in issue. Moreover, we deplore the conduct of bad landlords and their practices.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-36_para7"></a>Our concern is where a good landlord, who has an unblemished record, is required to transfer the right to manage to a right-to-manage company which subsequently manages the property badly. The Minister has described to the Committee a number of provisions in the Bill which he believes will prevent <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>such a situation occurring. In our submission, however, those provisions, in themselves, are insufficient to deal with the problem that I have outlined. I shall reflect on the noble Lord's reply and come back to this issue, perhaps in a different form, on Report.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-36_para8"></a>I omitted to speak to Amendment No. 147 in the group. I shall speak to it when we arrive at its place in the list. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-36_para14"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10301-36_para15"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving Amendment No. 142, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 143 and 144. They are simple amendments. They seek to leave out "court" and insert "leasehold valuation tribunal". The Bill rightly gives emphasis to increased role for the leasehold valuation tribunals. I see no reason why that is not the appropriate body to deal with landlords who are not traceable, which is the kernel of Clause 82.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-36_para16"></a>A leasehold valuation tribunal is a much less daunting prospect for a right-to-manage company than going to court. Much as I admire and like solicitors, unless it is absolutely necessary, the further they are kept away from property the better. This is one area where they can be kept just that little bit further away. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-36_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   We support the amendment. It seems appropriate that the leasehold valuation tribunal should become a specialist court, dealing as far as possible with all the issues that arise under the Bill. It is appropriate that these particular issues should be determined by the LVT. It will be a more informal and, we hope, a quicker and cheaper way of dealing with such issues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-36_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   We also support the amendment, although we consider that the operation of the leasehold valuation tribunals at the moment leaves something to be desired. We shall table amendments later in the Bill to that effect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-36_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The reason we suggested putting this to the courts was because the courts have to make similar decisions in other areas and no particular specialist expertise is required. We do not think that leaseholders, going to the courts in this way, are likely to receive a substantial bill of costs. There is a precedent in the 1993 Act for the procedure for collective enfranchisement where the landlord cannot be found, but we do not feel very strongly about this. There are other precedents in other parts of the Bill, where we have transferred some categories of leasehold disputes to the leasehold valuation tribunals. <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "10301-36_para17"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart--I am grateful for his support--that the LVTs need strengthening.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-37_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   We believe that, as between the landlord and an RTM company, there should be no liability for each other's costs, as now provided by Clauses 85 and 86. Members of an RTM company are almost always likely to be less able to afford costs than the landlord. There will therefore be a serious disincentive to them if they have to pay the landlord's costs as well as their own--and, of course, they will <P>


<a name="column_CWH1539"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1539</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have to pay their own. Equally, if the landlords are liable to pay their own costs, there will be an incentive on them to reach an early agreement.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-37_para0"></a>It is true that, under Clause 85, the landlord's costs had to be reasonable, but "reasonable" is, frankly, an elastic word. If the RTM company wishes to challenge the reasonableness of the landlord's claim costs, that challenge will itself be the subject, potentially, of further litigation, increasing the lessee's costs still further.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-37_para1"></a>If we seriously want to help lessees obtain the right to manage, we should exclude this proposed liability to pay the landlord's costs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-37_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   These clauses would completely remove the right of recipients of claim notices and landlords to recover the reasonable costs of dealing with those notices. While one does not want to use the emotive term "expropriation", unlike the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, it cannot be right that someone who has had his rights taken away compulsorily should bear the costs involved in dealing with that. Anyone who is served with a claim notice has a legitimate right to defend himself if he wishes to challenge it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-37_para2"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, indicated, it is not a blank cheque; one must be reasonable. The process of challenging those costs is through the LVT, which we have all agreed is a sensible and relatively informal way to resolve these issues. This amendment is not appropriate. The landlord must have the ability to recover reasonable costs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-37_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Jacobs: </B>   I support my noble friend Lord Goodhart. The argument of the Minister that each side should have the right to claim costs in the event of a loss sounds very reasonable at first blush. However, the parties are unequal, and that is where the problem between leaseholders and freeholders starts. If in the main the parties are unequal and power and strength lie with the freeholder, as we have seen with leasehold extensions before the LVT where the parties may take some time to put forward their cases, the costs incurred by landlords may be quite frightening. On occasion they employ, not surprisingly, the very best, and hence the most expensive, counsel, and that scares leaseholders most of all. It is wrong to treat the two parties as equal; in reality, almost invariably that is not so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-37_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   It would probably establish a right of precedent for the RTM. If the RTM is successful in its claim it has redressed that inequality. At that point the landlord is no longer an unequal party and, therefore, has a claim to have his reasonable expenses repaid. I accept that there may be landlords who try to seek unreasonable expenses; certainly, history indicates that that happens, but in relation to that there is the safeguard of the LVT. Clause 85(2) is also an important qualification, in that costs are reasonable only if they are of the kind that the landlord would <P>


<a name="column_CWH1540"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>incur if he was personally liable for them. There are a number of safeguards here. Therefore, I hope that these clauses are not deleted.

<A NAME = "10301-37_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that there is a safety net in place if an RTM company takes over the management of a block and things go wrong. One of the omissions from the Bill is the failure to include any method of removing an RTM company once it has started to manage a block. There are two situations in which it may become appropriate to remove an RTM company from management: first, where the tenants no longer want the company to manage; secondly, where the company grossly mismanages.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-37_para7"></a>If the RTM company ceases to have the support of the majority of the tenants it must be right that interested parties can apply to have the company removed as the manager.

The same arguments apply to the cessation of the RTM company rights as apply to the establishment of RTM company rights. They are a mirror image, as it were. That is borne out by the fact that Amendment No. 147 uses the same "just and convenient" phrase which was to be found in Amendment No. 137. All tenants have the right to seek the replacement of a defective RTM company under the 1987 Act by virtue of Schedule 7. There is plenty of protection.

<A NAME = "10301-37_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 148A, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 148B. These amendments would require the acquisition date to be set as a quarter day and to allow a minimum three-month handover period, unless the parties agreed otherwise. The date of handover of management responsibility should, in our submission, be linked to a clear date in the service charge year. The quarter days are fixed and well known. Although not all leases refer to quarter days, landlords and managing agents are used to working around these dates as focal points for management activity.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-37_para13"></a>We believe that the minimum period of one month specified in Clause 78(7) is too short to allow an effective and orderly handover, and recommend that a three-month minimum period after the service of the counter-notice be allowed and that the RTM company should take over responsibility on the next quarter day after that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-37_para14"></a>I have had no luck so far with my amendments to extend time periods. I look forward to the Minister's reply with a degree of fatalism. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=3>concerned. Where there is a counter-notice, that has to be determined by a leasehold valuation tribunal. Whether it is by agreement or whether it is by decision of the tribunal, these amendments would extend the period from that date to the point where the acquisition occurs. We can see no justification for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-37_para15"></a>The leaseholders have a right to a say in the management of the property--that has been established either by agreement or by the tribunal--and there is no reason for undue further delay, whether by reference to three months, to quarter days or whatever. One month seems to us to be adequate. If it has been challenged, there has already been some delay and there is no reason to extend it further.

<A NAME = "10301-38_para5"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 88 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-38_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I rise to speak to the Question that Clauses 88 and 89 shall stand part of the Bill. I am not convinced that the Government's intentions with respect to these provisions are clear, and I think they will pose practical problems. I appreciate that the intention of these arrangements is to ensure that an RTM company is not bound by what are called "sweetheart contracts"--to prevent a disgruntled landlord from shackling the RTM company with unsuitable contracts during the handover period.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-38_para6"></a>We understand that the Government's intention is that existing contracts will transfer to the RTM company, when the right to manage is exercised, only if both the company and the contractor agree; but we are not sure that this is clear from the Bill as drafted.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-38_para7"></a>Clauses 88 and 89 deal with the service of notices relating to management contracts but do not make clear what happens to those contracts once the notice is served. Landlords will be required to serve notices on their contractors at least one month before the handover of management so that the contractor has time to make any arrangements in the light of the changing circumstances and negotiate as necessary. It would be extremely helpful to have clarification from the Minister as to his understanding of the position relating to compensation as a result of a contract being frustrated.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-38_para8"></a>We are not convinced that the Government have appreciated that contractors may be influenced in their decision as to whether to continue a contract by the financial strength of the RTM company. A contractor may be happy to deal with the landlord who has a track record and real assets; he may be less certain in dealing with an RTM company. We wonder whether <P>


<a name="column_CWH1543"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1543</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contractors will accept a contract from an RTM company if they do not believe that the company will be in a position to pay.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-38_para9"></a>We are also concerned that the Government have not considered the impact of buildings withdrawing from the landlord's bulk purchasing arrangements on those leaseholders who remain under the landlord's management. It is quite possible that they, through no fault or decision of their own--or indeed the landlord's--will find themselves forced to pay more for services because the landlord is unable to obtain as good a deal with a smaller portfolio.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-38_para10"></a>As to insurance matters, as I understand it, it is not possible to frustrate insurance contracts under the present law because of the continuity of the insured interest, which is not affected by management arrangements. The circumstances appear rather closer to that of a novation or assignment where the freeholder must be specifically released from the obligation. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-38_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   I am grateful for this opportunity to stand up and get the circulation going in this rather cold room in which the Committee is being conducted. I agree with what my noble friend said about this clause. I find it highly unclear and it is a very important section that needs clarification.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-38_para11"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 151, which is grouped with the clause stand part debates in respect of Clauses 88 and 89, is designed to write into the Bill what I think the Bill is trying to say. It is not trying to add to the Bill; it is merely clarifying the situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-38_para12"></a>I need the Minister to do that for me. What will happen to existing contracts at the handover of the management, and what will happen to frustrated contracts?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-38_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Amendment No. 152 is also part of this group. Clause 88 and 89 undoubtedly require clarification. Having read the clauses and having looked at the Explanatory Notes, I came to an entirely different conclusion from the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. My understanding was that the existing contracts would be continued but simply transferred from the landlord to the RTM company. Indeed, it seems generally appropriate that that should be the case. Let us take, for example, a contract with a gardening contractor in respect of which there is no problem. If that contract is only terminable on, let us say, six months' notice given on either side, I see no reason why the change from the landlord to the RTM company should have the effect of terminating the rights of the gardening contractor.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-38_para13"></a>For that reason, I would on this occasion be unable to support Amendment No. 151 which would treat all contracts entered into by the landlord as being null and void and frustrated. The effect would be that somebody who had entered into a contract and who might have incurred expenditure on the basis of that contract continuing for a period of time, would have no right whatever to compensation.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH1544"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1544</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-38_para14"></a>We have come up with a different solution. We recognise that there can be a problem with existing service contracts. Sometimes, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said, there is a sweetheart contract, a contract with an associated company of the landlord or some element of mutual back-scratching. However, we believe that there is no reason why there should be an automatic termination or why the RTM company should have power to terminate a fair and reasonable contract. We believe there should be a power to terminate the cause, and Amendment No. 152 first suggests that any contract entered into after the RTM claim notice has been served should be subject to review. Once the claim notice has been served, of course, the landlord is on notice that he is not in a position to enter into long-term contracts without the risk of the RTM company disclaiming them when it takes over the right to manage. That would prevent contracts being dished out by the landlord to his associates.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-38_para15"></a>Amendment No. 152 gives a power to terminate contracts entered into before the claim notice has been served for a cause. We have suggested what those causes should be: where the money payable to the contractor party is too much, where the services to be provided are inappropriate--for example, services that do not actually need to be done-- where they are done to an excessively high and expensive standard, or where the contractor party is not a fit and proper person to provide the services. We believe that those are matters to be dealt with in the opinion of the directors, but that opinion must be a genuine opinion before the power to terminate can be entered into. We would be perfectly happy if this amendment was accepted on the basis that it should be not only a genuine but a reasonable opinion. We believe that this amendment is the right solution to what is obviously a somewhat complicated problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-38_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   This is certainly a complicated problem about which there is some misunderstanding. I shall try not to add to that. The Bill allows normal contract law to apply where the right to manage is acquired. Under contract law, contrary to what the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart implied, the reality is that a contract will normally fall as frustrated where one of the parties is placed in a position where he or she is no longer able to fulfil the obligations. Hence, a contract which relates to the management of a property will normally be frustrated where the right to manage is acquired for that property, because it will take away the existing manager's management functions and his ability to fulfil his side of the contract.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-38_para16"></a>As far as concerns compensation, which was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, under normal contract law at the point where a contract falls frustrated the contractor can recover the costs already incurred under the contract, but there is no entitlement to further compensation above that respective compensation. We believe it right that when the RTM company takes over it should not have to take over all the contract. We, therefore, do not want to interfere with what would be the normal operation of contract law.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-38_para17"></a>We recognise, however, that there are a number of other considerations. First, it would not be fair for contractors simply to lose their business without having had notice. There will also be contracts which the RTM company will wish to take over. It is for that reason that we have not provided in the Bill that contracts must always be frustrated. That would be too inflexible and counter-productive. In many cases the RTM company will want to take over those contracts. We also want to give landlords the opportunity to re-negotiate contracts which perhaps apply to more than one property, such as a gardening contract, or whatever.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-38_para18"></a>In the light of those considerations, the Bill makes provision for notices to be served in good time to make everyone aware that the right is to be acquired and the legal position which follows, and to make the necessary adjustments. I should also make clear that nothing in the Bill overrides the employment rights of anybody concerned, including those under TUPE. There is nothing in the Bill which causes a right-to-manage company to be obliged to take over a gardening contract, or any other, unless it has agreed to do so. There is, therefore, no need for the powers envisaged by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-38_para19"></a>I also have some trouble with the amendment tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, which provides that all contracts are automatically frustrated once the RTM company acquires the right to manage. This would mean that the RTM company could not, by agreement or whatever, take over any of the landlord's existing contracts. It would, therefore, be put in the position of always having to start from scratch, whatever was the most sensible situation. It would also leave a landlord who had more than one property, and a contract covering more than one property, with the requirement to re-negotiate the existing contract but to exclude the RTM property in all circumstances. We have designed the provisions in these clauses and elsewhere to prevent such ridiculous situations arising.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-38_para20"></a>Amendment No. 151 tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, also purports to provide that the normal rules of contract law shall continue to apply. That is the case but it has the consequences which I spelled out rather than the ones which the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, spelled out. It is difficult and complicated and we have taken careful advice. If we were to state it in such broad terms in the Bill, it could be misleading. Instead, we would have to set out in all detail what the application of contract law means.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-38_para21"></a>Members of the Committee will appreciate that we are not all that keen to undertake such a significant expansion of the Bill. However, normal contract law will apply where the right to manage is acquired. It has the consequences I have tried to spell out, and there are good reasons why the fact that it applies should be implicit rather than explicit in the way that the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, would suggest. Given the complexity, for the purposes of <P>

<P>
<A NAME="10301-39_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, replies, I have not researched this but I am not quite as sure as the Minister that the contracts necessarily would be frustrated. The issue about transferability of contracts is a complicated one. The basic rule is that the benefit of a contract can be transferred but the burden of a contract cannot. However, if the gardening contractor who is providing the services is willing to continue to provide those services to the RTM company, I am not entirely certain that the court would not be prepared to draw an implication that the contract was not, in those circumstances, frustrated, and that the gardening contractor was entitled to continue to provide those services and to receive payment for them from the RTM company rather than from the landlord. That may or not be the case--I am not saying that it is--but I believe that this issue will need to be looked at with some care in the interval between now and Report stage. I shall try to do so myself and perhaps the Government will also consider doing so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-39_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   The Minister said that he had received careful advice. Having listened to what he has had to say and being interested to hear how the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, took a different view from me on reading the Bill, I wonder whether the Minister would seek more careful advice on this clause. I am more muddled than I was before I heard what has been said. I shall have to read it in Hansard because the acoustics in this room are not great at the best of times. This area needs clarification. Perhaps we can look at it between now and the Report stage.

<A NAME="10301-39_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I do not rise to withdraw an amendment because I do not have an amendment down. I simply speak to the Question that Clause 88 and 89 shall stand part of the Bill. My noble friend Lord Caithness and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, gave the Committee very good advice. We can all go away and read what we each said, form our own views and come back at Report stage to hear whether or not the Minister will reaffirm what he has already said, or whether he has reconsidered his position and returns with a modified view.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
CONTINUING LIABILITIES
<BR>
(" .--(1) Where a liability exists as a result of an event prior to the acquisition date, the responsibility for that liability rests with whoever was the manager party at the time of the event.
<BR>
(2) If a liability such as described in subsection (1) exists, the RTM company shall permit the former manager party and any person authorised to act on his behalf reasonable access to any relevant documentation (or, if the information is recorded in the <P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10301-39_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: I rise to speak to Amendment No. 152A. The amendment ensures that if a liability exists, it remains the responsibility of whoever was responsible for the management at the time it arose, and gives the former manager a right of access to any relevant files in such circumstances until the issue is resolved.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-39_para5"></a>Where there are continuing liabilities arising from an event prior to the date of the hand-over of responsibility, it should be made clear that the liability remains with whoever was responsible at that time, and does not transfer to the new management regime. It is logical, in these circumstances, that the landlord should have the right of access to the relevant files until the matter is concluded, even where the RTM company would have a subsequent interest once the case is settled. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-39_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, for explaining that. At first sight, we do not agree that this provision is necessary. There is nothing the Bill itself will do to transfer any liability which was incurred before the acquisition of a right to manage. This is partly bound up with our previous discussion on what will happen to existing contracts. It may be that we can reach greater clarification on that at a later stage in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-39_para6"></a>The amendment also proposes granting powers to the landlord to access documents held by the RMT company. That does not seem necessary. Clause 90 requires the previous manager to hand over only information which is required in connection with a company's management of the building. As liability does not pass across, it should not be the case that any documentation relating to that liability would have passed across. Therefore, I do not see the need for that part of the amendment either.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-39_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   Perhaps on reflection, it would have been better to have dealt with this amendment in the course of the discussion on the previous grouping. We shall wait to hear what the Minister has to say on Report on the general issue of contractual liability, and in the light of that, reconsider whether or not I should press this amendment.

In other words, there is an RTM company that we want to see succeed, we want to see take over <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the block, but it is not getting all the information that it needs, and some it will not get until two months after it has taken over the management of that block.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-39_para12"></a>That is wrong. As soon as the claim notice has been put forward, there ought to be an overlap period. There should be a regular flow of information for at least two months between the landlord and the right-to-manage company before the right-to-manage company takes over. There is also a provision that where information is not provided, that matter could be referred to the LVT. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-39_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I should like to support the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, and I have put my name to the other amendments in the group. I am particularly concerned that an RTM company could start business without any funds. That seems to be something that the Government do not intend and which this amendment would correct.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-39_para13"></a>As I read the Bill at present, there is no obligation for the landlord to hand over uncommitted service charges at the acquisition date; it may wait until the appropriate moment. This seems to put the RTM company in a very difficult position. We are trying to achieve a smooth handover from a landlord to an RTM company. I believe that these amendments, taken in the round, would ensure that the handover is as smooth as it can possibly be. There will undoubtedly be difficulties, but we want to make it as smooth as possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-39_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I appreciate that we are all seeking to ensure a smooth transition of management. Quite frankly, with this Bill it has been quite difficult to know what to do for the best and there are conflicting suggestions. We appreciate that in many cases it would indeed be helpful if the transfer of functions and the handing over of monies were to take place at the same time. However, we also recognise that some leaseholders will wish to take over the management at the earliest possible date because they are concerned that the existing landlord may well exploit any delay.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-39_para14"></a>We fear that this amendment would leave leaseholders vulnerable to such a position and also reduce the time available for landlords to produce the records. The arrangements for handover in the Bill were drawn up after extensive consultations and represent a compromise between the various conflicting concerns. We would be reluctant to move away from those arrangements. There will be many situations where an element of co-operation will enable the parties to agree sensible arrangements for the transfer of responsibility and to agree sensible timetables--the provisions in the Bill allow plenty of scope for that--but where there is an element of antagonism or mistrust, leaseholders would almost certainly wish to gain control as rapidly as possible. In such cases, they would need to accept a temporary period of inconvenience and may need to finance expenditure arising. Nevertheless, the issue as to who was controlling the building would be resolved.

I hope that, on reflection, the Minister will think carefully about these amendments because they are specifically designed to ease the transition period and to ensure a smooth handover.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-39_para16"></a>The Minister said that in a bad situation the right-to-manage company will be eager to take over as soon as possible. I can understand that. However, I would have serious concerns for that RTM company if it does not have all the information. The landlord must be required to provide information for the right-to-manage company by a certain time, otherwise that company would be opening itself up to potential liabilities in order to enter into a contract in good faith. The RTM company wants to see its block properly managed and believes that it can manage it better than the landlord, but, unless it has all the information required, how can it possibly be in a position to make a sensible judgment?
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-39_para17"></a>This is a very serious area that we have still to resolve. I do not like the situation in which relevant information could be handed over as much as two months after the new management company has taken over. That is surely not right. I hope that the noble Lord will reflect on that further between now and another stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-39_para18"></a>I am grateful for the support of the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, on these amendments.

<A NAME = "10301-40_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a short and somewhat technical point. Under Clause 91 the landlord must hand over to the RTM company uncommitted service <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>charges. Those are sums that he has received and holds by way of service charges, less whatever amount is required to meet the costs which have previously been incurred in connection with the matters for which service charges are payable. The problem is that, although the costs may have been incurred, the amount that is needed to pay for them may well be uncertain.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-40_para8"></a>In an ordinary building contract the landlord may say that the amount is too much because the work has not been done properly. Equally, the builder may say that the amount under the contract is not enough because additional work has been done as a result of extras falling outside the contract. Therefore, there may be uncertainty as to what is required. Where there is such uncertainty it seems appropriate that the landlord should be entitled to hold on to the sums that are payable for work that has already been done, but if at the end of the day it turns out that the amount he has to pay is not as large as that the balance must be handed over, along with the uncommitted service charges that have already been handed over, to the RTM company.

<P>

We see no need to expand the definition of "management" in the way suggested in this amendment. "Management function" is intended to relate to what the company will take on under the leases to the property. The company will also be required to comply with any statutory requirements which are binding upon it as a manager. They will include health and safety legislation as well as requirements under leasehold, landlord and tenant law. This matter is already covered and no amendment is necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-40_para21"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, also suggests that the RTM company should be required to comply with all relevant guidance. Setting aside the question of precisely what that guidance should be, in any event we see no justification for requiring compliance with guidance. The whole point of guidance is that it is advisory. We encourage people to follow it but do not require it.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 44, line 7, leave out paragraph (a).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-40_para23"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10301-40_para24"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 168, together with our objection that Clause 100 stand part of the Bill, raises the question of the area which the RTM company manages. One starts with Clause 93 which details the management functions. Subsection (5) provides:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'Management functions' are functions with respect to services, repairs, maintenance, improvements, insurance and management".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-40_para25"></a>
Subsection (6) provides:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"But this section does not apply in relation to--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-40_para26"></a><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) functions with respect to a matter concerning only a part of the premises consisting of a flat or other unit not held under a lease by a qualifying tenant".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10301-40_para27"></a>
A "qualifying tenant" is a tenant who holds a lease of a residential flat under a long lease.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-40_para28"></a>The result of this appears to be that the RTM company is responsible for discharging the management functions over all flats which are occupied by long leaseholders, whether or not the long leaseholders are members of the RTM company. However, it does not apply to flats which are held on short-term rental leases, assuming there is no intermediate long leaseholder; nor does the right to manage apply to shop or office premises. I believe that that division of responsibility will be unworkable where a block contains flats, some of which have <P>


<a name="column_CWH1552"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1552</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>qualifying tenants and some of which do not. It appears that the dividing line between a matter which concerns only a particular flat and a matter which concerns that flat and other parts of the premises is not clear. For example, if the landlord originally covenants to provide hot water and heating to the flat and there is a particular problem which affects one flat only which does not happen to have a qualifying tenant, it appears that that is not part of the management functions of the RTM. Whose responsibility is it? Is it some residual function of the landlord?
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-40_para29"></a>I believe that the RTM company should be entitled and required to take over the management of all units which are served by the same common parts whether or not they have qualifying leaseholders. Most commercial premises will not use the same common parts; for example, they will be on the ground floor with separate entrances. I certainly do not object to the amendment of the paragraph so as to exclude from the RTM management functions in respect of units which do not share common parts. There would still be some problems, particularly with structural repairs, and it will be possible to live with that. In my view, you cannot have flats in the same building sharing the same services and the same common parts without a single unified management.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-40_para30"></a>I am also puzzled by the interaction of Clauses 93 and 100. Clause 100 assumes that the service charges payable in respect of excluded units go to the RTM company. How are funds to be made available for any management function in respect of excluded units which are not carried out by the RTM company? Clauses 93 and 100 need to be looked at again and need to be revised. I believe the solution should be that in respect of units sharing the same common parts at least, the management function should be taken over wholly by the RTM company, and the service charges should be paid direct to the RTM company. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-40_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   We oppose this amendment. We agree that the RTM company should be responsible for the management up to the door of the units but not beyond. We support the Bill's intention that freeholders should remain responsible for managing flats let on short leases, which we believe should include relevant assured tenancies and Rent Act tenancies and any units let on business leases.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-40_para31"></a>The relationship between the landlord and these tenants is entirely different from that between the freeholder and leaseholder. Any interference in that relationship could compromise the ability of the landlord to manage his investment and this aspect of the business.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-40_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, for his support. What the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is saying is entirely consistent with what he has been arguing throughout, most recently when he was trying to get the right to manage brought down to leases of seven years instead of 21 years. It is certainly consistent, and if we were to <P>


<a name="column_CWH1553"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column CWH1553</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>follow that approach it would make greater sense for the RTM company to take over responsibility for the whole property, including matters which are internal to units held on commercial and short leases. But that is not what we are intending to do. This would represent a fundamental shift away from the purpose of the right to manage.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-40_para32"></a>Our objective is to provide long leaseholders, who have made a substantial investment in their own homes, with the right to manage the building as a whole. We do not consider it appropriate that they should be able to interfere in the relationship between the landlord and short-term or commercial tenants. It is not our intention to provide other tenants, who will not normally have made a substantial investment in their premises, with the right to manage.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-40_para33"></a>There is no problem at all about the common parts of the property because somebody is responsible. The landlord is responsible or the long leaseholder is responsible, and they are responsible in proper proportion. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, asks who pays for the works done in the units which do not become the responsibility of the RTM company. The relationship of these units under the lease is not affected. If the lease says the tenant pays the landlord, that still applies; it is unaffected by the Bill. We do not see that there is a problem here. The common parts are protected, the members of the right-to-manage company have their own responsibilities, and the landlords have the responsibility for the others.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-40_para34"></a>As regards Clause 100, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, was concerned about the relationship between Clause 93 and Clause 100 rather than Clause 100 as a whole. I have a very long speech in defence of Clause 100, but I do not think it was being attacked. If he will allow me, I should like to write to him about the relationship between Clause 93 and Clause 100.

<A NAME="10301-41_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, for that. I misheard him to begin with and I am grateful for the clarification.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-41_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I remain quite worried by this. It is true that the proposal that the RTM company should take over the management of the whole block as far as it shares the same common parts is consistent with the line we have been taking. However, the amendments are not driven so much by that as by my concern about the workability of the system under which the responsibilities will be divided between the right-to-manage company and the landlord. I simply do not believe that is workable.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-41_para1"></a>If there is going to be a right-to-manage company, it has to take over responsibility, like it or not, for the whole of the block. How will it regard the excluded units? How will one allocate the facilities charge between the RTM company and the landlord? How will one deal with issues such as heating where the RTM company maintains the boilers and so on? If there is a blockage somewhere in the pipes which affects only the radiator of the excluded unit, the responsibility for dealing with that will shift over to the landlord. That is just not workable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-41_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I would not like the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, to sit down feeling dissatisfied with the answers. He is quite right in saying--and I failed initially to make clear to the noble Earl, Lord Caithness--that it is the right-to-manage company which implies the duty to manage. It is responsible exactly as the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, say.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-41_para2"></a>The question of who pays is what I thought was being addressed. The answer is that somebody pays for each of the units, either the RTM company member, the leaseholder, or where there is a shorthold, they pay. If it is a short-term or commercial tenancy, then the responsibility for payment is set out in the lease. Somebody pays for all the units, and therefore somebody pays his share of all the common costs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301-41_para3"></a>The only remaining problem would be if there were a problem of access to get to defective pipes in a single unit, but I cannot imagine that that is what the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is worried about.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10301-41_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   I am not sure I followed the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. I am with the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey. Surely it is not that different from what is happening now. If the landlord is managing the property now, and there are long leases and other leases, which is quite normal, it is not a question of the apportionment of the cost and the liability; it is not to do with the management per se.

There are common parts between the residential parts, and there are common parts for the whole of the shell of the building. My only thought is that when my noble friend Lord McIntosh writes his letter he should address the question of which type of common parts fall into which category. Two kinds of common parts are being talked about here. There are certainly common parts between the residential areas and common parts for the whole shell of the building. That certainly seems to be part of the debate that is going round at the moment.

<P>
<A NAME="10301-41_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   We are in a state of some confusion. My understanding is that the effect of Clause 93(6)(a) is to leave the RTM company with the responsibility <P>

<A NAME="10301w02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Revised projections of the prison population in England and Wales in December <P>


<a name="column_WA156"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2001 : Column WA156</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>2000 are set out in the table. The information requested can also be found in Prison Population Brief December 2000, summarised on the Internet at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/prisdec00.pdf
<P>

<A NAME = "10301w02_para0"></a>The table provides the annual projected prison population to 2007 based on three scenarios. These scenarios are:
<P>

<A NAME = "10301w02_para1"></a>Higher variant: Assumes custody rates increase by 0.6 per cent per year for males and 1 per cent a year for females and that average sentence lengths increase annually by 1.5 per cent for males and 2 per cent for females.
 
<P>

<A NAME = "10301w02_para2"></a>Central variant: Assumes custody rates increase as above but average sentence lengths remain at 1999 levels.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301w02_para3"></a>Lower variant: Assumes custody levels and average sentence lengths remain at 1999 levels.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301w02_para4"></a>The projections also take into account known legislative and policy changes as well as short-term fluctuations in the prison population. Projections are restricted to eight years ahead because beyond that projecting the prison population becomes too uncertain.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301w02_para5"></a>The Prison Service's funding baseline is sufficient to meet the higher population projection for the next three years. As part of the baseline, the 2000 Spending Review settlement included &#163;103 million/&#163;105 million/&#163;69 million over the next three years to provide additional capacity of 2,600 to meet this projected population. Funding beyond the next three financial years will be determined by future spending reviews.

The operation of this requirement is being considered in the context of the current review of the collective redundancy provisions. The number of notifications received by my department for the years 1998, 1999 and 2000 and the first two months of 2001 were 4,017, 4,189 and 4,418 and 709 respectively.

<P>
<A NAME="10301w03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health  (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  Section 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that an individual may invoke convention rights in any legal proceedings, including an application for judicial review, and also provides that individuals may bring cases on convention grounds alone. Aritcle 14 (Prohibition of Discrimination) of the European Convention on Human Rights provides for people to enjoy the protection of the convention rights without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status. This list is not exhaustive and could also include age, although it is not expressly mentioned. A case cannot be pursued on Article 14 grounds alone however; another convention right to which a claim of discrimination is attached must be involved. Discrimination for the purposes of Article 14 is a difference in treatment that has no reasonable and objective justification. In a health context, the articles most likely to be engaged are Article 2 (right to life), Article 3 (prohibition of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment) and Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life).

<A NAME = "10301w03_para0"></a>The provision of first-class care in the National Health Service on the basis of clinical need is a priority. Discrimination of any kind--whether it is on the basis of age, race or gender--is completely unacceptable in the NHS and action is and will be taken to challenge and correct any such practices.
<P>

<A NAME = "10301w03_para1"></a>The forthcoming National Service Framework (NSF) for Older People will for the first time set national standards and define service models for older people's health and social care. The NSF will also stipulate that age discrimination will not be tolerated in the NHS, ensuring that any arbitrary policies based on age alone are eliminated. The NSF will ensure fair access for older people to health and social care services and promote their dignity, security and independence.
