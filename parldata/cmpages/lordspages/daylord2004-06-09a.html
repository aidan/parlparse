<a name="40609-01_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Cox </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What is their response to reports of escalating violence in Plateau State, Nigeria.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="40609-01_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, we are concerned at the continuing levels of violence in Plateau State, although the number of incidents is falling. British High Commission officials have visited and are in close touch with the federal   and state authorities. We welcome the federal government&#039;s efforts to restore peace to the affected areas, but have urged that any intervention be carried out with full respect for human rights and the rule of law. We have offered humanitarian support to the Nigerian authorities.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="40609-01_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Cox: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that encouraging reply. Is she aware that, although Christians and Muslims have been involved in the fighting, when we were in the conflict areas there were disturbing reports that very well armed Islamist mercenaries from Chad, Niger and Cameroon had been involved in the fighting, and that Osama bin Laden had declared Nigeria ready for liberation and the Obasanjo government apostate? Will Her Majesty&#039;s Government therefore raise with the Nigerian Government concerns that the conflicts are being used and escalated to further the cause of Islamist terrorism?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="40609-01_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, in answering the noble Baroness, I acknowledge the tremendous amount of international work that she undertakes, and assure her   that we are well aware of the Osama bin Laden denunciation of Nigeria and other countries as apostate. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_256"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 256</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

We agree that the intervention of well armed mercenaries of both religious persuasions is of concern to us and the Nigerian Government. She will know that the Nigerian Government dealt robustly with a previous incident provoked by Islamic extremists in the northern state of Yobe, which was sparked off by a group calling itself Taliban. We have regular exchanges with the Nigerian Government and other interested parties on the issue, and will watch developments very closely.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="40609-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, have the Government received any request from the sole administrator of Plateau State for help in dealing with the people displaced by the ethnic violence in Yelwa? Does the Minister, although acknowledging that the matters are for President Obasanjo and his government to solve, think that there might be a role for the Commonwealth in defusing the tensions that have caused the rising levels of ethnic and sectarian violence not only in Plateau State, but recently in Kano?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="40609-01_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, the matter is for the Nigerian Government to resolve, and we support very much their efforts to resolve it. We have urged them to ensure that any intervention in that resolution is dealt with through the rule of law. For the moment, that is where we stand.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="40609-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </b>   My Lords, did the noble Baroness see the reports in the media that, on 11 May in Kano, 3,000 people may well have lost their lives? Has she had chance to study the letter from President Obasanjo in which he makes the welcome statement that he will pursue a policy of zero tolerance against those involved in the atrocities? In pursuing the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, I should say that President Obasanjo calls for international support to free,


</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>Will the Government think further about whether we can assist in any practical way in achieving that objective?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40609-01_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, I want to make it very clear to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, that we are assisting at present. Our aid budget to Nigeria is doubling this year. We have also said, because of the conflicts in the   regions, that we will stand ready in terms of humanitarian assistance; I think that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, was referring to other types of assistance. We are aware of the violence in Kano State. We are extremely concerned about the recent deaths there, and the British High Commissioner has visited Kano recently, where he stressed our concern to both the governor and the emir.
</p>

<a name="40609-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for giving me sight of his correspondence with President Obasanjo. We welcome the president&#039;s efforts to restore peace to the affected areas. We remain strong supporters of his <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40609-01_spnew7"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Manchester: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that there are more active Anglicans in Nigeria than in any other country of the Anglican communion? Is the Anglican Church among the interested parties with which the Government are in touch?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40609-01_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, yes indeed. I was not aware of the information about the number of Anglicans in Nigeria. There is a great and significant Christian community in that country and we are indeed in touch with the Churches. We very much back and give support to the Coventry Cathedral project on reconciliation in the Plateau State.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="40609-01_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </b>   My Lords, are representations being made by the EU and ourselves to the African Union to make it do something about the increasing bloodshed and terror&#151;particularly given that a number of the countries concerned, including Chad and others, are producing fighters who are adding to the mayhem rather than helping?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="40609-01_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, we are very aware of the problem regarding the Chad fighters and we have been active in the European Union in getting a statement from it recently. The EU said:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;The Presidency, on behalf of the European Union, expresses its serious concern and distress at the constant incidents of death and destruction that are taking place in Nigeria . . .  The European Union notes the rapid response of the Nigerian Government in despatching additional security forces to the areas concerned&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="40609-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is right that these matters should concern us deeply, not just because of the human rights, bloodshed and atrocity dimension, but because the stability of Nigeria is crucial to the world&#039;s energy and oil supply system, on which this country shall increasingly have to rely in coming years. Has she any information about whether these problems have spread to the Niger Delta area, where the main tensions are arising with the oil companies? Can she give us an updated report on that aspect?
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="40609-01_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, we have heard of incidents of problems in the Niger Delta area and we continue to have negotiations with the Nigerian Government, both at federal and state level, about all of those incidents. I very much agree with the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, that Nigeria is very important to the world community. We are working closely with the president and his government to address the necessary economic reforms that will benefit the whole of Nigeria.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What control is exercised by the sponsors of city academies over the design, construction and management of a new school.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="40609-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  My Lords, sponsors provide the vision for the academy design and are involved in the appointment of the design team. The academy trust, established by the sponsor, contracts with the construction companies. It is also responsible for running the academy in much the same way as a maintained school&#039;s governing body.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040609/text/40609-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40609-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Tombs: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for that brief but helpful reply. I am concerned that 90   per cent of the capital cost of the schools is state money and all of the running costs are met by the state, but they are outside the local education authority. Will the noble Baroness indicate the powers that her department has to ensure remedial action in the event of financial or academic shortfalls? Will she also be prepared to place a model contract, not a specific one, in the Library of the House?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40609-02_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, sponsors work closely with local education authorities and predecessor schools on any proposals to establish academies. The local education authority is represented on the governing body, so there are strong links. Also, the funding agreement is made between the Secretary of State and the academy itself. If there is a model of the contract I shall certainly look to placing that in the Library of the House.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="40609-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   My Lords, the issue of design, construction and management is one thing, but what will be the ethos of these city academies? What is it that city academies will bring to education that is not available at the present time, and would these resources not be better employed in seeing that state education is better than it is already?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="40609-02_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, that it is not a question of &quot;either/or&quot;; it is &quot;both/and&quot;. The basis upon which we develop academies is to look at areas where we have seriously under-performing or failing schools and to be innovative in bringing sponsorship into the design and build of a new school with the kind of flexibilities that enable those children to succeed more easily. Although it is early days, the results are very encouraging.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40609-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Blackwell: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister confirm that the Government are relatively satisfied with the performance of city academies? Can she confirm that, as the Government see it, a large part of that performance <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_259"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 259</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is due to their relative freedom to innovate not only in construction and design but in academic areas, free of state and LEA controls?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40609-02_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, academies follow aspects of the national curriculum and they have to provide a broad and balanced curriculum. Therefore, what they offer to children and young people is more flexible but it comes within the wealth of opportunity provided within the curriculum. As I said, these are early days, and those who have taken GCSEs, for example, have had little more than two terms in the academies. But from the three that are fully up and operational, we have seen significant increases not only in terms of academic attainment but also in areas of pupil behaviour and attendance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="40609-02_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Seccombe: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister tell   us how the results of the city academies and the so-called &quot;bog standard&quot; comprehensives compare?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40609-02_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, as I indicated, these are very early days. Pupils sat the 2003 GCSE examinations in three academies. In Bexley, the number of pupils who attained five A* to C results in their GCSEs increased from 7 to 20 per cent; for Greig, the increase went from 25 to 35 per cent, with a value added score that put them in the top 25 per cent of schools in the country; and Unity scored 16 per cent, which is broadly comparable with the results of the two other schools, and it also demonstrated increased attendance by pupils and better behaviour.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="40609-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that, in the London Borough of Hackney, the school which was previously known as Hackney Downs School is being redeveloped with the support of countless people? Help is being brought to many poor people, many of whom would have to go out of the borough to seek a worthwhile education.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="40609-02_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I visited Hackney and saw the work that Mike Tomlinson and the team are doing there. There are critical issues surrounding the lack of secondary school facilities within the borough. Therefore, I pay tribute to all that is happening. Hackney made significant gains in GCSE results this year.

</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40609-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </b>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord agree, or feel in his heart, that what he presented at first as a thoroughly well thought out and complex constitutional reform is now looking a little fly-blown and frayed at the edges? The fact that the Government still have no idea about where they are going to put their Supreme Court, the fact that there has been a lack of consultation and the fact that the Government were totally unaware of the consequences of abolishing the Lord Chancellorship all enhance the impression that there was no forward thinking. In the   circumstances, I wonder whether the spectacle of the noble and learned Lord&#151;the holder of the office which, a few months ago, he set out to abolish&#151;sitting contentedly on the Woolsack is not becoming something of a joke.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40609-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, I think that I should put aside my personal comfort on the Woolsack in dealing with these important and complex issues. The noble Lord is absolutely right: these are complex issues. As a result of referring the matter to a Select Committee, we have the opportunity to consider the issues in detail in this House and to consult widely. The Government can listen and consider how they can be improved. I do not accept the epithets that the noble Lord gave to our programme&#151;namely, &quot;fly-blown&quot; and &quot;unthought out&quot;. I agree that the matter is important and complex. We need to consult and to listen so that the scheme is as detailed and appropriate as possible.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="40609-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Ackner: </b>   My Lords, do the Government intend to implement the provisions which will translate the Law Lords into Supreme Court judges without first obtaining suitable alternative accommodation? If that is the intention, what rights and privileges hitherto enjoyed by the Law Lords, such as the use of your Lordships&#039; Library, the attendance at debates here and catering facilities, can still be enjoyed by the former Law Lords?
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40609-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, I hope that it will be possible to implement the proposals for the Supreme Court&#151;that is, to make them effective&#151;at the same time as a building is available. I cannot guarantee that that will be the position and therefore I can give no assurance in that respect, but I hope that that would be the position. Once a Supreme Court is established, the current Law Lords will be its first members. We would propose that they lose the right to sit and vote while they remain full-time Supreme Court justices. I believe that their rights in relation to the Library and catering facilities are a matter for this House to decide thereafter.

</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="40609-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, I do agree with that proposition. I think it is important that the final court of appeal in this country should be available in a building of its own&#151;visible and accessible to all.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="40609-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe: </b>   My Lords, when the Government are seeking to persuade 20,000 civil servants in London and the south-east to uproot themselves and move to other parts of the UK, does my noble and learned friend not agree that it is important that we have role models who are prepared to participate constructively in relocating their offices? Perhaps if he agrees with that sentiment, he would be prepared to convey it from this House to the judiciary, and we might seek the opportunity to see them setting an example to others.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40609-02_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, I agree with the principle that relocation all over the United Kingdom is appropriate for very many bodies. But I believe that the appropriate place for the final court of appeal of the United Kingdom is in the capital of the United Kingdom, and I think that that is the best argument for it staying in the capital. That does not mean that the final court of appeal would not be able to sit outside the capital of the United Kingdom as it&#151;the final court of appeal&#151;thought appropriate. But it is for that court, rather than for us, to decide when to sit outside the capital.

<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="40609-03_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, I shall ignore the epithet of mock gothic.

<a name="40609-03_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, the stated motive for the Government&#039;s proposals for the Supreme Court was that the public were confused by the role of the final appellate court being in your Lordships&#039; House. As I understand it, the noble and learned Lord is now suggesting that if a building is not ready by the time the Bill is enacted, the final court of appeal will be called &quot;the Supreme Court&quot;, but will still sit in your Lordships&#039; House. Will that not create even greater confusion than the alleged confusion that exists at the moment?

<a name="40609-03_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   No, my Lords, I do not think so. It is important to make it clear that the policy is that the final court of appeal should be a separate organisation from Parliament, so that people can see where the courts are and where Parliament is. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, when giving evidence to the Select Committee, said that after the Pinochet trial, people abroad wondered whether the politicians or the court had reached a decision in relation to the case. It is very important that there is clarity in our constitutional arrangements.

<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="40609-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, decisions on fuel duty take into consideration all relevant environmental, social and economic factors. The Chancellor welcomed OPEC&#039;s decision to raise production and the fact that some countries will move production up immediately. That is why, as both the Chancellor and the Prime Minister have said, we will not put the stability of the economy and public finances at risk by taking short-term decisions, but will review progress in August.

<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="40609-03_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, these issues are monitored carefully. The noble Lord will recognise that the Government have been concerned to reduce the duty and, therefore, to increase the differential on clean fuels. Of course, we have had areas of real success in these terms. The movement to low sulphur, and as we now confidently predict, to sulphur-free fuels, has been encouraged by the duty provisions in recent Budgets and progress has been made in that area. The noble Lord is right to draw attention to the fact that we cannot hit pollution targets unless we significantly address the issue of transport.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="40609-03_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister not understand that individuals and, importantly, businesses need certainty on fuel costs? Is it not about time that the Government got off the fence and said whether or not they will implement fuel duty increases in September?
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="40609-03_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am not sure which world the noble Baroness inhabits. If she thinks that we can be certain about fuel costs in view of the present position of OPEC and the problems in Saudi Arabia, she is giving to us prophetic capacities that none of us would claim. What is clear is that we need the situation to settle down. We need to be able to analyse what is likely to be the position of the oil price rise, which, after all, is a critical factor for the economy. An oil price rise will affect the whole economy. Fuel for transport affects only transport areas.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="40609-03_spnew19"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, my understanding of what my noble friend asked is whether the Government will get off the fence and say whether they will add to the existing price rise that is planned for September. That is what she wanted to know. She did not want to know whether the noble Lord believed that businesses were unable to read the tealeaves in relation to the future price.
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="40609-03_spnew20"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the Chancellor&#039;s decision is contingent upon the shift in world oil prices, which we all recognise have moved up substantially over   the past two weeks, thereby creating a great deal of concern in the transport industry, which is reflected in the questions addressed today. Nevertheless, it would be injudicious on the Chancellor&#039;s part if he responded to what may be a temporary situation with a decision that had long-term implications for the transport industry. It is right that we see what is happening to OPEC and oil prices over a period of several months.

We have indicated that in the light of the necessity of hitting our Kyoto targets and dealing with emissions we would want the European Community to consider changing the stance that it adopts at present. That is not a decision that can be taken unilaterally by the United Kingdom Government. It requires international agreement.
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="40609-04_spmin0"></a><b>The Duke of Montrose:</b>  My Lords, can the Minister tell the House whether the figures for carbon dioxide emissions from road fuel include the enormous lorries that come over from the Continent, tour around the country and leave again without buying a single litre of fuel in this country?
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="40609-04_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, they certainly include such lorries. It has already been indicated by Ministers that we intend to look very carefully at the issue of unfair competition when hauliers buy fuel in other countries at a lower price and compete with British hauliers on British roads.
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="40609-04_spnew3"></a><b> Earl Ferrers: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister give an assurance that the Government will not tax aviation fuel? If they did, even more disruption and cost increases would be caused.

<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="40609-04_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I indicated the complexity of the issue, and therefore I cannot give a categoric response to the noble Earl. However, he will recognise that in controlling climate change and dealing with the problems of pollution affecting all of us, aviation fuel makes its contribution to the problem. That is why we think that the aviation industry needs to be examined on the general principle that the polluter pays. I am merely indicating that this is not a decision which this Government can take unilaterally.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="40609-04_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Newby: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that the differential in duty between here and some of our near European competitor economies shows why, if we are to get a sensible approach to reducing air pollution, we need to have a broad level of agreement within the EU? Furthermore, for the UK to exert maximum influence to enable us to do this, do we not need to be at the centre of the EU rather than threatening to withdraw from it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="40609-04_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, that is a fairly general point derived from this question, but in broad terms it is of course right. If we create a single market and are unable to influence the decisions which can affect that single market against our interests, we are the losers by that. It is quite clear that we need to be at the centre of Europe, because our approach to fuel policy is a significant improvement on that of a number of our European neighbours.

He will also make a Statement on the outcome of the summit in another place on his return.

I also thank her and her colleague in the Commons, the Secretary of State for International Development, for their efforts in this crisis. But given that international action is required in this crisis, what proposals are the Government making not only to the G8, but also in the contact that Mr Benn will be having this afternoon with Kofi Annan, in taking international action forward? Furthermore, recognising how important it is that the north/south peace process is kept on track, what can this Government do to put pressure on the Government of Sudan to relieve the crisis in Darfur, rather than to make it worse?
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="40609-04_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady   Northover, is quite right. We need to make sure that the north/south peace process is kept on track. One of the things that we hope will happen in relation to that   is some form of UN Security Council resolution which will underpin the protocols that have come out of Naivasha. With respect to other proposals, we will continue our dialogue with the UN, with the European Union and with other partners. The most urgent need of the moment is to encourage other donors to contribute to the humanitarian response in Darfur. The noble Baroness will be aware that we are the second largest donor, after the United States. But taking out the United States, ourselves and the European Union, the response from the rest of the world community leaves much to be desired.

My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has just returned and is extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation there. Security remains the biggest concern because that is impeding humanitarian access. The Government of Sudan have made it absolutely clear that they will facilitate visas for those who are going in to assist NGOs, and they are going to speed up the process to enable much-needed humanitarian relief to come into the country. But we also need to get access to the parts of the country where there are internally displaced people, and to work with neighbouring countries like Chad where refugees have been displaced.

Since those days it has lurched from crisis to crisis, and there has been international appeal after international appeal.

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>The Liaison Committee was also mindful of the recent expansion in committee activity and the implications of this for both members and staff.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>Proposal for a Select Committee on the review of the BBC Charter




</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>1.   The committee has considered a proposal put forward by Baroness Howe of Idlicote that an <i>ad hoc</i> Select Committee be established on the review of the BBC Charter. Papers in support of the proposal are printed at Appendix 1. The Committee also heard Baroness Howe of Idlicote (who was accompanied by Lord Lipsey, Lord McNally and Lord Fowler) in support of her proposal.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>2.   The purpose of the committee would be to provide a means whereby the expertise existing in the House could be deployed in the discussions surrounding the review process. The committee would be able to have regard to the reports of other review bodies, and to hear the views of other interested parties. The supporters of the proposal would like the committee to be established in October, before publication of the expected Green Paper, with a view to reporting before publication of the White Paper.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>3.   The committee is sympathetic to this proposal. Many in the House have expertise in broadcasting and communications. Moreover the subject matter is currently important, the proposed committee&#039;s remit well defined, and a report would be likely to add value to the debate. So far as concerns timing, we understand that the Green Paper is likely to be published early in 2005. In our view it would not be sensible for a committee on this subject to be appointed before then. We are also reluctant to see further expansion of committee activity at this time and consider it preferable if this committee were not to be established until after the Select Committee on the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill [HL] had reported. So far as the proposed committee&#039;s remit is concerned, we also express the view that so far as possible it should seek to draw on the work of other review bodies.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>4.   We therefore recommend that an <i>ad hoc</i> Select Committee be established to consider the review of the BBC Charter early in 2005 after publication of the Green Paper and the conclusion of the work of the Assisted Dying committee; and that the committee should so far as possible draw on the work of other review bodies.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>Proposal for a Select Committee on international affairs</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>5.   The committee has considered a proposal put forward by the Earl of Sandwich and Lord Blaker that a sessional Select Committee be established on international affairs. A letter setting out the proposal is printed at Appendix 2. The Committee also heard the Earl of Sandwich and Lord Blaker in support of their proposal.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>6.   The purpose of such a committee would be to provide a forum in which all aspects of foreign affairs, including aid, could be discussed. In particular, these might include issues which lay outside the remit of the European Union. The House, they consider, contains many Members with expertise in foreign affairs and the field of scrutiny is sufficiently wide to be able to accommodate committees in both Houses without likelihood of overlap. The supporters of the proposal would like the committee to be established sometime after the next general election.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>7.   The committee has considered the question of whether or not to establish such a committee on two previous occasions, in 1999 and 2000. We then recommended that the committee should not be appointed on the grounds that its remit would overlap with the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee. We remain of <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_270"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 270</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>that view. The work of such a committee would also overlap into the work of the European Union Committee. For these reasons we do not recommend this proposal to the House.</p>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>8.   Both proposals for Select Committees came to us with lists of signatories in support&#151;150 in the case of Baroness Howe&#039;s proposal and 42 in the case of the Earl of Sandwich&#039;s proposal. While it is useful for the Liaison Committee to be aware of cross party support, we do not find that the increasingly common practice of appending long lists of supporters&#039; names helpful and hope very much that the practice will cease.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>Expansion of committee activity</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>9.   In the course of our discussions on the proposals for additional Select Committees, we have reflected on the expansion of committee activity in recent years. Thus in 1999&#150;2000 the House had Select Committees on the European Union (with six sub-committees), on Science and Technology (with two sub-committees) and one <i>ad hoc</i> committee. By the current session, the following additional committees had been set up: the Constitutional Affairs Committee, the Economic Affairs Committee and its sub-committee on the Finance Bill, and the additional sub-committee of the European Union Committee. In addition, at any one time one pre-legislative committee is now served by this House. Members of the House also sit on the Joint Committee on Human Rights. A Committee Office of 29 staff in 1999&#150;2000 now has 46 staff. We are also all too aware of the pressure that this expansion has placed on &quot;peer resource&quot;. While not wishing to exclude the possibility of establishing additional Select Committees where a compelling case can be made, we are unlikely in the foreseeable future to agree to an increase in overall committee activity.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>APPENDIX 1: MEMORANDUM FROM BARONESS HOWE OF IDLICOTE AND OTHERS ON THE CASE FOR A LORDS SELECT COMMITTEE ON BBC CHARTER REVIEW</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>It is acknowledged that the pre-legislative scrutiny committee chaired by Lord Puttnam on the Communications Bill carried out a thorough and constructive piece of work. That committee was immeasurably strengthened by the expertise and experience which   was added to it by peers with wide experience of the communications industries.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>The Puttnam Committee always envisaged that BBC Charter Review would be seen as a natural continuation of the re-shaping of communications undertaken by the establishment of Ofcom and the bringing into being of the Communications Act. It was also assumed that a mechanism would be found to continue to make use of the experience and expertise in the Upper House as Charter Review progressed. At the moment there are exercises being conducted on Charter Review by the DCMS Committee of the House of Commons, by Ofcom, and by Lord Burns on behalf of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. Various political parties have said they have formed their own study groups.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>In the circumstances it is, at the very least, a missed opportunity not to provide the mechanism which an <i>ad hoc</i> Select Committee could provide to make use of expertise existing in the Upper House on broadcasting matters to provide a suitable platform for these   and other interested parties to explain their positions and priorities. The Committee could work to a specific time-table to provide maximum assistance to Charter Review. For example, if established before the summer recess it could invite written submissions immediately, start taking oral evidence when the House returns in September and have a report ready by early spring of 2005.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>Without such a Lords committee parliamentary scrutiny of the Review process will be heavily weighted to activity in the House of Commons and, in particular, to the work of the DCMS Select Committee. Valuable though that work will be, it will be seen to provide unbalanced scrutiny of the process when compared with that undertaken for the Communications Act. It would seem extraordinary if the Lords were to remain silent on issues where the full range of its experience and objectivity are especially appropriate.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>Letter dated 18 March 2004 from Baroness Howe of Idlicote and others to the Chairman of Committees</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>Thank you for your letter of 27th January concerning the proposed select committee on communications. I have now had the opportunity to discuss your reply with a wide cross-section of peers, and this letter is written on their behalf, with their names and signatures shown below.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>A great deal has changed since the Liaison Committee decision, which we believe justifies an early meeting to decide upon a more focused proposal.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>It is our view that there is an immediate need for an <i>ad hoc</i> committee to be established to take evidence and report to the House on the issues surrounding the review of the BBC Charter, which as you know must be completed by 2006. Such a timetable makes it especially urgent for such a committee to start its work immediately if it is to make any meaningful input into the charter review. The House of Lords has many members with uniquely wide experience of broadcasting matters and the formation of a special committee of the House would enable this issue of such vital public concern to be investigated thoroughly, adding to the public debate for which the Government has called.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>I would be grateful if you could call a meeting of your committee to discuss the specific proposal as a matter of urgency. I should like at that meeting to take advantage of your kind invitation and attend with a small number of like-minded colleagues to state our case.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>I look forward to your earliest response.</p>
</ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>APPENDIX 2: LETTER FROM THE EARL OF SANDWICH AND LORD BLAKER TO THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>Four years ago we, along with about 20 other peers, proposed to the Liaison Committee that we should have an International Affairs Committee of this House. There is a wealth of experience of international affairs in the House which could be channelled more effectively through a new committee sometime in the future without trespassing on the various EU Committees&#151;say after the next election.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>New arguments which have come up are:</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&#151;   We need a forum other than the EU committees in which all aspects of foreign affairs&#151;including development aid&#151;can be debated</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&#151;   There are longer-term, less obvious topical issues not all of which are being taken up by the Commons or the Lords EU committees. Current examples might be: China, Nepal, security in Afghanistan, islands and smaller states, intervention in failed states/humanitarian catastrophes, conflict resolution in Africa, the UN Security Council and so on.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&#151;   There is the perspective of non EU-related developing countries which often receive less attention.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&#151;   An international affairs committee would undoubtedly enhance the reputation of the House.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>The Liaison Committee rejected it last time on the grounds that there would be overlap with the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, but we don&#039;t think this is really good enough. This House in any case is here to look again at government policies and decisions made in another place.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>However, as we see it, the new committee would complement and not in any way revise reports of Commons committees and would take care to avoid any overlap.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>The attached list of about 40 peers combines those who supported the idea last time with others who have joined since.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>We very much hope you will give this idea full consideration at your next meeting on May 10th and we would both be willing to attend to present the arguments and answer questions.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="40609-06_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </b>   My Lords, I am, of course, delighted that the Liaison Committee has agreed to support the proposal for a Select Committee on the review of the BBC charter and very much hope <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_272"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 272</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that your Lordships will endorse its recommendation. I thank the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees for what he said.

</p>

<a name="40609-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>I particularly want to thank my colleagues who were so important in helping to present to the Liaison Committee what turned out to be a rather more acceptable project than my original suggestion. That, as your Lordships may remember, had been for a more widely based ongoing communications sessional Select Committee, which would have been able to draw more permanently upon the considerable expertise and experience that exists in your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="40609-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>However, despite what I have heard from the Chairman of Committees&#151;and at the risk of sounding as though I am never satisfied&#151;I venture to mention the remaining concern that the committee apparently has to wait until the beginning of 2005 to start its work. The Green Paper is not due until then but, as we all know, the whole process of charter review is already well under way. At the very least, I should have thought that it would be helpful to everyone if the Select Committee was able sooner than that to invite evidence from those taking part in the existing numerous consultations and thus to alert a wider public to the committee&#039;s promised existence.
</p>

<a name="40609-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>I hope, therefore, not only that your Lordships will agree to the Liaison Committee&#039;s proposal, but that also a way can be found of ensuring that the existence of the Select Committee is well publicised at an early date and that a general invitation is extended to interested organisations to start preparing their evidence.
</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="40609-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   My Lords, although I have a specific interest in wanting to see this committee established, I shall make two general points about the report. I urge the committee not to become too structured in its response as it states very clearly that the BBC charter committee cannot start until the committee dealing with assisted dying has finished its work.
</p>

<a name="40609-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>We all know that committees can take a long time dying. We are working to a specific timetable in terms of the BBC charter. I was much more encouraged when the Chairman of Committees wrote to me and said that he would be happy to review the situation,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;to ensure that the committee on the BBC Charter has the resources to enable it to make a timely report&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>I should like clarification on that. It would be misleading the House if in February or March next year, with the committee on assisted dying still proceeding, we were told, &quot;Well, I am sorry; the House voted last June that you could not start work until this committee had wound up&quot;. That is what I mean about being over-prescriptive.

</p>

<a name="40609-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Another suggestion has been made and I made it in my letter. In government there are plenty of precedents for setting up committees. Ofcom is a very good example. When there is a job of work to do, one does the preparatory work of appointing the people, inviting the evidence and so on in advance of the starting gun. That could be easily done without the over-prescriptive suggestion in the Liaison Committee report. We could use the weeks and months before the committee started. I have no quarrel with the committee&#039;s starting point <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_273"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 273</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

being the Green Paper. But I think that the preparatory work could be done now so that the committee can hit the ground running. Otherwise, we may find ourselves in the situation where usual channels are looking for recruits and so on and precious weeks are lost.

</p>

<a name="40609-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>The general point I want to make is that this response is over-prescriptive and that the committee could have given a general go ahead. We could then use flexibility and common sense to start up the committee at the right time to do a real job of work. As it is, I think that we have, as it were, blundered into a very good solution. The work of this committee will be able to start after the House of Commons committee, which, under the wise leadership of Mr Gerald Kaufman, is already taking evidence. We will have that report and other evidence in our hands and be able to work.
</p>

<a name="40609-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>My other point is on paragraph 8. The committee is   most distinguished, but it is not the prefects&#039; committee and it should not behave as such. If noble Lords want to collect signatures and submit them to the committee, I believe that is a matter for noble Lords. It is no business of the committee to say that they do not want to have them. We know what will happen: people will be told that it is just a bee in the bonnet of a single noble Lord. If a noble Lord wants to put an idea and demonstrate that he or she has widespread support in this House, it is a matter for their judgment and not for the committee&#039;s.
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="40609-06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Fowler: </b>   My Lords, I very much support the proposal of the Liaison Committee and I support what the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord McNally, have said about the position and timing of the committee. It seems to me that the renewal of a BBC Charter is self-evidently a crucial issue. It is a totally appropriate subject for an ad hoc committee. It is exactly the kind of issue that this House should consider because it is exactly the kind of   issue where we could have some influence on the outcome.
</p>

<a name="40609-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>Therefore, if the Liaison Committee could do something about the timing of the committee and set it up earlier than currently envisaged, it would be very much to the benefit of the committee and the House. The sooner the committee is set up the better and the more chance and prospect there is of the committee&#151;and ultimately this House&#151;having influence.
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="40609-06_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </b>   My Lords, I rise in general support of the remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady   Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord McNally. I think that the issue of looking at the BBC is determined not by how long the committee dealing with the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill takes to look at it, but the imminence of the review of the BBC Charter. Therefore, to tie one to the other is illogical.
</p>

<a name="40609-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>I recognise the administrative burdens we are placing on staff. I do not know what the timescale is for the review of the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill, but if it is not finished by December this year,   certainly in my view&#151;and on this I disagree marginally with the noble Lord, Lord McNally&#151;we should not wait for the Green Paper. It is to be hoped <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_274"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 274</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that this committee could inform the Green Paper by starting no later than January 2005. So I would seek an amendment. By all means wait for the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill review to be finished, but if it is not finished by January 2005, then start the BBC Select Committee anyway.
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="40609-06_spnew4"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Manchester: </b>   My Lords, it was obvious during the debate that we had in the progress of the Communications Bill that there is an enormous amount of expertise on all sides of this House on this subject. It would be a great shame not to continue to use that expertise in the way that is being proposed. I entirely support the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, in what has been put forward. I have heard the points that have been made, and have rather warmed to the view that the sooner all this gets off the ground the better.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="40609-06_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Corbett of Castle Vale: </b>   My Lords, the Liaison Committee will be aware of the strong support on all sides of your Lordships&#039; House for this Select Committee, although it looked down its lordly nose at the numbers involved. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord McNally, that perhaps that does not lie in its mouth to say so, because it is important to make clear when these issues have wide and all-party support. However, I acknowledge that the Liaison Committee has rightly focused attention on certain matters; for example, there is no point doing work that other people have done before. When it is published, the Green Paper will be an amalgam of all the consultation processes. To that extent there is no point in treading over that territory again.
</p>

<a name="40609-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>I want to underline the points made by noble Lords earlier that, because of the time-scale, we have got to have the preparatory work done before the committee starts. I cannot see that there is any reason why that should not be done. There is a wealth of experience in   this House across the broadcasting sector, within which immense changes are taking place. If we are going to do this job&#151;and I am glad that the Liaison Committee has now agreed that we should&#151;we need to do it in the most professional manner possible. That means getting the preparatory work in so that we can make a very clean start early in the New Year.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="40609-06_spnew6"></a><b> Viscount Tenby: </b>   My Lords, I congratulate the Liaison Committee on its decision, and associate myself with the remarks made from all sides of the House on this. It is important that we do not have slippage here&#151;it is very important indeed, as I think noble Lords have emphasised. I should just like to make one comment on the remark made by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, on the question of collecting names. It may be that that is not done commonly in this House. However, how else is one able to demonstrate the wide appeal of these proposals? I cannot think of any other way of doing it. I commend all the remarks that have been made by other noble Lords this afternoon.

<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="40609-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Norton of Louth: </b>   My Lords, I have three brief questions for the noble Lord on the report. First, is the noble Lord aware there is a factual error in the report? Paragraph 9 states that the House has established a   &quot;Constitutional Affairs Committee&quot;. It has not; it has   created a Constitution Committee. The House of   Commons has created a Constitutional Affairs Committee and it is important that the two are not confused.
</p>

<a name="40609-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>Secondly, does the noble Lord agree that the report constitutes something of a lost opportunity? It appears far more concerned with means than with ends. The report concludes by saying that for a committee to be established,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;a compelling case can be made&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>What are the criteria that will determine whether a case is compelling?

</p>

<a name="40609-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>Thirdly, following the point made by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, I appreciate why Paragraph 8 is included: it deprecates the submission of long lists of Peers in support of establishing a new committee. Would it not be a good idea to make clear that, in future, adding one&#039;s name to such a list will demonstrate a willingness to serve on such a committee? Would that not help to solve some of the problems identified in the report?
</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="40609-07_spmin0"></a><b>The Chairman of Committees: </b>  My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have contributed to this debate. I must admit I had thought that most of the House would be grateful that   the Liaison Committee had agreed to set up a committee on the BBC Charter. Nevertheless, I know one cannot please a lot of people all the time. On the question of the timing of the committee, it is not just a matter of resources, although the work involved in establishing a committee&#151;issuing a call for evidence and acknowledging written evidence received&#151;should not be under-estimated. The Liaison Committee did consider this extremely carefully and we were keen to ensure that the inquiry was focused and did not duplicate existing work. Therefore, a call for evidence which was issued before the Green Paper was published might not address key areas or might ask for information that was not, in the event, particularly relevant.
</p>

<a name="40609-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McNally, acknowledged that I have been in correspondence with him. He asked what would happen if the committee on the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill went on longer than was predicted at the moment. I did say in my letter that, should it become apparent that that committee would not finish when it was expected to, then the Liaison Committee would indeed revisit the question of resources for the committee on the BBC Charter to enable it to make a timely report. I really do not think that I can go any further at this stage. I would have thought that that would satisfy the House. The noble Lord also referred to Paragraph 9 of the report on the question of new committees, as did the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth. The committee did look carefully at this proposal. If one looks at Paragraph 9, one sees the enormous expansion of committee activity that has taken place in only a few years. We had a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_276"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 276</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Committee Office staff of 29 in 2000, and four years later it has almost doubled to 46. That is just an indication of the increase in activity.

</p>

<a name="40609-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>I must apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, in that we have named one of the committees wrongly. Nevertheless, it is a very important committee and involves not only staff but also Peer resources. They are not always easy to find. I am sure everybody who wants a committee would say, &quot;Oh, we can easily find people to serve on these committees,&quot; but judging by my discussions with the usual channels I am not sure that it is necessarily always that easy. That was the considered conclusion of the Liaison Committee. The Liaison Committee is set-up by this House to deal with exactly that kind of thing and I hope the House will therefore approve its report.

</p>

<a name="40609-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>A criticism was made by the noble Lords, Lord   McNally, Lord Norton of Louth&#151;and, I believe somebody else as well&#151;of Paragraph 8 of the report which is a very restrained criticism of the practice of collecting signatures. Of course we cannot stop people collecting signatures&#151;people can go round collecting as many signatures as they like. Personally I tend to sign anything which is put in front of me in order to make people go away. I am sure a lot of noble Lords would do exactly the same.

</p>

<a name="40609-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>If people wish to put up a proposal for a Select Committee, what I hope we would achieve on those occasions is a carefully considered letter from the proposer of that committee, signed by perhaps one representative from all sides of the House&#151;perhaps four or five signatures on it in all. Then it would be up to the Liaison Committee to decide whether to agree to this committee. The proponents of the committee would, of course, be invited to come in and make their case before the Liaison Committee. That is, I think, the best way of doing it.
</p>

<a name="40609-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>I have never been in the House of Commons, unlike the noble Lords, Lord McNally and Lord Fowler, so I have never taken part in EDMs. However, if one looks at some of the EDMs that take place in the House of Commons, one does slightly question whether we want to go down that particular route. I hope, therefore, that the House will approve the report of this committee.

<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="40609-07_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey </b>   rose to call attention to international development and the departmental report 2004 of the Department for International Development; and to move for papers.
</p>




<p><a name="st_86"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I am grateful that we are holding this debate today on international development and on the 2004 report of the DfID. I am particularly grateful to all noble Lords who have put their names down to speak. I am delighted we can for a few moments focus on these crucial development issues. I welcome the departmental report 2004, and commend it to those seeking to understand the UK&#039;s <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_277"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 277</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

very sound development record over many years&#151;and not just the last seven. For almost eight years, I have battled away to get greater resources for development because I have always believed that developed nations are nations that work at peace with their neighbours and with all their contacts. Today I can congratulate the Secretary of State, Hilary Benn, and the right honourable Gordon Brown, the Chancellor, on the dramatic increase in resources&#151;a 93 per cent improvement from when I left office.
</p>

<a name="40609-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>However, with additional resources come additional responsibilities. It is on that aspect that I want to concentrate, rather than picking out parts of the report&#151;which reads well as a whole, but probably less well if I try to paraphrase it.
</p>

<a name="40609-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>By 2005&#150;06, we shall have a total UK aid budget of &#163;4.5 billion, of which &#163;833 million will be allocated as our contribution to the European Union Development Programme. That means that more emphasis will be needed to ensure that the EU development budget is better spent and properly accounted for, both in decision making in Brussels and through the offices of the European Union in developing countries. If we are to get the best value for money from every pound available for the developing world, we must look outwards at what our agents are doing with our taxpayers&#039; money.
</p>

<a name="40609-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Inevitably, there are gaps in such a major departmental report. Not everything can be written down. I shall concentrate on what is probably a lack   of emphasis&#151;rather than a lack of action&#151;on the co-ordination between donors in the field and on capacity building and institution building in the countries that we seek to assist. They are important aspects of the way in which we spend money to which we do not always give sufficient attention. In other words, we should place more emphasis on the contributions that are made, particularly those that private sector partners can make to development. All those themes are interconnected, and I believe that they are fundamental to successful and sustainable international development.
</p>

<a name="40609-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>I shall declare my personal interests. My work for Africa continues through the World Bank and through my company, Africa Matters Ltd, which seeks to bring business and governments together through investment in Africa. In the wider world, my directorships bring me into close contact with developments throughout all continents.
</p>

<a name="40609-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>My commitments in business have also allowed me to seek assistance for development through corporate social responsibility programmes and through skill exchanges to improve the delivery of the moneys that   are available to the developing world. I am glad that the DfID report focuses, rightly, on the eight millennium development goals, with their 18 targets. It is a small section of the whole, but it is well worth taking to heart. If we could make them work, we would be a long way down the track to bringing peace and stability to the developing world.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_278"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 278</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>I am not sure, however, whether the report addresses how we achieve the millennium development goals. It goes without saying that the developed world must help to reduce the appalling levels of poverty and deal with the lack and inadequacy of education and improve access to safe drinking water and healthcare, but they are also a central mission for every nation. They are not tasks for governments alone; they are responsibilities best delivered by partnership, as the report rightly points out. There is no doubt in my mind that achieving the millennium development goals depends on better donor co-ordination and the pooling of resources through all types of partnership. That is where there is much more work to be done. It is not just a question of spending; it is a question of sharing know-how across the board, if we are to meet the needs of countries in the developing world.
</p>

<a name="40609-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>The reality is that, in 2005&#151;the first milestone for the millennium development goals&#151;the vast majority of developing countries will not be on track to achieve those goals. Worse still, a few countries will, effectively, have gone into reverse. That is a situation that we are bound to address. I know that the international finance facility that the UK Government are bringing forward is there to help front-load&#151;to use the jargon&#151;the aid that is available to stimulate governments to work towards meeting the millennium development goals. However, for any real chance of success through the initiative and of further success in debt reduction, we must see faster   practical action and better donor co-ordination in-country. Such matters are probably a little small for the G8 nations to address at the present time, but those of us who work in the G8 nations must make sure that such measures are delivered.
</p>

<a name="40609-07_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>The Government&#039;s leadership in reducing EU agricultural subsidies and removing trade barriers must also step up a gear, as does training for developing countries in putting their case in the successor Doha round. I hope that the Minister will comment in particular on trade access, the removal of trade barriers and the reduction of subsidies.

<a name="40609-07_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>International development is best delivered by seizing opportunities for genuine partnerships. It is about capacity building at every level. However, without genuine national and local commitment to the programmes in the   developing world and without ownership of the implementation plans, our external assistance will not help as well as it can or should. I know that some in the House may express concern about the size of donor support these days. The amounts given are very important, but the way in which the money is spent and the programmes delivered is even more important. That is why I have always concentrated on trying to give value for money: it is as valuable for the recipient as it is for the donor country.

</p>

<a name="40609-07_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>Too often, the detailed &quot;how&quot; is not well enough understood by those implementing programmes, let alone being agreed with the government concerned. That holds back the maximum value for money. In some countries, we face too much donor competition. That is something that we should tackle together with the recipient countries. Although I welcome the increase in aid from developed to developing nations, I am concerned that the lack of co-ordination is leading to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_279"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 279</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

duplication. That does not mean best value for money. Value for money cannot be achieved without thorough capacity building. Budgetary support, which is the way in which we give much of our aid these days, is valid only when it has attached to it the capacity building that means that the money is used efficiently.
</p>

<a name="40609-07_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>A lack of sufficient skilled people in management in government institutions, especially in spending departments, is seriously hindering sustainable growth in many developing countries. One way to tackle that is mentoring. Many private sector companies are prepared to do such mentoring, if only we could get our mind round that sort of partnership. The overseas development fellowship scheme, which has run for over 40 years, gives young postgraduate economists the opportunity to work in the public sector in developing countries in the Commonwealth. The scheme was recently extended to Rwanda, where the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning benefited greatly from it. There are similar schemes in other countries. Local empowerment can also be helped directly by the private sector. In post-conflict Sierra Leone, de Beers has helped the Government Gold and Diamond Office of the Ministry of Mineral Resources and assisted the Government there generally to raise their ability to assess their exports accurately.

</p>

<a name="40609-07_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>Capacity building is also needed for entrepreneurship, to help to build to a thriving private sector, particularly small micro and medium enterprises, some of which are now getting support from the corporate sector. In Ghana, Unilever has set up the Foundation for Education and Development. That foundation provides business education for local entrepreneurs. To date, 75 small-scale entrepreneurs have benefited from the workshops run by the foundation. Sharing training, particularly training in   science and technology, can help to stimulate local industries to become suppliers to main investors. Active investment in a factory or an agricultural production process produces real multipliers. Often, for every person employed, a family of 10 is supported. That money then feeds back into the local economy.
</p>

<a name="40609-07_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Just as, in the developed world, private sector development leads to the emergence of a professional middle class, that, in turn, brings benefits to society in the developing world and can help to reduce the risks of autocracy. That is why I call on DfID to support real partnerships between recipient government countries and the corporate world, so that the private sector can play its part to strengthen those governments and to become a real engine of growth in the countries concerned.
</p>

<a name="40609-07_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>In South Africa one of my own NGOs, the British Executive Service Overseas, has been instrumental in helping to set up a social impact programme called SIPSA which particularly assists SME development. That is an example of how a well co-ordinated partnership of business and NGOs with government can raise funds from both the public and private sectors, and bring forward the technical skills that are so often missing and the management expertise that can make all the difference.

<a name="40609-07_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>It is often said of Africa that it is a continent led by   personalities. We know leadership is vital, but the structures for a fully functioning and stable democracy need to be put in place too, and people trained to work in them, so that those institutions endure and the country is not at the mercy of those in power at any given time. Only in this way will future generations benefit from socio-economic development. That is why I hope the Government will do more to build sound institutions to help win the many fights faced in the developing world, particularly the fight against corruption, which remains a major constraint to nation-building and business development&#151;there is simply no point in investing in a country where corruption is rife.
</p>

<a name="40609-07_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Good governance is an absolute must, and I hope DfID will continue to place emphasis on transparency and accountability, but also give more practical training to help governments to make their anti-corruption policies work effectively. In Kenya President Kibaki is going to   great lengths to reform their judicial system, and his anti-corruption commission is becoming successful in promoting better governance and removing officials who abuse power. In Ghana President Kufuor has worked significantly to reduce the extent of the corruption that he inherited over three years ago. All these efforts are only the beginning. There is so much more to be done.
</p>

<a name="40609-07_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>I place on record my thanks to all those businesses helping in the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Their role is vital and cannot be underestimated.
</p>

<a name="40609-07_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>The developing world has a great human and business potential too often overlooked by the developed world. I will not dwell on the size of markets or the great potential for investment&#151;it is all there for anybody to read. Suffice to say that good returns on investment in Africa, as well as in Asia and Latin America, mean that no business should refuse to investigate the growth potential. Investment climates are becoming more stable and secure, even if there are still a few well documented places to hold back on just now. Above all, greater access to the world&#039;s markets and to business partnerships will accelerate the positive trend. More governments are showing belief in the developing world, so that it may be enabled to play a greater part in world economic growth. I beg to move for Papers.

<a name="40609-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Desai: </b>   My Lords, it is a pleasure and a privilege to follow the noble Baroness, who has introduced the subject in a remarkably non-partisan fashion. I recall her days as Overseas Development Minister. At one stage when she teased me and asked whether I wanted to get rid of her, I remember making the disloyal remark that as far as I cared she could stay Overseas Development Minister for ever, no matter which party was in power.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Since those days one good thing has happened: the Development Minister now has Cabinet status. As she generously acknowledged, this Government have done remarkably well by way of enhancing the aid we <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_281"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 281</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

give to developing countries. My right honourable friend Gordon Brown has taken a lead in tackling the problem of financing the solutions for poverty and development around the world, the latest one of which   is international financing facilities. One must acknowledge that the UK Government, under both Mr Major and the present Prime Minister, have taken a big lead in tackling the debt problem, which has been a major problem for developing countries.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>I welcome the report, but I also want to mention things that are normally not in such reports, and to try to think of a way forward regarding this problem. There is a paradox here. We have been thinking about, and spending money on, the eradication of poverty for 50 years. While there has been much progress, some problems still seem to be persistent and hard to tackle. We have learnt a lot about development&#151;we no longer think of it in terms of capital stock and economic growth, but in terms of clean water, healthcare, literacy, gender empowerment and so on. This revolution in development thinking was welcome, and was part of the UNDP&#039;s human development report, which I had a small part in developing.

</p>

<a name="40609-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>However, we may have reached the end of that revolution. We have got a stage where development programmes funded by official government aid have   begun to require so many conditions that it has almost become an exercise in baroque architecture. We want schemes to have transparency, accountability, good governance, sustainability, gender awareness and participation of the poor, and all those conditions are always put before any project that is financed by official aid. This process ought to be re-examined, because we are losing sight of the principal aim, which is reduction of poverty. It would be nice to have these other what I might call &quot;peripherals&quot;, but if poverty can be reduced by some effective means, I feel strongly that we should not reject schemes just because they do not have one or the other boxes ticked off. Looking at what the UNDP did over the 1990s, it was very easy for people sitting in New   York to make new conditions. New theories of development had come together. More requirements were being put on field staff, who had a difficult problem to cope with. Is it not time to simplify the requirements for development programmes? I feel the same about the millennium development goals&#151;there are far too many.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>We know empirically from observation that some problems are clustered together. Infant mortality, lack of access to clean water or to healthcare and the low position of women are strongly correlated with poverty. If we can reduce poverty, these sorts of things tackle themselves. Whatever we do with millennium development goals, we must get strictly in view that reduction of poverty is our main goal. Everything else will follow from that. One cannot reduce poverty without providing some of the conditions, like clean water, education or good healthcare. I hope that will be our approach.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>I have said this to your Lordships before&#151;we have to learn from the success of Asia in tackling poverty. The way Asia, especially in the east and south-east, has reduced poverty over the past 30 years is a remarkable <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_282"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 282</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

story. More people have come out of poverty in that time than ever have before in the history of the world. The fact that there are still a lot of poor people is neither here nor there. People have come out of poverty because by and large governments&#151;some of which, I am sorry to say, were rather corrupt&#151;were responsive to the needs of their own poor. Through a rapid growth programme, which included the redistribution of assets such as land and a big emphasis on education, they were able to reduce poverty across China, Taiwan, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and so on.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>I quite agree with the noble Baroness that corruption is bad and that one does not like corrupt governments, but I prefer corrupt governments which are effective to corrupt governments which are not. If I may say so without upsetting him even more than I have in the past, I prefer Dr Mahathir Mohamad to Mr Mugabe because eventually, whatever he is, Dr   Mahathir Mohamad ultimately benefited the people that he was supposed to lead. Malaysia has come out of poverty and racial strife because of the determined effort of a government in pursuit of development. We should examine whether or not to categorise governments as those which provide good governance and those which are responsive because, basically, governments are there to cater to the needs of the poorest people in their midst.

</p>

<a name="40609-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>A great deal has been said about Africa, where there is to be an African commission, and the need for good governance there. But, again, as I said in the debate in your Lordships&#039; House on political parties, Africa misses   out on robust political parties which are involved in robust political dialogue. You do not get good governance without good politics; it is not possible. You need someone inside and outside government to put a check on them and say, &quot;What you are doing is not right&quot; or &quot;You are corrupt&quot; and so on. Unless there is that level of political involvement it will be hard to establish good governance. It cannot be established from above; it has to come from below.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>Finally, I wish that our newspapers were more informative and more informed about development problems. I should add, perhaps unfairly, that there was a headline in the <i>Observer</i> over the weekend about clashes in Sierra Leone. When I read further it became clear that the article was referring to the Ivory Coast, not Sierra Leone. The poor editor had not realised that Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast are not the same country, which is rather sad.

</p>

<a name="40609-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>Like her, I shall respond very positively to this important and impressive DfID report. It is good that we have such a government department. Indeed, in a report published today, the Washington-based Center <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_283"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 283</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

for Global Development recommends that the United States Government should establish a not dissimilar agency. That report underlines the same main themes as those which underpin the challenges outlined in the 2004 report of the Department for International Development.

</p>

<a name="40609-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>These are not subsidiary to our main foreign policy interests; they are not a kind of charitable addendum to the main business. They are key foreign policy challenges&#151;terrorism, transnational crime, global poverty, humanitarian crises of hunger, plague and disaster, whether human or natural. The CGD report states that these challenges originate in, spread to and   disproportionately affect developing countries, especially those which we would describe as failing states. These are countries in which governments fail to provide security, fail to provide political legitimacy and fail to meet the basic needs of their citizens. These include some countries where DfID is trying to make a difference for the better.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>I am very positive about much of the general and, indeed, detailed work of DfID outlined in this very full report. In a sense, it is a part of the conscience of our country that we involve ourselves in the wider world in this fashion.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>However, I wish to refer to a few problems that I see in our general approach. I am sure that others may well have observed the inconsistencies that there sometimes are in our policy as a whole, where we destroy the infrastructure of a country and then spend the limited resources that we have in trying to build it up again. Others may comment that that particular anomaly is characterised in Iraq and, perhaps notoriously, in Israel&#039;s operations in the territory of the Palestinian Authority.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>But this kind of paradoxical behaviour goes much wider. I remember a number of years ago expressing concerns about the support that our Government were giving to President Fujimori in Peru because they were terribly impressed by the way in which he was tackling the war against terrorism, as it would now be described. After a couple of visits to the country, I was very concerned that the whole approach he was taking was destroying the political party infrastructure of Peru and that, whatever the short-term effects on the terrorist camp, the long-term effects would be very serious.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>I am very glad to see on page 78 of the report that we are funding Transparencia, an organisation which, along with IDEA, is trying to build up the political parties. But that this is happening now, with relatively limited resources, is because of the degree of political support that was given to the destruction of these parties a number of years ago.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>I notice that, as far as I can understand it, the budget for Latin America outlined on page 171 will slip by two-thirds, from &#163;32 million in 2001&#150;02 to &#163;11 million in 2005&#150;06. One must assume from those figures that, in countries like Peru, which are included in the budget, we are cutting back at a time when we should be strengthening the infrastructures. We know very <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_284"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 284</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

well that the situation in that country is not improving at the moment; indeed, it is becoming increasingly unsteady and unstable.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>So it is not only a question of being consistent&#151;do not go in and wreck something and then have to build it up at great expense subsequently&#151;but, when you do get involved with something, of sticking with it over the long term. One of the problems with many peace processes and nation-building exercises is that the international community becomes involved for a short time and then, just when you are beginning to turn the corner, the international community rushes off to the next emergency. Then what has been put in place, but is still unstable and brittle, begins to fall to pieces. It is perhaps less glorious to stick with the work of building up, but in the long run it is much for the better.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>The anomaly of trying to build and at the same time, in another sense, taking to pieces manifests itself in other ways. There is a serious moral question about the fact that we are trying to build up healthcare staff in many developing countries. We are not achieving all of   our millennium goals in Asia and Africa&#151;for instance, we are not meeting the targets for the provision of specialist healthcare staff for the delivery of babies&#151;and yet some of our National Health Service trusts are going to developing countries and actively trying to persuade trained staff to leave there and to come here to work.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>I am absolutely for people having the freedom to travel and work wherever they choose in the world, but that is not the same thing as spending money on targeting countries that already do not have enough trained staff in order to fulfil the inadequacies of our own system. That is the kind of paradoxical behaviour which is certainly not characteristic of real joined-up government.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>When I refer to DfID being part of the conscience of governance and of our country, I mean not only conscience by way of giving charitable aid but conscience by way of bringing to the attention of other components of government the untoward and paradoxical effects of other policies, whether in healthcare, defence or the other aspects of foreign policy that I have mentioned.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>I am also delighted to see the attention that has been given to addressing conflict, particularly in chapter five, because conflict is one of the things that destroys development. But I am not sure how much we are learning from the experience of relatively successful work in conflict resolution. As I look at the situation as it develops in South Africa or my own part of the United Kingdom and then consider what our Government and others have done in addressing the Middle East it seems that we have not learnt and applied the important lessons. We have taken rules of thumb but not reflective thought when we come to those difficult circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>There is much more that we could do in thinking about it. For example, it has become clear in recent years that the doctrine of national sovereignty cannot be allowed to run unless there is a reasonable degree of benevolence and competence on the part of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_285"></a>

Governments of countries. Martin Woolf from the <i>Financial Times </i>describes some regimes as &quot;gangsters with flags&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>That does not mean that the attitude of developed countries should be to march in whether or not the United Nations is behind them and irrespective of whether the action confirms with international law. It may mean that we have to consider how to develop the international institutions and law to a new order that does not place a sacramental stamp on national sovereignty but on the other hand does not ride roughshod over the freedom of others to conduct their business with our assistance and co-operation.
</p>

<a name="40609-08_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>This is an important report and I am glad to see it being debated, but I hope that some of the inadequacies of our approach will also receive consideration.

I also express my gratitude for the immense contribution to international development she has made for so many years and is still making. I want to confine my comments to one theme: the level of international aid.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>As long ago as 1970 the United Nations established a target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for countries such as ours. We have been committed to reaching this target for more than 30 years and we have never made it. The closest we got was 25 years ago when our aid level reached 0.51 per cent of GNP. The Government plan to reach 0.4 per cent in 2005&#150;06. Welcome though that increase is, we are still nowhere near meeting the original commitment.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>But every once in a while there comes a moment when we signal a refusal to accept the status quo and we realise that a significant difference can be made. The Jubilee 2000 campaign to drop world debt was one such moment. The Churches were at the heartbeat of that movement. Its twin strengths were its size and its diversity. Old and young, rich and poor, rock stars and members of the Mothers&#039; Union&#151;I am a great fan of the Mothers&#039; Union&#151;joined forces in a coalition that ultimately could not be ignored.

</p>

<a name="40609-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>I wonder whether your Lordships remember that when he looked out at the crowds of peaceful debt campaigners who greeted world leaders in Birmingham in 1998, President Clinton remarked, &quot;I know a big tent when I see one&quot;. The big tent was responsible for the cancellation of much debt. Debt relief has allowed a number of African countries to introduce full and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_286"></a>

universal primary education. The job is not finished; only one-third of the debt has been dealt with, but it shows what can be achieved.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>Next year we have the possibility of another breakthrough moment. There is a coming together of a number of events that offer great opportunities. Next year our Government will chair G8 and hold the European Union presidency. Next year will be the twentieth anniversary of Live Aid; and the Prime Minister&#039;s Africa Commission should be in full flow. So next year has the possibility of being another pivotal moment to tackle global poverty; a real opportunity to be grasped, if only we will.

</p>

<a name="40609-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>Such a breakthrough delivered by the actions of Governments around the world will also do a great deal to make the world a more peaceful and less divided place.   We all know that tackling poverty is never straightforward. The noble Baroness, Lady Chalker, has given us some examples of the difficulties that have to be overcome. But I venture to suggest that one&#151;perhaps the   critical&#151;indicator of the success of the Africa Commission, the G8 and the UK&#039;s EU presidency will be the level of additional resources they deliver to the poorest countries in the world.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>I understand that in the next few days as part of the Government&#039;s spending review decisions are being taken about the aid budget for the next three years. Those decisions will be crucial, not just for the sake of the millions of people around our world, but also because it will be difficult for our Government to convince other countries to increase their efforts to tackle world poverty if we are not doing so ourselves.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>We can take some pride in the significant increases in aid provided by our Government since 1997, for which I am grateful. We can also take some pride that the UK&#039;s aid is among the most effective in the world. Yet we are still performing relatively poorly in comparison with others. Five countries have already met and exceeded the target of 0.7 per cent of GNP. Five more countries have set a date when they will reach the target; Britain is not one of them.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>We cannot be among world leaders in tackling world poverty until our aid levels reach their target. As a nation we are becoming richer and richer year by year. The richer we are, the more we have to give. The notion of giving a proportion of one&#039;s wealth to the less fortunate is a non-negotiable Christian principle.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>While I recognise with gratitude the substantial increases in aid that the Government have made, I also recognise that more than 100 million children still do not go to school in our world; more than 6,000 people die every day because of HIV/AIDS; and this year alone half a million mothers will die during childbirth in poor countries.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>So I want to make a plea to the Government to agree   a timetable to increase our development aid and   by 2008 finally to reach that target to which we committed ourselves way back in 1970.

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>I too would like to congratulate and thank the noble Baroness, Lady Chalker, for securing this important debate; but more importantly for her continued support and commitment. It will not be a surprise to the House that I shall concentrate mainly on that part of the millennium development goals and the DfID report pertaining to reproductive health and rights and the government strategy on achieving the targets.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>Of course I accept what the noble Lord, Lord Desai, and the right reverend Prelate had to say: eliminating poverty is the key to achieving all the millennium goals. I am a doctor, and therefore I worry about the suffering that exists.

</p>

<a name="40609-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>This year is the tenth anniversary of the international conference on population and development; a halfway stage to the goal set for universal access to reproductive healthcare by 2015. There have been some gains, mainly the renewed commitment to sexual health and rights and the focus on women&#039;s needs, but not much in the way of tangible results over the past decade. On the contrary, a dramatic reduction in funding for reproductive health from some of the richer countries and donors has threatened to reverse what little gain there has been in the areas of contraception, safe sex to combat HIV/AIDS, safer abortion and family size. The UK needs to work harder to persuade nations and donors to restore their funding for reproductive health. Can the noble Baroness say what plans DfID has to engage in dialogue with countries, particularly the United States, with regard to supporting reproductive health and rights more actively?

</p>

<a name="40609-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>Improvements in reproductive healthcare and reproductive health will save lives, reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, reduce population size, improve economies and help reduce poverty and hunger.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>The current figure of 40 million people with diseases such as HIV/AIDS is appalling. Three quarters of people in sub-Saharan Africa live with HIV/AIDS, with the younger ones most at risk. As has already been mentioned, 6,000 youths between the ages of 16   and 24 are infected every day. Some 13 million children under the age of 15 have lost both parents. Nearly 350   million new cases of sexually transmitted diseases occur every year&#151;the women and the poorest of the country are the most vulnerable.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>I turn now to reproductive health as it relates to pregnancy and childbirth, which is the main focus of my speech. Each year, as the right reverend Prelate said, 250 million women become pregnant, of whom 600,000 die every year. That is equivalent to four jumbo jets full of 350 people each crashing every day, and all the occupants dying. Nearly 10 million of those women experience life-threatening complications which leave them either dead or living with lifelong disability and ill health. Nearly 50 million pregnancies are terminated each year, many using unsafe practices, resulting in nearly 70,000 to 80,000 deaths of mostly young women. In parts of sub-Saharan Africa, a <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 288</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

woman has a lifetime risk of dying in childbirth of one in 16, compared with one in 2,800 in the developed world.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Despite much work over the last decade, there has been little success in reducing these numbers. The goal of halving maternal deaths by 2015 will not be met. The global maternal mortality ratio has changed little. What is required is a new strategy for action on the maternal health development goals. I would be interested to know if the noble Baroness can say what plans DfID has in this field.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>We have in the United Kingdom organisations with experience of working in this area in the developing world&#151;organisations that can work with DfID to develop models of care that will produce tangible benefits and achieve millennium development goals.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>Death in childbirth is the ultimate tragedy. Tragic, too, are the conditions that leave women with lifelong disability and ill health as a result of injuries sustained during childbirth. Very little, if anything, is done to help these women, who suffer from lifelong disability such as obstetric fistula. I shall describe what that is, because some of your Lordships may not be familiar with the term.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>Let me describe the fate of a beautiful 13 year-old girl living in the mountains of Ethiopia, given into marriage by her family, often to an older man. At the age of 14 she gets pregnant and, despite the hard life away from home, she looks forward to the birth of a healthy child. When the time comes, she labours; she is frightened and is supported by one or two women from the village. Her labour lasts a long time&#151;three to four days. By this time she is exhausted, dehydrated and frightened&#151;frightened for herself and for her baby. Finally, she delivers&#151;she delivers a dead baby. She is in utter despair, but too tired to think. She falls asleep.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>A few days later, weak and still exhausted, she realises that she is leaking urine all the time. She does not know why. There is no one to help. Because she smells of urine, she is discarded by the community and left to lie in a hut far away. If she is lucky, somebody will hear of where she can be taken where facilities are available to cure her or her horrible condition. But for 2 million women in Africa alone, no such facilities are available.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>There are very few facilities in Africa. They are mostly provided by people such as Catherine Hamlin, aged 78, who is still working in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, and Sister Anne Ward, who is still working in parts of Nigeria. There are very few facilities and very few trained doctors and nurses.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>UNFPA has recently carried out a needs assessment exercise in most African countries that tabulates the facilities that are available. If training can be provided, more of these women could be cared for.
</p>

<a name="40609-09_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>I hope that the millennium development goals can include help for these women. There are many from this country who are prepared to work and train doctors in Africa. There are hospitals which, if the capacity was increased and the doctors were trained, could cope with treating these women.

<a name="40609-10_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Flather: </b>   My Lords, I would like to say how delighted I was to see my noble friend Lady Chalker opening this debate. Many a time in the past we have enjoyed listening to her, and we have supported her in her work. Some people in the House may not remember her policy&#151;children by choice. That encapsulates so much. What else is there to say? People should not be forced to have children, but at the same time they should have the opportunity to have children. The noble Lord, Lord Patel, drew attention to the hundreds of thousands of girls with fistula, young girls especially, who wander the streets in Nigeria because nobody will let them come near. This abuse of human rights is just unbelievable.
</p>

<a name="40609-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>I was going to start by talking about a very large group of people who often seem to be forgotten, but now that the noble Lord, Lord Patel, has drawn attention to those women&#039;s issues, I intend to confine my remarks to the situation of women in developing countries. They have no recognisable access to any kind of human rights. Women in India and Africa do most of the work but there is no respect for them and no financial return.
</p>

<a name="40609-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>I do not know whether noble Lords saw a documentary about a woman in Africa suffering from AIDS. Her husband had died, she had five children of her own&#151;two girls and three boys&#151;and had taken on two nephews. It was the 12 year-old girl-child who did all the work while the five louts&#151;if I dare to use the word&#151;did nothing but play football outside. If we allow that kind of thing to go on, under the title of &quot;culture&quot;, we are totally failing in our duty to help the most oppressed people.
</p>

<a name="40609-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>I should declare an interest. I am the director of Marie Stopes International, but, more importantly, I am a woman whose origins lie in a developing country. I have seen what happens to women in India.
</p>

<a name="40609-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>Let us look at the peer group pressures on men and women. Men with a group of men will want to show off. They will drink; they will fight; they will gamble; and maybe they will womanise. What do women do? They try to save whatever little money they have for their homes and their children. In every Marie Stopes clinic and in every area I have visited, I have heard the women talk about their children&#039;s education. They say that they do not want their children to live lives like them and that they want them to have better lives. I have never heard the men say anything like that. It is important to see how the pressures work on the men and women.

</p>

<a name="40609-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>There are fine success stories where the women have been the target of aid. The Gramin Bank in Bangladesh was started not for women, but when the bank found <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_290"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 290</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that it was the women who repaid the loans&#151;the micro-credit&#151;it stopped giving loans to men. It has a success rate of 98 per cent returns and it has become so rich that it has now set up a mobile phone company. Hundreds of thousands of women have benefited from those micro-credit schemes. Micro-credit is a great way to help women in rural economies.
</p>

<a name="40609-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>I know of a charity that is working mainly on water, but it also helps women with some embroidery, some sewing et cetera. I have met those women. I have gone Rajasthan and spent an afternoon with them. I do not need an interpreter; I can talk to them directly. The amount of self-respect and empowerment that has come from the minute amount of money that they earn is just remarkable. They have compelled the local council to give them a place to bathe and a place to wash their clothes. One might think, &quot;Well, what the hell is that?&quot;, but they did not have it and they have it now. We should collect examples of good practice, put them together and see how they can be multiplied, because if we are going to see any change in the developing countries, I strongly believe that it will come through the women.

</p>

<a name="40609-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>We have never focused on them enough. In presentations about work, women are seen as an adjunct. Sometimes, they are not mentioned at all. When one asks &quot;What about the women?&quot;, those giving the presentation reply, &quot;Oh, yes. We&#039;re doing lots for women&quot;, but they do not talk about it. They do not see them as part of the mainstream and that is very disappointing.
</p>

<a name="40609-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>I have spoken to some of the delegates from the   UN   Economic Commission for Africa. The male representative from Uganda told me, &quot;We have to be very careful, you know. We mustn&#039;t upset the men. If we are going to do anything for the women, we must do it in such a way that the men think it&#039;s their idea&quot;. Those attitudes are not pleasant.
</p>

<a name="40609-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>We all know that women are suffering from HIV. A huge group of women in India is HIV positive, but they are not allowed to go to a clinic because it would bring shame on the family. They are monogamous women. They are not the ones who go out; it is their men who infect them. President Bush says, &quot;Ah, yes, but they should abstain&quot;. Who is supposed to abstain? Is it the men? Have the men ever abstained? If the women are to abstain, they would dearly like to. Have they the power to abstain? No,   they do not. Have they the power to make the men wear condoms? No, they do not. That culture moves quite a way up to the lower levels of the middle classes. Women do not have the power to control their men&#039;s sexuality. It is extremely important that they are given ways of looking after themselves in that respect.
</p>

<a name="40609-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>President Bush feels that he should not support UNFPA because it supposedly endorses China&#039;s one-child policy. No, UNFPA does not. It does not tell any country what policy it should have. I have seen its work in China. It is trying to introduce choice for the women over contraception. It is trying to help young people understand what is available and what is not, yet President Bush says that UNFPA is not an organisation to be supported.

<a name="40609-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </b>   My Lords, it is some time since the House has had the opportunity to debate international development issues. The noble Baroness, Lady Chalker of Wallasey, is therefore to be congratulated on providing this occasion, all the more so because of her distinguished record in office and the practical contribution that she made then, and still makes, to the development agenda.
</p>

<a name="40609-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>I shall focus on three issues in this wide field: the interface between international development and peace and security; the EU&#039;s development policy; and the plight of children in Brazil. It has long been a truism to point out that without peace and security, developing countries are not going to be able to claw their way up the development ladder, to attract foreign direct investment, to grow their economies, to provide their people with jobs, education and healthcare. The list of countries where peace and security have broken down and, with them, virtually any external economic input other than basic humanitarian assistance is a long and sad one.
</p>

<a name="40609-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>Perhaps slightly less well understood is the reverse proposition; namely, that where development has successfully got under way and where a country has been able to raise its GNP per capita significantly, the vulnerability to threats to its stability and security reduces. A considerable body of academic research indicates that, beyond a certain level of GNP per capita, the risk to a country of a breakdown in its peace and security sharply reduces.
</p>

<a name="40609-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>What that demonstrates, I would suggest, is that we are not, as governments and multilateral institutions were for far too long too prone to assume, dealing with two completely separate agenda items, one involving economic development, the other involving peace and security, each with its own specificities and remedies. Rather, we are dealing with a closely linked set of problems which interrelate and impact on each other, either for the good or for the bad. However, even if that is now intellectually better understood than it used to be, it cannot be said that many governments and many international organisations have taken effective steps to address the interlinked aspects of the   agenda in a coherent way. In that respect Her Majesty&#039;s Government are to be congratulated on setting up the conflict prevention pools for Africa and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_292"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 292</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the rest of the world, which, I understand, are jointly managed by DfID, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the MoD. The European Union is to be congratulated on earmarking 260 million euros to back up the African Union&#039;s efforts at conflict prevention.
</p>

<a name="40609-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>However, does the UN Security Council with its primary responsibility for peace and security concert its actions with the IMF and the World Bank, which have much bigger resources? Do even the different parts of the United Nations family&#151;the United Nations Development Programme, the World Health Organisation, UNICEF and others&#151;invariably pull in the same direction? Do the financial institutions and those who manage the world&#039;s debt problems fully appreciate that the exercise of rigorous conditionality on a country which is already slipping towards state failure may only accelerate its progress towards that destination? I do not think that a convincingly affirmative answer can be given to any of those questions.
</p>

<a name="40609-10_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>The UN High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, on which I have the honour to serve, is looking at all these matters and will, I hope, come up with some useful and sensible suggestions. If and when we do, towards the end of this year, I hope that we shall   be able to look to the Government for support in getting&#151;dare I call it this?&#151;a more joined-up approach to handling the crucial interface between peace and security and economic development.

</p>

<a name="40609-10_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>The European Union&#039;s development policies have few friends in this country and the leading opposition party now seems to want to do away with them altogether. I agree that the negative effect of the European Union&#039;s trade distorting export subsidies for agricultural products does grievous damage and that these subsidies need to be phased out as quickly as possible. It is good that the Commission, which negotiates on our behalf in this field, is now prepared to commit itself to doing that within a pre-established timetable. I hope that the G8 summit meeting, which is under way today, will firmly nail its colours to that target.
</p>

<a name="40609-10_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>I also agree that the administration of the European Union&#039;s aid budget leaves a good deal to be desired, even if Commissioner Patten has instituted genuinely valuable reforms which now need to be applied more widely. However, I would suggest that the remedy of repatriating our share of this expenditure, which is now being advocated, would be a clear case of the cure being worse than the disease. It seems to ignore the fact that more than half the members of the European Union have no bilateral aid budgets worthy of the name, and probably very little will to allocate funds to such bilateral budgets. So if we break up the European Union&#039;s aid effort, the quantum of aid going to developing countries from Europe is likely to drop sharply. Is that what we want? And is it what many developing countries with which we have close and beneficial ties would thank us for bringing about? I doubt it.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_293"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 293</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-10_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>The whole subject surely needs a good deal more thought. Would we not be better advised to focus on reforming the EU&#039;s aid policies rather than destroying them? I know there is great frustration at the fact that any increase in the European Union&#039;s aid budget, which we do not control absolutely, results in a reduction in our bilateral aid. However, that is not a policy which is made in Brussels; it is imposed by an organisation whose headquarters is a few hundred yards from here&#151;Her Majesty&#039;s Treasury. When I used to tell my friends in Brussels about the negative effect of any increase in the EU aid budget on our bilateral aid, they used to smile in wonderment. None of their governments followed that practice. I suspect that they thought it was another example of British masochism run wild.
</p>

<a name="40609-10_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>In raising the problems of Brazilian children I must declare an interest as I have a son who works with street children in Sano Paulo, Brazil. I fear there is some risk that our policy of concentrating on poverty eradication and shifting the balance of our aid programmes away from middle income countries&#151;a policy for which, in general, I have considerable understanding&#151;will have a negative impact on the excellent work that DfID has done in recent years to improve the plight of Brazilian children, about which my noble friend Lord Alton spoke so movingly when he reported back in March after a visit to Brazil.
</p>

<a name="40609-10_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>Brazil is certainly a middle income country, but it is also one that has some of the greatest inequalities in   the developing world. When the International Development Bill came before this House in 2001, the noble Baroness who is now the Leader of the House gave the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, and others such as myself who raised the issue of the priority to be given to programmes for children the most categoric assurances about DfID&#039;s intentions in that respect. Therefore, I hope that the Minister in replying to this debate will be able to respond positively to the concerns that I have expressed.

<a name="40609-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bowness: </b>   My Lords, like other noble Lords, I thank my noble friend Lady Chalker for introducing this debate. She has a very distinguished record in this field. The debate is particularly welcome as it enables me as chairman of the relevant subcommittee to run a   trailer for the European Union Select Committee report, <i>EU Development Aid in Transition</i>, that was published at the end of April. The committee looks forward to the Government&#039;s response and to debating that report on the Floor of the House, at which time I shall, of course, acknowledge the assistance that my committee received from many people in the preparation of that report.

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 294</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>European Union development aid, together with member state aid, provides more than 50 per cent of official development aid worldwide, and so it is extremely important that it is both efficient and effective. Whatever criticisms have been levelled in the past, the committee found that both the quality and the speed of delivery of European Union development aid had seen very considerable improvement in recent years. We particularly noted the very frank statements from officials whom we met in Brussels acknowledging the problems of the past.

</p>

<a name="40609-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>The reforms that were put in place have now produced a significant improvement in aid delivery, principally due to the establishment of EuropeAid in 2001, the introduction of country strategy papers focusing on governance and   human rights, the deconcentration of EU tasks to European Union overseas delegations coupled with an improvement in accounting and monitoring procedures. That is not to say that further reforms and efforts are not necessary to complete the process. Indeed, there needs to be greater coherence between European Union development policy and the European Union&#039;s other policies on trade and agriculture.

</p>

<a name="40609-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>It is fair to say that while EU development aid together with that of the member states represents more than 50 per cent of official development aid worldwide, the geographical scope of European Union aid remains controversial. The percentage focused on low income countries is only 42 per cent. The committee suggested that in the medium term the European Union should work towards developing an objective set of global criteria to help assess the need for aid rather than the present regional basis for allocations. This does not mean that countries within the African, Caribbean and Pacific grouping (ACP) would receive less aid than at present; some, indeed, might receive more. However, we believe that at present European Union aid is skewed in favour of the ACP grouping to the detriment of other low income areas such as Asia. In that respect there are advantages to the European Development Fund being brought into the principal European Union budget lines&#151;something which I note from the report we are discussing the Government do not favour and have rejected.

</p>

<a name="40609-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>We were disappointed that the draft constitution did not have a stronger focus on development aid. It is hoped that there will not be a reduction of development interests in the name of the European Union&#039;s common foreign and security policy. It is important that the next European Commission retains an independent development commissioner and puts both aid policy and aid programming functions into a single directorate-general, retaining for implementation purposes EuropeAid.


</p>

<a name="40609-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said&#151;I hope that the committee&#039;s report will encourage him&#151;the committee found the suggestion that European Union aid should be repatriated likely to be both counterproductive and politically unfeasible. European Union aid as opposed to bilateral aid, as the report makes clear, has a number of advantages. This afternoon is not the occasion to go through those in detail, but I shall cite a few. The European Union, acting on behalf of all member states, is in a good position to argue the case for good performance <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_295"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 295</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on governance and human rights. It should certainly be possible to secure greater coherence between aid and other   instruments in which the European Union has competence, particularly in trade and agriculture.
</p>

<a name="40609-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>Of course, there are advantages for the recipient countries in dealing with a co-ordinated group of donors. For the donors, there is value in having their aid co-ordinated in a single strategy. The picture of European Union aid is therefore considerably more favourable than is frequently painted. I hope that the Minister will be able to enlighten the House on the reasons for opposing budgetisation of the European Development Fund, but perhaps she cannot do so in advance of the response to the committee&#039;s report. I also hope that she will take note of the committee&#039;s support for the non-repatriation of EU development aid.

<a name="40609-11_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Sandwich:</b>  My Lords, I add my warm thanks to the noble Baroness for giving us another opportunity to debate international development. In an election week, it seems appropriate to start with a little polemic on the Government&#039;s record on aid spending, which had shown so much promise. Perhaps the noble Baroness was a little too kind in her opening remarks. She and others will remember the bullish aid manifesto of 1997. We are now in the eighth year of this Government and, as the right reverend Prelate says, the target of 0.7 per cent still seems as far off as ever.
</p>

<a name="40609-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>I do not doubt the commitment of the Chancellor and the new Secretary of State, but NGOs are beginning to campaign seriously on the issue. Without the international finance facility and a much greater initiative from the G8 than we are getting this week, they wonder how the millennium development goals will ever be reached. The Government have certainly moved forward with additional spending and political commitment to Africa, with greater aid harmonisation through the Development Assistance Committee. The new research into the role of middle-income countries is also welcome. However, DAC figures show that in   spite of all the trumpeting our ODA is still only 0.34   per cent, which is just behind the European average. It will creep up to 0.4 per cent by 2006, which is again below the forecast EU average of 0.43 per cent. That implies an ambitious annual growth rate of 8 per cent, and I hope that the Minister can explain how that can be achieved.

</p>

<a name="40609-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>Are the international development department&#039;s public service agreements too closely linked to the millennium development goals? Those goals are ambitious, as already mentioned. The education targets in Africa&#151;they are marked green in the annual report&#151;still seem attainable, but most of the other boxes are red or amber. My noble friend Lord Patel has given us a poignant illustration on health. When it comes to target 4 on trade barriers, one large red box indicates that the post-Cancun talks are still stalled. Perhaps the Minister will give us a more positive picture, remembering that the UK began to influence the European Union on the Singapore issues.

</p>

<a name="40609-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>There was some good news on trade last week, when the WTO ruled against the US cotton producers. That means that countries such as Mali should now be able to fetch a more reasonable price for their goods. However, some argue that west African cotton farmers should also be compensated. In 2002, Mali received 37 million dollars in aid, but lost 43 million dollars simply as a result of lower export earnings due to US subsidies, according to the International Cotton Advisory Committee. Without such compensation, cotton farmers in west Africa will never be on an equal footing.
</p>

<a name="40609-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>Much now depends on the new economic partnership agreements and how they can build on the valuable relationships with the ACP countries. They will have to   raise their sights towards strategic and regional partnerships, while the EU takes more care with vulnerable LDCs and revives the concept of &quot;special and differential treatment&quot;. Most people now accept that the international trading system is potentially the most valuable vehicle for poverty reduction. The question is whether the WTO, with the decision on cotton, is genuinely moving forward to equitable trade integration. Japan and the US, in particular, still need to respond positively.
</p>

<a name="40609-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>Much can be achieved through the real participation of civil society in both trade and aid. For instance, a   recent Christian Aid report shows how local communities in Ghana&#151;farmers, traders and consumers directly affected by trade and especially the dumping of agricultural exports&#151;can influence national decisions. Similar work has been done on debt relief elsewhere in Africa. However, I wonder whether governments are serious about the involvement of civil society in the poverty reduction strategy process. Sometimes one suspects that it is part of the mantra of good governance, which disguises official inability to achieve a proper process of consultation.
</p>

<a name="40609-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>A lot of respected NGOs, such as the Overseas Development Institute, the Bretton Woods Project and the International Institute for Environment and Development, are questioning the adequacy of the PRSP framework. For instance, a senior researcher at the ODI has commented:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;In most African countries there is a tendency for PRSPs to be seen as technical planning processes&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>The Bretton Woods Project stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;Participation is being invoked for legitimation rather than a fundamental shift in policy making&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>Will the Minister therefore confirm that the DfID is doing its best, alongside the IMF and the World Bank, to monitor the effectiveness of PRSPs, which are critical? The DfID has increased its support for UK civil society, which I of course welcome, as I do the success of the partnership programme agreements.

</p>

<a name="40609-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>The section on the EC in the annual report is quite candid about the European Union&#039;s failure to direct more assistance to the low-income countries, and to continue with the reform of its external assistance programmes in line with the European Development Fund. That may not surface in tomorrow&#039;s elections, but as we approach the UK presidency there will be more calls on Her Majesty&#039;s Government to speed up the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_297"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 297</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reform process, of which we must all be ashamed, although the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, says that there have been improvements. On the positive side, the EU and DfID have both given solid support to communities such as the Palestinians in their sincere if desperate efforts to improve their fragile administration and stay in the negotiating process.
</p>

<a name="40609-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>The debate takes place against the curious background of the Sea Island Summit, in which the interests of poor countries&#151;especially trade and debt relief&#151;are again overshadowed and subjected to a parade of western aspirations for the Middle East, as reflected in the latest UN resolution. I agreed with much said by the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice. It is evident that aid-giving itself has entered a dangerous new phase since 9/11, and I am sorry that the Government have been associated with experiments in democracy and world security at the expense of true development in the Middle East, and that that is reflected in their holistic anti-terrorist programme.
</p>

<a name="40609-11_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>Brutal attacks on the United Nations in Congo and aid workers in Afghanistan during the past week have again highlighted the perils of helping overseas. They send a chilling signal, not least to young people, that it is no longer enough to go abroad and do good if you are likely to attract attention from terrorists or bandits with murderous intent.
</p>

<a name="40609-11_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>There was disturbing news in Afghanistan when five M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res aid workers were killed. MSF has been working in Afghanistan for nearly 35   years and it is tragic that it has had to suspend all its operations there. Christian Aid and others have also had to suspend their projects.
</p>

<a name="40609-11_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>The Select Committee on Foreign Affairs is due to report soon on the policies required to protect humanitarian work in areas still affected by the Taliban. The EU&#039;s Commissioner for Development, Poul Neilson, has already complained about the role of the US-led coalition and the blurring of military and humanitarian aid. Several of us have constantly mentioned this. We do not want soldiers doing aid work, we want them to protect aid workers. The Government have put up an astonishing smoke screen, claiming that security is under control when US-led forces are doing their own thing and NATO still has no unified command.

</p>

<a name="40609-11_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>DfID and others have made an enormous investment in several regions of Afghanistan, including valuable support for local Afghan NGOs; and it is up to DfID to demand more protection from the MoD and our US allies. I hope that the Minister can assure us that she will go back and propose to her colleagues a new initiative that will take proper account of security for aid programmes in Afghanistan and elsewhere.

<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="40609-12_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   My Lords, your Lordships&#039; House is fortunate indeed that it has been possible for my noble friend Lady Chalker of Wallasey, with her wide experience and even wider reputation, to secure and to open this debate so pertinently. I am myself <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_298"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 298</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

fortunate, especially as a tyro in these matters, to follow the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, whose authority on the same matters is very considerable. At the general level, I concur with my noble friend that help should always be defined by the receiver rather than by the giver. Perhaps I should preface my remarks by saying that I have been a personal friend of Mr James Wolfenson, the President of the World Bank, for nearly 50 years since we were at the Harvard Business School together, and I admire him considerably.
</p>

<a name="40609-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>The thoroughly worthwhile DfID report runs to more than 200 pages and in the perhaps unnecessarily constrained minutes the Leader of your Lordships&#039; House has vouchsafed each of us in this debate, notably in comparison with the other debate, I propose to make one provocative reference to a recent exchange at starred questions; to make one observation about substance as it affects style; to give a synopsis of one germane case history; and, arising out of the latter, to ask one question of the Minister, of which I have at her constructive invitation, given her notice. Incidentally, I join the noble Lord, Lord   Alderdice, in expressing surprise that Clare   Short should have gone along with the recruitment of NHS staff from emerging and developing countries; and I was much moved by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Patel, about the implications of that at the opposite end of the transaction.
</p>

<a name="40609-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>First, regarding the recent exchange at Starred Questions&#151;the Question related to the way in which economies are measured statistically in the context of climate change; in short, the argument about using current exchange rates or purchasing power parities. Some in your Lordships&#039; House will have thought the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, who I am delighted to see in her place, &quot;courageous&quot; in Sir Humphrey Appleby&#039;s phrase, in telling my noble friend Lord Lawson of Blaby that he was just wrong in his advocacy of PPP, but she was patently speaking for Her Majesty&#039;s Government.
</p>

<a name="40609-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>In terms of collective responsibility, I do not expect the Minister replying today to demonstrate a scintilla of dissent from the noble Baroness&#039;s position, but since the noble Baroness&#039;s asseveration, the <i>Economist</i> returned to the subject twice in its 29 May edition during the Recess, which concluded that measurement by current exchange rates underestimated the growth rates in emerging economies. I could not help noticing the DfID report&#039;s comments on some growth rates in Africa against the overall continental need. As the IMF uses PPPs and the world uses the IMF in its debt reduction considerations, I should be delighted if the Minister told me that DfID were to use PPP, but after the recent defence of Government practice by the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, I shall not hold my breath.

</p>

<a name="40609-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Secondly, regarding substance&#039;s effect on style&#151;I have a close relative who has been holding positions of considerable responsibility for her age in an NGO in several central African countries. She is generally full of praise for the way that DfID handles NGOs and, particularly, for the quality of questions that they ask. She praises, too, their good methodological procedures. She felt, however, that they might sometimes&#151;profitably for both sides&#151;be more proactive in handling <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_299"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 299</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

NGOs, while acknowledging that that might be a function of the amount of previous operational experience a DfID official in the field had. She thought in general that NGOs&#039; productivity might be greater if their relations with DfID were more institutionalised.
</p>

<a name="40609-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>I put to my close relative the analogous case within the UK of the concerns of voluntary sector organisations such as the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, St John&#039;s Ambulance and the WRVS at being omitted from statutory reference in the Civil Contingencies Bill. She assented immediately, citing Oxfam&#039;s recent experience of being involved in domestic poverty alleviation programmes here in the UK, where it has apparently been found that, ironically, the standard policies and procedures are inferior to some of Oxfam&#039;s practical experience in developing countries. I have no emotional capital tied up in that observation, but I pass it on in constructive mode.

</p>

<a name="40609-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>Thirdly, the germane case history. Perhaps suitably for a case history, my interest is historical rather than either financial or current. For two decades I chaired a trust, although I am no longer involved, which set out originally to do archaeological research at 7,000 feet in the Peruvian Andes. After about five years it elided into rural development. In the first decade 80 per cent of the work was archaeological and 20 per cent was rural development. In the second decade the proportions were more than reversed, with 90 per cent being rural development and 10 per cent archaeological. In so far as there was a watershed&#151;that word is not inapposite&#151;that changed the flow. A   BBC &quot;Horizon&quot; film showed how, after five or six   years of archaeological activity, a valley that sustained 1,800 people in the days of the Incas was sustaining less than a quarter of that number by the 1970s. The key to those comparative numbers had been the Inca irrigation canals which, as the film showed, our project had opened up again.

</p>

<a name="40609-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>Our project at Cusichaca is now the first site those travelling on the Inca trail see after they leave Cuzco; and it has both patiently and patently uncovered or rediscovered the entire Inca infrastructure. In the second decade, the trust moved into the next great valley; and its constituency in the third decade are two basins with four districts in each and 18,000 people within them overall. The mission is rural development by example, covering reforestation, horticulture, lots of training, demonstration centres and organic agriculture.
</p>

<a name="40609-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>The trust helped create a museum and cultural centre to cover the whole constituency, both for purposes of education and tourism. There is one ongoing canal project, again, to show what can be done. As the standard manuals would approve, there is the recent creation of a local NGO with a staff of 20   Peruvians, led by a British zoologist, who was with the trust for seven years and is now married to a Peruvian girl. Similarly, a Dutch soil scientist, trained at Reading University, who was involved in the trust&#039;s second decade/second valley study, is now a consultant to the EU, but comes back to the trust&#039;s area of operations, both to visit and to train. The trust&#039;s founder, the redoubtable Dr Ann Kendall, whose <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_300"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 300</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

doctorate is in archaeology, continues to spend four months each year in Peru, in two stretches of two months each.

</p>

<a name="40609-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>The current funding comes from the EU and our own Community Fund. DfID funding, to which the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, alluded, has fallen arising from the switch of funding from middle income countries to poorer countries in general and to Iraq in particular, although anyone who knows Peru, whither I first went 40   years ago, will know that even if the population on the coast is middle income, the Andes themselves remain poor beyond description. It is the same case that the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, cited in Sao Paulo, whence both my late first wife and Dr Ann Kendall came. Moreover, although the Community Fund funding is British, the fund has been criticised for going abroad and it is further enveloped in the uncertainties that surround the reorganisation of the New Opportunities Fund. So, British funding to an organisation which has been run largely on a shoestring, but has earned a substantial reputation for this country, may not remain constant.

</p>

<a name="40609-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>The trust is now carrying out environmental research, mapping whole areas for their natural resources and coexistence, so as to give the local communities a handle on their opportunities. This community involvement was what made the Inca civilisation so impressive, even if it was not proof against Spanish gunfire. My question, to which I alluded at the beginning, is whether the Darwin Initiative, which is funding research into biodiversity globally and supporting environmental and biodiversity research, will also be diverted away from Peru on middle income and Iraqi grounds. If it is, it will be a classic case of policy confusion, but a clear answer from the Minister would be welcome.

<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="40609-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Chan: </b>   My Lords, I add my thanks to the noble Baroness, Lady Chalker, for securing this debate on international development&#151;an area of concern in which she has a distinguished reputation. It was during her time as Minister for Overseas Development that I had the opportunity, together with colleagues from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, to work in Orissa and the five northern states of India over a period of 10 years. Therefore, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for that.
</p>

<a name="40609-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>I welcome the DfID report of 2004 with its analysis of policies to help the poorest countries to achieve the millennium development goals. Aid for developing countries continues to be as necessary today as it has been over the past four decades. Of course, mistakes were made in the past when donors expected the recipient countries to repay debts with interest. Thankfully, Her Majesty&#039;s Government have been at the forefront in cancelling the debts of poorer countries.

</p>

<a name="40609-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>Much has been said about the millennium development goals, which include the eradication of extreme poverty and   hunger and the achievement of      universal primary education. Those require infrastructure, good governance, a lack of corruption and other issues that seem to be rather difficult to achieve.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_301"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 301</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>Other MDGs&#151;particularly those relating to health&#151;are more likely to be achieved in local communities. They are dependent on the promotion of gender equality and the   empowerment of women, and they include reduced child   mortality, improved maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other infections, and ensuring environmental stability and partnerships for development.

</p>

<a name="40609-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>I shall focus on the &quot;how to&quot; in three areas: first, the empowerment of women; secondly, the need for a reliable supply of medicines and equipment; and, thirdly, partnership learning and working among developing countries, particularly among health workers.
</p>

<a name="40609-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>The empowerment of women is essential in achieving those MDGs. Such empowerment is surprisingly not difficult to achieve in local communities. In most traditional societies, women decide on what families eat, which includes the growing of food, and how children are nurtured. Therefore, the use of micro-credit has been very helpful and productive. The missing ingredient to enable women in developing countries to influence the health of their families is the opportunity to receive information and support on how to improve health and well-being.
</p>

<a name="40609-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>Examples abound in poor communities of the positive contribution that women make when they are supported by community development teams. I have seen groups of illiterate women in urban slums and villages in India who sing songs about the care of babies, about weaning foods and also about how to make oral rehydration fluids using salt and sugar for treating their babies with diarrhoea. As a result, babies and young children in those communities gain weight and remain healthy, and their mothers use health services appropriately.
</p>

<a name="40609-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>Success in those settings depends upon partnerships between trained and motivated health workers and local women, who are given the opportunity to take control to improve their lives and the well-being of their families. Basic information on local food which is nutritious for infants and children, the availability of vaccinations against serious childhood infections, such as tuberculosis, and the protection of children against endemic malaria are important.
</p>

<a name="40609-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>Co-operation and partnerships between, for example, the UK non-governmental organisations and local communities through capacity-building are very important and productive. The NGO of which I am chairman&#151;the Malaria Consortium&#151;has been engaged in capacity-building with people in Uganda and Ghana, where we have offices with more employees than we have in London.
</p>

<a name="40609-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>Where women are literate, as in the southern Indian state of Kerala, substantial improvements are made in maternal health, child survival and, with appropriate services, the control of diarrhoea and respiratory infections in children. All those improvements have been achieved in spite of Kerala being one of the economically poorer states of India. Similar results have been achieved in Sri Lanka&#151;again, one of the poorer countries in south Asia.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_302"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 302</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-12_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>Urban slum improvement projects in other parts of India have also led to local success with improvements in the health of children and mothers. I had the privilege of taking a group of Indian health service leaders and workers from urban slums to Thailand to meet their Thai counterparts to discuss how to run public health schemes and manage HIV/AIDS. My Indian colleagues were encouraged to see progress being achieved in other Asian settings which they could adapt for their communities. And that visit was made 10 years ago.
</p>

<a name="40609-12_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>When replying, perhaps the Minister will inform your Lordships of efforts that are being made by DfID to encourage governments of developing countries to learn from the examples of best practice in other communities in their own or neighbouring countries through visits and working partnerships.

</p>

<a name="40609-12_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>A regular supply of effective medicines in local communities is essential for the treatment and maintenance of health. What proportion of DfID&#039;s budget is allocated to this essential service? Training of health and community workers is another essential if countries are to achieve the MDGs. Partnerships with other developing countries that have achieved success in local communities is important. As many achievements in local communities are led by non-governmental organisations, to which other noble Lords have alluded, to what extent does DfID support their work in developing countries?

</p>

<a name="40609-12_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>Finally, DfID could also influence better donor co-operation so that health services in communities in poor countries could be more joined up. For example, condoms provided for HIV prevention should also be distributed by reproductive health workers. Concern for death rates in children under the age of five should be better focused on infants&#151;that is, children in the first year of life. That should encompass the healthcare of women, including contraception, so as to ensure a birth interval between one pregnancy and another of about 18   months. We can do more to improve the healthcare of mothers and babies in order to fulfil the MDGs.

<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="40609-13_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Northover: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Chalker, for introducing this very important debate. As others have pointed out, she does indeed have a formidable record in this field. The debate is extremely timely, given the backdrop of the G8 meeting in Georgia this week. It is good to hear that at last the UK seems to be prevailing on our US allies in terms of negotiating debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries. I hope that the noble Baroness can fill us in on the progress of those talks.

</p>

<a name="40609-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>But we are discussing this issue against a wider backdrop. Countries in the developed world have been at odds with each other over the Middle East and, in particular, over Iraq. Achieving the millennium development goals seems as remote as ever, with the possibility&#151;in fact, as we have heard, the probability&#151;of many of the poorest countries going backwards by 2015, largely because of the AIDS pandemic.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_303"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 303</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>Of course, with a more local backdrop, we have the European and local elections tomorrow. In these elections international issues have been on the agenda far more than is often the case. Europe and Iraq have been key issues, but little attention has been given to the plight of those suffering from AIDS in Africa, or even to those being starved, raped and murdered in Sudan.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>There is a strong interest in international development in the UK, but so often it is eclipsed by concerns closer to home. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle has pointed out, it was in 1970, almost 35 years ago, that the UN set the target for countries to reach official development assistance of 0.7 per cent of GNP. By 1975, the UK had reached about 0.5 per cent, but by 1997, that had slipped to below 0.3 per cent. As other noble Lords have said, the Government are to be credited with bringing up that level currently to 0.34 per cent, but it is still a long way short of the 0.7 per cent target.

</p>

<a name="40609-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>In the next four weeks the Government will determine their overall spending plans for the next three years. Can the Minister tell me whether she believes that the Government will have a timetable for reaching 0.7 per cent in the spending review? Other countries have reached that point, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden and others have a timetable for doing so, including France, Spain and Ireland. One of the planks of the Irish presidency of the EU was to agree the timetable. Until the UK has pledged 0.7 per cent on aid, some countries have said that they are reluctant to support the International Finance Facility, which has yet to get off the ground.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>So much for the size of DfID&#039;s budget, but what about how it is spent? In the very full report, DfID emphasises that it is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;committed to spending 90 per cent of our budget in the world&#039;s poorest countries by 2005&#150;06&quot;.</p>

<a name="40609-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>Surely it has been little short of disastrous that so much effort and money over the past year or so has been spent on Iraq. We read that the UK aid budget is set to increase to &#163;4.5 billion by 2005&#150;06, which is welcome. But how can it be justified that &#163;544 million has been pledged by the UK Government to Iraq up to March 2006? Whatever the rights and wrongs of overthrowing the regime, doing so without true international support, and thereby bringing on ourselves the responsibility, with the Americans and few others, for reconstructing Iraq has surely completely distorted DfID&#039;s budget and its direction.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>Why is it that the reconstruction forced on us by the UK&#039;s actions comes out of the DfID budget which is   supposed to help the poorest in the world? Can the Minister tell me which countries are, therefore, suffering cutbacks as a result of this policy, this distortion in the budget?
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>My noble friend Lord Alderdice and the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, have pointed to the serious reduction in aid to Latin America. I note DfID&#039;s almost complete withdrawal from the Pacific. Obviously, the UK cannot be involved everywhere, but when areas that were supported by the UK are suddenly dropped, while <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_304"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 304</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

expenditure on Iraq hugely increases, surely the Government should be held to account. No expenditure at all is to be allowed in the Pacific after 1 April 2004. That is an area which includes one failed state&#151;the Solomon Islands&#151;which until recently was a UK responsibility. Fiji is also politically unstable. It is not likely that the EU will take up responsibility here, given that it has no long-term interest in the area. Can the Minister tell me what future she sees for the poorest areas in the Pacific? Have any agreements been made with others to ensure that the poorest in those areas do not lose out?

</p>

<a name="40609-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>Can she also tell me how the department weighs up the relative merits of expenditure on Iraq and Afghanistan, a country with great poverty, but which, as is also claimed of Iraq, has significance for instability far wider than the country itself? As the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, has pointed out, if a country reaches a certain point in development, it is more likely to be stable. These things are indeed interlinked. What intercessions has DfID made to other government departments and to international organisations about the need for security in Afghanistan so that reconstruction can take place, so that the poppy harvests can decline, in the way that the Chancellor has promised, and so that stable government can thrive?
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>When Lakhdar Brahimi left Afghanistan he impressed on the world how important it was that security was provided there. He noted with some irony how readily troops were provided for Iraq while Afghanistan was neglected. As my noble friend Lord Alderdice has said, we have to see policies through if stability is to be achieved.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>The MDGs place particular stress on the need to improve the position of women and girls. I support what the noble Lords, Lord Patel and Lord Chan, and the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, have said on that. I note with some interest that the vast majority of the photos in DfID&#039;s annual report are of women and girls. It was quite difficult to find boys featured among them. I trust that in many ways that reflects the nature of what DfID is doing.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>At this point I turn to the gravest crisis facing the poorest nations and that is the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which of course afflicts women and girls even more desperately than men and boys. As the All-Party Group on Africa stated in its report published on Monday,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;the AIDS epidemic is an exceptional threat to African societies and states as well as to millions of African people. It requires an exceptional response&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>It has the potential,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;to tear apart social fabric, destroy developmental gains and plunge some regions into decades of stagnation and insecurity&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40609-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>The urgency of this crisis, I must say, does not shine out of the DfID annual report. There is a page of text on AIDS compared, for example, with three and a half pages of text on Iraq. Yet the threat to world order, political stability, economic growth and the future, not only of Africa but surely far wider, as the disease spreads and as its after-effects are felt, is far more significant. Can the Minister tell me how many members of staff serve in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_305"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 305</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

DfID, how many work full time on Iraq, and how many work full time on HIV/AIDS? To what extent is the problem concentrated within a unit, and to what extent is it tackled in every department and at every level? Can she also say when DfID will produce its comprehensive plan on AIDS? What proposals might that bring forward to help AIDS orphans?
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>I believe that my noble friend Lord Alderdice is right. He describes as paradoxical the effects of some policies that work against the effects of others. Surely allowing the AIDS pandemic to spread, while we are theoretically trying to achieve the MDGs, is at the least paradoxical.

</p>

<a name="40609-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>Nevertheless, the Government are to be applauded for putting international development higher on the agenda. But it seems to me that there is a long way to go and it is very clear that Iraq has been a major diversion from the needs of the very poor. We must all hope that, with the passage of the latest UN resolution, the time will rapidly come when Iraq properly governs and secures itself so that attention can once more be effectively addressed to the needs of the poorest in the world.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>It is surely the case that we have a moral responsibility, as others have said, to the poorest in the world, but we also have, as the noble Lord, Lord   Hannay, pointed out, a self-interest in the greater stability that economic development produces.

<a name="40609-13_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Rawlings: </b>   My Lords, I, too, thank my noble friend Lady Chalker for initiating this afternoon&#039;s debate and for introducing it with such wisdom. I echo the comments of other noble Lords in recognising the long and ongoing commitment my noble friend shows to the field of international development.

</p>

<a name="40609-13_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>Today&#039;s debate presents us with an invaluable opportunity to examine the very important contribution the Department for International Development has made over the past year. As is so frequently the case in your Lordships&#039; House, we have heard this afternoon many knowledgeable, moving and enlightened contributions. I welcome the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, to the Dispatch Box for this debate, but I cannot disguise my disappointment that a debate on something as fundamental as the international development annual report, covering such a vital subject, is not being replied to by the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, who has such long experience in the field.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>In speaking to the report, I would like to address several of the key geographical zones in turn before finally turning to the more holistic role that DfID plays in supporting some of the world&#039;s poorest societies.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>As we have heard many times, 1.1 billion people live on less than a dollar a day. Of these, 70 per cent live in rural areas, working in agriculture. We have heard, too, that the current combination of agricultural subsidies in developed countries and trade barriers to protect their own products continues to contribute to ongoing poverty.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_306"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 306</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-13_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>I start with the situation in Africa, where the vast majority of the poorest countries are situated. We note that DfID spends almost 50 per cent of its bilateral assistance in this region. Tragically, for too long their progress has been held back by conflict, on which I want to concentrate.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>Only today, in a Statement in the other place, we heard yet again that the Janjaweed militia is responsible for massive violence, that a climate of impunity prevails in Darfur, and that the Government of Sudan permit the Janjaweed to exercise a reign of terror over the Darfurians. As the Secretary of State said, we have a responsibility to do all we can so that Darfur does not descend into genocide.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>Conflict, as we see in Darfur, is a major contributor to world poverty. Indeed, page 107 of the report points out that of the 40 poorest countries in the world, 24 are either in the midst of or have recently emerged from conflict. It is also important to recognise the important contribution that peace-keeping operations can have in reducing poverty. We welcome the fine report, <i>A   Case for Change</i>, by Nicola Dahrendorf, produced by King&#039;s College, London, that DfID commissioned to address this issue, and I declare an interest as chairman of its council.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>We also welcome the progress that has been made in   providing improved access to healthcare and education. However, not all the progress in Africa has been as good. The ongoing scourge of HIV/AIDS continues to blight the continent, as the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, mentioned. It is spreading though a mix of cultural traditions, lack of education or, in the case of Zimbabwe, ill-thought-through land reform. There, the displacement of thousands of farm labourers has led to the spread of the disease. I fully agree with the stirring speech of my noble friend Lady   Flather on the plight of women in developing countries.

</p>

<a name="40609-13_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>Good governance and national responsibility have a major role to play in those countries where health education has been pushed to the fore. There have been significant reductions in new cases of the virus, and I pay tribute to the work of the Government of Uganda. Moreover, a global strategy coupled with good governance might help curb the spread of HIV/AIDS. We would like to see the Global Fund for health ring-fenced to promote pharmaceutical research into an affordable cure for HIV/AIDS, and not have its efficacy reduced to a general pot of money, as publicly advocated by the former Secretary of State for International Development.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>In Asia, there has also been progress. In Afghanistan, no longer at war&#151;despite some of the reports we have heard from the noble Earl, Lord   Sandwich&#151;economic growth is up 30 per cent, and 4 million children have returned to school. We acknowledge the work that DfID has done in Burma, where there has been considerable progress since the   communist regime, where the UK is the largest co-financier of the fund for HIV/AIDS.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>We do however note with interest the statement that DfID is involved in a 100 million dollar loan to provide schooling for 2.4 million children in China. Perhaps <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_307"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 307</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Minister could enlighten the House on the reasoning behind a loan to support education in one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.

</p>

<a name="40609-13_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>I turn to the situation in Europe and the Middle East. Particular progress has been made in Iraq, and we pay tribute to the work DfID has done in supporting this. In particular, we welcome the &#163;0.5 billion the Government have pledged up to 2006 for reconstruction projects and humanitarian assistance. The funding will go far in improving the lives of Iraqi people in their unfolding democracy.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>We note the additional funding for the Palestinian negotiation support unit which provides advice to the   Palestinian Authority on how best to approach negotiations with Israel. It has been suggested, however, that this organisation has, since the collapse of the Camp David negotiations, been involved in spreading anti-Israeli propaganda. Obviously, with any funding it is important that the Government can trace the use to which it is put and I ask the Minister what checks are in place to ensure examples such as this do not become the norm.

</p>

<a name="40609-13_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>I turn to the global situation and I agree with many noble Lords who have rightly mentioned Latin America that the lack of support for those countries is quite shameful. We welcome the clear progress that the Government have made in the area of debt relief, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Desai, where 100   per cent of the debt owed by most heavily indebted poor countries has been written off. However, current procedures in debt relief&#151;namely, HIPC&#151;are bureaucratic and slow and are failing the people they were designed to help. If further progress is to be made in relieving poverty in developing countries, urgent reform of debt relief and HIPC in particular is required. What guarantees may be provided to support those countries that have not yet achieved decision point or completion point?
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>Finally, I turn to the important roles of aid and trade. Noble Lords who have read the report will have seen that in the opening pages Her Majesty&#039;s Government set out the important role that aid has to play. Indeed, successive governments have all realised that aid is crucial in moving some of the world&#039;s poorest countries away from   the millstone of poverty. However, we must not underestimate the importance of trade in establishing robust and sustainable free market economies. I fully endorse the support of my noble friend Lady Chalker for private sector contribution.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>With regard to the department&#039;s fourth target of reducing trade barriers between developing countries by 2005 and the Doha development agenda, I find it difficult to see how this target will be met in the light of the collapse of the Cancun meetings in September last year. We welcome the Doha development round and the subsequent meetings because we view free trade as more effective and sustainable than aid in isolation. While we recognise the need for aid, our priority is to liberalise markets and thus have free trade as the key propagator for global wealth development.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>Following on from this, we could establish an advocacy fund for developing nations that would be paid for by the richer countries of the world. The <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_308"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 308</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

advocacy fund would in turn allow poorer nations to pay for the necessary expertise and legal advice in order to hold their own throughout future world trade   talks. We support a rapid return to the Doha development round in order to pursue free trade as the most effective remedy in curing world poverty.

</p>

<a name="40609-13_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>I am sure all noble Lords will agree that aid should always add value and help countries to help themselves. We are grateful to my noble friend for reminding us of the importance of European Union aid. Yet, as my honourable friend the Shadow Secretary of State for International Development, John Bercow MP, recently said in a speech to the International Institute for Strategic Studies,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;there is a chronic contradiction between aid policy and trade policy . . .  For every dollar western taxpayers give to poor countries, those countries lose two dollars through barriers to their exports to the developed world&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-13_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>All too often it seems what the UK Government give in overseas aid is more than outweighed by what we take away through trade subsidies or sanctions.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>Truly effective aid requires fair trade. As we have heard from the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle during the debate, even if countries meet the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GDP for government aid, the sum remains insignificant when compared to the potential of trade. When faced with a choice between giving people money and enabling them to earn money, the latter is surely preferable.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>In this encouraging report we read of aid, debt relief, development of affordable medicines and more trade with many of these countries. These are all laudable aims, but which will have little effect on a country being torn apart by constant conflict. It is easy to forget when talking about war that each figure represents the death of an individual&#151;someone&#039;s father, mother or child. In Darfur alone it is estimated that 2 million have died. With this one example it is easy to see how conflict is the fundamental contributor to world poverty.
</p>

<a name="40609-13_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>It would be churlish of me not to recognise the importance and significance of last week&#039;s celebrations of 60 years of peace and prosperity in Europe after centuries of bloody battles. This peace is due principally to the European Union and the NATO alliance, but also to the democratic freedom and good governance of individual countries. This can only emphasise how important it is that everyone who has the privilege to vote, in whatever election, does so.

<a name="40609-14_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, I too thank the noble Baroness, Lady Chalker, for securing this debate and in doing so I acknowledge her most impressive record and experience in this field. I thank all noble Lords who have participated in this excellent debate for their very constructive and often challenging remarks, and for their positive comments on the Government&#039;s policy towards international development.
</p>

<a name="40609-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>As 2005 approaches, we are reaching a critical time for global political commitment and UK leadership in the field of international development. The 2004 DfID <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_309"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 309</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

departmental report&#151;I thank all noble Lords who have made encouraging noises on the report&#151;sets out the work that DfID undertakes through bilateral and multilateral channels in more than 125 countries around the world and aims to give a balanced picture of UK success stories and areas where much more needs to be done and how we intend to achieve that.

</p>

<a name="40609-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>Progress towards the internationally agreed millennium development goals is mixed, as many noble Lords have said. On current trends it is unlikely that more than two goals will be met by 2015: the goals relating to income poverty and improved access to safe water. Globally, 104 million children still do not go to primary school; 10 million children die each year before their fifth birthdays from largely preventable diseases; and 1.1 billion people are still living on less than one dollar a day.

</p>

<a name="40609-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Each UK government department has to measure progress against a set of objectives that make up its public service agreement; a mechanism first implemented in 1999 that provides a coherent and dynamic focus for the department&#039;s work. As the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, said, DfID&#039;s 2003&#150;06 public service agreement is linked directly to the millennium development goals.
</p>

<a name="40609-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>The millennium development goals have been referred to by many noble Lords. The department is on track to meet 17 of the 28 indicators linked to the objectives. There has been a significant reduction in the proportion of people living on one dollar a day. The ratio of girls to boys enrolled in primary schools has increased. The effectiveness of the international development system has been enhanced. However, enormous challenges remain, as we have heard today from many noble Lords, particularly those relating to under-fives and maternal mortality rates, tuberculosis detection rates, the poverty focus of the EC and the stalled World Trade Organisation talks.
</p>

<a name="40609-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>The constraints to progress against the millennium development goals and the public service agreement vary considerably between geographical regions. They include particularly the impact of HIV/AIDS and barriers to trade, in addition to ongoing conflict, poor governance, inequality and exclusion, and human rights abuses. The scale of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is staggering, as the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, said, with nine new infections occurring globally every minute. That is quite simply killing development in many countries. Life expectancy is dropping and deaths among skilled workers and young people are undermining prospects for future economic growth. The social consequences for women and children in particular&#151;a matter raised by the noble Lord, Lord   Patel, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Flather and Lady Northover&#151;are devastating. In Botswana it is estimated that life expectancy will drop from 65 years in the early 1990s to 27 years by 2010.

</p>

<a name="40609-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>The UK Government&#039;s call for action on HIV/AIDS is the start of a process that will take us beyond our 2005 presidency and focus on stronger political direction and   improved funding. On donor co-ordination and HIV/AIDS programmes, we are fully supportive of the UN and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_310"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 310</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

World Health Organisation efforts to secure HIV treatment for 3 million people in the developing world by the end of 2005, including 2   million in sub-Saharan Africa.

</p>

<a name="40609-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>The stalled world trade talks at Cancun were a major disappointment and the UK Government are absolutely committed to an early resumption of multilateral trade negotiations. The stakes are high, as the noble Baroness, Lady Chalker, has implied. Estimates suggest that a 50 per cent reduction in trade protection measures by both developing and developed countries could result in a welfare gain for developing countries of around 150 billion dollars per year. As noble Lords will know, that is three times what they receive in aid. This could lift 300 million people out of poverty by 2015, as the noble Baroness said.
</p>

<a name="40609-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>Noble Lords have stressed that the international community must now move on to deliver on the Doha commitments to improve market access, to reduce and agree a date for ending all forms of export subsidies and to reduce trade distorting domestic support.
</p>

<a name="40609-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>The challenge to the millennium development goals is particularly daunting in sub-Saharan Africa where poverty levels are the highest in the world. Less than 1   per cent of global foreign direct investment goes to the region. Africa&#039;s share of world trade is also less than 1   per cent and 29 million Africans are infected with the HIV virus.

</p>

<a name="40609-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>The UK Government are committed to tackling the challenges faced by sub-Saharan Africa. The Commission for Africa set up this year provides an opportunity to take a fresh look at the problems facing Africa, both past and present, and to recommend a new way forward. This is not a UK commission. More than half the commissioners are African and it aims to draw on the expertise of as many African organisations as possible, in particular the African Union and the New Partnership for Africa&#039;s Development. The commission has agreed six principal themes to be considered over the next six   months: investment in people;   conflict and peace-building; the environment; governance; the economy; culture and participation. Its recommendations may mean difficult choices for the international community and Africa, but new solutions must be identified if the Millennium Development Goals are to be relevant for the majority of Africans.
</p>

<a name="40609-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>The United Nations millennium development goals stock-take next year will provide a harsh reality-check. It is currently estimated that sub-Saharan Africa will reach neither the poverty goal nor the child mortality goal until 2150&#151;some 150 years beyond 2015. It will be imperative that we use this stock-take to gain renewed commitment from the international community as a whole to meeting the millennium development goals within the agreed timescale. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle has rightly said, 2005 will offer an important opportunity for the UK Government to increase the international political focus on development as they take   on the presidencies of the G8 and the expanded European Union. The way forward is clear&#151;we must ensure that sufficient financial resources are provided, and that these are used to optimum effect if real progress is to be made. Again, the right reverend Prelate underlined this issue in his contribution.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_311"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 311</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>First, the volume of aid must be increased. The 2002 Monterrey Financing for Development Consensus committed international donors to providing significant additional aid by 2006. We now need to live up to these commitments. The UK Government are gradually moving towards the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of our gross national income being allocated to official development assistance. We aim to reach 0.4 per cent in 2005&#150;06. I take note of several noble Lords&#039; criticisms on the speed of that development. We are also strongly supporting the proposed International Finance Facility which aims to more that double the total aid provided globally to more than 100 billion dollars a year.

</p>

<a name="40609-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>Secondly, in addition to providing more funds, as the noble Baroness, Lady Chalker, has highlighted, the effectiveness of that aid must be improved. In the last year for which we have figures, donors started 35,000 activities with an average size of 1.5 million dollars. It is almost impossible for developing countries to keep track of these initiatives, and to draw maximum benefit from them. DfID has worked closely with others to implement the principles established in the OECD Rome Declaration on Harmonisation in 2003, which aim to encourage a more integrated approach from international donors. DfID has reduced its number of projects and focused more on poverty reduction budget support and sector strategies intended to support partner governments&#039; own poverty reduction agendas. Thirdly, well-informed, evidence-based policy is critical to good decision-making on both aid allocations and intervention. DfID is working to improve its policies through greater research and improved analytical methodology, and has reorganised its policy division this year to provide more focused analysis, advice and expertise.

</p>

<a name="40609-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>Given sufficient political will, progress is possible. There are already success stories to be told. Ongoing conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa have fallen from 19 to two over the past four years. The heavily indebted poor countries initiative has released 1.7 billion dollars since 2001 for social expenditure and poverty reduction in 27   countries. Over the past four years, DfID has helped India to increase primary school enrolment to 90 per cent. In conjunction with other agencies, DfID has helped to save 1,000 lives in the immediate aftermath of the Bam earthquake in Iran. It is estimated that DfID&#039;s aid lifts 2 million people permanently out of poverty each year.

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>I will do my best to answer as many of your Lordships&#039; questions as possible, and those that I do not reach I will follow-up in correspondence. The noble Baroness, Lady Chalker, asked about DfID and private companies, and what action we are taking to develop these partnerships. DfID is working on a number of fronts to promote greater corporate responsibility and greater partnership with the private sector. Successful examples include the extractive industries transparency initiative launched by the Prime Minister in September 2002 to promote full transparency of payments and revenues in the oil, gas and mining sectors in developing countries. There is also the support for the ethical trading initiative, an alliance of businesses, <br>&nbsp;<br>

non-governmental organisations and trade unions designed to improve working conditions in global supply chains. The noble Baroness also asked whether the poverty reduction budget support is given in conjunction with help for capacity-building. Capacity-building is provided in conjunction with the budget support, often within the area of public financial management systems among others. An important indicator of whether budget support will result in poverty reduction is whether the recipient government&#039;s public financial management systems are effective.
</p>

<a name="40609-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Chalker, and the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, asked what DfID is   doing to improve access to trade and reduce trade barriers. They will know that the Government acknowledge the damaging effect that dumping and trade-supporting subsidies have on developing countries&#039; agricultural sectors. Commodity dependency&#151;and the associated vulnerability to high volatility prices&#151;also remains a major development problem. Our priorities for the round are getting agreement on the issues that matter most to developing countries: agriculture; non-agricultural market access; and special and differential treatment to help poorer countries adjust to open markets.
</p>

<a name="40609-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>The noble Baroness raised the issue of corruption as did my noble friend Lord Desai. She asked whether we are training for reducing corruption. We are not training specifically, but DfID provides a wide range of support for developing countries to tackle corruption&#151;through strong enforcement action against corruption and money laundering such as effective anti-corruption agencies and financial intelligence units, and through necessary preventive measures such as improved public sector financial management and better parliamentary oversight.
</p>

<a name="40609-14_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle and the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, raised very strongly the issue of the 0.7 per cent target. I have covered that to some extent. They also asked me directly about a timetable, as did other noble Lords. I will no doubt disappoint them by saying that the UK Government have not as yet committed to a timetable for reaching the 0.7 per cent target. However, I am sure that the strong appeal of the right reverend Prelate and other noble Lords will be noted.
</p>

<a name="40609-14_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, asked in his very moving contribution what plans DfID has in developing a new strategy for meeting millennium development goals for reducing maternal deaths. A new strategy on maternal health will be launched by the department in the coming weeks. As the noble Lord knows, DfID is committed to reducing the appalling toll of deaths of mothers and new-born babies. We are focused on building better health systems able to meet the challenges of delivering quality care in the resource-starved settings that are often found&#151;systems able to provide access to quality reproductive health services, prevent and safely manage unwanted pregnancies, and provide skilled attendance for every birth backed by ready access to emergency obstetric care.

</p>

<a name="40609-14_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>The noble Lord also raised the question of how DfID is promoting programmes for treating women with obstetric fistula. I am sure that the department will be very willing to discuss this most important area of women&#039;s and girls&#039; health with him at his convenience.


</p>

<a name="40609-14_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, and the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, spoke about the USA with regard to contraception and reproduction programmes. They asked what plans DfID had to engage in dialogue with countries such as the USA to promote reproductive health and rights more actively by restoring their funding schemes. They will know that DfID has a long-standing commitment to support reproductive health and rights. We are a leading donor to UNIFEM. DfID engages with international partners in strengthening global leadership and raising the profile of maternal health on national and international agendas. Although we agree to disagree with the United States on those policies, such as those on condoms and abortion, that does not preclude us from working closely with the United States on sexual and reproductive health in a number of countries.
</p>

<a name="40609-14_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Flather, the noble Lords, Lord Patel and Lord Chan, and others emphasised the empowerment of women. We agree that gender equality and the empowerment of women are essential prerequisites for the eradication of world poverty and the upholding of human rights.
</p>

<a name="40609-14_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>I was asked a specific question by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, about street children in Brazil and the consequences of DfID&#039;s policy on middle-income countries. I can say to the noble Lord&#151;I hope   that it is good news&#151;that the Government&#039;s reprioritisation of funding to middle-income countries will not affect the work being done with street children in Brazil, which is supported by DfID. United Kingdom NGOs will continue to have access to funding through DfID&#039;s Civil Society Challenge Fund and through their partnership programme agreements with DfID for such projects. DfID currently supports one such project through the Civil Society Challenge Fund scheme.
</p>

<a name="40609-14_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Hannay of Chiswick and Lord Bowness, asked about EU aid policy and our response to it. We are, of course, in favour of turning the European Union into an effective player in aid policy. It is the third-largest aid agency in the world. Recent EU reforms are starting to push things in the right direction, and we are looking to build on those positive developments. That will not give noble Lords the complete answer, but, no doubt, we will get that in the coming weeks and months.
</p>

<a name="40609-14_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, asked a specific question about the Darwin Initiative&#151;a biodiversity initiative. Last year, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs contributed &#163;4   million to the Darwin Initiative, which is a small grants programme that draws on British expertise in biodiversity to promote conservation and the sustainable use of resources in less-developed countries. Since its launch in 1992, the Darwin Initiative has committed over   &#163;35 million to more than 300 projects in over 100   countries. Defra&#039;s contribution to the initiative will rise to &#163;7 million in 2006&#150;07.

<a name="40609-15_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister and the 12 other noble Lords who spoke in the debate. We will inevitably sympathise with the Minister, in trying to sum up such a wide debate. I remember the situation well.

</p>

<a name="40609-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>I beg the Minister and the department to consider again how we can achieve better co-ordination and collaboration, not only with other donors but also with governments. I ask DfID not to be cowed by Finance Ministers, who always want to direct everything. That is why I made particular play in my comments on capacity building of extending capacity building in foreign countries to the spending departments, not just to financial management. However good the IFMIS systems are, support will be of value in   lifting people out of poverty only if the spending departments get it right, not just the Finance Ministers. I know that the Minister and the department will put special emphasis on trying to get easier trade relations between the developing world and the developed world, but training in those countries to enable growth in their export industry is vital.
</p>

<a name="40609-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>It would be wrong to go over the debate, and it is impossible to sum it up in 20 minutes or in two. I take to heart what the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, said about the health issues. Unless we get the health issues right, we undermine so many of the other things that we do. For many years, my companies have trained two people aged 20, in order to have one active and working at 40. That is the scale of the problem. It is not just HIV/AIDS; it is malaria and TB, about which we can take far more preventive action than we, as donors, encourage countries to do.
</p>

<a name="40609-15_para2"></a>

<a name="40609-15_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Northesk</b>  rose to call attention to levels of personal debt, including mortgage debt; and to move for Papers.

</p>




<p><a name="st_105"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, your Lordships will recall the heady days of the last few years of the previous century. The Prime Minister proclaimed a new political order based on new Labour&#039;s &quot;Third Way&quot;. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the back of his <br>&nbsp;<br>

immediate decision to transfer the setting of interest rates to the Bank of England, claimed the equivalent of economic sainthood. His comments in a Statement on the Government&#039;s economic and fiscal strategy in June 1998 give a flavour of the rhetoric that prevailed at the time:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;The spending plans that we set must ensure sustainable finances over the whole economic cycle&#151;rigorous financial discipline that, together with monetary stability, ends once and for all the boom and bust that for 30 years has undermined stability, hindered long-term investment in our public services and prevented this country from achieving its potential&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 11/6/98; col. 1195.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>That claim of fiscal alchemy&#151;the banishment of boom and bust&#151;dripped from the lips of Treasury Ministers like so much honey.
</p>

<a name="40609-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>In terms, the situation that prevails at the moment is one of booms in house prices and consumer spending, both fuelled substantially by debt. Perhaps we should not be surprised that the Treasury has become more circumspect about claiming that boom and bust has been banished. Even the Chancellor&#039;s affection for prudence&#151;formerly so strong&#151;seems to have cooled.
</p>

<a name="40609-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>Nevertheless, we should give credit where credit is due. Noble Lords on these Benches might wish that the   Government had been a little more generous in acknowledging their golden economic inheritance. Despite that, it would be churlish not to admit that the economy has performed tolerably well in recent years. However, although, outwardly, some of the headline trends continue to seem adequately robust, clouds are gathering. We cannot tell how dark they may be or what economic hailstorms they may carry, but of one thing we can be certain: they are gathering. Not least among them are current levels of personal debt.

</p>

<a name="40609-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>It is as well to put the matter in context. According to the most recent figures from the Bank of England, net lending to individuals stands at &#163;985 billion. Personal debt is currently rising at the rate of &#163;1 million every four   minutes, with the breach of the &#163;1 trillion mark imminent. In common with my right honourable friend Oliver Letwin, I do not suggest that this,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;will lead to an economic meltdown, but it is a timely wake-up call&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40609-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>Unsecured personal debt has grown by more than 50 per cent since 1997, twice as fast as incomes, and now stands at &#163;5,330 per person. Total unsecured personal debt stands at &#163;172 billion and is growing at over 10 per cent a year. Credit card lending grew by &#163;963 million in March, the largest increase in two years. As to mortgage lending, this grew by &#163;9.34 billion in March, the highest amount for five months.
</p>

<a name="40609-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>Here, worrying signals are beginning to emerge. At what the Government might call the affordable end of the market, many people with limited experience of the rental sector are entering the buy-to-let market. This is fanning the flames of house price inflation. However, as revealed in last week&#039;s <i>Sunday Times</i>, there is growing evidence that people&#039;s expectations of the return on their investment are pitched too high. In such circumstances the effect of even a relatively modest increase in interest rates could be profound. As Shelter has observed:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_316"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 316</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;If buy-to-let investors cut and run this could be the catalyst for a severe slowdown&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>Shelter&#039;s research provides us with an insight into the standing of the unaffordable end of the market by showing that buying a first home is now 33 per cent less affordable than it was 10 years ago, and that first-time buyers accounted for just 29 per cent of all buyers last year&#151;a fall from 50 per cent in 2001. In addition, 55   per cent of all mortgage lending is to homeowners borrowing against the value of their existing homes and, incredibly, that 50 per cent accounts for 50 per cent of the rise in consumer spending. From this we can infer that a sizeable proportion of mortgage debt is being used to fund either day-to-day living expenses or lifestyle choices.
</p>

<a name="40609-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>The reverse side of the debt coin, saving, exhibits similar properties. The savings ratio has halved under the current administration. According to the Family Resources Survey, 27 per cent of households have next to no savings at all, and a further 23 per cent have savings of less than &#163;1,500. Charles Bean, the Bank of England&#039;s chief economist, has noted that one-third of British households have virtually no liquid assets to draw on if the need arises. In the six years from 1998 to 2003, the household saving ratio has never been higher than 6.7 per cent; in the previous six years to 1997 it was never lower than 9.3 per cent.

</p>

<a name="40609-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>By all available measures people are saving less and borrowing more than when the Government came into office, which, as reflected in the statistics, is causing increasing problems. Some 1.5 million new consumer debt problems were brought to Citizens Advice Bureaux during 2001&#150;02, a 50 per cent rise on 2000&#150;01. Inquiries to CAB about consumer credit and debt have gone up 46 per cent during the past five years. Twenty-six per cent of people struggle with debt repayments from time to time, and 11 per cent have more serious problems. Over 3 million households now rely on the services of moneylenders. Individual bankruptcies are at their highest level since late 1993, with those going bankrupt during the past year rising by nearly a third.
</p>

<a name="40609-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>What is more, debt is impacting disproportionately on the most disadvantaged. The debt to income ratio is highest for the poorest households, where it has also risen faster than in any other group, doubling between 1995 and 2000. Households earning less than &#163;15,000 are twice as likely to be in arrears than more affluent households.
</p>

<a name="40609-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>Despite the commitment of the Chancellor at the 2003 Labour Party conference,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a>&quot;to abolish pensioner poverty in this generation&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40609-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>the proportion of pensioners living in households below 60 per cent median income before housing costs in 2001&#150;02 remains relatively unchanged from 1994&#150;95 levels. A MORI survey, published earlier this year, has found that student debt has risen by 74 per cent over the past four years, with students now graduating with average debts of &#163;8,031, as compared with, according to the Government&#039;s own figures, &#163;840 in 1995&#150;96, &#163;2,530 in 1998&#150;99 and &#163;3,210 in 1999&#150;2000.
</p>

<a name="40609-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>All in all, this is a curious, not to say surprising, legacy of the Government&#039;s protestations of &quot;prosperity not for the few, but for the many&quot;. It is not as if the Government <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_317"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 317</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have been suddenly blindsided by personal debt as a specific feature of the economy. As long ago as October 2000, the DTI convened a meeting with various financial institutions, prompted by research from the Citizens Advice Bureaux showing unprecedented demand for debt counselling, to discuss ways of stemming the growth in unaffordable debt. At the time Dr Kim Howells commented: &quot;It&#039;s&quot;&#151;that is, personal debt&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>&quot;become a major concern to almost everyone, not just the people who are out there trying to give advice&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-15_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>And yet, judging from subsequent responses, the Government have become ever more reticent, not to say blas&#233;, about the matter. In March of last year, the Treasury Minister Ruth Kelly held out consumer debt as a badge of honour for, and almost a source of pride in, the Government&#039;s economic policy, stating:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>&quot;Growth in household debt reflects strong fundamentals with a robust labour market, low interest rates and strong gains in housing wealth&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 10/3/03; col. 21W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-15_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, reiterated this sentiment in his response to an Unstarred Question from my noble friend Lady Wilcox:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a>&quot;Our stable macro-economic framework has delivered sustainable economic growth, with the growth in borrowing reflecting the strong fundamentals of the UK economy&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-15_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>He added, for good measure:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;The economic success is to some extent fuelling the issue of consumer debt&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-15_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>To be fair, the noble Lord did qualify his comments by stating that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a>&quot;this is an issue which the Government take very seriously. We are working to address the problem&quot;. &#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 21/10/03; col. 1582 col. 1582.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-15_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>In November of last year the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, sought to offer a similar reassurance, when he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a>&quot;The Government are alert to the risks&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-15_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>well that is all right, then&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;but debt at present remains affordable&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 11/1/03; col. 1209.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-15_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>Despite the way in which the figures for debt have surged in the intervening period, he added:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a>&quot;I deny the inexorable rise of household debt&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 11/11/03; col. 1211]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-15_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>Even the Minister has got in on the act. Last December he offered this analysis of the totality of the debt problem saying that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a>&quot;the ratio of debts to assets in the economy is still very healthy among households. The reason why people feel that they can push the boat out with regard to credit cards is because they feel wealthier . . .  People feel wealthier because, objectively, they are wealthier&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 2/12/03; col. 184.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-15_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>Most, if not all, of these pronouncements share an odd feature. Paraphrasing Gordon Gekko in the film &quot;Wall Street&quot;, they say, &quot;Debt is good&quot;. They translate as exhortations to borrow. In truth, this should not surprise us unduly. As my noble friend Lord Saatchi observed in a similar debate some eight months ago,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a>&quot;the Government have a vested interest in the continuation of the present build up of debt&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 21/10/03; col. 1580]</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_318"></a>

</p>

<a name="40609-15_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>Paradoxically, the current booms in consumer spending and house prices are propping up the performance of the economy, and on the basis of the evidence this week from the CBI and the Halifax, neither is showing any signs of slowing. With that in mind, it is perhaps worth contemplating how Government policy interacts with the issue of debt.
</p>

<a name="40609-15_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>I accept that the Government are not in the business of telling people how to run their own finances. Nevertheless, policy has a role to play in establishing the economic climate and sentiment in which they live their lives. Over the past seven years the Chancellor has conspired to introduce a whole range of measures&#151;the removal of advanced dividend tax credit, the introduction of means-testing via the convoluted tax credit system, and so on&#151;which act as disincentives to saving. In conjunction with this, the Government are throwing huge sums of public money at public services.
</p>

<a name="40609-15_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>The Chancellor, far from continuing to ally himself with prudence, is funding today&#039;s spending from debt in the expectation of jam tomorrow. Irrespective of current affordability, there is a sense in which the psychology of public policy has shifted from thrift to profligacy. Perhaps we should not be surprised if, learning from the example, the public exhibits the same sort of attitudes towards saving and debt as the Government.

</p>

<a name="40609-15_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>Moreover, if, as seems to be the case, the broad sweep of public policy is predicated on the concept that debt is good, there is scope for suspicion that this is motivated as much by requirements of political expediency as a wish to sustain the economy in robust and vigorous health. We are in a significant electoral period and there are those, not least the Item Club, who suggest that the Chancellor has deliberately engineered the current debt-funded pre-election boom.
</p>

<a name="40609-15_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>The Minister will no doubt insist that Bank of England independence pre-empts this. As we all know, the Monetary Policy Committee is statutorily required to consider interest rate policy within the limits of the symmetrical inflation target. It cannot deviate outside these bounds other than in exceptional circumstances. Accordingly, it is in a somewhat anomalous position: because it is tied to measuring inflation with CPI rather than RPIX, it is obliged to ignore council tax and all other housing costs. House price inflation is, of necessity, a closed book to it.
</p>

<a name="40609-15_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>George Trefgarne, writing in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> last month, is particularly robust in his criticism. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a>&quot;Of all the scandals involving this Government and its manipulation of numbers and targets, the fiddling of the inflation target is quite the most reprehensible . . .  It is precisely because of this fiddle that the house price and credit spiral has suddenly become so political&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40609-15_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>In a subtle and roundabout way, the independence of the committee to set interest rates according to the prevailing circumstances of the economy has been compromised with potentially damaging consequences.

</p>

<a name="40609-15_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>By way of comfort to the Minister, I accept that some of the headlines and media reporting of personal debt in recent weeks have been overblown. Indeed, I have taken <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_319"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 319</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

due note of MORI&#039;s report last week on credit card debt. Certainly it is premature to assume that current levels of personal debt presage an impending crisis. Nor do I envy the Government their task. Consumer confidence as a major plank of the economy is a fragile and fickle phenomenon at the best of times. Nevertheless, there does seem to be growing evidence that current levels of both debt and house prices are unsustainable. As Ken Rogoff, the International Monetary Fund&#039;s chief economist, has said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a>&quot;Forty per cent of all housing booms are followed by busts, with housing price drops that typically average 25&#150;30 per cent&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-15_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>Nor should we be immune to his explicit warning that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a>&quot;the long boom in house prices&#151;up 28 per cent in the US since 1996, and 70 per cent in the UK since 1994, adjusted for inflation&#151;put them in danger territory&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-15_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>As we all know, other eminent commentators have issued similar warnings, not least Sir Andrew Large, the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England. It would be irresponsible to ignore them. To do so would be to run the risk of engineering the &quot;bust&quot; to the current &quot;boom&quot;. How hollow the Chancellor&#039;s words would sound then.
</p>

<a name="40609-15_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>My time is up. That being so, I very much look forward to the contributions of other noble Lords during of debate. I have no doubt that they will elaborate on some of the themes&#151;and, doubtless, others&#151;that I have outlined with much more eloquence and expertise than I can muster. I beg to move for Papers.

<a name="40609-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   My Lords, the problem is the build-up of debt and the shift from thrift to profligacy. But the main object of this speech is to clarify the approach to the retention of control of our financial and budgetary affairs&#151;a matter of national interest affecting the state of our economy&#151;which already has become a sharp political issue.

</p>

<a name="40609-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>As a subsidiary matter in context with the levels of personal debt and mortgage debt, recently the question has arisen of whether the Government&#039;s proposal to amend the Consumer Protection Act 1974 to clarify APR&#151;or, in ordinary English, the total cost of credit&#151;would have little effect other than to confuse and increase the cost to consumers. On this, it is not proposed to comment.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>To revert to the main object, the introduction of my noble friend Lord Northesk rightly affirmed that fiscal and monetary control is unitary in the sense that measures to adjust the level of household and government debt not only interact but have an effect on taxation, on inflation, to which my noble friend referred, and on the economy, to which he also referred.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>Albeit that no noble Lord with former practical experience as Chancellor of the Exchequer is to speak, at least we are to have the benefit of the expertise of the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, and the other noble Lords whose names are down to speak. My noble friend Lady   Noakes speaks from the Front Bench on Treasury affairs, which are totally within the remit of the object of this speech.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40609-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>The hope is that the timely introduction of my noble friend, for which we should all express gratitude, will herald a fully fledged, prime-time debate on the draft EU constitution, but before the conclusion of the negotiations. The question arises whether the unitary fiscal and budgetary control is to be retained or surrendered. The draft EU constitution&#151;and this is no time to go into detail&#151;broadly speaking, is a federal structure which appears to afford no veto in the national interest and leaves wide open the crucial aspect of conferral of competence, to which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scott of Foscote, referred the other day.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>Already some of the red lines that we read about&#151;we have to say &quot;read about&quot; because no one knows what they are&#151;have been erased. In this context, an assurance is respectfully sought that the Government shall retain budgetary and fiscal control unfettered by EU objection, imposition or sanction. If no such assurance can be given&#151;and that may well be the case&#151;what is the Government&#039;s approach to this retention of control? Perhaps, if he is able, the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, will inform the House. If he is not able to do so, it would be no cause for surprise.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>But until the Government approach is known, it   simply is not possible to formulate constructive opposition&#151;certainly for those who, as at present advised, are not inclined to support the UKIP, which would take us to the brink without having seen the books. Albeit an issue of cardinal importance, there are always objections to a one-issue party.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>Household debt, which is only one aspect of the problem of debt, is now about &#163;100 billion. It is increasing, as my noble friend said, by &#163;1 million every four minutes. In addition to the bank figures, there was &#163;9.8 million mortgage debt in April and as yet no figures for May.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>Your Lordships may think that the only way in which to put on the brake&#151;and a brake must be put on&#151;is to raise bank rates to over 5 per cent; perhaps further if need be, but initially by at least a step towards 5 per cent. That is a balancing act on the tightrope of bankruptcy, which has now topped the high watermark recorded 10 years ago. A vast area of imponderables has to be taken into account, including the extra burden on those who have borrowed at other than fixed rates. It is no easy exercise and I do not pretend that it is.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>The Government handed over bank rates in a most curious way to the MPC of the Bank of England to control inflation without a remit to control household debt. That was the most dotty exercise that anyone could have conceived. They are now about to start to redress the situation by what we hope the MPC will do tomorrow. The main long-term beneficiaries of the situation appear to be the financial institutions.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>Government debt has risen to &#163;13 billion, notwithstanding 66 stealth taxes since 1997. It is not known what action should be taken other than to increase taxation or whether the Government intend to take such or any action. Can we continue to borrow and spend much more and avoid an increase in <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40609-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>Has the frail thread of confidence been stretched too far? I can ask those questions but I am unable to answer them. I do not have the expertise. Fortunately, I am in a position to defer to the opinion of the noble Lord, Lord   Skidelsky, and my noble friends who are due to speak and who have the requisite expertise in the area.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>Retention of fiscal and budgetary control is not only requisite for the reasons already given, but also for the protection of the realm from those who believe it to be the will of God to destroy themselves if in the process they can destroy us.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>There has to be an immediate long-term continuing massive financial commitment, which the Budget has to bear and take into account, not only for the defence, intelligence and emergency services, but for the British Council, diplomacy, the World Service and aid for the rehabilitation of those deprived of their homes and human dignity assailed by deadly high-tech weaponry that they do not possess.

<a name="40609-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Skidelsky: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, for introducing the debate and giving us a chance to discuss a topic that I know arouses strong moral feelings. My wife cannot be the only person in the world who believes that an overdraft is the first step on the road to ruin&#151;a view seemingly backed up by today&#039;s sad story of the young father who hanged himself because he could not pay back the &#163;70,000 debts he had accumulated on 19 separate credit accounts.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>The story reminds one of the marvellous Victorian moral tale <i>Eric, or Little by Little</i>, that I read as a child. The speeches of the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, and the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, seemed to have a little of the same flavour: little by little on the road to ruin.

</p>

<a name="40609-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>What are the facts of the case? The annual growth of total lending to individuals runs at 14 per cent compared to average annual earnings growth of 4 per cent. The rate at which households are incurring debt is rising three times as fast as their incomes. That is the central fact for those who claim that the current rate of growth of debt is unsustainable. I know that there are other figures with which we can be dazzled, but those seem to be the crucial ones.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>The rate of household borrowing is strongly associated with house price inflation. The majority of personal debt is mortgage debt. Since personal disposable incomes are rising at less than half the rate of house prices, this suggests, in the words of the Monetary Policy Committee,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a>&quot;that household income gearing [is] likely to rise over the next few years towards levels last seen in the early 1990s&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-16_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>That could increase the vulnerability of the bottom end of the household sector to any rises in interest rates or unforeseen shocks.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_322"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 322</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-16_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>Such facts are used by those who claim that levels of personal debt are rapidly becoming unaffordable or&#151;in the jargon&#151;unsustainable and that a rise in interest rates is needed to curtail them. I hope that I am not a Pangloss. I agree that there is meaning in talking about unsustainable levels of debt, but the fact that debt is expanding faster than incomes does not mean that it is becoming unsustainable. It may simply mean that the sustainable level of debt has been rising. That is largely what has been happening.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>What grounds do I have for saying so? First, Britain has enjoyed unprecedented macroeconomic stability for the past seven years; not just high and stable levels of employment, but stable growth of earnings. There are two main reasons. The first is the macroeconomic framework established by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, by which I mean giving responsibility for setting interest rates to the Bank of England and establishing credible fiscal rules.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>That was a bold, even revolutionary step at the time, and it has paid off by making policy much more predictable. One of the advantages of being on the Cross Benches is that it is much easier to give credit where credit is due.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>Secondly, the British labour market has become much more flexible. For that the Thatcher labour market reforms must take most of the credit, although the decline of manufacturing has also played a part by dampening certain cycles that made our economy less   stable. The proof is that since 1997, the British economy has survived a threefold increase in oil prices as well as a substantial rise in the sterling-euro exchange rate with scarcely a blip. Contrast this with the experience of the 1970s when a fourfold rise in the price of oil produced a massive stagflation. The contrast is overwhelming.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>The result has been that we have enjoyed not just greater security of income but also more predictable growth of incomes. That is the background against which a higher sustainable rate of debt creation has emerged.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>There are other factors: the banks have become more expert at assessing the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. That has made it safer not only for people to borrow but for banks to lend. It is not just that the demand for credit has been growing&#151;the supply of credit has been growing as well.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>Thirdly, there have been important changes in the way in which the consumer market works today. The essential one is that you can now spread payments over a longer period, making a purchase more affordable. For example, before, you would have to put down a large deposit to buy a car and pay off the borrowing during the lifetime of the car. Now you can make a constant stream of payments for a succession of cars&#151;in effect, a leasehold system. You own the car but pay only for the cost of its use, which means that the sustainable amount of borrowing for any level of income has gone up.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_323"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 323</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-16_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>Finally, a large number of people have assets other than income out of which to pay service charges on loans. More than 60 per cent of householders are now house-owners. If you have wealth, small changes in your income do not matter so much for your consumption. Technically, possession of wealth makes borrowing more sensitive to income changes. When your income falls, you do not reduce your consumption but you can borrow more. If wealth is rising, consumption can rise too, regardless of income, which basically means that you can borrow more.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>Last month&#039;s minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee implicitly accepted the main proposition I am advancing&#151;that the sustainable level of borrowing has gone up&#151;when it said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a>&quot;Bank contacts with the major lenders . . .  suggested that most borrowers could service their loans at a significantly higher repo rate, provided that unemployment did not rise materially&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-16_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>There is another interesting feature of today&#039;s loan market, which needs to be teased out from a rather paradoxical set of statistics. Studies show that the level of household debt is closely associated with the level of household incomes. How does this square with the fact that debt has been rising faster than earnings or incomes? It is partly due to the fact, as I suggested, that the sustainable ratio of debt to income has been rising. But I suspect that it reflects something else as well, which is that some groups are increasing their earnings far faster than the national average, while the earnings of other groups are increasing less than the national average. In other words, the distribution of income is becoming more unequal. That would partly explain the growing gap between the rise of debt and the rise of incomes. I think that the relationship is extremely interesting and deserves further exploration.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>The conclusion of my argument is that we ought not to be too gloomy about the growth of household debt. It does not reflect the collapse of prudence or the decay of civilisation or, more mundanely, even relentless advertising by credit card companies, but merely the fact that with greater security of income, more stable income growth and a wider distribution of home ownership, people can afford to borrow more.

</p>

<a name="40609-16_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>Our public rhetoric, however, continues to emphasise the evils and dangers of falling into debt. Indeed, there has been some evidence of that in this debate. This rhetoric obviously reflects deep-seated moral attitudes. However, the contradiction between our rhetoric and the reality makes it very difficult to have a coherent debate on such topics as top-up fees for universities, for example. The noble Earl, Lord Northesk, mentioned student debt, but the very people who worry about the burden of student debt would not think twice about borrowing much larger sums for other purposes.
</p>

<a name="40609-16_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>The point about borrowing is that it enables you to anticipate your future income. As long as the anticipation is correct, it makes sense to borrow against it. In today&#039;s world, increased borrowing is a sign of success, not of failure.

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>I really would rather be singing from the Labour Benches. I remind the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, that land prices in Oldham have been rising faster than almost anywhere in the country. He seems very lonely on his Bench. Since Wednesday debates are usually for Back-Benchers, I would like to make a point that I have made before. We might have a word with the various Whips to encourage people to speak from the Back Benches. I had asked if I could speak from the Minister&#039;s Bench today. I was told that under the rules of the House, I could sit there, but it would be deemed rather frivolous if I were to speak. So I shall probably now make a frivolous speech.
</p>

<a name="40609-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>Are we so indebted that we need to be worried? Are we on our way to Carey Street, which, as your Lordships will remember, is somewhere near the Old Bailey? We seem to go to the Old Bailey more and more for other reasons. From there, of course, we go to the Clink&#151;Clink being the liberty that could be granted by the Bishop of Winchester. I went to school in Winchester so I have a moderate knowledge about this.
</p>

<a name="40609-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>If we are in that position, the Government should have told us. Alexander Hamilton said that national debt, if not excessive, is to us a national blessing. Sometimes, to encourage or have growth, you need to have debt&#151;you need to borrow and to beat the banks. For years and years, interest rates were way below the rate of inflation and the only way you gained was by buying fixed assets so that you beat the banks. We had no industrial growth and limited real growth in our economy.
</p>

<a name="40609-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>My noble friend Lord Northesk, who is sitting behind me, staring down my neck, will realise that, being an ancient banker, my brief is dated noon today. Last month, the level of mortgage borrowing was &#163;16   billion but there has been a fall this month. It is coming down, the new demands are lower, and mortgage debt is not as worrying as people feel. I shall try to explain why.
</p>

<a name="40609-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>We are a house-owning nation, unlike much of continental Europe, which consists of lease-owning or   renting nations. Throughout continental Europe, when people reached retirement age&#151;I made this point in the Second Reading debate on the Housing Bill so I ask noble Lords to forgive me for repeating myself&#151;people would put their savings into property which they would rent out, knowing that they were in control of their income and would have a regular income which would not go up and down according to interest rates. Noble Lords will remember the time when, in Switzerland, one had to pay 1 per cent for one&#039;s money on deposit. We were never used to having low interest rates, and we thought that savings would be safe in a bank. But you cannot live off your savings.
</p>

<a name="40609-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>I had a very good friend, a wise old man, who said to me, &quot;Malcolm, I have a worry about your government. When you Conservatives first came in, having sold my <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_325"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 325</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

business, I could live on the interest on the interest. The Conservatives managed to reduce inflation and bring interest rates down and, having paid for houses for my family, I found I couldn&#039;t live on the interest itself. So I had to invest&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40609-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>This is what seems to have happened. Most of us realise that you cannot keep up with inflation when inflation is above interest rates&#151;the returns from the bank are negligible. So where does the money go? Some of it went on the stock markets, but they have not performed that well, and a large amount went into asset-earning investments, particularly property. In parallel, one has seen an enormous growth in what is called the venture capital market. That is private money that says it can do better by going into private ventures than by going into a stock market.
</p>

<a name="40609-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>That has distorted our attitude to debt and assets. Average unsecured debt is more than covered by financial assets in the case of a large chunk of the population. However, we have moved from being the cash society of maybe 25 years ago, when only a third of people had bank accounts, to a form of paper-transaction society where few people are paid cash wage packets each week and where 91 per cent of the population has bank accounts. That percentage has tripled in a short period.
</p>

<a name="40609-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>One used to worry that banks took on people without following the historic rules that one must have good references. When I was sitting on the Committee of London Clearing Banks, I would complain that we should not allow people to open accounts unless the references were taken up. The banks would say that the references were not worth taking up. Noble Lords should look at the change. Now one cannot even open a bank account without one&#039;s application going to some security man in the United States and exposing everything. One&#039;s banking secrecy has disappeared. Almost any teller in any branch can look at what is in one&#039;s account and one feels slightly insecure. I am not saying that money is going back under the mattress, because it is not.
</p>

<a name="40609-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>The distortion arises not just from the movement in payment to banks. People do not use banks in the way that they once did; they use plastic or cards. There are 125 million to 150 million cards in issue which go into a machine, which can withdraw money or which one can use for credit. In general, those are what we would call credit cards. Their holders fall into a number of groups. Most of them, surprisingly, pay off their debt each month automatically by direct debit. They know that they are inefficient and they do not want to pay the extra charges that would be incurred. Another group of credit card holders will use them to manage their affairs. When they are going on holiday, they will draw money out of the facility that they have. Almost everyone has a gold card now; platinum has run its course. I do not know what comes next. Those credit card holders will use their card to manage their affairs, sometimes quite efficiently, sometimes not so.
</p>

<a name="40609-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>Then there is another little group which banks and credit card companies do not like. They switch credit cards every month according to when they get a free <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_326"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 326</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

deal and believe that they can make some money on <i>arbitrage</i>. The remainder of card holders, which make up only a relatively small number, often get into debt. That is where the biggest social worry lies. People who have never had a bank account before are now being sold credit on a vast scale. Twenty-five million store cards are now in circulation, where one is encouraged to open an account in the belief that free credit is on offer, but one does not necessarily pay it off. That is a cause for worry.

</p>

<a name="40609-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>Noble Lords have already referred to people who are not used to the whole concept of borrowing and its consequences. I shall give just one of many examples that have been presented to me. A young man in his early 30s, with learning difficulties, decides that he does not want to have a bank account any more. He is unable to maintain a full-time job and is maybe earning the minimum wage. Within six months, because he has learned how to use a computer, he manages to open eight different accounts and obtain a borrowing facility of more than &#163;12,000, of which &#163;10,000 is drawn down with no way of repaying it. He sees another advertisement on the television from an organisation that claims that it will spread out his debt with no charge. He feels that he is secure, but all he is doing is paying a fee each month to that credit agency, which is extending the life of the loan and he is not aware of it. Then, when he finds that he cannot borrow any more money to live on and needs more money, he goes into a bank and asks it to help him become a song-writer. The bank tells him that he can have a business loan. Without interviewing him, it gives him a &#163;5,000 business loan. When I followed the matter back with the many of the agencies and the people concerned, I found that such stories are common. I also found that many people who are granted such facilities are required to pay an extra amount for insurance. The lending agency, if I may call it that, is not necessarily totally exposed; it has cover and it does not have to worry too much.

</p>

<a name="40609-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>My concern, therefore, is for the lower sector of those who are given credit. Some people are being sold credit. I am not suggesting that the Government should legislate, but I wish that people would look at all the advertisements that are being made. One sees 0 per cent on balance transfers being offered to people who are not aware of what APR is. In his reply, the Minister will no doubt tell me about the DTI&#039;s new study on APR. I gather that such a study is being organised, but I have almost forgotten what it involves. However, it would be nice if every offer of credit came with as big a health warning as does a packet of cigarettes. It should be wrong for organisations to be able to sell credit by direct mail, to gain access to mailing lists, or even to advertise it. That is radical, but such credit promotion is increasing levels of personal expenditure.
</p>

<a name="40609-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>However, the ratio of household debt to expenditure is only 23 per cent, which is not desperately high. Our worries are greater than they need to be. My worry is not so much the level of consumer debt, but the level of hidden government debt or off-balance sheet debt. I am not a proponent of PPP or PFI, but when it defers any liability on government balance sheets, I start to worry. When I see that the Government are going to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_327"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 327</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

build nine hospitals this year and 11 the year after, at vast expense, and when I see the expenditure that has to go on the railways, on the roads and on education, I am worried. The level of indebtedness there can rise.
</p>

<a name="40609-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>I have no panacea, but I am just beginning to feel that we have a secure economy. The older generation is recognising that it cannot survive on savings alone, which is why we are seeing remortgaging or equity release. One is realising that as one&#039;s house rises in value, it takes one past &#163;250,000 limit that can be handed on to one&#039;s heirs and successors under current inheritance tax rules. One says to oneself that it may pay in some way to take out a loan that will release equity and help one&#039;s children to buy their own houses or pay student fees. It is a round robin of debt.
</p>

<a name="40609-17_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>I am not worried about it. I am just worried about the Government. I am worried about the consumer only in respect of the store credit cards. In general, I do not think that we shall all end up in the Clink. There are easier ways of doing that. As Kipling said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a>&quot;I am here in the Clink for a thundering drink and blacking the Corporal&#039;s eye&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-17_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>The Government should realise that people historically got into debt on account of drink, and that governments got into debt on account of war. We have had an expensive war that is going to hurt the Government. The drinks scene worries me and an awful lot of people&#039;s eyes are being blacked. The Government should concentrate on what they were put in power to do, and not on surreptitiously increasing the level of taxation and expenditure. I am worried more about the Government than about the house-owner.

<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="40609-18_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Northbrook: </b>   My Lords, I begin by declaring an interest as an investment fund manager. I thank my noble friend Lord Northesk for initiating this important debate. I slightly disagree with the rosy picture painted by the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, in his interesting speech.

</p>

<a name="40609-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>My only disappointment is that the noble Lord, Lord   McIntosh of Haringey, is not responding for the Government on such a major economic issue and that no Labour Back-Benchers have spoken or are in the Chamber. I had hoped that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, would be here, but I wish him well on his trip to an unpronounceable organisation in Paris.
</p>

<a name="40609-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>This is a timely debate. It comes a week after April UK consumer borrowing figures revealed, as many noble Lords have said, that total secured and unsecured lending is now approaching the staggering figure of &#163;1 trillion. That milestone is expected to be reached later in the summer. Other noble Lords have said that secured lending has shown the highest-ever percentage monthly increase, rising by &#163;9.8 billion or 1.2 per cent in April. That total now stands at &#163;810 billion, which, according to Bank of England statistics, is 82 per cent of the total lending outstanding to individuals. The not insignificant figure of &#163;174 billion&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, should take note&#151;or 18 per cent, is categorised as consumer credit. Therefore, the figures show that the secured debt is more than four times the unsecured, but the unsecured is still a significant figure.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_328"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 328</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>The difficult questions to answer are: first, do either the proportion or the actual levels matter? Secondly, should the lenders themselves be alarmed by this? Thirdly, should the Government do anything about the situation in regulation or legislation? I shall deal with each of those in order.
</p>

<a name="40609-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>First, I turn to whether the actual level or proportion of debt matters. If the housing market continues to rise at the current rate, the secured loans will have a satisfactory level of cover. Even if the rate of growth of the housing market is less, at half the current rate of 20 per cent, there will not necessarily be a problem. However, in my view the real difficulties start when there is a sustained fall in property values. In the past this has occurred when interest rates have increased very sharply. At this time I have to say that that situation does not appear so likely, but there are some straws in the wind which could cause interest rates to be raised much more than expected. A sustained increase in the oil price would be one. It should be noted that this was the major cause of our inflationary problems in the 1970s. The inflationary impact of this now is much less than it would have been then as manufacturing plays a much less important role in our economy now and the share of goods in the CPI has fallen from 70 per cent to just over 50 per cent.
</p>

<a name="40609-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>The next straw is the general increase in consumer spending. The Bank of England is focusing heavily on this, which is being financed to an extent by a mixture of mortgage equity withdrawal and consumer credit. I do not think that enough speakers have focused on the problem of mortgage equity withdrawal which, according to the Bank of England, is now running at about 8 per cent of household disposable income&#151;up from nil per cent in 1997&#151;that is, borrowing secured on property which is often used for consumer spending.
</p>

<a name="40609-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>The other straw is the increase in average earnings, which is particularly evident in the private sector in the past six months. The public sector increases of 2002 and 2003 have reversed somewhat although this could still be a problem in the longer term. The combination of these factors, if they continue to increase at the current rate, could mean that we may well get higher interest rates than expected, thereby jeopardising individuals&#039; ability to repay their debt.
</p>

<a name="40609-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>So in reply to the question whether the proportion or the actual amount of debt matters, it is clear that if interest rates rise by an unexpectedly high level, house owners or consumers in debt may be caught out. The area in which they may be particularly caught out, as my noble friend Lord Northesk stated, is the buy-to-let market. Here there has been a huge expansion in the past few years as investors have borrowed at, say, 4&#189;   per cent&#151;which will be rising now&#151;and have been able to let out the properties at, say, a 6 per cent yield while also enjoying a rise in the capital value of their properties. However, as more and more people have seen this opportunity, the net yields on property are declining. According to some commentators in central London they are now at the level of 4&#189; per cent. This <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_329"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 329</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

makes the mathematics much more difficult for the buy-to-let investor and there is a danger that this could be the first part of the housing market to collapse.
</p>

<a name="40609-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>My second question is whether the lenders should be alarmed by the potential scenario that I have just mentioned. If they have lent sensibly on a cautious percentage of the value of the property&#151;say, 60 to 70   per cent&#151;there should not be cause for concern. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that the bad habits of the late 1980s are reappearing, and that even 100 per cent mortgages are being awarded by some lenders. According to the latest Bank of England inflation report, the ratio of house prices as a multiple of earnings stands at 5.7 times&#151;well in excess of the historical average since 1952 of about 3.7 times. Again, as in the 1980s, this can lead to trouble if there is a major hike in interest rates.
</p>

<a name="40609-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>The third aspect is whether the Government should be doing anything about the situation by way of regulation or legislation. While I do not believe that it is correct to interfere in the operation of the housing market, I think it is reasonable that the Bank of England should keep an eye on lending institutions and discourage the granting of 100 per cent mortgages. A publicity campaign could also be initiated on the dangers of borrowing a multiple of more than, say, four times salary. However, in my view, there is no need for legislation.

</p>

<a name="40609-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>In my opinion this is not the case in the area of consumer credit. The debate in April in the other place on the Treasury Committee report on credit card charges contains much of interest on this topic. The honourable Member John McFall reminded the committee that it was 30 years since the passing of the original Consumer Credit Act 1974, and that they were still waiting for a review of it. The problems that he concluded needed to be addressed were several. The honourable Member said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a>&quot;First, important information is buried in the small print and written in technical jargon, which makes it extremely difficult to compare cards&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40609-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>Can the Minister give the House any assurance that the use of larger print will become a regulatory requirement?
</p>

<a name="40609-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>Then there is the problem of the annual percentage rate charged, or the APR as it is known. Providers are at present allowed to calculate the annual percentage rate&#151;the figure most commonly used to compare credit cards&#151;in more than one way. The honourable Member continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a>&quot;The true cost to the consumer of different cards is concealed behind complex interest rate calculation methods, not taking account of the APR, and seemingly unreasonable charges are levied which are sometimes not specified in advance&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 22/4/04; col. 143 WH]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40609-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>With store cards in particular he found a serious problem of lack of transparency. Will the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, confirm the promise made by the Minister in the other place to the honourable Member John McFall that a single method of APR calculation will be introduced by October 2004? There has been an announcement today but I have not had time to digest it. Several Members of the Treasury Committee <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_330"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 330</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

stated how at present it is calculated in different ways by different companies. The Consumers&#039; Association, for instance, identified 10 different methods of interest rate calculation currently in use in the UK credit market.
</p>

<a name="40609-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>Credit card company marketing practices also gave the committee cause for concern. Among these are the receipt of unsolicited credit application forms, some of which offered misleading credit terms. For instance, Barclaycard offered a,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a>&quot;0 per cent for ever offer&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>which the OFT chairman, John Vickers, concluded was completely misleading, and the promotion of it was stopped.
</p>

<a name="40609-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>As the committee reveals, the amount of inquiries received by citizens advice bureaux about consumer debt has increased by 46 per cent in the past three years. I welcome the Government&#039;s establishment of the over-indebtedness advisory group and a cross-ministerial advisory group to look at the issues. I also welcome our own party&#039;s commission set up under the chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Griffiths of Fforestfach to study the whole issue of household debt.
</p>

<a name="40609-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>Other major issues raised in the debate on the Treasury Select Committee report back in April were: clarifying the consequence of making the minimum payment, unsolicited increases in credit limits, not stating the rate of interest and credit card cheques. Of all these the last seems to be the most serious. Apparently, according to the committee, credit card cheques are sent to about 16 per cent of households&#151;5 million in total&#151;and almost every dispatch is unsolicited. If you are unwise enough to bank one of these, debit interest starts accruing immediately even before you start spending the money.
</p>

<a name="40609-18_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>The main venom of the committee was reserved for store cards, which on average, according to the honourable James Plaskitt MP, charge as much as 30   per cent per annum, despite historically low levels of interest rates. For instance, the lending institution GE Capital has not cut its interest rates since 1999.
</p>

<a name="40609-18_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>I want to ask the Minister about the relationship between today&#039;s announcement of a credit industry shake-up and the White Paper that the DTI has produced, which looks forward to a consumer credit market appropriate to the 21st century. The White Paper suggests that a lot of problems that the Treasury Committee has unearthed can be addressed through secondary legislation. What will change as a result? I hope that the Minister will answer that. Also, what definition of &quot;responsible lending&quot; will be used in implementing the White Paper&#039;s proposals? Does the Minister agree that the issuing of credit card cheques is not responsible lending?
</p>

<a name="40609-18_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>Today&#039;s announcement&#151;the standardisation of APR&#151;is to be implemented through secondary legislation. I welcome proposals for the clarification and presentation of different interest rates, or a standard way of calculating interest rates on credit cards. However, consumer groups are worried that the changes are not enough. Doug Taylor, the Consumers&#039; Association spokesman, said that it was concerned <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_331"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 331</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that there would still be loopholes, particularly within the advertising regulations, which may be open to misinterpretation.
</p>

<a name="40609-18_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>Although the Government are not positively encouraging debt, they are certainly discouraging savings by the withdrawal of ACT and the cutting back of the PEP and ISA limits. The scenario that I have painted is much less rosy than that sketched out by the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, and there are serious warning signs on the horizon of things that could come to pass if interest rates were to rise sharply.

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="40609-19_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Newby: </b>   My Lords, I too thank the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, for bringing forward the debate at this time. As a number of noble Lords have pointed out, we either have passed or are about to pass the point at which household debt reaches &#163;1 trillion. Although that is an unimaginable figure in many ways and has no particular practical consequence, it may be an appropriate time to give some thought to whether it matters. The debate has demonstrated that there is no common view at all about whether it matters. We have two groups&#151;the worriers and the optimists.
</p>

<a name="40609-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>The worriers, who include the chairman of the FSA, point to record levels of household debt in relation to post-tax income&#151;now 120 per cent, as opposed to 40   per cent in 1980. As several noble Lords have pointed out, four-fifths of that is secured against depreciating house prices, which, in relation to income, are at levels comparable to those just before the house-price crashes between 1973 to 1975 and 1990 to 1992. There is also growing evidence of debt distress in the form of record personal bankruptcies. The Bank of England&#039;s own analysis suggests that 10 per cent of debtors regard debt as a heavy burden, and that 20 per cent of those with unsecured debt are borrowing to service the loans. On that side of the balance, recent FSA figures show that 6.9 million families are having difficulties with their borrowing commitments&#151;an increase from 6.1 million families the same time the previous year.

</p>

<a name="40609-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>The optimists, of whom the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, is in the van among your Lordships this evening, argue that there has been a shift in the sustainable levels of debt for a number of reasons, which he enumerated. They argue that   the debt-to-income ratio of debt holders is not deteriorating, that the debt-servicing ratios of households are at historically low levels, and that the relationships between secured debt and assets and between unsecured debt and financial wealth cannot depart far from historic averages. For their part, the banks claim to have learnt the lessons of the late 1980s and early 1990s, and to be very careful to assess their customers&#039; ability to pay before making loans.
</p>

<a name="40609-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>In a number of respects, both sides of the argument are right. The difference is about not current facts, but expectations of the future. The worriers emphasise that consumers are taking on debt on the assumption that employment will remain at recent high levels, interest rates will remain relatively low, income growth will remain strong and house prices will remain high. The optimists argue that those fears are misplaced.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_332"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 332</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>There is also confusion in the debate, in that there are two distinct debt problems, both of which have been discussed. First, there are the minority of borrowers, mainly in low-income households, who are in severe difficulty with debt. Analysis shows that the most serious problems relate to unsecured debt and families in social housing. That is a very different problem from that of the home buyer borrowing over the odds to get a foothold on the home-ownership ladder. Debt as a manifestation of poverty is a real issue.
</p>

<a name="40609-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>The other debt problem is potential rather than actual. Continuation of comfortable balance sheets of households with big mortgages depends on the absence of a serious crash in house prices, plunging substantial numbers of people into negative equity. The optimists believe that house prices are being driven up by real and enduring scarcity in the housing market, caused by more and more people and households chasing seriously constrained increases in the housing stock. That was one of the main conclusions of the Barker report. They also believe that, barring some major unforeseen shock, policies designed to ensure financial stability will ensure low interest rates, low inflation and steady growth without a destabilising housing boom and bust.
</p>

<a name="40609-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>The worriers take a different view&#151;that, although Gordon Brown&#039;s estimable commitments to financial stability may work in aggregate, there can still be boom and bust in asset markets, of which in Britain housing is by far the most important. Just as stock markets see irrational exuberance, so do property markets. On the lending side of the market, a few aggressive lenders are undoubtedly pushing loan-to-value ratios and income multiples into hitherto uncharted territory, leaving their more conservative competitors lagging behind and faced with the dilemma of either following suit or losing market share.
</p>

<a name="40609-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>Whatever the larger banks say about their assessment of potential borrowers, anyone who gets the flood of direct mail that I do, from all kinds of banks of which one has never heard and about which it is difficult to discover very much, cannot believe that they are acting with the degree of responsibility that the British Bankers&#039; Association might wish. With such lenders about, there are undoubtedly ingredients for a potentially unstable asset bubble. It will be clear only with hindsight whether the worriers or the optimists are right.

</p>

<a name="40609-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>It seems to the Liberal Democrats that the fact that we do not have the benefit of hindsight should not mean that we sit on our hands. A problem with the current situation is that the Bank of England worries about a potential house price bubble, but claims that it cannot take action to deal with it because its single policy tool&#151;interest rates&#151;is quite rightly focused on a much broader set of variables than simply house prices. The FSA, the Treasury, the DTI and the OFT all have responsibilities in the area, but there is a danger that primary responsibility is often not desperately clear. In <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_333"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 333</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that is the danger that some measures that could be taken are left untaken, because everyone looks at everyone else to take it.

</p>

<a name="40609-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>Therefore, I would like to make a number of suggestions that, whichever view one takes of the overall borrowing situation, could usefully be implemented. I have two suggestions regarding high and rising debt, as far as individuals, in particular those on relatively low incomes, are concerned.
</p>

<a name="40609-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>The first relates to advice. A number of speakers have mentioned the increasing role that the citizens advice bureaux play in giving financial advice. But they are tightly constrained in what they can say and I believe that there is a need to establish a framework for providing independent, low-cost financial advice supported by the credit providers and the investment industry. The banks and the investment industry are already looking at that area and are doing something, but they are not doing very much and they are not doing it with any great urgency&#151;and they could do more.

</p>

<a name="40609-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>Secondly, it would be sensible to widen the remit of the social fund to permit an emergency short-term lending fund for low-income families in financial crisis. That would be a failsafe measure which, it is hoped, would not be needed in the vast majority of cases. However, as the case mentioned by one noble Lord   about a man who committed suicide demonstrated, we are talking about issues that have fundamental impacts on the ability of households to live normal lives.
</p>

<a name="40609-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>The second raft of changes that are needed relate to the way in which the banks operate. First, I agree with the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, that there should be a credit health warning on the tidal wave of unsolicited credit promotion that we are all bombarded with. I am not sure what the research evidence is on the health warnings on cigarettes, but I cannot believe that it has no impact whatever. Secondly, regarding low-income households in particular, there needs to be a crackdown on exploitative loan sharks. It is an area that is very much within the remit and focus of the review of consumer credit, but as we have debated previously in your Lordships&#039; House, the pace at which that review is being undertaken leaves much to be desired. It would be sensible if the often hidden penalties for the early redemption of debt were ended, because that would encourage people when they are in a position to reduce their debt to do so without incurring financial penalty.
</p>

<a name="40609-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>There needs to be stronger enforcement of OFT rules to prevent abuse associated with misleading advertising by debt management and advice services and excessive interest rates on store and credit cards undoubtedly need to be more rigorously policed by the competition and trading authorities. There has been some debate about the proposals on simplifying APR and making that clearer. That is a sensible step, but I doubt whether it goes far enough. I hope that it would be possible one day to produce with every financial product sold the equivalent of the sheet that one receives when one obtains a medicine, to which the drug companies devote enormous effort. It describes what the drug is, what its ingredients are, what it might <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_334"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 334</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

do to you and what the side effects are. One does not have the equivalent of 20 pages of minute print in a packet of aspirin, but something that describes the key features of that drug. That kind of document is almost entirely lacking in financial services products&#151;not least, because, while the drug companies have to go though immensely rigorous procedures to make sure that the information on that piece of paper is correct, that piece of paper is sadly missing in many financial services products.

</p>

<a name="40609-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>Finally, there is the question of, as it were, macro management of credit, where we have three suggestions. First, we believe the Government should publish and monitor, along with the Bank of England and the FSA, measures of sustainable household debt along the lines of the Government&#039;s fiscal rules. The Government have clear rules about what should be happening to taxes. They should have equally clear views on what are sensible measures of sustainable household debt.
</p>

<a name="40609-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>Secondly, there should be guidance to banks on safe loan-to-value ratios and income multiples for mortgage borrowers based on independent assessments of asset values by a group operating in a similar manner to the Bank&#039;s Monetary Policy Committee.
</p>

<a name="40609-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>Finally, there is scope for the active use of reserve deposits to reduce destabilising boom and bust in mortgage lending. I realise that this last point is extremely controversial within the banking fraternity&#151;indeed the Bank of England claims that in the multinational world in which we operate and in global liberalised capital markets it is virtually impossible to do that. But frankly, given that there is a raft of regulations of which the rules about solvency ratios are but one, it is worth looking at the option of adjusting ratios to reflect the state of asset markets and, therefore, the risk of loans.
</p>

<a name="40609-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>There are a raft of proposals that we believe make sense, whether one is an optimist or a pessimist about prospects for household debt. I hope that the Government might adopt them.

<a name="40609-20_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, the timing of my noble friend Lord Northesk is immaculate. He has allowed us to debate the increase in personal debt at the very time that the debt is hurtling towards the &#163;1 trillion mark&#151;and many noble Lords have referred to that. It is not, as the noble Lord, Lord Newby, said important in its own right, but breaching such a major hurdle has a totemic significance.
</p>

<a name="40609-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>I believe that this debate is important because the rising level of personal debt creates dangers for the economy in the short term, dangers for long term savings and it has particular dangers for individuals. The bottom line is that the financial well-being of our country is under threat. I am not too gloomy, but I am considerably more circumspect than the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, and I am an unashamed &quot;worrier&quot;, to use the terminology of the noble Lord, Lord Newby.

</p>

<a name="40609-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>I was slightly alarmed by my noble friend Lord   Selsdon&#039;s introduction with his desire not merely to join the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, on the Cross Benches, but to cross the Floor completely and sit with the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham.
</p>




<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="40609-20_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Selsdon: </b>   My Lords, that was only because I thought that he was lonely.
</p>




<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="40609-20_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, indeed. That was a kind thought of my noble friend, but I will say that when his speech was developed I was not quite so alarmed. That is not to say that I agree with all that he said, as he will find out as I continue my speech, but I agree with him about the build up of debt among those who are relatively illiterate in financial terms, which was also mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Newby.
</p>

<a name="40609-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>Secured lending has been growing at an annual rate which topped 15 per cent at the end of last year. That has contributed to house price inflation, which has been running at well over 20 per cent. The ratio of house prices to average annual earnings is now its highest in 50 years and shows no sign of letting up. Does that matter? I am sure that it matters to individuals. First time buyers find it increasingly difficult to afford house ownership, particularly in high cost areas such as the south-east&#151;and we heard some of the problems that the buy-to-let market is causing in the housing market.
</p>

<a name="40609-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>But as well as the impact on individuals it also matters to the economy overall, because the personal finances of those individuals are becoming more exposed to the cost of debt servicing. It has often been argued, as it has this evening, that the interest burden as a proportion of household income is at low levels and is considerably lower than in the early 1990s when house prices peaked. That is true, but the forward projection of total debt servicing costs, including principal repayments, prepared by the Bank of England, shows that with current interest rate expectations the ratio will rise and will possibly even exceed that experienced at the previous peak.
</p>

<a name="40609-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>At that level, we could see a major house price correction. I do not say that it is inevitable that we shall have a house price bubble with the serious consequences that we experienced on the previous occasion. I agree with my noble friend Lord Northbrook on that. However, I do say that it is a plausible outcome and one about which I hope the Government have done some serious thinking.
</p>

<a name="40609-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>The proportion of income which has to be diverted to service debt has an impact not only on house prices but also on the amount available for consumption. Since 1997, household consumption has been an increasing proportion of GDP, rising from 61 to 65 per cent in 2003, and that increase has shown no sign of abating. We can see a strong correlation between the growth in household consumption and the growth in secured borrowing and, in particular, in the levels of mortgage equity withdrawal.
</p>

<a name="40609-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>The Chancellor&#039;s latest projections for GDP growth show that increasing private consumption will continue to be the biggest single element of GDP <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_336"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 336</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

growth. Let us suppose, just for the sake of argument, that householders thought that, with rising debt service costs, they had to borrow less and spend less. Even the Chancellor in the previous Budget conceded that the biggest downside risk in the UK was consumer spending. I suggest that it is quite plausible that fairly soon householders will hit a point at which they will check back on their spending and, therefore, potentially impact the consumption element of GDP.
</p>

<a name="40609-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>The latest Budget arithmetic shows that the Chancellor&#039;s golden rule has a headroom of 0.1 per cent. If consumers spend less and if growth falls away, will the golden rule be breached; or, perhaps even more likely, will the golden rule be met but with further tax rises to meet the gap?
</p>

<a name="40609-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>When the Minister responds this evening, I hope that he will say what levers the Government have to deal with rising debt. The Government have placed the most powerful lever&#151;the interest rate&#151;in the care of the Bank of England. The Bank of England remit, as we have heard, is to achieve a particular inflation figure, which the Government have perversely constructed using the index of consumer prices so that the impact of house prices is ignored, as my noble friend Lord Northesk has already pointed out.
</p>

<a name="40609-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>The Bank of England is required by Section 11 of the Bank of England Act to support the Government&#039;s economic policy, as well as to achieve monetary stability. The Government are entitled, under Section   12 of the Act, to tell the Bank of England what their economic policy is. To date, the Government have chosen only to tell the Bank to achieve,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a>&quot;high and stable levels of growth and employment by raising the sustainable growth rate and creating economic and employment opportunities for all&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>Will the Minister say whether the Government continue to regard that as an adequate instruction to the Bank? Do the Government have no policy towards personal debt or asset prices to which they believe the Bank should have regard? My noble friend Lord   Campbell of Alloway alluded to that problem. He also pointed out the extra problems that we would have if we yielded further control to Brussels, as the draft constitution currently permits. Perhaps I may be permitted a small digression along with that of my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway. That is, of course, another very good reason to say &quot;no&quot; to the euro. But let us return to the matter of personal lending.
</p>

<a name="40609-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>I have dealt with the subject of secured lending, but the position on unsecured lending is much the same and it is also a real problem in the making. It is clear that unsecured lending growth has contributed to consumption, quite possibly at levels that are not sustainable. But my concerns about unsecured lending, which is a much smaller proportion of the total, have far more to do with the impact on individuals than the impact on the economy overall.
</p>

<a name="40609-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>We know that the debt to disposable income ratios have been rising strongly and are now at 130 per cent or more&#151;way above the previous peak a decade or so ago. I do not believe that that can simply be explained <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_337"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 337</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

by distribution, as the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, attempted to argue earlier. The increase is very much more significant than distribution would probably allow for, but I think that it is worth looking at in more detail.
</p>

<a name="40609-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>However, the real problem is that the ratio is far higher for the poorest households, and it is those households that are most likely to be in arrears. They are the ones that are much more likely to be paying the high interest rates on credit cards and store cards. My noble friend Lord Northbrook spoke eloquently about many problems in this regard. Around 3 million households&#151;an astonishing number&#151;rely on the services of money lenders, who of course are not known for their bargain rates of interest.
</p>

<a name="40609-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>As we heard from my noble friend Lord Northesk and others, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux has been reporting a rising level of inquiries relating to consumer debt, and the statistics on arrears and problem debts are on a rising trend. Behind those statistics are human tragedies. The poor, in particular, find it easy to slip into debt levels which they cannot sustain. We were reminded of that recently when an 84 year-old pensioner managed to run up a &#163;30,000 credit card debt, despite the fact that her pension was less than &#163;80 a week.

</p>

<a name="40609-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>I know that there are no easy answers on this. The response of my party has been to set up a Debt Commission, chaired by my noble friend Lord Griffiths of Fforestfach. The commission has only just started its work, and it is too soon to say what its findings will be. But I believe that the existence of the commission, which draws together both the commercial and voluntary sectors, is a constructive response.
</p>

<a name="40609-20_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>The obverse of rising debt is low levels of savings. The Government have presided over a debt boom and a savings crash. The savings ratio is at about half the level of the one that the Government inherited. In the six years to 1997, the ratio was never lower than 9.3 per cent, but in the following six years it has never risen above 6.7 per cent and is now considerably lower.
</p>

<a name="40609-20_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>The Government not only have no effective savings policies; they have also systematically set about undermining the savings culture that they inherited. We have the infamous &#163;5 billion annual raid on pension funds, which is one of the major causes of today&#039;s pensions crisis, and that, in turn, has led to a loss of confidence in savings for pensions. The Government abolished the popular PEPs and TESSAs and replaced them with ISAs. But they worried about those becoming too popular and so they have now set upon a policy of squeezing them out of existence. The latest statistics show that they are, indeed, being successful in doing that.

</p>

<a name="40609-20_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>I say to the Government that a set of policies that encourages personal debt while discouraging savings is the worst kind of short-termism. The Government might well get their GDP figures shored up in the short term but the problems that they are storing up for the future are considerable. They are, in my view, unbalanced and fundamentally unsustainable policies, and they are not policies that a Conservative government would pursue.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_338"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 338</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-20_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>I cannot finish without reflecting on the role of the Government&#039;s economic management in setting the climate for personal financial decisions. The Government have embarked upon a debt-supported spending spree. We have seen the amount that the Government expected to borrow last year rise from the &#163;10 billion forecast before the last election to &#163;37.5 billion, as set out in the previous Budget Statement. The Chancellor expects to borrow another &#163;157 billion over the next five years. That is without counting the off-balance sheet debt of which my   noble friend Lord   Selsdon reminded us. My right honourable friend Oliver Letwin has rightly described the Chancellor as the &quot;credit card Chancellor&quot;. His Budgets are &quot;spend now, pay later&quot; Budgets. It is hardly surprising if the electorate follows suit.
</p>

<a name="40609-20_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>Seven years of Labour Government have been characterised by economic prosperity, brought about in large measure by the strong economy that they inherited in 1997. But, in my view, that is under threat. If personal debt levels continue to rise, it will not take much to push our economy out of its comfortable trajectory. That will be bad for the economy and a tragedy for some individuals. Those are the dangers of which these Benches have been warning. To date, in reply we have had complacency from the Benches opposite. I hope that this evening the Minister will give a more convincing response.

<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="40609-21_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham : </b>   My Lords, the whole House is grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, for introducing this debate, which has provoked some interesting contributions. The division that has been identified between the gloom-mongers and those who are more optimistic is a fair analysis. My joy this evening is that what has always been defined as the gloomy science of economics has had the most optimistic and constructive perspective put on it from the outstanding economist present in the House, the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky. At one stage I thought that he was going to render my response to the debate otiose. He covered so much of the ground.
</p>

<a name="40609-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>In response to one point made by the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, on whether the distribution of income and resources has been skewed, and whether some are getting more rapidly better off and others poorer, I thought he might give us some credit for the numbers of children who have been taken out of poverty, which has been the result of constructive policies by the Government. We need to address ourselves to what has been recognised on all sides as certain extreme aspects of the economy about which we need to be concerned.
</p>

<a name="40609-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>First, it is clear that low-income families are more vulnerable to loan sharks and to the high cost of credit than others. In a moment, I shall turn in more detail to the measures that have been announced today, and which were the subject of the contribution from the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon. I want to reassure him on that front. Secondly, I shall refer to the wider reaches of the lending industry and the necessity of reigning in some of that by making consumers more aware of their rights and providing clarity of information. I want to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_339"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 339</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

comment on that in a little more detail. I believe that we are on common ground on those two points. Measures need to be taken and I emphasise that that is what the Government believe too.
</p>

<a name="40609-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>On the more general issues, it would not be surprising to the House if I did not place myself firmly among, not the optimists but, the realists who recognise that this is a secure economy which has a base, as the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, identified, that changes the terms of some of these arguments. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, emphasised the problems of the decline in the savings ratio. Of course, there has been a decline. People feel more secure.
</p>

<a name="40609-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>The reason why they borrowed under the previous administration was that they had to guard against the shocks and difficulties of an insecure economy, not least of which were the levels of unemployment at that time that could strip away a household&#039;s income. The fact that the people today are prepared to reduce their savings ratios is a reflection of the fact that they have faith in the Government&#039;s handling of the economy. They have the experience of certain aspects of the economy working very much to their advantage, not least, of course, the fact that we have the highest numbers of people in work that this country has ever known.
</p>

<a name="40609-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>Although the contribution by the noble Earl, Lord   Northesk, was on the more pessimistic fringe, he was very fair about certain aspects of debt&#151;certainly on credit card debt. We should recognise that the vast majority of people who incur credit card debt, and who add to the total, meet their monthly commitments. They borrow at a negligible rate of interest&#151;I am sure that this is a position shared by all in this House&#151;and they borrow in an entirely responsible manner. They take out three to four weeks&#039; credit and meet their obligations at the end of that time. That accounts for the majority of our fellow citizens. Although that may lead the noble Baroness to be dreadfully concerned about the overall levels of debt reaching proportions that we have not known before, that may be a reflection of the fact that people have security about the economy as a result of direct experience, and that enables them to take on such obligations without fear.
</p>

<a name="40609-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Northesk, also excoriated the Government&#151;I cannot repeat his phrase with total accuracy&#151;for shifting the inflation targets. The Government gave the Bank of England the new inflation targets&#151;CPI at 2 per cent&#151;to improve the quality of the targets and to help to ensure that inflation expectations in the UK remain in line with those in the euro area. CPI is a more comparable measure of inflation internationally. It represents international best practice. Adoption of the CPI enables a more direct comparison between inflation rates in the UK and the euro area. I do not believe that the Government have anything for which to apologise. It is not a matter of fiddling with the inflation rates at all, but choosing a more accurate, an effective and an appropriate measure.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_340"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 340</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>The noble Earl also suggested that the Government were selling pensioners short. I have already mentioned that children have been taken out of poverty. Over 400,000 pensioners between 1997 and 2001 have been taken out of relatively low income, after housing costs. Pensioners are, on average, &#163;13.50 a week better off with pension credit and other measures&#151;than if the earnings link had been in place since 1997. The poorest third of pensioners are around &#163;26 a week better off. So I refute the charge that the Government have not responded to   the needs of pensioners. I can assure the noble Lord that the Government are certainly committed to ensuring that all pensioners are able to share in rising national prosperity.
</p>

<a name="40609-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>Finally he suggested that the reason why individuals were getting into debt was because they were aping a profligate Chancellor. I can assure the House that the Chancellor is not profligate, but is following extremely realistic perspectives. Tomorrow various elections are taking place and there may be a number of shocks for established parties, as is being reflected in the press&#151;I notice the anxiety on the other side. But what is it about our present political culture that is often commented upon? It is that individuals do not have the highest possible regard for their political leaders and leadership. Suddenly to suggest that the whole country is pursuing particular strategies with regard to household incomes because they are out to ape the Chancellor, is a very odd concept indeed. They would be acting with some probity if they followed him, but I doubt whether we are in a position to claim that particular form of emulation.
</p>

<a name="40609-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell, put these issues into the context of the European Community. I was grateful for that. I am not in a position to deal with that in a debate that is so limited&#151;we shall need another debate before we address ourselves to the fundamental questions of European membership to which he referred. Suffice it to say that, as far as the Government are concerned, our membership of the European Community is certainly showing us in a very strong economic light, often to the envy of our European colleagues.

</p>

<a name="40609-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>We do not underestimate the fact that there are challenges ahead, but it is scarcely for me in this debate to respond to the issues of the European constitution. This was ground that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, was keen to drag me onto, but I feel I cannot do justice to that aspect of the debate given so many other issues directly related to the main topic before us.
</p>

<a name="40609-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, was kind enough to suggest that I might be lonely on the Government Benches: who could be lonely when accompanied by the noble Lord, Lord Evans, as a helpmeet in these circumstances? I also heard what the noble Earl, Lord   Northbrook said. We all miss my noble friend Lord McIntosh who normally responds to these debates, but he is unable to be here today. He cannot fulfil every conceivable obligation in government, so from time to time the House will have to put up with a rather doubtful substitute.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_341"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 341</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>What I did appreciate about the contribution of noble Earl, Lord Northbrook, was his suggestion that there were limits to what the Government could do with regard to lending. He is right in those terms and it would ill-behove members of the Opposition to suggest that their position, having put their thinking-caps on, is that the only way we can extricate ourselves from what they define as a crisis, because of the level of our household debt&#151;but which the Government of course deny is in those terms at all&#151;is through a significant government action.
</p>




<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="40609-21_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for giving way. Can he remind me which noble Lord referred to this as a crisis?
</p>




<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="40609-21_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I have exaggerated by using &quot;crisis&quot;, and I withdraw that particular word. I bring again as evidence into this debate the prospect the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, indicated he had already heard; namely, a certain amount of pessimism. All of that emanated, as I saw it, from the Opposition Benches. I do not think the noble Baroness did anything to lighten the gloom when we were able to have her contribution on that perspective.
</p>

<a name="40609-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>I want to assure the noble Earl, Lord Northbrook, and also the noble Lords, Lord Newby and Lord   Selsdon, that we have been concerned today to make announcements on the question of consumer credit. We certainly are taking steps to ensure that there is one measure of APR. I do not know how big the print will be that justifies this; but I do recognise the importance of the small print problem when people are not aware of the nature of the contract that they have signed.
</p>

<a name="40609-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>Our announcement today is concerned with producing the first move in a set of regulations in the Government&#039;s shake-up of the consumer credit market. It is only a first move and does not implement the whole of the White Paper. I was asked on one occasion in the House whether legislation would follow the White Paper: well, it may do, but we can do a certain amount of constructive good based upon the propositions in the White Paper through regulation. That is the aspect we have introduced today.
</p>

<a name="40609-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>The new requirements will tighten up credit advertising so that consumers will be better able to compare products; and it will also introduce a standard way of calculating the APR, which will mean that when an APR appears in an advertisement it must always be more prominent than all the other financial information. The most basic facts will, therefore, be clear to the consumer.
</p>

<a name="40609-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>I do not pretend that the latter will solve all the problems of consumer lending. We know there are the vulnerable and we also know that we could all become vulnerable to certain seductive literature submitted through the post. However, today we are introducing a clear approach to cardinal issues which are critical to the consumer. I give way.

Nevertheless, the noble Lord contributed to certain elements of gloom about the present position, which I want to refute. I want to refute another area of significant concern which was mentioned today; that is, the housing market.

</p>

<a name="40609-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>There are problems with certain aspects of the housing market. Borrowing against an asset which is being enhanced does not appear to me to be a major problem in the economy, but we must certainly have regard to first-time buyers. That is why we commissioned the Barker review and from that have developed a whole series of proposals which will be brought to fruition to meet the mismatch between the demand for and the supply of housing.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>We all recognise why it is difficult to generate a rapid response in terms of supply with regard to housing, but we also recognise that with the increase in the number of households&#151;an important factor in regard to housing demand&#151;we need to think more seriously about extending house building and house building opportunities. That is the burden of the Barker review and it is the basis on which the Government intend to act in order to relieve some of the pressure upon the housing market.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>Against the background of a strong economy, judicious action to look after the most vulnerable and our concern as regards fundamental issues such as the housing market, I emphasise my view that the Government should not be complacent about personal debt. That is why action has been taken today in the way I have described. There is a whole range of other fundamental actions being taken by government. We are in the position which was summed up so much more accurately than I can by the noble Lord, Lord   Skidelsky; namely, that, because of changes in the structure of the economy and legitimate changes among our people regarding expectation, what 15 or 20 years ago might have been looked upon as potential for very serious problems as regards the economy will not manifest in those terms. Far from it; what we have are aspects.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>Let me give one obvious illustration. The proportion of homes repossessed by lenders is at a historically low level. The current position does not represent a very stark contrast with the position which I think the Official Opposition this evening were prone to describe. That was the position of 15 or 20 years ago with the appalling consequences of the housing crash. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_343"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 343</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I maintain that the strength of our economy is such that no such crash will be repeated this time. The Government are acting judiciously and are in control of the situation. We recognise that there is no room for complacency, and that action needs to be taken in certain crucial areas.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>Nevertheless, we are also appreciative of the fact that alarm and gloom should not be spread against a background of a rising economy&#151;one in which there has been considerable prosperity in recent years&#151;where the majority of people take judicious decisions on the handling of their household incomes and wealth.
</p>




<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="40609-22_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Selsdon: </b>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, I wonder whether he could help me&#151;not necessarily today at this moment. I have been asked if I could produce a comparison between government borrowing and consumer borrowing on a like-for-like basis. Perhaps the Minister can send me a short letter stating, for example, that the level of consumer borrowing today is &quot;this&quot; and that the level of government borrowing is &quot;that&quot;. It would be a sort of simple comparison, because both sides have a right to know.
</p>




<p><a name="st_120"></a>

<a name="40609-22_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Northesk:</b>  My Lords, I am hugely grateful to all my noble friends&#151;I still prefer to include the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, among their number&#151;for their contributions to the debate.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>It has been a delight to listen to everyone&#039;s comments. In fact, in contrasting the speeches of the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, and other contributions, albeit to varying degrees and from varying directions, I detected a degree of consensus. It strikes me that we are all agreed that of itself personal debt does not constitute an immediate threat to the economy. We are all much more concerned about its current impact in individual cases. Importantly, there are concerns as to what the potential outcomes of the current trends in the statistics, if sustained, might be.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>To that extent the delineation of the noble Lord, Lord Newby, between the worriers and optimists was accurate. In so far as concerns gloom, it centres around anxieties as to whether the Government are properly focused on these trends.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>Having articulated both sides of this coin to the benefit of the Government and the Treasury, tonight&#039;s proceedings have, I believe, been extremely useful. Of course, now is not the time to rehearse the debate in its entirety. Once again, I am hugely grateful to all noble friends who have spoken. It only remains for me to beg leave to withdraw the Motion for Papers.

<a name="time_31"></a>
<a name="40609-22_time1"></a><h5></h5>


<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="40609-22_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Andrews </b>   rose to move, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 4 May be approved [<i>18th Report from the Joint Committee and 8th Report from the Merits Committee</i>].
</p>




<p><a name="st_123"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, we believe these regulations recognise changing times and changing expectations. They also deal with issues that are by definition sensitive and controversial and to which the Government have sought, after long and hard reflection, to do justice.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>In 1990 this House agreed the current provisions for the information which the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority can give to donor-conceived adults. The provisions were right for their time. The 1990 Act enabled the HFEA to construct a register and provide the following limited information, if asked by a donor-conceived adult: whether the person might be related to someone they intend to marry; and, at age 18 or over, whether the HFEA&#039;s register showed them to be donor conceived.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>Those were entirely sensible provisions in their day. But over the past 13 years it has become apparent that in adulthood some donor-conceived people find those provisions inadequate and insufficient. Some have said, for example, very poignantly that not being able to find out about their origins has left them with a gap in the way they see themselves, a gap in their identity, in their ability to tell their own story&#151;and we are, after all, story-telling animals&#151;and an inability to make complete sense of their lives.

</p>

<a name="40609-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>By 2010, about 40,000 donor-conceived children will have been born&#151;and by 2023, about 60,000 such children. This is an issue for the House today because in agreeing the provisions in 1990, Parliament anticipated the possibility that, as time passed, more information might be sought and might need to be given. The Act had a regulation-making power in Section 31 to enable us to do this, and for the past three years we have been considering and consulting how best to do so. We feel it is now time to end the uncertainty, to make good that anticipation and, in particular, to reflect the paramount rights of the child in these provisions as we are seeking to do consistently in many other aspects of law and practice.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>There are two aspects to the regulations&#151;non-identifying and identifying. Under the regulations before us today, a donor-conceived person aged 18 or older will be able to obtain a list of non-identifying information about their donor from the HFEA if they ask for that information and if that information is on the HFEA&#039;s register&#151;which began in 1991. Given the lapse of time, the first 18 year-olds will be eligible to ask for this information in 2010. By that time, the information on the register might be slightly limiting, depending on what the donor was asked to provide at the time of donation. In respect of donors who register with a clinic on or after 1 July of this year, a comprehensive set of non-identifying information will be collected from fertility <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_345"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 345</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

clinics by the HFEA. This is listed at Regulation 2(2)(a) to (h), and for example includes physical features, ethnic group, religion, occupational interest, and a pen portrait of the donor.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>The second element in the regulations enables donor-conceived people born from gametes or embryos donated on or after 1 April 2005 to obtain identifying information about their donor from the HFEA when they reach age 18 or later. That is set out in paragraph 3, and includes the name, date of birth and last known postal address. We fully recognise that this is a highly sensitive issue. There is an ethical as well as a practical need to balance the rights of the child with the rights of the donors who make such an invaluable gift of life. We have concluded after an extensive public exercise and consultation that it is right that in the future donor-assisted young people should have these new rights. We have every expectation that they will grow up in loving and happy families. However, just as some other countries have concluded, we also feel that they should have the right to access information about their origins which will help them, if they so choose, to complete their life history.

</p>

<a name="40609-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>Among the bodies which support the decision are the Ethical Committee of the BMA and many children&#039;s organisations. This means that the first 18 year-olds to benefit from that information will do so from late 2023. Let me emphasise that the commitment to past donors has been that they will not be identified retrospectively. We respect and will uphold that commitment.

</p>

<a name="40609-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>What has changed since 1990 to make this provision seem so necessary? One thing is that there are some 25,000 donor-conceived children&#151;2,000 are born a year&#151;and we welcome that. Another important cultural change&#151;partly because of the 1990 Act&#151;is that the secrecy and even stigma surrounding assisted conception has faded. Many more people talk much more openly about assisted conception, including donor conception. We celebrate that, and recognise and share the distress that infertility causes. Assisted conception and infertility is no longer so much of a matter to keep hidden, though of course it remains a painful matter, very deeply felt. I also believe that public attitudes towards information and rights to information have changed dramatically. Information now is much more readily accessible than it was in 1991. Information about donors is held on a national database, the register of the HFEA. It is largely collected and stored by the HFEA, but donor-conceived people have no access to it. In a century where access to information is regarded as a personal and political right, this does not seem any longer to be appropriate. It has already proved to be a bone of contention&#151;the Government are very likely to be challenged about the provision of information to donor-conceived people, as the Department of Health has already been in an application brought by Liberty. That application related to the provision of non-identifying information.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_346"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 346</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-22_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>I say again, we have not taken this step without long and serious public consideration. We held a consultation exercise on non-identifying information between December 2001 and July 2002. That process revealed that there needed to be a wider debate on identifying information. These regulations reflect the outcome of this whole process. The responses to the public consultation showed that there was significant support for the non-identifying regulations. There is also considerable, but not universal, support for a move to identifiable donors.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>Let me focus on identifying information since that is what I know noble Lords will want to address. Of the 237   responses received to the public consultation in 2002, 132 were in favour of removing donor anonymity; 70 were against; and 23 were undecided. However, we found that there were relatively few responses from clinics or donors. So, we carried out further work to assess the response of clinics. Forty-five clinics and 140 donors replied. Most, not all, of the clinics did not favour removing donor anonymity. I will come to the reasons for that in a while. However, a third of them made positive suggestions for recruiting identifiable donors in the future&#151;more advertising, with a higher profile, and more and better information. One or two clinics were extremely positive.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>In the light of that, I shall address some of the dilemmas that, I am sure, noble Lords will want to raise. First, will the change to identifying donors lead to a loss of donors, longer waiting lists and more pain for potential families? We recognise the importance of donor sperm or eggs for 7,000 or 8,000 patients each year. We know that clinics will need to recruit at least 200 identifiable sperm donors each year, perhaps double that. They will also have to recruit 1,100 identifiable egg donors. Of the 140 donors who responded, half said that they would be willing to donate again as identifiable donors, if they were able to. We know, of course, that many of them will not be able to, for a range of reasons, but it is a significant and encouraging response, as they were recruited on the firm understanding that they would be anonymous.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>Secondly, although we recognise that there is likely to be a dip in donor numbers&#151;certainly in the short term&#151;evidence from other countries suggests that donor levels will rise again. After Sweden removed donor anonymity in 1985, there was a decline, but research indicates that the decline was later reversed. In Victoria, Australia, identifying information for all donors was required from 1998. A decline was reported, but now donor recruitment is at a level that meets the need. In New Zealand, there has been a voluntary system for identifying donors for some time, and new legislation has recently been introduced to remove anonymity. We are told that the consensus is that the legislation is highly likely to succeed.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>The third reason why we believe that the recruitment of identifiable donors is achievable is that we are doing things differently. We are not aware of any other country that has removed donor anonymity alongside a campaign to raise public awareness and improve the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_347"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 347</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

service. That step forward will put the recruitment and support of donors on a more systematic and reliable basis, which the clinics have wanted.

</p>

<a name="40609-22_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>Since 1990, the National Gamete Donation Trust has become a central point of contact for people wanting information about becoming a donor, and we have funded it for several years. Additional funding has recently been made available for the appointment of a donor recruitment manager. That is a big step forward. She will work with clinics, with the HFEA and with organisations representing patients to improve services for donors and encourage recruitment. The manager is now in post, and we shall make further funding available.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>We will accompany the transition to donor identifiability with a positive, proactive campaign for public awareness of the value of donation, so that we can help clinics to recruit identifiable donors. We are working closely with the British Fertility Society and the National Gamete Donation Trust. We are already discussing ways of using the media to reach potential new donors. Ultimately, we want to see a change in the culture around donation. We want a better service, which not only emphasises the value of the gift made but encourages a different profile of donors and provides additional support and status for donors and donor families. I am reminded of the great book by Richard Titmuss, published some time ago, on the gift relationship. He was talking about blood donation, but this is a gift relationship of a different sort, and we should value it.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>We are taking steps to support clinics and their work. We realise that clinics cannot change from using anonymous donors to identifiable donors overnight. We have given advance notice to clinics of a transitional period from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006, in which clinics will be able to use sperm or eggs donated anonymously before 1 April 2005. From 1 April 2006, when the transitional period will have ended, donations will have to be used on an identifiable basis. There will be exceptions for gametes reserved for the creation of siblings for children already born, which will not be destroyed until the end of their storage period, and embryos created before 1   April 2006 from sperm or eggs donated anonymously before 1 April 2005.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>One of the fears that has been raised is that parents might be deterred from telling their children that they are donor-conceived, but I understand that research soon to be published by Susan Golombok, Director of the Family and Child Research Centre at City University, indicates that more parents are planning to tell their child about donor conception&#151;about 50 per cent intend to do so. The research points out that if parents act on this intention, obviously it is likely that some children, when adults, will want to have information about their donor. Some may wish to have direct contact.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>The fear is that such willingness to be open will be compromised if families are afraid of a much-loved child breaking away to initiate a new and possibly destructive relationship, leading to distress and trauma to the original family. The evidence from <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_348"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 348</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Susan Golombok&#039;s research is that there is greater emotional involvement between both parents and the child conceived by gamete donation than other children. It is a well researched piece of work and, I believe, extremely significant. That evidence seems to militate against such a general possibility.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>At another level, I do not believe, at a time when there seems to be more openness towards relationships, that that trend will be reversed. We are living through a cultural change. We have seen such openness work successfully in recent years in relation to adoption. Research in Sweden, where donor anonymity was removed in 1985, showed that more parents told their children about their origins in the period 1992&#150;97 than in the period 1986&#150;92, and that about 50 per cent have told, or intend to do so.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>A third source of reassurance comes from the fact that families will not be left to fend for themselves as they consider telling their child. There is a great deal more support available for families to assist them through the process, and there will be more in the future from organisations such as the Donor Conception Network who will put families in touch with each other and, I am sure, will be able to develop the services and support they offer, in terms of information, workshops and so on, in response to the challenge that will be placed upon them.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>The fear that parents may be deterred from telling is related to another: whether donors will be deterred by what has been rather dramatically described as the threat of a knock on their door in 18 years&#039; time. We are giving careful thought to what counselling services might be accessible to donors if a donor-conceived adult expressed an interest in contact. We would expect arrangements for being in contact to adopt the same values and principles as those we are developing through the adoption changes. Those changes were much more radical because they were retrospective, which the contact arrangements are not. There are many details to be worked out for the process to be put in place in 18 years&#039; time. We have time to get it right, and I can pass on an invitation from my right honourable friend the Minister in another place to noble Lords to give their responses, experience and advice on these issues.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>There are two points I want to make clear. First, donor-assisted children who want to seek out the donor will not be able to make any claims on them. The donor will have no legal, social or financial responsibilities. The second is a more intuitive comment. These children are, by definition, much-loved and much-wanted, and in those circumstances it is unlikely that they would seek wilfully to disrupt the donor&#039;s family life. There is some positive evidence: several donor-conceived children in the UK and abroad have traced genetic links through DNA testing. They have not acted, or been met, with hostility. In fact, I understand that much happiness has resulted. Over the past 12 to 15 years in New Zealand, donors have been accepted only if they were prepared to be identified to offspring in the future. In recent years the Sperm Bank of California has <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_349"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 349</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

provided the identity of its first donors to donate under its identity release scheme. We are not aware of any negative consequences that have followed from that.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>We will take stringent steps in the regulations to ensure that donors and donor-assisted people have the fullest possible information and support in whatever decision they take. A donor-conceived adult wishing to ask for information from the HFEA might, for   example, be given an initial leaflet for consideration or be offered appropriate counselling. Another possibility is that they might be offered non-identifying information first, before taking the decision to ask for identifying information. They do not have to ask for all the information, but it would be accessible to them.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>As I have said, donors will be offered extensive counselling before signing up with a clinic to being identifiable. If a donor decides to proceed, his or her information will be passed to the HFEA for storing on its register.
</p>

<a name="40609-22_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>I believe that these regulations are timely. Given that the issues are so difficult, they are appropriate, right and consistent with other aspects of the policy for children. With a strong effort by fertility clinics, sperm banks and support organisations, and with a campaign for public awareness, a better service and a more positive, open culture, I believe that we can steadily attract donors to meet patients&#039; needs and protect the rights of children growing up in a future world where questions of identity are likely to be even more urgent than they are today. I commend the regulations to the House.

<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="40609-23_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for introducing the regulations with her customary clarity and for the sensitivity with which she has addressed what are by common consent quite complicated ethical issues.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>What gives rise to these regulations, however, is not at all complicated but very simple: it is the general principle that openness and access to information is a desirable thing. I think it is certainly true&#151;and here I agree with the noble Baroness&#151;that the climate of the times in which we live favours greater access to information, all other things being equal, than was the case 14 years ago when the HFE Act was passed by Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>In tune with that thought, I am entirely sympathetic to the idea that no person who has been adopted should be denied access to his or her genetic identity or the information that goes with it where such information is readily available. It is a perfectly natural human impulse to want to find out about one&#039;s origins where for any reason these have been concealed. As a result, I have no difficulty with the proposition that donor-conceived individuals should <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_350"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 350</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have access to non-identifying information about the person who donated the sperm or egg which brought them into being. Indeed, I have not heard anyone raise an objection to this idea.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>It will probably be quite surprising to many people that there is no provision for this to happen already when the first donor-conceived individuals on the HFEA register reach the age of 18 in 2010. I, myself, did not previously realise, for example, that but for this order there would have been no provision for anyone to be given details of a donor&#039;s medical history or that of his family. That was a surprise to me. Indeed, there could be circumstances in which such information was relevant and important to a child before he or she reached the age of 18, and I am not at all clear why, if the need arose, these details should not be made available to him or his parents at any time. Perhaps the Minister could comment on that point.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>The more difficult aspect of the order relates, of course, to identifying information. The main fear expressed about this, to which the noble Baroness referred, is that it will lead to a serious fall in the number of donors. The work that has been done by the Department of Health indicates that half of all donors&#151;that is to say, existing anonymous donors&#151;would have been willing to donate sperm or eggs if their anonymity were removed. That, so far as it goes, is mildly encouraging in that it indicates that there are at least some people who do not mind the idea of being identified even though they have volunteered anonymously. However, I would not have thought that it was enough to enable us to be confident about the supply of donations into the future.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>This is a very important issue. About 2,000 couples a year depend on donors in order to conceive. I am aware of how deeply distressing it is for such couples not to be able to have children. If we are to continue to address their needs&#151;as I believe we should try to do&#151;we have a duty to make sure that we do not do anything which would seriously jeopardise the supply of donors.


</p>

<a name="40609-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>The Minister mentioned that the Government intend to mount a campaign to boost the numbers of identifiable donors. It would have been more reassuring if they had carried out some proper market research on that score. I am not aware that they have carried out any beyond the straw poll that I mentioned, which cannot really be said to constitute research.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>There is still a great deal that we do not know. At present, the recommended maximum number of live births per sperm donor is 10. We may find that identifiable donors are not willing to allow their sperm to be used for as many as 10 live births. Bearing in mind that the regulations will potentially allow all their adult genetic offspring to make contact at the age of 18, there could well be a limit to the number of people that they want to find knocking at their front door, as the Minister put it, in 18 years&#039; time or later. That would be a perfectly understandable stance to take.

</p>

<a name="40609-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>The trouble is that we have no idea whether, first, we can recruit the same number of donors that we have previously, or secondly, there is likely to be on average a smaller number of live births emanating from each of them. If, for the sake of argument, the average number of live births per donor fell from 10 to five, the recruitment of donors would need to double from present numbers. How achievable is that? I suspect that that was the reason why so many licensed clinics opposed the removal of anonymity.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>Efforts will also need to be made to recruit more egg donors. A high number of eggs donated&#151;although not more than a third of the total&#151;come from what are termed egg-sharing arrangements; that is to say, where women in receipt of fertility treatment allow some of their eggs to be used to benefit infertile couples. We simply do not know how many women will be prepared to egg-share on an identifiable basis.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>One consideration that may deter women from sharing eggs is that their entire medical history, including the fact that they were in receipt of IVF treatment, could become known to others at some future date. For many women, receiving IVF treatment is still a private and sensitive matter. Many may balk at donating eggs for that reason. If they do, their feelings should be respected.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>The trouble is that if there is a shortage of egg donors, as there may be, some women will find themselves pressurised into agreeing to egg-sharing arrangements and may even do so contrary to their better judgment. I am concerned about whether that would be ethical and I hope that the Minister will tell me that it will be strongly discouraged in GMC guidance.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>If there turns out to be a shortage of either sperm or egg donors, infertile couples will either have to wait longer or else they will go to where they do not have to wait. We could find some couples going abroad to   purchase donor-assisted conception; perhaps to countries with less stringent regulation than we have here. I await to hear from the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, if he is planning to speak&#151;which I hope he is&#151;whether he thinks that that is a possibility. If it is, we should be concerned.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>We need to ask ourselves whether the gain to be derived from discarding anonymity is worth the pain that may ensue. I say &quot;discarding anonymity&quot;, but of course it is not clear how many donor-conceived individuals will be in a position to exercise their right to discover the identity of their genetic parent. The exercise of that right presupposes that such individuals will be informed that they are donor-conceived.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>The Minister spoke of recent research, which was extremely interesting, but a recent study showed that a high proportion of children conceived by donor are never at any stage told that that is how they came into being. We have no idea whether the regulations will have the effect of increasing secrecy or whether they <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_352"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 352</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

will make no difference. They may possibly do the former if parents are resistant to the idea that one day the child may seek out his or her genetic parent. It would have been useful to have some credible market research on that issue, alongside the other questions that I have raised, but we do not have any. We have only what one might call expressions of blind optimism, if that does sound too unkind. I do not think that that is an adequate basis on which to pass laws, especially laws of this nature.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>The Minister spoke about the rights of the child being paramount. It is worth making the point that a child has no absolute right to be told about his origins. He cannot have, otherwise the regulations would have contained a provision to ensure that every relevant child was given this information at the appropriate time. So we are not talking of rectifying the absence of a right that is unconditional but about something that is desirable. Given that, I have to question whether it is wise to allow access to identifying information at this stage. Would it not have been much better to do so only when we were a little more certain what the consequences were likely to be? That would have been the responsible course. However, the Government have closed off that option, and I think that that is a mistake.

<p><a name="st_125"></a>
<a name="40609-23_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for a very thoughtful and persuasive introduction to the debate. If we were to vote on the regulations, it would be a free vote on these Benches. In a sense, I speak as an individual rather than on behalf of my colleagues, although I hope that I represent the views of a considerable number of them.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>There is no doubt that we are debating an issue of considerable importance. Lifting anonymity for sperm, egg and embryo donors after 1 April next year is not something to be undertaken lightly. There was a very interesting debate in the other place. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, set the case against the Government&#039;s proposal and emphasised that a very serious debate needs to take place.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>Effectively, we are setting considerations of the rights of the donor-conceived child, or certain principles relating to those rights, against concerns about the future supply of sperm and eggs for couples who wish to undergo fertility treatment. The bottom line is that I believe that, following the Government&#039;s consultation, the case has been made for lifting anonymity. As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said, there is nothing between anyone, on any side of the House, on the non-identifying information. This debate is all about the identifying information.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>Knowing who one&#039;s biological parents are is part of one&#039;s identity, and it is important to have that information, if it is available. I do not think it is relevant only on medical grounds so it is not adequate to have only the non-identifying information available.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>A sense of identity is extremely important in these circumstances. To some degree, we can debate these matters rationally and scientifically. Having read a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_353"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 353</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

great deal about the subject over the past few days, I feel that a sense of identity is at its core. It is difficult to explain precisely why that should be, but that is where I feel a lot of the argument lies. It is not necessarily a scientific thing to know where you came from, it is partly emotional. It has been said that roots are overstated but I believe that they are very important. There is a sense of loss and frustration when those are not known. It has been recognised, as the noble Earl, said, for adoption purposes. We made great strides with the recent adoption legislation, and I believe that the information should be available for those who are conceived as a result of the donation of eggs and sperm.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a>I was very much taken with a recent article on the Donor Conception Network website; the noble Baroness referred to the organisation. It adds up to the fact that people need to consider and recognise the long-term implications of their decision on donation. The Minister spoke about a gift relationship. It is of course a gift relationship, but it is a responsible one. That is the cultural issue at stake.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a>I was much taken by Walter Merricks&#039;s article, blandly entitled &quot;Ethical Issues&#151;Anonymity&quot;. He asked whether donors who cannot cope with the consequences should be donating. If potential donors do not want to accept the long-term consequences of their donation, is that because they are currently encouraged to think that their act is a simple, uncomplicated and unconnected one, with no consequences and so on? Of course not. We should be encouraging responsible donation. Ultimately, there should be no great conflict in that area. It is fair to remove anonymity, provided that it is not done retrospectively.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, made a valid point about market research and the impact of similar changes in other countries. We need to know about that. Did the level of donation in Sweden return to former levels shortly after 1985? I do not know the answer to that question&#151;I am sure that the Department of Health&#039;s research resources are far greater than mine in terms of the comparisons it can make&#151;but I hope that that was the case.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>The real effect for donor-conceived children will not be seen until 2023, but the effect on couples who may be faced with inability to undergo treatment could be seen much earlier. That needs to be set against the fact that we are speaking about some 220 sperm donors in any single year. Therefore, one of the big questions to ask is what would be the impact of the kind of promotional campaign about which the Minister has spoken. Surely it cannot be beyond the wit of the Department of Health or others involved to increase the number of donors beyond 220 in any one year.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>There are other valid questions to which we do not know the answer. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised the issue of the recommended number of live births from each donor, which is currently set at 10. What will be the impact on that figure when the donations are no longer anonymous? How can we look into the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_354"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 354</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

crystal ball on that? I suggest that we have to do our very best in promoting discussion and a change in culture in the way that the Minister described.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>Of course I understand the reservations of the British Fertility Society and of several clinicians, not least of the noble Lord, Lord Winston, who is not here today. He has gone on record as being against the regulations. Those reservations need to be carefully weighed up, but if the Government are prepared to weigh in with a major campaign to persuade donors to come forward, that would go a long way towards satisfying the pragmatic objections.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>We need a change in the nature of the culture of donation and indeed of parents. I have great respect for the researcher, Susan Golombok, in other contexts. I have not seen the research to which the Minister referred, but I hope that any campaign addresses not just the issue of donors and their willingness to donate, but also that of parents sharing that crucial information with their children at some future date.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>There are a number of other questions to be asked. For example, what would be the budget for such a campaign? We have heard about the principle of the campaign, but what the advertising people call &quot;share a voice&quot; is hugely affected not only by the messages of the campaign, but also by the amount of money spent on it. It does need to be a powerful campaign.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>Although the Minister was setting aside the counselling problem slightly for the future, we need reassurance on how that service would work and would be set up.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>The transition to the new regime will be extremely important. It is also very important that if we make this change in the regulations today, we say that it operates from a certain date. There should be no resiling from the current anonymity of those who have donated on the understanding that it was going to be on an anonymous basis. That is very important as there is a great danger that once one set of rights is given, that situation could change in the future.
</p>

<a name="40609-23_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>Having weighed up very closely&#151;it is an extremely difficult area of ethics&#151;whether the issue regarding future donors is outweighed by the principle that donor offspring should, where they choose, have knowledge of their genetic origins, I come firmly down in favour of the latter.

<a name="40609-24_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Warnock: </b>   My Lords, I greatly welcome the regulations. One of the declared aims of government is to provide equity between children who have been born by donor and those who have been adopted. As has been said, this has become increasingly important now that society as a whole is much more conscious of the importance to an individual of being able to see himself in a wide genealogical and genetic context than was the case 20 years ago. Then, the overriding consideration against supplying identifying information was the fear that the supply of donors would dwindle.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_355"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 355</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a>However, I believe that in any case, even if the supply dwindles temporarily, we need, as the Minister said, a culture change in our attitude to donation. This can be brought about by changing the view taken of infertility, male and female, and of the motives of those who donate, particularly perhaps those who donate sperm.
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>There is no doubt that in the past there was something surreptitious and slightly comic about sperm donors who tended to be medical students who needed money for a pint or something. There was something faintly funny about going off and masturbating and producing sperm and no one really liked to acknowledge that that was done.
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a>However, as has been said, I think that a new kind of donor may well arise who quite definitely makes a donation altruistically. I say anecdotally that I have met three or four men in their forties with children of their own who have decided quite deliberately to become donors because they are filled with sorrow at the thought of what people suffer who really want children and who are infertile.
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a>It seems to me that one should not be too horrified by the thought that five or even 10 people might turn up on the doorstep. Of course, they will not. If they want to find out who their father is in the case of artificial insemination by donor, they will take pains to find that out, and they may or may not want to make contact with that person. However, even if they do, it seems to me that often making contact with your genetic parents when you are an adopted child is far more controversial, and often far more difficult, than making contact with a donor, whether of eggs or sperm, because, after all, the child who is adopted had already been born, and was already given away by the genetic parents. The parents may well have other children and may want to forget all about the child. They may even have concealed its existence from everyone. There may be many cases where an adopted child making contact with his or her genetic parents is very traumatic and does not turn out well at all, whereas I think there is something much less traumatic about the very fact that you are a child of donation&#151;you had not been born when you were, as it were, given away. You never were given away.
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a>The most important thing is in general to overcome the aura of secrecy, which ought by now to have gone away entirely. If, as I believe, providing information about the genetic parent makes it less easy for parents to conceal from their child the circumstances of their birth, that must be nothing but good. If the child has a right to know, the parent who refuses to tell the child that he was born by a donation is really committing an offence. Therefore, the child ought to be accorded the right to know, just as adopted children are.
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a>Secrecy about adoption has almost died&#151;hardly any adopted children do not know that they are adopted&#151;whereas there still are a very large number <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_356"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 356</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of families who try to conceal from their children that they were born by donation. As the noble Earl, Lord   Howe, said, that is partly to do with the still-remaining shame about infertility. Surely we have got over that since 1991. The Act did a great deal to bring the issues into the common domain. I am not sure that so very many people are ashamed to have received IVF; many of them, such as the original IVF people, are intensely proud that they did so. The same is true of male infertility, which is far more acceptable as a concept than it was 20 years ago when it was confused with impotence and people thought it shameful.

</p>

<a name="40609-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a>There can be no moral justification whatever in deceiving a child about the circumstances of his birth. It is a very awkward doctrine to enunciate, considering the number of children born by adulterous relationships. Nevertheless, it is deeply morally wrong to pretend that a child is the son or daughter of a father or mother who is not his or her real biological parent. To insist on pretending shows self-interest on the part of the parents&#151;that they are interested in their own status, not that of the child. It may be deeply traumatic for the child, because children nearly always guess that there is something a bit funny about their birth if it has taken place by donation or they were adopted. To treat a child as though it were a toy or a pet&#151;to suggest that it does not particularly matter where it came from because it is your child&#151;is genuinely immoral.
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a>The whole opening-up of the issue will encourage parents to realise that they must not conceal from their children the true facts of their origin. We all know that there may turn out to be medical factors that make it quite essential that they know. For instance, if the social father develops Huntington&#039;s Chorea, the child must be told that he is at no risk. Quite apart from those considerations, not to tell the child is simply to use it as a means to the parent&#039;s satisfaction&#151;to refuse to allow him to see himself as the individual whom he is. On the grounds that that will be less easy in the new open atmosphere, I greatly welcome the regulations.

to a matter of market research, as the noble Earl, Lord   Howe, argued earlier. The evidence is pretty clear&#151;there was a report only this morning from the Netherlands which said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a>&quot;A new law that requires sperm donors to be identifiable has come into force in the Netherlands, resulting in a dramatic drop in the number of men coming forward to donate&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a>So we do not need market research to tell us what the consequences may be. The report continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a>&quot;Women wanting to obtain sperm from Dutch sperm banks are now apparently facing up to two years on a waiting list, since even before the new rules took effect on 1 June.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a>The law, which was passed after 10 years of deliberation, says that Dutch fertility centres can no longer take anonymously-donated sperm samples, and stipulates that all donor-conceived children will be able to find out the identity of their biological father at the age of 16. One Dutch clinic, in Barendrecht, says that the number of sperm donors on its books has fallen, in anticipation of the new law, from 135 to only 15. Dr Jan Karbaat, from the Bijdorp clinic, said, &#039;I have just placed an advertisement for donors, but got zero reactions&#039;, adding that his clinic is considering offering payments for donations.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a>According to reports, a number of Dutch women who want to use donated sperm in order to have a child are crossing the border to Belgium, where donation can still take place anonymously&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40609-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a>So the evidence is quite clear. What we are doing tonight does not require market research. Nevertheless, what the Government are doing is right for the kind of reasons that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, has outlined. Although he knows that I fundamentally disagree with his party&#039;s decision to support as a matter of policy motions on issues such as abortion, embryo experimentation, therapeutic cloning and euthanasia, I greatly respect the position that he personally took in your Lordships&#039; House this evening and I agree with everything that he said.

<a name="40609-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a>Why is it then that these regulations do not operate retrospectively? If there is a principle here, then it is a principle and it should not just be about what happens to those who are born in the future. What about those who have been born in the 14 years that have elapsed? Why is it that a child born using gametes or embryos donated before 1 April 2005 will not be able to know the identity of his or her biological parents, whereas a child born using gametes or embryos donated after 1   April 2005 will be able to find out? That strikes me   as inherently unfair and the noble Baroness, Lady   Andrews, was right to remind us of the retrospectivity that is operated in the case of adoption. Why should the same principle not operate here? We cannot have it both ways. It is fundamentally illogical in what we are agreeing tonight. We do not need market research to tell us about the implications of this and we need to face these matters four square.

<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>While reading the Standing Committee debate from another place, I was struck by how much time was spent on discussing the effects of these regulations on the donors, patients and fertility clinics, which of course have a deep interest in all this. But, important as those considerations are, one could not help but think: what about the children?
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>Many of the arguments against full and retrospective disclosure of identifying information fail to demonstrate sufficient regard for the child&#039;s welfare, as set out in Section 13(5) of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. They are more concerned with protecting the personal relationships and feelings of the biological and legal parents. Such issues should be resolved prior to couples seeking infertility treatments and prior to individuals agreeing to donate gametes and embryos. We must face this issue squarely in advance of people having such treatments.
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a>During the Standing Committee debate in another place, concern was expressed about the potential impact that donor identification might have on donor recruitment&#151;a point reflected in our debate tonight. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_359"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 359</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

That must be a secondary consideration to the child&#039;s paramount interest in knowing who his or her biological parents are. I argued in 1990 that we risked creating multiple cases of identity crisis by denying answers to the fundamental questions: &quot;Who am I?&quot; and &quot;From where do I spring?&quot; Those are answers that every person is entitled to receive.
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>When potential donors are finally made aware that identifying information will be made available, that may help to impress upon them the enormity of what   they are about to undertake. This is not, as my noble friend indicated a few moments ago, a matter of going along and donating sperm or even of being paid for doing so. We are all well aware&#151;I raised it in the 1990 debate&#151;of the cases of medical students who added a sum to their student grants by taking part in this activity without any thought of what they were entering into.
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a>Either this is a moral and ethical debate or it is not. If, as my noble friend said, we reduce it simply to a question of materialism and consumerism and consider it to be on a par with going to the supermarket, I do not think that we shall do anyone any great favours.
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a>I am extremely concerned to learn that the Government intend to mount a public awareness campaign. The Minister indicated that early next year we are to start telling the public about the need for, and importance of, gamete and embryo donation in an attempt to maintain current levels of donor eggs, sperm and embryos as a way of dealing with the concerns that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, mentioned during his remarks. I should be grateful if the Minister could confirm how much public money will be ploughed into that initiative. When she replies, perhaps she would also indicate what will be said in that advertising campaign about the duties and responsibilities that go with bringing a child into the world.
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a>Egg donors, in particular, will be exposed to considerable medical risk, which can, as the Minister well knows, be life-threatening. I hope that she will confirm whether the Department of Health will be responsible for any deaths which may occur as a result of these treatments. What assessment has been made of the risks, and will that be alluded to in the advertising campaign? I consider it to be irresponsible for the Government to promote egg donation when it carries such serious medical risks. Those have not been referred to during our debate thus far.
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a>A line of argument is being promoted&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, rather entrenched it this evening&#151;that gamete and embryo donation are in the same league as blood donation. That is palpably untrue. With the latter there is minimal risk and the altruistic act helps to sustain and to save lives. The former, on the other hand, can involve serious medical risk and involves the creation of a human life which will in all likelihood never see the light of day, and which will be frozen or manipulated and then discarded in the course of destructive embryo experimentation.

</p>

<a name="40609-24_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a>Perhaps the Minister can confirm&#151;the figures were given in an Answer in the other place a few months ago, so I am sure she will be able to confirm this&#151;that more than 1 million human embryos have been destroyed or experimented upon during the past decade since this legislation was passed. However, only 4 per cent of all the embryos produced during that period have ever seen the light of day.
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a>Therefore, I am deeply suspicious about the role of the HFEA and the clinics in the Government&#039;s proposed public awareness campaign. They are conflating the role of the watchdog and the burglar. Can the Minister confirm whether all the gametes and embryos donated will be used in fertility treatments? Members of your Lordships&#039; House will have seen over the past few weeks that applications have already been lodged, so will they be used for yet more experiments to develop reproductive techniques that have nothing at all to do with even the therapeutic cloning to which your Lordships agreed two years ago?
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a>I would like to know from the Minister whether those embryos will be used in research projects, particularly those involving embryonic stem cell research. I am sure that she will want to give the House the percentage figures that will be involved. The research industry has a vocal lobbyist in the HFEA and it desperately needs to get hold of gametes and embryos if its dreams for embryonic stem cell research are to be realised.
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a>In this context the Government&#039;s public awareness campaign can, of course, be seen as timely. Of course, the use of adult stem cells carries none of the ethical implications referred to in the debate about embryonic stem cells. I welcome that and I believe that in that context good science, good medical practice and good ethics march hand in hand. Therefore, public money would be better spent on appropriate national health schemes such as education and research programmes which deal with the primary causes of growing infertility in this country, in particular the exponential rise in sexually transmitted diseases.
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a>I would like to see the public funds allocated to natural fertility programmes that seek to work closely with couples to overcome the root causes of infertility rather than bypass those through recourse to donated gametes and embryos. The problem with donor recruitment that is envisaged when identifying information is made available should provide greater impetus for the promotion of natural fertility programmes. After all, according to the live birth rate for IVF programmes, it is still appallingly low at around 20 per cent. For the 80 per cent for whom years of treatment in futile IVF is in vitro failure, surely we can find an alternative. How much better it would be if some of the 600 babies who are daily aborted in this country&#151;184,000 every year, some 6 million in the past 30 years and one in five since the legislation was introduced 30 years ago&#151;could be given up for adoption, enabling 100 per cent&#151;not 20 per cent&#151;to parent a child. This country has been in denial about the efficacy and the cost of IVF and its implications.

</p>

<a name="40609-24_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a>Finally, I ask the Minister to clarify, if she can, the future of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. These regulations bear the name of that authority, but only last month the Secretary of State for Health, Dr John Reid, announced that in an effort to cut Whitehall bureaucracy there would be a 50 per cent reduction in the number of arm&#039;s length bodies such as the HFEA. Is the HFEA to be abolished or merged? We certainly need an answer to that question before we pass regulations of this kind.
</p>

<a name="40609-24_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a>While the regulations are welcome as far as they go, I do not believe that they go far enough. I do not believe that they address the far more important and deep issues that we have been denying for so long. Although the Government are doing the right thing, I believe that they are doing it for a lot of muddled reasons.

<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="40609-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Turnberg: </b>   My Lords, like many other noble Lords, I too am strongly in favour of the regulations that give children the right of access to non-identifying information about their biological parents. Even more than that, I believe that it is essential that they can do that for a whole range of reasons set out in the explanatory memorandum and in the regulations. I support the question of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, about why children must wait until the age of 18 before they are allowed access to such information.
</p>

<a name="40609-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a>I would have thought it not unreasonable for them to have this sort of information much earlier. I also very much agree with the noble Baroness, Lady   Warnock, about the need for children born in this way to have the information that they were indeed conceived in this way.
</p>

<a name="40609-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a>As regards paragraph 3 of the regulations, I am sorry to have to say that, despite the eloquence and persuasiveness of my noble friend Lady Andrews, I am much less persuaded of the validity of a right to identify a biological parent, where that parent no longer wishes to be identified 18 years downstream. There is a balance to be struck here between one individual&#039;s right to know and another&#039;s right to anonymity: it is not all one way. In other medical matters, we betray confidences and get round anonymity with great difficulty. We put up all sorts of barriers to prevent medical information, and information about oneself, getting out into another domain.
</p>

<a name="40609-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a>Let me give a couple of examples. Imagine the case of a young man, often a medical student&#151;and here I rush to the defence of medical students&#151;who, perhaps because he has seen the distress of infertile couples, decides to become a sperm donor. Perhaps, under the new regulations, he agrees now to give up his anonymity to any offspring of the donation. Then 18   years later when he is likely to be married, with a couple of children conceived with his wife, he is faced <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_362"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 362</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

with a biological child&#151;or perhaps five, or 10&#151;who he probably did not know existed. Having agreed originally, he may now feel quite differently about a new-found child, as indeed may his wife, and his children born to her. Some embarrassment, certainly, but much more importantly, a considerable stress may be put on the marriage. We know that nowadays 50   per cent of marriages are shaky anyway.
</p>

<a name="40609-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a>Then there is the sense of responsibility suddenly acquired. Currently no legal responsibility is envisaged, but who knows what may follow in 18   years&#039; time? In any case, a feeling of some responsibility cannot be denied and financial responsibility may follow, all of which will add to the stress on his own family.
</p>

<a name="40609-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a>My noble friend Lord Winston, who unfortunately cannot be here today, has given me an example of the woman who donates her eggs to another infertile woman. Often the donor women are going through an IVF programme and the spare eggs are given altruistically to others. But many such women fail themselves to conceive with IVF and they then face the unhappy prospect of meeting a child 18 years later who is genetically half theirs but who they had never known existed. Again, that is a further stress on a childless couple who are likely already to feel deprived. Of course it is possible that some may be pleased with the news, but I fear that more will be most distressed.
</p>

<a name="40609-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_490"></a>It was said that potential donors will be counselled before being asked to agree to being identified 18 years later and then again later, but I believe that the young men will either run a mile or go ahead and live to regret it. Who of us, when we were undergraduates, could have predicted how we would feel in 18 years&#039; time? It therefore seems likely that we will see a fall in the number of sperm donors in the immediate aftermath of the regulations.
</p>

<a name="40609-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_491"></a>Although the experience of Sweden and elsewhere suggests that the numbers bounce back, I suspect that those who come forward will be older and more mature. We would then be losing out on the healthier&#151;I fear that it is the healthier&#151;sperm which comes from younger men than middle-aged men. And all because it is said that children born after donation feel dispossessed. My noble friend Lord Winston tells me that the evidence from his clinics shows that those who feel this way are likely to be in a small minority. Yet the potential damage this change in the law may inflict on others has barely been examined.
</p>

<a name="40609-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_492"></a>Clearly, today is not the day to try to remove these regulations, but I believe that we need much more evidence and more research into the full impact on all participants, not just the children and the parents rearing the child. I hope that I can persuade the Government, at the very least, to support more research into the impact on donors and their families of the loss of anonymity and to reconsider this whole issue in the light of that research when the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act is revisited, as I hope it will be.

First, let me say that I support the Government on this Motion. I am also persuaded that the rights of children are paramount over the rights of infertile couples, or any other couple.
</p>

<a name="40609-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_493"></a>Bringing the law into line with that on adopted children is also correct, as my noble friend Lady   Warnock said. I agree with all that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said except that this is an ethical issue. To me this is beyond an ethical issue, it is a rights issue. It is about the right of children to know their biological identity.
</p>

<a name="40609-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_494"></a>I accept the arguments put forward very powerfully by the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, about identifiable information being available. I have heard the arguments both from the British Fertility Society and my own college about how this change may create a problem, particularly with the falling numbers of sperm donors. The arguments and the examples produced by the noble Lord highlight that. I support the idea that more research should be carried out and that we should address the results of that research when we debate the matter further in due course.
</p>

<a name="40609-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a>However, today, all the briefs I have received from fostering, adoption and other agencies, the HFEA, the British Fertility Society and the college do not persuade me that this order should not be supported; and I support it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="40609-25_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </b>   My Lords, this is a particularly significant debate for me because I, along with my noble friend Lady Hooper, had the responsibility of presenting the Bill which became the   1990 Act to this House following the report of the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, and her committee.
</p>

<a name="40609-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_496"></a>I recall that this particular matter&#151;the identification of the donor&#151;required a good deal of thought at the time. My recollection is that the main reason for adopting the stance taken in the Bill on this point was the belief that unless anonymity was afforded to the donors, the likelihood was that the system would never get off the ground.
</p>

<a name="40609-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_497"></a>It is now 14 years since that happened, but I think that there must still be a question about exactly what effect the change will have on the willingness of donors to come forward, particularly, as the noble Lord, Lord   Turnberg, said, donors in the age bracket when their donations are likely to be the most valuable.
</p>

<a name="40609-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_498"></a>It is a difficult question. I entirely accept, and have always accepted, the importance and the paramountcy of the interests of the children. But unless a donor comes forward in a particular case, no child will emerge in that instance. So, in a sense, this is anterior to the question of the entitlement of the child because if there are no donors, no children will arise. That was the issue. At the moment I must say that I find it a little difficult to know the exact basis on which the Government are optimistic that this change will not seriously damage the programme in this respect.

</p>

<a name="40609-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a>The very fact they seem to be proposing a fairly extensive advertising programme suggests at least a fear that that this may have a contrary effect. The other point I think is worth mentioning&#151;I think the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, also referred to this&#151;is the question of ultimate responsibility. In her very clear introduction of these regulations, the noble Baroness mentioned the fact that any legal liability is excluded, but of course such legal liability is excluded only by the terms of the Act. This regulation shows that the terms of the Act are not by any means like the laws of the Medes and Persians. Therefore, some degree of liability should arise.
</p>

<a name="40609-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_500"></a>I am entirely in favour of non-identifiable information being allowed and I agree with those who asked why wait until 18. It may well be very important in connection with some illness in the child much earlier than that. We have seen a good deal of development in relation to the genetics of illness, and the precise situation in that respect might be extremely important. I am not sufficiently technically aware of the situation to know to what extent non-identifiable information can produce sufficient detail to enable a clinician to deal with this particular matter, but in so far as it is necessary for a clinician to be able to deal with the health of the child, I would hope that the necessary information would be available.
</p>

<a name="40609-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_501"></a>At present, I think that the general view of those who have spoken is that these regulations will not be opposed, but I think it is right to express some concern about their impact. The fact that such a distinguished practitioner in the area as the noble Lord, Lord   Winston, has concerns about the issue certainly makes me&#151;as by no means a practitioner&#151;rather concerned.

<a name="40609-26_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, it has been a very distinguished debate and I am particularly glad that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, was here to take us back to the origins of these regulations. As we expect in this House, the dilemmas which are represented by the professions and people outside are well represented here. Although it is unusual for me to find myself not in agreement with my noble friends Lord Turnberg and Lord Winston&#151;the latter could not be in his place&#151;we do of course listen very closely to their views, as we listen to those of all who have spoken in this debate. It has been extremely thoughtful indeed.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_502"></a>I do not want to reiterate any of the detail, but will try to address the issues that have been raised. They have ranged fairly far and wide, but it seems that one of the overriding questions has been the issue of the shortage of donors. While noble Lords have welcomed the idea of a campaign, some issues have been raised about it. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord   Mackay, put it, why are we right to be optimistic? Indeed, the noble Earl, Lord Howe described this as &quot;blind optimism&quot;. In so far as our policy has to be evidence-based, I think that we have used the evidence that is available. This suggests that there may well be a temporary drop and we must be prepared for that. This is why we have put aside <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_365"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 365</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&#163;200,000 to be invested in the campaign in the first instance. Trying to draw in new donors and to make them&#151;I address this point particularly to the noble Lord, Lord Alton&#151;fully aware of their responsibilities is a very serious undertaking. Those responsibilities are greater now that they include the potential for being identified.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_503"></a>Apart from a campaign&#151;and it is something which we have every intention of taking seriously&#151;I should like to make some other points about the supply of donors. It is possible that fewer live births per donor will be permitted under the regulations. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised that issue. The number might be three or five, rather than 10, so we will need to increase the number of donors. Two hundred sounds like a small number of donors, but there is a high attrition rate, and there is a huge gap between the number of people who put themselves forward and the number of those eventually selected. It is a serious undertaking.

<a name="40609-26_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </b>   My Lords, before the noble Baroness leaves the issue of the campaign that is to be waged next year, I want to know the answers to my two particular questions about the cost of the campaign and whether it would emphasise the risks to women involved in egg donation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_133"></a>
<a name="40609-26_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, I answered the question on cost: &#163;200,000 has been set aside. As for the risks to women, every donor who comes forward for egg donation or sperm donation is told whether there are risks to their health. We will continue to do that.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_504"></a>Another reason why we can be fairly optimistic about our stocks of gametes is that, although it is hard to get the information, some clinics tell us that their stocks are high and that they have enough for a year and some tell us that they have stocks for more than a year. So, we have a temporary respite. We will, of course, liaise with the National Gamete Donation Trust to make sure that clinics are as fully prepared as possible. We also know that the technology is changing. I understand, for example, that, in Sweden, there are new technologies that enable sperm to be kept for longer. We are not going into an identical situation, and we can bring in gametes from other countries, provided that we can source them and identify them. So, there are other sources. I hope that that helps noble Lords to understand the background.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_505"></a>Several noble Lords raised the important issue of research. The research that I quoted is unpublished, which is why noble Lords will not have come across it. It is about to be published. The researchers are well prepared to do further work, and we will look at it with great interest. I take what the noble Earl, Lord Howe, my noble friend Lord Turnberg and the noble Lord, Lord Patel, said on that point. We recognise that, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, said, there is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_366"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 366</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a need for more research on infertility, and we are putting increasing amounts into medical research as a whole.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a>We would consider whether there was a need to widen the scope of the 1990 Act to cover fresh sperm, if we needed to take such a step. The noble Lord, Lord   Alton of Liverpool, spoke about how women should not be put under pressure to donate eggs. It is a fundamental part of the whole arrangement that people are not put under pressure. They are voluntary donations. When it comes to egg sharing and altruistic egg donation, a great deal of counselling goes on. I was not making a direct allusion between blood donation and gamete donation; I was simply commenting that the notion of a gift relationship goes back a long way.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_507"></a>The noble Lord also asked why the measures were not retrospective. Historically, donations have been made under conditions of the strictest anonymity, and we would break faith with those donors if we made the legislation retrospective. That is an ethical position that I think the noble Lord will accept.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a>I was also asked about the future of the HFEA. The noble Lord is right: there is a review of arm&#039;s-length bodies, including the HFEA. We will have to wait for the outcome, as the matter is still under consideration.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a>In relation to the details of the advertising campaign, we are developing that campaign by liaising with the National Gamete Donation Trust, the Infertility Network, the Donor Conception Networks and the clinics themselves, so it will be put on a sophisticated footing.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a>I was asked why we do not allow information to be made available to those under 18. The age of 18 is in the primary legislation and these regulations cannot address that. That is why the information will become available at that point.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, asked whether embryos can be donated for uses other than fertility Treatment; for example, stem cell research. Embryos are donated with informed consent, and this must include informing the donor. It does include research, including stem cell research. I cannot give the noble Lord the figures he seeks, but I will certainly do so if I can.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_512"></a>I hope noble Lords will forgive me if I have left any other questions unanswered. I shall not reiterate what I have said. I am grateful for the support the regulations have received. We are acting in good faith. While I would not say that we are dealing with futurology, it is certainly difficult to know what the world will look like in 18 years&#039; time. We have done our very best to keep faith with all the people involved in these provisions, but we cannot be expected to have all the answers. I believe that the changes achieve a balance of rights and interests and I am happy that they seem to command the majority of opinion in the House.

<p><a name="st_134"></a>
<a name="40609-26_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Andrews </b>   rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 28 April be approved [<i>18th   Report from the Joint Committee</i>].
</p>




<p><a name="st_135"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I am going to cut short my speech, in view of the hour. I propose to write to noble Lords if they want further information about training opportunities, and so on. I shall whizz through as fast as I can.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_514"></a>The order will introduce statutory regulation for operating department practitioners&#151;ODPs. It will strengthen public protection for patients undergoing operations by setting and maintaining in law standards of practice, training and conduct for this group of healthcare staff who are closely involved in the delivery of patient care. It will bring ODPs in line with their medical and nursing colleagues who work in the same area.

</p>

<a name="40609-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_515"></a>I do not know how much noble Lords know about ODPs. I knew very little, and I am very impressed with what I have learnt about the role they play. They are important healthcare professionals who have to ensure that every operation is as safe and effective as possible. Their work takes in the whole range of peri-operative care, from preparing anaesthetics right through to taking care of the patient when they are coming round.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_516"></a>The history of the profession goes back to the 1970s. I shall not rehearse it, but I will say that the qualifications over the years have changed as the role itself has developed. We have moved from an NVQ to   a Higher Education Diploma in Operating Department Practice, which will come into operation this October.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_517"></a>ODPs are skilled members of the medical team, and they are important to ensuring the patient&#039;s recovery. Not only are they employed within operating departments, but they are also now being employed in accident and emergency and cardiac arrest teams. If we are to deliver a modern and responsive health service, we have to ensure that they meet national standards set by an independent regulator.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_518"></a>The order has the warm support of the Association of Operating Department Practitioners and the entire profession. But if they are to benefit from <i>Agenda for Change</i>, they have to be able to register by October 2004. Failure to do so could damage recruitment and retention of ODPs.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_519"></a>The protected title is proposed, as it is currently in use by practitioners and recognised by members of the public. We are not going to protect alternative <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_368"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 368</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

titles,   such as &quot;anaesthetic practitioner&quot; or &quot;surgical practitioner&quot;, since these titles are already in use and they reflect different roles. We propose to protect the single title of ODP.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_520"></a>The legislation also proposes opening a new part of the HPC register for ODPs. This means that there will need to be new members of the council&#151;registrant, alternate and lay. This will increase the HPC from 12   practitioner members and 11 lay members to 13   practitioner members and 12 lay members. I am sure noble Lords will know that once ODPs are regulated they will have to pay fees of &#163;60.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_521"></a>The order has been the subject of extensive consultation over three months and has attracted, I am pleased to say, broad agreement. The provisions of the order are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_522"></a>This programme has grown out of the order that set up the Health Professions Council in April 2002, which was designated with the power to regulate new professions that were currently unregulated. This is the first new profession to be covered in this way. It will be followed by applied psychologists in 2004; healthcare scientists in 2005; and psychotherapists and counsellors in 2007&#150;08.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a>The effect of the order will be to bring ODPs within the remit of the Health Professions Council, the role of which is to set standards of proficiency, conduct, performance and ethics under Article 21 of the HP order; to set standards of education and training under Article 15 of the HP order; to maintain a register of those who meet the standards and are fit to practise under Article 5 of the HP order; to have a mechanism for investigating complaints; and to deal with registrants who cease to meet the standards by taking any necessary action. That, of course, will be the responsibility of the HPC&#039;s &quot;fitness to practise&quot; system.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a>I shall conclude my contribution at this point. I have available a great deal of detail about how we shall incorporate the Association of Operating Department Practitioners, which has brought the profession to this point. I pay tribute to it. There are 6,000 members already on the voluntary register. There are a further 10,000 outside it, many of whom share the same training and qualifications. We wish to make sure that such people are also registered because they have the right qualifications. To ensure that people who came into the profession early are able to register, grandparenting arrangements have been introduced to enable them to prove that they also have the right training and qualifications. I shall happily write to noble Lords about how we intend to achieve that.
</p>

<a name="40609-26_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_525"></a>With that very short explanation, I commend the order to the House.

<p><a name="st_136"></a>
<a name="40609-27_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   My Lords, we welcome the order and I thank the Minister for her introductory words. Operating department practitioners have very considerable professional responsibilities for patient care and there can be no doubt that professional self-regulation under the umbrella of the HPC is entirely right and appropriate.
</p>

<a name="40609-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_527"></a>I do not have any comments of major importance other than to congratulate all involved in laying the groundwork for the order, including officials in the department and, particularly, the Association of Operating Department Practitioners. I wonder, however, whether I could ask a couple of subsidiary questions.
</p>

<a name="40609-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_528"></a>In any new move of this nature there has to be a managed transition. As the noble Baroness said, there are 6,000 practitioners already on the association&#039;s register but probably up to 10,000 ODPs who are practising but not registered. That is a very large number of unregistered practitioners. The extent of the professional competence of this latter, very large, group of people is a closed book. Some will no doubt have reached standards of competence which they can demonstrate readily and there will be little difficulty in admitting them to the new register; others, however, will need to be formally assessed and undergo the relevant training before completing a test of competence.
</p>

<a name="40609-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_529"></a>The trouble is that we simply have no idea how many individuals fall into the latter category. Is the Minister satisfied that the two-year period allowed in the order to enable unregistered practitioners to apply to become registered is sufficient to ensure that there is no disruption to the NHS? My understanding is that the standard training requirement for a practitioner is a two-year higher education diploma. Therefore, any delay on the part of unregistered practitioners in submitting their names to the HPC for assessment may result in large numbers being technically unfit to practise when the transitional period comes to an end.
</p>

<a name="40609-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_530"></a>Secondly, I understand that the title of operating department practitioner is to be protected, but no other title. I do not question that decision, but what is to prevent someone using the unregulated title of surgical practitioner or anaesthetic practitioner? What steps will be taken in the NHS to ensure that as far as possible those individuals employed to carry out the   role of operating department practitioners are professionally entitled to use that name?
</p>

<a name="40609-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_531"></a>Thirdly, will the Minister reassure me that the ADDP will continue to fulfil a relevant role as the professional advisory body for the HPC in relation to operating department practitioners? I am a little unclear about the role it will have. Officially it will be for the HPC to define standards of competence and ethical behaviour and to devise appropriate education and training and to assess fitness to practise, but where <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_370"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 370</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

will the expertise on those issues within the ADDP be directed, and will it be retained there? What exactly will be its function?
</p>




<p><a name="st_137"></a>
<a name="40609-27_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My Lords, I wish to join the noble Earl, Lord Howe, in congratulating the Association of Operating Department Practitioners. This is the first of the new professions to come under the Health Act 1999. Many of that Act&#039;s provisions were reasonably controversial, but it was agreed between us all at the time we debated the Bill that the provisions were a more satisfactory way of allowing the emergence of new professions by regulation rather than having to have primary legislation, provided that those new professions were prepared to come within the umbrella of the HPC.
</p>

<a name="40609-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_532"></a>The HPC is an interesting umbrella; a diverse range of professions nestles underneath it. As always, I suspect one of the key issues for new professions is inevitably&#151;and I suspect it will be the same for the profession coming down the track mentioned by the Minister&#151;so-called grandfathering, which means that there is a controversial area about the training requirements and so on. I do not wish to go much further tonight because of the hour, but I know that such issues are always controversial and I suspect that the Minister may like to say a little about it in her winding up.
</p>

<a name="40609-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_533"></a>I am interested in the reference to <i>Agenda for Change</i> and so on. One hopes that when such new professions are formed and placed under the regulator we will see flexibility and we will not see a new profession building a little regulatory laager; that it will continue to play a flexible role and an even more flexible role in the future, if that is what <i>Agenda for Change</i> is designed to secure.
</p>

<a name="40609-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_534"></a>While congratulating the new profession, I hope that it will not pat itself on the back and say, &quot;This is what we do, our competencies are thus and we don&#039;t take a wider role&quot;. I hope that that is not the spirit in which it is going forward.
</p>




<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="40609-27_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, I have been impressed by the way in which the new profession has developed its competence and its skill over the past few years. I am sure that it will continue to do so. It is an admirable example of a flexible profession.

</p>

<a name="40609-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_535"></a>The noble Earl asked me three questions. The AODP will concentrate on being a professional body, developing the professional scope of practice, advising on training curricula to meet service and professional needs and providing membership services and developing specialist groups. It has no fear for its future. It probably has a very bright future with registration.
</p>

<a name="40609-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_536"></a>The noble Earl raised a serious point about not wanting to see disruption and dislocation in the service. He is right to be concerned about that. We believe that the two-year period is sufficient. The NVQ is running alongside the new diploma; we will not be recruiting to the NVQ any more, but there will not be a gap, as I understand it, between the two.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40609-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_537"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, invented the term &quot;grandfathering&quot;. The word is &quot;grandparenting&quot;. It is a sign of the wisdom that comes with grandparents. The 10,000 people outside the scheme will have to prove that they have practised safely and effectively as an ODP for three out of the past five years. Some of them may have trained. Some young nurses, for example, have been in the health service for many years, and have an HND qualification. They have grown up through the system and continue to make very important and sometimes different contributions.

</p>

<a name="40609-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_538"></a>We do not want to lose those experienced, safe and effective practitioners just because they do not hold the most up-to-date qualifications. Obviously, the HPC must have safeguards in place to make sure that practitioners can have their training and experience assessed properly. They may be asked to undergo further training. We are trying to strike a balance <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_372"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column 372</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

between making sure that those people are not lost to the health service while weeding out people who do not have that experience and training but may be able to acquire it in the future.
</p>

<a name="40609-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_539"></a>The education and publicity for ODPs and employers by the HPC, the AODP and the Department of Health will make it clear that only ODPs will be able to use the title. That will be the legal situation. Anaesthetic practitioners will not be able to use it, nor will the other practitioners referred to by noble Lords. It is a very clear requirement in the legislation.
</p>

<a name="40609-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_540"></a>I hope that that explanation satisfies noble Lords. We have taken this order rather faster than I anticipated. If there are further questions, I would be very happy to write to noble Lords.

</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40609-27_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden </b>   moved Amendment No. 23:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 13, line 14, after &quot;hours&quot; insert &quot;, pensions&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving the amendment, I shall speak also to Clause 19, with which it is grouped. The amendment would include pensions among the core elements about which there should be collective bargaining once recognition has been agreed under the terms of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40609-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>I find it surprising that pensions as an item for negotiation should have been excluded, although the Government themselves do not seem very sure about it, since Clause 19 simply specifies that the Secretary of State may at some time in the future decide by order that pensions should become an issue about which there should be negotiation. As we all know, pensions have become a major issue; for many years, pensions have been a matter for negotiation between unions and employers in situations where there has been union recognition. I have myself been involved in pensions negotiations on behalf of members; when I sometimes meet retired members, I find them very grateful for what the union has been able to do for them. They are fortunate because they have benefited from payments under final salary schemes.
</p>

<a name="40609-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>The House will debate tomorrow the Second Reading of the new Pensions Bill, which is being introduced by the Government to cope with situations in which the employer has become insolvent. The campaign for the provisions in this Bill and for compensation for those who will not be covered by it has, in the main, been union-led. Unions have also been responsible for ensuring that member trustees, sometimes union-nominated, are appointed. It should be pointed out that we have always made a sharp distinction between negotiation about pensions and pension schemes and trusteeship. The functions are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC64"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC64</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

quite different. Our union has always run training courses for trustees, and that will be even more important under the new Bill.
</p>

<a name="40609-27_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>The Government seem to acknowledge the importance of union involvement in pensions negotiation, since the new Pensions Bill specifically requires employers to consult unions and the workforce about changes to pension provision. I therefore find it difficult to understand why pensions are specifically excluded in a Bill about trade union recognition. Unions have always regarded pensions as deferred pay; indeed, in some instances, employees have been willing to accept rather lower salaries in companies with good pension provision, sometimes accepting lower salaries than they might have received elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="40609-27_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>I would welcome a Government&#039;s response to all these circumstances. It may well be that simply doing as I propose&#151;adding pensions to the core items&#151;is not the best way to include pensions as a matter for negotiation in the Bill. I understand that currently provision of pension benefits by an employer is a voluntary matter. However, it seems to me that when there is a pension scheme, there is a strong case for a union having the right to enter into negotiations about that scheme. My noble friend the Minister will no doubt let the Committee know the Government&#039;s response to the views expressed under the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40609-27_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>As for Clause 19, if pensions are included as a core item for negotiation, the powers by which the Secretary of State can later decide that pensions should be included would not be needed. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40609-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My noble friend chided the Government for being unsure about the issue, because of the terms of the clause. However, I wish to reassure her about Clause 19, which seeks to introduce a necessary element of flexibility that will enable us to take on board the basis of the representations she is making if they prove to be substantiated in future. So it is not a question of the Government being unsure, rather it is about the Government seeking in the clause to keep the door ajar, providing the necessary flexibility to respond to the points made by my noble friend. At the same time, for reasons that I will identify in a moment, we cannot accept the amendment in its entirety at present.
</p>

<a name="40609-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>It is clear that my noble friend wishes to ensure that pensions should join pay, hours and holidays as the core bargaining topics for statutory recognition. Of course, we recognise the case that my noble friend has made about the significance of pensions. As she indicated, the Pensions Bill will be before the House tomorrow for its Second Reading and there will be a full debate about the issues. I will limit my comments today to the relationship between pensions and collective bargaining, which is what this Bill is about.
</p>

<a name="40609-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>When the CAC makes an award of statutory recognition, the parties are obliged to bargain on three topics: pay, hours and holidays. There has been some debate about whether this implies that the parties must bargain on pensions, on the grounds that pensions are part of pay. We think it necessary to clarify the matter <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC65"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC65</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in this Bill to avoid possible confusion. The Government do not believe that it is appropriate at this time to make pensions a topic for collective bargaining under the statutory procedure. Clause 19 therefore makes clear that pensions are not part of pay for the purposes of the statutory recognition procedure. After all, the statutory recognition procedure is intended as a fall back.
</p>

<a name="40609-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>The voluntary resolution of recognition claims is much to be preferred. That is how the vast majority of agreements are struck. It follows that we do not want to encourage applications for statutory recognition where those applications could be resolved voluntarily. We believe that would happen if the scope of the statutory recognition award were significantly greater than the typical scope of voluntary recognition agreements. It would draw everyone&#039;s attention to the statutory position.
</p>

<a name="40609-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>Currently, statutory recognition covers pay, hours and holidays. These issues are those most commonly included in recognition agreements, and they are indisputably the core bargaining matters. The question is whether pensions have now achieved the same status. We recognise the force of my noble friend&#039;s representation, and we know that pensions are moving significantly up the bargaining agenda. TUC figures suggest that 49 per cent of new voluntary recognition agreements include pensions, but as an item for consultation. The TUC survey does not provide a figure on the proportion that include pensions as the subject of negotiation. The statutory position is about negotiation.
</p>

<a name="40609-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>We have therefore commissioned research by Sian Moore of the Working Lives Research Institute and Helen Bewley of the Policy Studies Institute to look more closely at recognition agreements signed since 1998. The interim findings of their research have recently been published by the Department of Trade and Industry. The findings suggest that pensions are less likely than the core topics to be specifically included, and more likely to be specifically excluded, as a topic for negotiation in such agreements. In only 11 per cent of new agreements were pensions specifically mentioned as a bargaining topic.
</p>

<a name="40609-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>Of course, that does not mean that the parties did not subsequently bargain about pensions, or that pensions were implicitly covered within the scope of bargaining in some way. The researchers are therefore undertaking further work for the DTI to examine actual bargaining behaviours. However, on the balance of the evidence available, we believe that it is fair to assume that bargaining about pensions is untypical behaviour in recognised workplaces.
</p>

<a name="40609-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>Having said that, I look forward to a time when pensions can become a suitable core topic for the statutory procedure. I appreciate the argument that pay and pensions are closely linked, which was the burden of my noble friend&#039;s representation. It is right and proper that unions should be concerned about their members&#039; incomes in retirement as they are about <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC66"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC66</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

those members&#039; current remuneration and, as my noble friend indicated, she has considerable experience of dealing with these issues.
</p>

<a name="40609-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>That is why this clause includes the power, which I mentioned in my opening remarks, for the Secretary of State to add pensions to the three core topics at some future point. The Government intend to exercise this power when there is clear evidence that pensions are typically included as an item for negotiation in voluntary agreements.
</p>

<a name="40609-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>We will therefore undertake periodic surveys of collective bargaining to monitor what is going on. I have referred to research that we have in hand. The interim findings, which focus on new agreements, can be found on the DTI website. As I said, we are following that up with further research. This should give a picture of the current extent of bargaining on pensions in voluntary agreements, which can act as a benchmark against which to measure change in this area. The Fifth Workplace and Employment Relations Survey, due in 2006, should also provide a guide to this.
</p>

<a name="40609-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>We will, of course, undertake consultation before making an order under this power and the order will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedures of both Houses.
</p>

<a name="40609-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>That is the position in general terms with regard to the clause but I want to address a few remarks to my noble friend about the amendment. She is right that, because of the way in which the amendment is framed, it covers only two out of the three crucial points in the procedure and therefore it is not a complete amendment and has its defects. I am always loath, particularly in Committee, to present the arguments in terms of defects in the drafting of amendments. I know the difficulties that everyone, except the Government, struggles under in preparing their cases with regard to amendments, particularly Back Benchers, with whom I have an instinctive sympathy. That goes without saying. After all, one never knows how quickly one will return to that blessed state.
</p>

<a name="40609-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>I want to indicate to my noble friend that in advocating the basis of the clause I hope that she will recognise that I am sympathetic to the points that she makes. The Government are aware of the growing strength of representation with regard to pensions. We are not convinced that we are at the point where we can change to the statutory position without it overwhelming all voluntary negotiations because it would contain that extra dimension&#151;of course, there will be the opportunity for issues such as this to be aired in tomorrow&#039;s debate on the Pensions Bill.

The Government seem to be saying, if I follow them, that they cannot put pensions in the Bill because if they put pensions in it would overwhelm the voluntary system. I do not know whether that would be because once pensions were in, all employers would say, &quot;Well, <br>&nbsp;<br>

if it is in the Bill then we will give you pensions&quot;, or whether, because pensions are so valuable, there would be hundreds of applications for statutory recognition, everybody would come along to the CAC and there would be a great queue. It is nonsense, but it is ingenious.

<a name="40609-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>The fact that we have to take into account, and we were debating it when the Committee met the other day, is that what is embodied in the 1999 Act was a balance. It was a balance between what the TUC wanted and what the CBI was prepared to sign up to. That is why those three items were put in as the subjects of statutory recognition. Otherwise it makes no sense. They are there because that was the basis on which agreement could be reached.

</p>

<a name="40609-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>Previous attempts to legislate to encourage collective bargaining have involved nothing like this. For example, in the 1992 consolidation Act, which spelled out the legal basis of labour law in this country, Section 178(2) gave a reasonable definition of what recognition should normally cover:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;terms and condition of employment . . .  engagement or non-engagement&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;allocation of work . . .  discipline . . .  membership or non-membership of a trade union . . .  facilities for officials of trade unions . . .  machinery for negotiation or consultation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>That was the rough idea. About two-thirds of what we have here is in the first item: members&#039; &quot;terms and conditions of employment&quot;. So we merely have an agreement or fudge, produced to get some consensus for the 1999 Act.
</p>

<a name="40609-28_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>We say that now that the consensus is up for review and there might be a case for adding to this list of three the fourth issue of pensions. There are very good reasons for that. It has now become clear that workers are very concerned, much more so than they were even in 1999, about what is happening to pension funds. They do not trust employers in what they are doing with their pensions. Therefore, pensions have suddenly become a very important bargaining issue and because of that a lot of employers are resisting it. Therefore, it becomes a critical item that we could include to show that this recognition legislation is entitled to bite on an area where it is required.

<a name="40609-29_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   I wish to add some points in support of my two colleagues. The Minister kicked off by saying that he wanted to keep the jaw open, not the door open. He was right the first time: I hope that he will keep the jaw open to snap up some of the red herrings that he has subsequently deployed. In trying to find out where we are going, the first red herring is that this matter is not for the Pensions Bill tomorrow; it belongs in this Bill. This Bill defines the territory of the three points, to which the fourth point should be added as life goes on.
</p>

<a name="40609-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>Secondly, so far as concerns industrial politics, this will never be one of those consensus items between the TUC and the CBI. We all know that, whether in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC68"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC68</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

London or Brussels, there are some territories where one can hope, albeit with a sword of Damocles hanging over the negotiations, to find some way forward. I am almost certain that this is not such an item. However, as the Minister has said, the phraseology of Clause 19 suggests that the power of making by order an amendment to add pensions is something that the Government think may be on its way. Let me put it this way: it is becoming a question of when rather than whether.
</p>

<a name="40609-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>The third red herring&#151;if it is not a red herring, it is some similar fish&#151;is the question of how to define &quot;typical&quot;. I think that I have got right the form of words used here: the Government would be inclined to go down this road once it is clear that this is typical of voluntary agreements. Let me deconstruct that sentence&#151;that is how the philosophers would look at it these days. First, why should it need to be typical? Even on the philosophy advanced by my noble friend the Minister, what is wrong with it being a significant number of agreements? Clearly, there could be a whole spectrum from nought to 10.
</p>

<a name="40609-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>In the national debate about pensions, we are trying to arrest the decline&#151;not the decline and fall&#151;of final salary schemes. We are trying to sustain pensions because there are trade offs with retirement age, et cetera. As everyone has said, it is moving very rapidly to the top of the bargaining agenda. The test should be much more to do with there being a significant number of agreements rather than it being typical. In either case, it is difficult to say what the adjective means, but the word &quot;significant&quot; should be thought about.
</p>

<a name="40609-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Finally, the fourth red herring is the notion that, although we have now moved to a public policy position of contemplating this being an item for the four, in the same breath we are told that there is some distinction between what can be done logically or sensibly through the statutory CAC scheme and what can be done through voluntary collective bargaining. That is a notable red herring: of course, anything can be done through voluntary collective bargaining. We are talking here about an employer, for example, in a voluntary agreement where the union perhaps has the other three items. What if it wants to go to the CAC to get the fourth one? The form of words used by my noble friend has begged that question.
</p>

<a name="40609-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>I hope that I am right in interpreting what has been said: that the door is open, as well as the jaw being open. This is obviously a matter that the TUC and trade unions generally will press further at the time when&#151;rather than whether&#151;the Government decide to do something about new paragraph 171A(2) of Schedule A1 to the 1992 Act, under Clause 19 of the Bill.

<a name="column_GC69"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC69</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

argument. First, I thank my two noble friends who have responded. I agree with a great deal of what has been said. When I moved the amendment originally, I said that I was not bound by my proposed wording. I was quite prepared to accept that it is a rather flawed way of attempting to deal with the whole issue of pensions as a matter for negotiation by unions once recognition had been achieved, which is basically what we are after.
</p>

<a name="40609-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>I am pleased that the Minister accepts the validity of the arguments that have been made in support of trade union recognition on pensions. That is clear. I note that he says that the door is not just ajar but open. I want us to be able to go through that door speedily. I do not see why the Bill should be utilised as a means for us to go through that door. Although we will discuss pensions tomorrow&#151;and that Bill will go into Committee, meaning that many of these issues are likely to arise&#151;the whole point of the amendment is to achieve a situation in which the unions feel able, once recognition has been achieved, to demand the right to deal with retirement income on behalf of their members as well as their day-to-day salaries and conditions.
</p>

<a name="40609-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>It is perfectly legitimate to ask for that. I am by no means satisfied that the reply given by the Minister deals with all the points we have made. Of course we acknowledge that at the moment&#151;I stress that&#151;provision of pension benefits by an employer is a voluntary matter. But I think that pressure is mounting for there to be some element of compulsion. Whether that is achieved, I do not know, but certainly it is there. A view is held that a demand should be made of employers to share the burden of pension provision as far as both the state and the individual is concerned. If that happens, of course there would need to be negotiation.
</p>

<a name="40609-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>I do not think I can say much more at this point. We shall look at this again because, as I said earlier, we feel quite strongly about it. Over the years the unions have developed their negotiating skills on pensions provision and they have skilled and competent people able to deal with these issues. They believe strongly that they should be able to utilise the services acquired on behalf of their members to ensure that they receive proper retirement benefits when finally they leave employment. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>



<p><a name="st_15"></a>The noble Lord said: I had hoped that the Minister would comment on some of the extra points made during our last debate. In due course he may find an opportunity to do so because further issues were raised during that interesting discussion. Perhaps an opportunity will arise a little later.
</p>

<a name="40609-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>I shall speak briefly to Amendment No. 24. Everyone recognises that if one has legislation of the type now before the Central Arbitration Committee with provision for a ballot, and the union loses the ballot, it cannot simply return the next day and have another go. But the Government have decided, for reasons I understand but do not agree with, that when it wins a ballot, the union has to obtain a &quot;yes&quot; vote of 40 per cent of all those entitled to vote.
</p>

<a name="40609-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>My argument turns on the critical criterion that the union needs to secure a &quot;yes&quot; vote of 40 per cent of those entitled to vote. I could be tempted into listing how many Members of Parliament or councillors would be elected on that test tomorrow. I suspect that no one would be elected. Everyone knows that in such elections&#151;whether we are talking about postal ballots or going to the polling station&#151;achieving a 40 per cent turnout, let alone a majority of those in the bargaining unit entitled to vote, is not an inconsiderable achievement.
</p>

<a name="40609-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>A 40 per cent &quot;yes&quot; vote is a very high hurdle indeed. Some quite important constitutional changes have fallen foul of it. I think I am correct that the first attempt at Scottish devolution, in 1978, fell at that hurdle. A majority of those voting voted in favour, but not 40 per cent of those entitled to vote.
<a name="time_1"></a>
<a name="40609-29_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40609-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>Perhaps I may apply this to the CAC procedure. Let us say that there is a ballot and the union wins. However, of the 1,000 people entitled to vote, 350 said &quot;yes&quot; and 250 said &quot;no&quot;. The result would be that the union was unsuccessful. Let us take another case&#151;although the procedure would not differ from that in the 1999 Act, which went much too far in this regard, even if one can see the point about some sort of minimum turnout&#151;in which 350 said &quot;yes&quot; and 150 said &quot;no&quot;. Again, the ballot would not be carried.
</p>

<a name="40609-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>As inequitable as many trade unionists regard the provision, my amendment would not change any of it. My amendment deals with the fact that the three-year rule applies just as much to these hard cases as it does to a case where the union is defeated hands down. For example, if the union lost by 350 to 250 or by 350 to 150, it would have to wait for three years. I submit that it is against common sense and natural justice that no distinction can be drawn between the two types of case. It seems to me and many others that it is no more than fair play to say that where a union has won the ballot despite the fact that 40 per cent of the whole bargaining unit has not cast a &quot;yes&quot; vote, the union should be able to make another attempt after one year.
</p>

<a name="40609-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>I have not brought with me an overall statistical analysis, but I am sure that the DTI has this information to hand. Although my amendment would make a difference in only a quite limited number of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC71"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC71</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

cases, I think it fair to put the case for the change. It would not affect an enormous number of cases. I am sure that any independent observer would be more than happy to accept my argument and I trust that my noble friend the Minister will do likewise. I beg to move.

<a name="40609-30_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   I am very glad to hear from the noble Lord, Lord Lea, that he is not suggesting that people should be able to come back and have another ballot the next day or next week; such an arrangement would be too horrendous for words. I believe that the three-year period was probably designed to prevent what could be called a war of attrition between employers and employees who do not want representation, so that they are gradually worn down by a constant series of applications year after year. I think that Parliament agreed on the three-year quarantine period as a result of its collective wisdom, and I do not think that anything in real life has shown that it is absolutely out of order and ought to be altered. I very much hope that the Government will reject the amendment.

<a name="40609-30_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am grateful to my noble friend Lord McCarthy for the way in which he introduced his amendment, save for two aspects. He chided me about not responding to one or two additional points on a previous amendment, which I would not dream of infringing upon at this stage, except to say that there was a slight mistake on my part. I had thought that my noble friend Lady Turner was replying to the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, when in fact she was withdrawing the amendment, effectively ending my contribution. I did not seek to ignore my noble friend&#039;s points. As my noble friend Lord McCarthy has rightly said, we shall return to those issues during our deliberations. We shall certainly ensure that the points in question are returned to.
</p>

<a name="40609-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>The other aspect of my noble friend&#039;s contribution for which I did not thank him&#151;although I appreciated much of it&#151;was a trip down memory lane to Scottish devolution in 1978. As a veteran of the Parliament at that time, I remember that vote. We all recognise how significant that concept was at that time and what it meant for Scottish devolution. It is not helpful to go back over that ground in seeking to persuade Ministers about how to deal with the present position.
</p>

<a name="40609-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>My noble friend will recognise the obvious point&#151;and I accept part of the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller&#151;that we seek some stability in these arrangements. He will know that we are at this point as a result of the substantial work that produced the pre-1999 TUC/CBI agreement. Nobody on any side pretended that everybody got everything they wanted from the legislation at that time.
</p>

<a name="40609-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>I recognise that my noble friend finds aspects of the present position exceedingly irksome, but he will know that a reasonable case has been put forward: a degree of stability is needed. A ballot is an important aspect for both workforces and employers. When used in the workplace, it is likely to attract considerable interest and activity. But it is not the kind of thing that one <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC72"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC72</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

would wish to occur every two or three months. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, may have overstressed the matter when she suggested that people could mobilise themselves for the very next day. But there must be some judgment on what is an appropriate interval before returning to an issue.
</p>

<a name="40609-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>The Government&#039;s case is that the period of three years enables some stability. Recognition of the union allows the new relationship between the parties to bed in without attempts being made to derecognise the union within a short space of time. When workers give their union a mandate to continue to represent them in collective bargaining, their employer must respect that for three years. There is an obvious point in which that provision is a counterpart to that.
</p>

<a name="40609-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>I hear what my noble friend has said. I respect the strength with which he has put forward his position. But he will recognise that some judgment must be made and agreement reached, part of which is to allow the Government to legislate on what is a reasonable time for new arrangements to bed down or, if failure occurs, a reasonable period for which the situation can prevail before a second attempt is made. The judgment of the Government is that there should be a three-year period. I hope that my noble friend will recognise that there is general strength behind that position, and that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40609-30_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   I am afraid that my colleague has failed to address the point that I made. I do not know whether he listened carefully to what I said and I shall ask him to respond in a minute. I am sure that he has heard me on this amendment almost to the point of tedium. It distinguishes the position where a union has lost the vote and it has to wait for three years. First, let me ask him to acknowledge that that is an agreed point in the context of what I am putting forward here. I ask the Minister to give further thought to what I am suggesting. That is that if there is a union victory in the ballot, but it fails, perhaps by a whisker, to get 40 per cent of those entitled to vote, as there has been in one or two cases, it is against common sense for it to have to wait for the same three-year period. That will not be a war in the sense of any other war. This is a very special case where they have won the vote.
</p>

<a name="40609-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>Unless he is asking the trade union movement to come down totally against the three-year rule, I am saying that this is a helpful amendment to the Government. I ask him to think very carefully, before we come to Report, about the merits of drawing a distinction between where the union has lost a vote and must wait for three years on the one hand, and where it has won the vote but has failed to get the 40 per cent on the other. Maybe it has failed to get 40 per cent because it failed to get the right turnout, rather than it failed to get the balance of support for recognition in the establishment or the bargaining unit. It has just failed to get the 40 per cent turn out. We all know how easy it is to fail to get a 40 per cent turnout.
</p>

<a name="40609-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>In this particular case, I am leaning over backwards to contradict, as it were, TUC policy and am accepting that the three-year rule is there. However, where there has been a victory for the union in the ballot but it just <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC73"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC73</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

failed to get 40 per cent of those entitled to vote, will the Minister pause and think again about whether there is not a very strong case for saying that then the union have to wait for a year or 18 months? There is no point in saying two years and six months, so let me say a year. Then it can have another attempt to bring forward a procedure and it may be that if the same thing happens a second time, which would be like lightening striking twice, and would be the end of it. But that is another story and it would be too complicated to draft.
</p>

<a name="40609-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>I am saying this for the 14th time to make sure that people have not misunderstood it. Basically speaking, if the union wins the vote, but it has not got the 40 per cent turnout, Ministers may distinguish this from a case where the union has lost the vote and it has to wait for three years. That is what I am putting forward and that is what I ask my noble friend to give a little more thought to. I ask him to do that before Report and I ask him to give it a little more thought before I withdraw the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40609-30_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I reassure my noble friend that I have given considerable thought to this. The problem is, as he says, that union won the vote and has met one of the conditions of victory, but it has not met the other condition. First of all, his amendment does not apply to anyone else who fulfils one condition of victory but not the other. It only applies on one side, the trade union side. Secondly, I think that he recognises that there must be a figure because his speech indicated it and he is a reasonable person in discussion. He has not presented a situation to the Committee where the trade union had won the ballot by three per cent to two per cent and said that that was a victory and therefore they should have the chance to have another go at it. He is indicating that it must be a narrow defeat. We would have to define exactly what &quot;narrow&quot; is; what the scope should be. We would need to have a figure to indicate within what range a &quot;narrow failure&quot; could be defined in order to arrive at 40 per cent. My noble friend will recognise that what he is doing is in effect recasting a concept which has been agreed.
</p>

<a name="40609-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>I do not say that the concept is set in stone, but I do say that he must recognise that this a lopsided approach to the issue. It will not do to say that the narrowness of the failure to meet one criterion gives scope. That would require a definition. We would then have another concept of the threshold, in effect a subsidiary threshold. One threshold would stipulate 40 per cent, and there would be a second threshold which allowed that if the vote was over a certain amount, the union could come back within a year. At another percentage point or so above that, the union could come back within six months.

<a name="40609-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>However, this Bill retains the exemption for small firms, despite strong objections from the TUC. This amendment seeks to delete the exemption for firms with fewer than 21 employees. It should be said in support of this amendment that it is often employees in small firms who are most in need of protection. Larger firms are likely to have managers with some knowledge of employment law or, in the case of very large firms, personnel departments with managers knowledgeable about employment rights. That is often not the case in small firms, which employ a substantial proportion of the workforce of this country. Unless the stipulation is removed, or something similar to our amendment is accepted, several million employees, many of whom are poorly paid, will remain outside the provisions of this Bill, and thus the possibility of the protection that a recognised, independent trade union would provide.
</p>

<a name="40609-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>I know that the TUC has lobbied strongly on this and I hope that there has been time for the Government to rethink their position. Clause 11 details arrangements by which employers may utilise a decline in the number of the workforce to derecognise, which would not be needed if this amendment or a similar provision were accepted. I beg to move.

House. The best I could find was paragraph 4.17 of <i>Fairness at Work</i>, the document that the Government introduced when they first came into office. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;Many small companies recognise trade unions already&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>We know that. It goes on to say that, &quot;Many do not&quot;. We know that too. It continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;In many small firms employment relations are managed not just on an individual level, but on a personal level. In these circumstances statutory requirements on trade union recognition would be inappropriate&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>That is a <i>non sequitur</i>. I will read it again. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;In many small firms employment relations are managed not just on an individual level, but on a personal level&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>What is the difference between an individual level and a personal level? The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> says that &quot;individual&quot; means &quot;relating to one&quot;. It says that &quot;personal&quot; means,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;relating to a particular individual&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>All family law relates on a personal level, as does a very great deal of labour law. What on earth does this mean? It means absolutely nothing. In fact, the Government have never advanced any argument at all. Nevertheless, an argument can be advanced.
</p>

<a name="40609-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>I challenge the Government&#151;to some extent my noble friend has already done so&#151;to say that any of the arguments that might logically be used, at least in principle, do in fact apply. One might argue that we do not need to apply this legislation to small firms because they are already very good employers&#151;we all know what excellent employers they are&#151;but that is not what research tells us. That is not what Guest and Rosenthal found in 1993 when they talked about the &quot;black holes&quot; of small firms. It is not what Sisson found in 1990 when he talked about the &quot;bleak house&quot; of small firms. Above all, it is not what has been shown in one WIRS survey after another.
</p>

<a name="40609-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>The research shows that small firms pay below the average and that workers have less security, lower productivity and poor conditions. Of course they do&#151;because they are small; because many are not very good at their job and cannot become big firms. If they are good at their job, then good, they can become big firms. If that happens, then on the whole their industrial relations will become better because they can afford for them to get better.
</p>

<a name="40609-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>I am glad to see that the Government do not dare to advance the argument that we do not need to apply this legislation to small firms because they are much better employers.
</p>

<a name="40609-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>The second argument is that these firms are already well organised. But they are not&#151;they are extremely badly organised, and we all know why. In such firms there is a high turnover and a lot of part-time work. They also have an older labour force with family ties. All kinds of conditions in small firms make it extremely difficult for unions to organise.
</p>

<a name="40609-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Of course that does not mean that unions cannot have an impact when they get into small firms. Small firms in the printing industry were well organised and it made a difference. In the United States, particularly under the New Deal, a whole range of small scale industries were unionised. The result was an improved <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC76"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC76</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

labour force, improved wages and higher productivity. The point is not that unions cannot make a difference but that the objective conditions can make it much more difficult to unionise.
</p>

<a name="40609-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>So I do not think that the Government can advance any such argument. They certainly did not do so in <i>Fairness at Work</i>.
</p>

<a name="40609-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>My last point is that although the Bill couches the point in a way which is not apparent, what we are giving here is a right to workers and we are supposed to be giving it to all workers. It is not the employers&#039; right to recognise; it is the workers&#039; right, in certain specialised circumstances, to gain recognition. By what right do we deny this right to those who need it most and who are in the most difficult situation? I think that it is time that the Government changed, moved and altered their position, just a bit, to enable small firms with underpaid workers, to make an attempt at recognition.

<a name="40609-31_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   I would certainly oppose Amendment No. 25. Indeed, I would also oppose that Clause 11 should be deleted from the Bill. As regards Amendment No. 25, the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, and the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, both made the point that trade unions have lobbied the Government heavily on this point. I know not whether the employers organisations have equally lobbied the Government hard on that point, but they have lobbied me and told me of the difficulties that they would have if this happened.
</p>

<a name="40609-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, made the point that employees in companies that employ fewer than 21 people often have poor pay, are not necessarily well treated, and so forth. That is not my experience of small businesses. We should not start on the basis of always assuming that things are wrong. In my understanding, small businesses employ overall a far larger part of the workforce than larger employers. It is important that we protect them so that they do not go out of business.

</p>

<a name="40609-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>Clause 11 relates to the employers right to end bargaining arrangements. To delete that would be wholly objectionable. The clause contains very stringent provisions about how that might be achieved. If the amendment is accepted or passed, an employer would be saddled with union recognition for ever, no matter what changed circumstances there may be for the company or, indeed, even a change of views of the current employees. I would strongly oppose its deletion.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40609-31_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   Does the noble Baroness not recognise that under the terms of the legislation there is a derecognition procedure that an employer could invoke, which is exactly the same as the rule for companies with under 21 employees?

<a name="40609-31_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   That may very well be the case. But I think that this would fall heavily on small businesses.

<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40609-32_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   Does the noble Lord agree&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="40609-32_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   I have listened to the noble Lord for two days: I should like to finish what I have to say. Before the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, rises, I want to say that I found one thing that he said absolutely reprehensible. He said&#151;which I wrote down&#151;that, &quot;The reason that small businesses are small is because they are not successful. If they were successful they would be bigger and therefore the 21 requirement would not apply&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40609-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>That is a reprehensible remark, particularly in the context of the modern world. I suspect that it is some time since the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, had direct experience of what is happening in business. Clearly, Her Majesty&#039;s Government have been successful managing the economy of this country. To a large extent that is due to the economic success of the sort of businesses that the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, just said were unsuccessful because they employed under 21 people. The world in which we had sweatshops in Manchester with fewer than 21 people employed is fortunately almost gone for ever. The sweatshops ought to have gone&#151;although we may regret the fact that a lot of the manufacturing industry has gone to India or China or wherever. In the modern world, we have large numbers of modern hi-tech industries with firms that employ significantly fewer than 21 people. They are highly successful. To say that small firms with fewer than 21 people are a failure and that if they were not a failure they would be bigger is a charge that simply ought to be withdrawn.

</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="40609-32_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   But this is a review. One cannot really say that the Government set the thing in stone in 1999, as they said that in five years&#039; time they would have a review. This is the review. All sorts of things are being changed; one cannot say that if one changes this little detail the whole thing will unravel, otherwise we would not have a review at all.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="40609-32_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   Of course, the Government do not oppose the principle of recognition in small firms. Indeed, we know that recognition in some small firms can work very well. We recently funded a project proposed by several unions under the strategic <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC78"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC78</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

partnership fund to explore the ways in which unions can work best with proprietors and managers in micro-businesses. The project should certainly produce some useful guidance on good practice in that regard.
</p>

<a name="40609-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>We simply do not believe that it would be appropriate to impose recognition in very small micro-businesses. Such firms tend to have personalised working relationships, as my noble friend Lord McCarthy said. I shall not get into a discussion about individual versus personalised at this stage. It is likely that in small organisations managers and workers will have much more direct contact. That is bound to change the character of relations in such organisations.
</p>

<a name="40609-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>I would be the first to appreciate the point that my noble friend Lord McCarthy made that there can be instances when things go very wrong indeed. It is certainly the case that small units in the past were the source of grievous exploitation, but it is a different world today. People are much more confident with regard to their rights and their bargaining position in wider society, not least against the background of a more successful economy&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, was generous enough to suggest. With low levels of unemployment, people working in small organisations are likely to get a decent deal; if they do not, they are up and off. That is certainly the position with a lot of young workers these days, who do not consider themselves as committed to one workplace for the length of their working lives. We are in an infinitely more flexible economy these days. As the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, said, small units are a feature of that economy.
</p>

<a name="40609-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>We know the threshold opposed by the trade unions, and the Government considered the issue very carefully. As my noble friend Lord McCarthy said, this is an opportunity to review the 1999 position, so it is only right that the Government should look into these matters afresh. We have reviewed carefully the operations of the Employment Relations Act 1999. However, unionisation and collective bargaining have never been a marked feature of employment relations in such very small businesses. The review that we carried out discovered a lack of demand for recognition in the smallest organisations. Very few workers in small businesses are union members, although such businesses employ millions of people in the present economy. We estimate that in firms employing 10 to 20 workers only 4 per cent are union members.

</p>

<a name="40609-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>I understand my noble friend&#039;s concern that those figures should be improved upon, and I recognise that there are cases in which such improvements would bring benefits to workers. However, we have to face the facts as they are. We are talking about a very small percentage of workers in organisations of fewer than 20 workers. We have also seen limited demand for recognition in those organisations that are just above the threshold. I feel that I shall spend the whole afternoon chopping and changing with figures, but let me make the obvious point. Less than 5 per cent of CAC applications involve businesses employing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC79"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC79</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

between 21 and 30 workers. That category of organisations just above the threshold is little involved with regard to the CAC procedures.
</p>

<a name="40609-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>The definition of the threshold includes employment by the employer and any associated employers. That arrangement captures the situation where employers might split their businesses under common ownership to ensure that each entity is too small&#151;in other words, below the 21-person threshold. Our review found that the legislation had worked as intended. There was no evidence that employers had restructured their businesses to avoid the recognition threshold.
</p>

<a name="40609-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>Of course, recognition is not the only means whereby workers can receive union services at the workplace. We must remember that the right to be accompanied by a union official at disciplinary and grievance hearings applies to employers of all sizes of unit. The 1999 Act established that right, and other parts of this Bill strengthen the entitlement. That is only right and proper. I can reassure my noble friend that these arrangements are part of the 1999 position. They deal with the individual entitlements of workers, ensuring that individual union members can access their union&#039;s services at key events affecting their future.
</p>

<a name="40609-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>I maintain that my noble friend&#039;s proposal is inappropriate. It could lead to unhelpful situations where employers&#151;including tiny organisations employing just one or two people&#151;are required to establish formal bargaining arrangements with trade unions. Our preferred approach in the case of these very small organisations is to leave it entirely to the parties whether recognition should occur. Our funding of the project on effective union relations in micro-businesses should help to inform the decisions which those parties take.
</p>

<a name="40609-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>My noble friends also indicated that they did not like Clause 11, and I have a very extensive defence of the intricacies of that clause. However, I assume that the reason why they do not like the clause and are objecting to its standing part of the Bill is due to the particular point of the threshold.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40609-32_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   Yes, that is right.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="40609-32_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   So I shall not go into a long defence of Clause 11, and I hope that I have given a strong enough argument for my noble friend to feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>I shall deal with some of the points raised in the debate. I should tell the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, that of course we are not against small businesses. I have never been against them; in fact, when I was a member of the TUC general council, I and my noble friend Lord Lea were members of a committee set up deliberately under the DTI to give assistance to small businesses. We supported that move because we realised that small businesses employ a lot of people <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC80"></a>

and help to deal with unemployment in several areas. We are not against small businesses, and nor is our proposal.
</p>

<a name="40609-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>We are concerned with ensuring that if people exercise their right to belong to a union, recruit their colleagues and want then to be bargained for in a small firm, they should have the right to the bargaining arrangements available in the Bill, even though the firm involved may be small. As my noble friend Lord McCarthy pointed out, if the membership falls, the employer under the Bill would have the right to opt for derecognition, because the procedures are set out in the Bill. We are concerned about ensuring that, if people want to belong to a union in a small firm and want to have their terms and conditions bargained for because they have managed to recruit their colleagues, that should be available to them under the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40609-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>In response to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, I repeat that we are not against small businesses. This provision is not directed against them. We are concerned about the right of individuals to belong to a union and be bargained for by it. I accept that this is a package, so to speak, but in Committee we are entitled to deal with individual issues, which is what we have been trying to do.
</p>

<a name="40609-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>We are concerned that this is a matter for a very large number of employees. I gather that around 6 million workers are employed in small companies. We are anxious to ensure that they can enjoy the same rights available to those who work in large companies. However, I note what the Minister has said. I shall think about his response to see whether there is some way in which we might be able to come back to the matter on Report. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_36"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 27 provides the remedies available to the CAC where it finds that a complaint of unfair practices in relation to a derecognition ballot is well founded. As far as possible, the framers of the Employment Relations Act 1999 sought to ensure that the procedure for derecognition of a union which has been the subject of an award of statutory recognition should mirror the Part 1 procedure for recognition. Therefore the remedies introduced by this amendment are essentially the mirror of those which will apply to unfair practices in relation to ballots on recognition. We have already discussed these remedies in some detail in our debate on Amendment No. 20. I hope, therefore, that noble Lords will permit me to concentrate on only a couple of small points of difference between the two rather than the areas in which they are the same.
</p>

<a name="40609-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>This applies in the rare situation where a worker or workers, not the employer, has made the application to derecognise the union. This is provided for in paragraph 112 of the statutory procedure. It is the only case under the statutory procedure where there are three distinct parties to the application: the union, the employer and the applicant workers. The amendment <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC83"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC83</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

therefore contains additional paragraphs 119G and 119H. Paragraph 119G ensures that the remedies for unfair practices apply in relation to an application for derecognition by a worker, and makes clear that an applicant worker can both make complaints and be the subject of complaints of unfair practices.
</p>

<a name="40609-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>There is a difficulty, however, in applying the &quot;red card&quot; sanction&#151;the football analogy I used during our first sitting in Grand Committee&#151;which applies where the employer has failed to comply with an order of the CAC, or has committed a second unfair practice subsequently. This same difficulty applies where the employer has committed an unfair practice which involves either violence or the dismissal of a union official. If the application in question had been made by the employer, the CAC would be able to reject the employer&#039;s application for derecognition. Where the application in question has been made by a worker or workers, for two obvious reasons the same sanction could not apply.
</p>

<a name="40609-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>First, it is not possible to know with certainty the employer&#039;s attitude to the worker&#039;s application. It might be natural to assume that the employer would favour derecognition of the union, although he might take exactly the opposite view. If it is the case that the employer favours derecognition, then the sanction that the application was rejected might well have a punitive and deterrent effect on the employer. However, there may be situations where the employer is in favour of the continued recognition of the union, perhaps because he believes that a less preferable union is waiting in the wings to seek recognition should the worker&#039;s application be successful.
</p>

<a name="40609-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>Secondly, even were it possible to determine the employer&#039;s true attitude towards the application under consideration, it would not be just to punish the union or the worker for transgressions which might have been committed by the employer. The worker should not have the application rejected, nor should the union be derecognised because the employer has misbehaved.
<a name="time_4"></a>
<a name="40609-33_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40609-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>With that in mind, the Government have devised a different remedy for that very particular case. Where, in the case of a worker application for union de-recognition, an employer is guilty of failing to comply with an order of the CAC, committing a second offence after the order has been issued against it, or committing an unfair practice involving violence or the dismissal of a union official, the CAC will be able to order him to refrain from all further campaigning in the ballot. This order and the CAC&#039;s initial order to take mitigating action will be enforceable as though they were orders of the county court, should the employer continue to fail to comply. If an employer does not comply with an order of the county court, he may be found to be in contempt of court and liable to an order for sequestration or even imprisonment.
</p>

<a name="40609-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>To date there have been no applications by either an employer or a worker for de-recognition of a union awarded recognition under the procedure. The <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC84"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC84</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government expect applications by workers to be extremely rare. We must legislate, however, for the possibility that it could occur, and for the possibility that an unprincipled employer may see encouraging the worker to make an application as a way to engage in unfair practices&#151;a matter that they could undertake with impunity. I believe that the sanction I have just described and the enforcement mechanism that backs it up are sufficiently strong to discourage rogue employers seeking to exploit worker applications for their own ends.
</p>

<a name="40609-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>Amendment No. 28 mirrors Amendment No. 22, providing that where the CAC decides to order a ballot on de-recognition to be rerun, its duty is to reveal the result of the first ballot to the parties, and that would then not apply in these circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40609-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>Amendment Nos. 30 and 94 make consequential changes to the Bill and the recognition schedule. Amendment No. 30 deletes a reference to the power at paragraph 27C from Clause 14, because that power is deleted by Amendment No. 27. Amendment No. 94 ensures that the provisions of Clause 12 apply to applications for de-recognition under paragraph 128.
</p>

<a name="40609-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>The Government believe that the remedies for unfair practices in relation to de-recognition ballots, like those for unfair practice in relation to recognition ballots, are fair and effective. They provide a mirror image of what is to apply in the case of recognition as well as a strong alternative to deal with the unusual case where there are three parties to a ballot. In that light, I beg to move.

</p>

<a name="40609-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>This amendment should have been made in another place when Clause 16 was added to the Bill. Clause 16, as the Committee will be aware, provides a power at paragraph 166B of the statutory procedure for the Secretary of State to provide that the use of unfair practices is prohibited during any period of the statutory procedure prior to the ballot period. The purpose of this power is to allow the Government to respond rapidly should evidence emerge of intimidation taking place before the balloting period.
</p>

<a name="40609-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>The amendment is consequential to the addition of Clause 16 to the Bill. It works by inserting a reference to the power at paragraph 166B into Clause 14&#151;the general power of the Secretary of State to amend the schedule following representations from the CAC. Clause 14 lists the specific powers of the Secretary of State to amend particular parts of the schedule. The power at paragraph 166B should therefore be added to that list.

Then, under subsection (6), the case manager writes a report that he submits to the CAC itself. Presumably, and in most cases, the CAC will ultimately base its decision on the contents of that report. Under subsection (8), the CAC must then send copies of the report to the employer, the union and, where appropriate, the individual worker.

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>However, that does not go far enough. If these parties are going to be able to make representations to the CAC before it announces its decision based on the case manager&#039;s report, they really are entitled to see not only the decision but also the evidence on which the case worker based his decision.
</p>

<a name="40609-34_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the case manager may have misconstrued the facts due to a misunderstanding, or have recommended a decision not supported by the facts. As the procedures laid down by the Bill do not provide for the exchange of evidence or even necessarily a face-to-face hearing, there is no opportunity for one side to test the evidence given by the other. It is a basic principle that a party to judicial proceedings&#151;or in this instance quasi-judicial proceedings&#151;should know exactly what case has to be answered.

<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="40609-34_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   It is certainly true that these two amendments are simple and short but, my goodness, they would significantly change the effect of Clause 18. Perhaps I may begin by explaining what the clause does and the way in which it improves the operation of the statutory procedure. I shall then describe why I think that the amendments would be a great deal more damaging than perhaps the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, thinks they would be.
</p>

<a name="40609-34_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>There are a number of points in the statutory procedure where the CAC must apply certain tests to the union&#039;s application in order to decide the question that has been put to it. The first of those points is at the admissibility stage. The CAC must satisfy itself of a number of things before it can accept a union&#039;s application. Those include that at least 10 per cent of the proposed bargaining unit are members of the union and that a majority of workers in the proposed unit are likely to favour recognition.
</p>

<a name="40609-34_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>Later in the process, the CAC may have to apply the same tests again where a bargaining unit which differs from that proposed by the union has been determined, and the CAC may have to conduct a further check of union membership levels when deciding whether a union should be awarded recognition without a ballot.
</p>

<a name="40609-34_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>In order to decide all those questions, the CAC case manager checks the names of the union members in the relevant bargaining unit, which are supplied by the union, against the list of workers in the bargaining unit, which are supplied by the employer. I hope that I shall not be taxing the Committee&#039;s patience if I repeat that point: the list of workers who are members of the union is compared with the list of workers that is supplied by the employer.
</p>

<a name="40609-34_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>Petitions in support of or opposition to a union&#039;s application may also be received by the CAC. In that case, the CAC case manager will also seek to verify by <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC87"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC87</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

checking the employer&#039;s list that the workers who have signed a petition are members of the bargaining unit. On the basis of those checks, the case manager compiles a report for the panel on the level of union membership and the likely level of support for recognition within the bargaining unit.
</p>

<a name="40609-34_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>Currently, the CAC relies on the parties voluntarily agreeing to provide it with such data. At present, that is done on the basis of goodwill. That has been relatively successful, but it has limits. Negotiating that with the parties inevitably gives rise to some delay. On occasion, one or other of the parties has initially refused to co-operate with a check. Fortunately, the CAC has always been able to find a way through those difficulties. However, it relies on the goodwill of the parties. Ultimately, if a party refuses to agree, the process may be significantly delayed or frustrated.
</p>

<a name="40609-34_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>The clause introduces a power for the CAC to require any party to an application to provide it with the information it needs in order to conduct the checks that I have described. At the same time, the clause codifies the CAC&#039;s current practice, which aims to protect the confidentiality of workers&#039; personal details.
</p>

<a name="40609-34_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>That ensures that the names of union members and workers who sign pro-recognition petitions are not disclosed to the employer. Likewise, the names of the workers in the bargaining unit plus the identity of individuals who sign anti-recognition petitions are not disclosed to the union. It also makes clear that the CAC panel does not see those names. So the panel bases its decision only on evidence that is available to all the parties.
</p>

<a name="40609-34_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>That measure will reduce delays in the process. Of particular relevance to this debate, the clause also enshrines in law measures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive worker details in either direction. The amendments would require a case manager to disclose all the evidence to the CAC panel, and thus to the parties, on which the report was compiled. In other words, the case manager would need to append to the report all the data supplied by the employer and the union. That would of course include the identities of workers, and other personal data would be revealed. Confidentiality, which I think all parties would prefer to preserve because of their interests in either direction in the outcome, would be completely undermined.
</p>

<a name="40609-34_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>I wonder if I could, in making this submission, also test out something that has worried me about this amendment and possibly some later amendments. It is worth seeing if there is a genuine difference, or if this is just my imagination. Amendments of all kinds are studied by people way beyond your Lordships&#039; House, and if I may say so, because of the fame of the Miller amendment, probably those standing in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, are studied with particular care. I wonder whether there is a concern here about whether the CAC&#039;s own processes are reliable and whether it can be trusted with sensitive information.

It would be important, looking at these amendments, to ensure that people do not draw the wrong conclusions. I say for the record, and I hope that this is a shared thought, that the integrity of the CAC in handling these kinds of matters has been proven to be extremely sensitive and robust. It has been shown to have treated confidential areas appropriately.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>After Clause 20, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_3"></a><br>
   &quot;PERCENTAGE OF WORKERS VOTING IN BALLOT


(1)   Schedule 1 to the 1992 Act (collective bargaining: recognition) is amended as follows.


(2)   In paragraph 29(3)(b) for &quot;40&quot; substitute &quot;30&quot;.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_52"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment deals with the issue that we have debated several times: the conditions required in order to achieve a declaration in favour of recognition. What we call the overall turnout test, instead of being 40, should be 30. I do not want to go over the ground gone over before by my noble friend Lord Lea, except to say that we face a long series of hurdles.
</p>

<a name="40609-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>First, there is the fact that the employer is refusing to recognise; the union has to take this employer who is against recognition to the CAC; they must pass the 10 per cent test; they must then either get 50 per cent membership or they must win a ballot; and after that there is the further, sometimes called electorate test, of 40 per cent of the electorate voting in favour. We did not have anything of this kind in the previous Act, and we did not have it in the Industrial Relations Act 1971. The Government say that it is all right, partly because that is what we agreed in the first place, and it is a balance&#151;I accept that. However, the Government also say that it is working well. They have said on many occasions that because it is working well they cannot accept any major change, certainly not a change of the magnitude represented in this amendment. Well, I suggest that if the Government look closely, they will see that it is working adequately rather than well, and it could work a lot better.

</p>

<a name="40609-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>There have been 233 applications. Depending on how you look at it, that is much better than last time in some ways, because then we had hundreds and hundreds of applications, but we had so many applications that they could not be dealt with by ACAS, the institution supposed to deal with them. One might say that we had to lower the number of applications, and we have. We have only had 233 applications, because unions know that it is extremely difficult to satisfy the criteria. The Government say that it is working well because 64 declarations have been in favour, and only 23 cases have been lost in relation to ballots. If they go forward and have a ballot, only 23 times have they lost.
</p>

<a name="40609-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>The Government also say, and they stress this, that outside the area of the statutory recognition procedure, there has been a significant rise in the number of voluntary recognitions, and therefore it is working well. We say that it is not working more than adequately. A large number of cases are abandoned because agreement cannot be reached on the criteria, or because the unions get discouraged, or because they come to realise that they cannot satisfy the criteria. The Government have admitted that there are long-delayed results. There are records of determined, even unlawful resistance, which is why the present Bill contains provisions for unfair practices. The TUC listed these in its evidence to the Government, which is why there has been some move made in this review.
</p>

<a name="40609-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>One of the problems of the legislation is that it has, perhaps naturally in the present circumstances, swallowed the notion of the ballot panacea. It is difficult to argue against voting nowadays. Voting is regarded as the proper way of testing opinion, despite the fact that it suffers from absenteeism, difficulties of contact, and in the end it is difficult to get a high level of responses. That is what people mean when they say that abstentions are votes against recognition. When the previous system operated&#151;when the CIR operated the system and when ACAS operated it&#151;we did not have ballots. We had surveys. Members of the organisation went round and asked people what they wanted. They took long schedules about, and on that basis, totally confidentially, they decided whether they wanted to recommend recognition. We do not have that now; it is not possible to have that now. So, we get a situation where significant numbers of workers come forward who want to get recognition, but for all kinds of reasons and failures of contact, and all kinds of ways in which employers can put obstacles in the way, unions do not obtain the necessary 40 per cent quota.
</p>

<a name="40609-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>My noble friend Lord Lea tried to put forward a mild way in which we might do something for what might be called a close-run thing, when you win the first one and you cannot win the second one. The Government will not listen to that; or maybe they will when they come back. In the meantime, one way around it would be to lower the universal test from 40 to 30. I beg to move.

He also said towards the end of his speech that maybe they could not reach the 40 per cent because some employers put obstacles in the way. He did say that and agrees that it is a possibility.

<a name="40609-35_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   That may well be one interpretation. I am not saying that it is incorrect. I am simply saying that I do not think that one can say that because they have not reached 40 per cent it is because in one way or another someone stopped people who wanted to vote from voting. If 40 per cent is the amount that is required, 40 per cent of people would vote. To my way of thinking, that is how it would be. I do not have Schedule 1 of the 1992 Act in front of me. Perhaps the Minister when he replies will say, if this amendment were carried, and the figure was 30 per cent, what would happen if 40 per cent did not want it? Presumably that would be no majority, and it would not count&#151;

The noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, is not suggesting for one moment that anyone stop the other 70 per cent from voting in any way&#151;they just did not vote. That is the bottom line.

<a name="40609-36_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   Does not the noble Baroness agree that the TUC has submitted evidence on this? I do not know whether she has seen that evidence, but I understand that it is partly&#151;I do not say entirely&#151;because there is evidence that employers have found it relatively easy to make it difficult for people to vote. They could hold the vote when people were not there and therefore could not vote. Thus it was felt necessary to put in the Bill a whole series of remedies for unfair practices so that we could deal with the problem, which is not an imaginary problem.

<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="40609-36_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   It is important to make absolutely clear on the record the actual situation that results from a minimum &quot;yes&quot; vote of 40 per cent.

</p>

<a name="40609-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>At the moment, far from a simple majority of 50 per cent plus one, as she advocates, let me cite an arithmetical example of a result that would not lead to recognition. I have written it down to ensure that I get it right. If a vote was won by 39 to 38&#151;we are not arguing here whether that is a sufficient majority, I seek simply to illustrate the point&#151;that represents a 77 per cent turnout with a majority vote, but the answer would be no. That is how it works at the moment.
</p>

<a name="40609-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>There are, I think, some half a dozen cases of near misses of this sort, which is why, as my noble friend Lord McCarthy remarked, there are different ways of skinning this cat. But I also think that a 50 per cent turnout is another way of looking at it. No doubt we shall discuss that before we reach the Report stage.
</p>

<a name="40609-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>As for the most satisfactory way to deal with it, at the moment it is something of a travesty of democracy to demand a turnout of 77 per cent.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="40609-36_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   I certainly have not seen the evidence from the TUC. However, no doubt the Government will have seen it and therefore I am perfectly content to listen to whatever the Minister has to say on this amendment. It is interesting to note that in so many amendments, the aim is to lower the threshold. Perhaps in this case the Government think that that is the correct course. If that is so, then so be it.
</p>

<a name="40609-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>For the record, I did not say that I thought it should be 50 per cent plus one; I made a particular point of saying that I did not think that. I merely cited the number.
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="40609-36_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   This has been a difficult issue for some time, one in which sharp contention is possible between unions and employers. However, with the greatest respect to my noble friend Lord McCarthy, it is not fair to say that it is working only adequately. Voluntary arrangements are not a bad starting point. From my own experience, where a union is able to achieve an agreement on a voluntary basis, that is not bad and usually sets the sails rather fairer for the period that follows than when one has had to grind out a raw dispute through a compulsory mechanism. Often that leads to a result that leaves a sourness on the part of all those involved. So I would not want anything on the face of Bill that might harm the voluntary route since, objectively, that must be the best option for everyone.
</p>

<a name="40609-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>While it is possible to find out the opinion of people in a workplace, voting is an attractive option when compared with most of the alternatives. These days, people are extremely concerned to ensure that they have the right to express their own views. They may choose not to vote, but it is regarded at the least as a very valuable asset in the generality of instances.
</p>

<a name="40609-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>I want to come in principle to the realpolitik of the matter. The 40 per cent threshold is an integral part of the recognition procedure. Because of it, a &quot;yes&quot; vote produces an unequivocal demonstration that there is positive support for recognition among the workforce. This prevents anyone, whether an employer or anyone else, from arguing that a union won on an unrepresentative ballot in a low turnout. Even when <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC93"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC93</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the process is compulsory rather than voluntary, that improves the chances of a constructive working relationship between union and employer being established.
</p>

<a name="40609-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>When the threshold was introduced, some thought it would be a major barrier to recognition. I paused and considered that point myself, but it is always worth looking at the evidence to see whether one&#039;s own concerns have been realised in practice. In fact, out of the 88 ballots ordered by the CAC, only two have been lost because of the 40 per cent threshold. A quick sum in my head puts that at near enough 2.5 percent; therefore, 97.5 per cent have not fallen on the threshold.
</p>

<a name="40609-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>It is also worth bearing in mind that the 40 per cent threshold also applies in derecognition ballots. I note that the proposed clause does not amend sub-paragraph 121(3)(b) of Schedule Al of the 1992 Act, which imposes an identical requirement in derecognition ballots. I do not know whether that is the intention of Members of the Committee in tabling the amendment. However, it is the Government&#039;s belief that whatever the arrangements finally agreed, the recognition and derecognition arrangements should mirror one another and be seen to be fair because they have done so right across the piece.
</p>

<a name="40609-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>The most crucial part of the realpolitik is that the 40 per cent threshold was part of the balanced package that was negotiated with unions and employers in 1999. It is absolutely right for my noble friend Lord McCarthy to say that this is an occasion for review; there has been a detailed review, in which no evidence was found to suggest that the process has failed. We would be inviting others to unpick those parts of the recognition procedure which they did not like if we were to amend the threshold arrangements now. I cannot believe that that would do anything other than to disturb all the elements of the balances that have been struck. The issues are not small ones, nor are they without their symbolism. Moving in an area with such an impact is bound to raise a vast variety of difficult issues. I do not want to overstate, but I believe that that is the case.
</p>

<a name="40609-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>In conclusion, the Government believe that the 40 per cent figure serves a generally useful purpose and should be retained. I would therefore ask my noble friend to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="40609-36_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   The Minister as usual makes a very good case, and I accept that something had to be done this time to mark out the difference between this time and the previous two times, which were generally regarded as disasters.
</p>

<a name="40609-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>The key to that difference is the ballot&#151;I fully accept that. The point was that, if there were a ballot, as long as it was a majority ballot, it would be very difficult for the employers to resist. On the other hand, ACAS used to recommend recognition when there was a membership of only about 10 or 15 per cent. When it did a survey, it almost always recorded a majority; therefore, the committee would recommend some kind of recognition, because it related it to the size of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC94"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC94</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

union membership in the bargaining unit. I regard that as a much more sophisticated and intelligent way in which to find out what people think.
</p>

<a name="40609-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>I must say this, although I know that I shall shock certain Members of the Committee&#151;sometimes there are better things than votes. There are things that one wants to find out, which one can find out much more scientifically through surveys. There may be a 100 per cent return and, as long as one believes the people who collected the survey, one gets a much more sophisticated feeling of what people think than if one has asked them to vote.
</p>

<a name="40609-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>I accept that that option is not possible, however, and that the Government this time had to do something different. I would not want them to depart from the principle of voting at this point. Nevertheless, it is not quite true to say that this balanced package was universally agreed; it was a settlement, and all settlements contain elements in which one or another of the parties continue to argue for its point of view. That was the TUC&#039;s point of view&#151;it never accepted that there should be a 40 per cent threshold, but it had to in order to reach agreement, so it signed the agreement.
</p>

<a name="40609-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>What the TUC wanted, as my noble friend Lord Lea said&#151;or what it hoped for&#151;was that the standard way of getting recognition would be the 50 per cent vote. If it could be demonstrated to the CAC, the public and employers that there was that 50 per cent, it would not be necessary to go on and have a ballot. However, because of the peculiar way in which the legislation was drafted, which we have discussed and which I shall not go over again, it is much more frequently the case than was expected and hoped for that we have to go on to the second stage.
</p>

<a name="40609-36_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>I am not suggesting that the Minister is doing this intentionally, but it is not fair to say that everything is going well, because we do not really know about the number of cases that never come forward. I am in a difficult place, because I do not know either. The Minister said that only 1 or 2 per cent fall on the 40 per cent threshold, but when unions know that they could not win the 40 per cent, they do not go forward. They do not want to have the case thrown out, because that finishes them for several years, whether the law says so or not.
</p>

<a name="40609-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>We are bound to go on with these arguments. It is not fair to say that they are settled; they will continue to be pressed. I hope that in the course of this review, the Government will make some movement on the issue as well as others. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_4"></a><br>
   &quot;APPEALS FROM CAC AND RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR CAC


(1)   An appeal lies to the Appeal Tribunal on any question of law arising from any decision, order or declaration of the CAC, or arising in any proceedings before the CAC under this section.&quot;
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC95"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC95</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(2)   The Secretary of State shall within three months of the passing of this Act promulgate rules of procedure to be followed in all proceedings before the CAC covering (but not exclusively)&#151;


(a)   evidence;


(b)   conduct of witnesses;


(c)   discovery, exchange or documents and witness statements between the parties;


(d)   prior disclosure to the other party of the case to be answered;


(e)   details of and use of written evidence and statements and such other matters as he shall deem appropriate.


(3)   For the purposes of subsection (2), the Secretary of State may revoke or amend such rules from time to time as he shall deem fit.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_64"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment is in two parts. The first is to be found in proposed subsection (1) and the second in proposed subsections (2) and (3).
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>The purpose of the first subsection is very simple, and virtually self-explanatory. There should be a statutory right of appeal on matters of law&#151;not fact&#151;from the CAC in recognition and derecognition cases. I have proposed that it should be to the Employment Appeals Tribunal; that seems to me to be the most appropriate body. Currently, appeals have to be made by way of judicial review.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>The Government have suggested&#151;and perhaps the Minister will repeat that suggestion today&#151;that since relatively few employers resort to that process, it must follow that the vast majority who have had statutory recognition cases are content with the way that the CAC has dealt with them. However, that is not so. The CBI tells me that many employers have not sought a judicial review because of the substantial costs, to say nothing of the delay involved. That must impact especially hard on smaller businesses, which do not have the same deep pockets as the union with which they may be dealing.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>Speedy and inexpensive access to justice should always be the objective of legislation. I trust that the Government will accept this very moderate amendment.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>At this stage, the second and third subsections constitute a probing amendment; nevertheless, it is a very important one. The two subsections would require the Secretary of State to promulgate universally applicable rules, so that unions, employers and individual workers in one part of the country will act and be treated in the same way as those in another part of the country. The CAC is not one sole tribunal, any more than the High Court is just one judge; it is a whole number of separate tribunals sitting in different geographical areas or even sitting in the same area, if there is enough work for them. There are separate tribunals with separate chairmen, separate members and separate caseworkers. What is absolutely not required is separate rules of procedure, separate standards of evidence and so on. What is required is consistency, the same sort of consistency that universally applies in civil litigation because of the comprehensive rules of civil practice. I hasten to add that I am not asking for anything as comprehensive and detailed as the several thousand pages that they occupy. It would also inhibit the practice of &quot;forum <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC96"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC96</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

shopping&quot;, where an applicant on either side, given a choice of venues, will try to pick the one whose practices they believe favour them the most. The absence of a comprehensive set of law reports relating to CAC decisions itself militates against consistency.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>In my amendment, I have tried to make it as easy as possible for the Secretary of State by not requiring the rules to be made by statutory instrument but simply by a ministerial edict. This is employed in the High Court, where from time to time, what is called a &quot;practice note&quot; is issued, which is binding on all litigants and their lawyers.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>In order not to be unduly prescriptive, I have proposed that in addition to what I may call the basic requirements of a judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal, which I have set out in the amendment, the Secretary of State shall have power in the rules of procedure to include anything else that seems to him to be appropriate.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>Finally, I have proposed that the Secretary of State shall have the same power to alter, modify, or even revoke the rules, again by a ministerial direction, without having to go through the procedure of a statutory instrument. The subject of this part of this amendment is of concern to employers operating nationally who need to know where they stand when involved with the CAC. I have no doubt that this would be an objective of the unions as well. It is certainly as much in their interests as that of the employers.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>I called this part of the new clause a probing amendment because a clear indication is required from the Government as to how they propose to ensure that there is consistency and uniformity in proceedings before the CAC, no matter where those proceedings take place. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="40609-37_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   I am a member of the CAC, but that is not necessarily material to this point. We are talking about a paradox. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has mentioned a wish to have inexpensive access to justice. The CAC provides very inexpensive access at the moment. Indeed, the parties to the Treaty of London in 1999, or whatever it was, were looking for the most inexpensive and informal way of approaching this matter.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>The noble Baroness referred to all litigants and their lawyers. Most people do not come along with lawyers and long may it remain so&#151;this is not private information because all the cases are heard in public if anyone wants to go and listen, although it is not the most entertaining day out. The route down which the noble Baroness would take us is the opposite of the one she wants to go down. It is a very expensive route where everybody does have to come with lawyers and has to act in a terribly legalistic way. At the moment, speaking only for myself, but I think most people would agree, the ideal is that people close to the ground&#151;the trade union officials and the managers&#151;come along and answer questions about how it is. That is it.

Of course, there is judicial review which is costly to someone, either the taxpayer or the parties. I do not think it is the taxpayer but the parties who have to pay. The prima facie question is whether that route is in the spirit of the CAC, whether it is better or cheaper. I very much doubt it.

<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="40609-37_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   I fully support what my noble friend Lord Lea has just said. For many years, I was a member of the CAC. It was a very informal process, not legalistic at all. In fact, representation by lawyers was actively discouraged by the chairman when I was a member. If one follows this kind of procedure one is erecting an enormously legalistic, expensive system giving the employer, who wants to be difficult, has plenty of money to spend and is perhaps hostile to a recognition claim, the opportunity to utilise a legalistic procedure that is not envisaged in the Bill. It would not help any of the parties concerned. I hope that my noble friend will not feel tempted by this amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="40609-37_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   Before the Minister replies, I would like to tell the noble Lord, Lord Lea, and the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, that I appreciate that both of them have far more knowledge of how the CAC works than I have or am ever likely to have, particularly as the noble Baroness has just said that she was a member of the CAC for many years. However, as I said when I moved my amendment, the CBI asked for something like this. It said that judicial review is very expensive and lengthy and that the Employment Appeals Tribunal might be quicker and less expensive. However, the Minister will be able to clarify that for us.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>The other matter is that, when I spoke about the second part of the amendment, which is a probing provision, I used the words, &quot;This amendment is one of concern to employers&quot;. That was put to me by another organisation that represents employers, the EEF. It is a matter of concern and, although listening to the two noble Lords it sounds as though it is not a problem, I believe that it is a problem. I shall be interested in what the Minister says on this point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="40609-37_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I hope that noble Lords will not feel that my response is inadequate because I have not been a member of the CAC. I was involved in a lot of the discussions that the trade unions and the big employers&#039; organisations had before 1999. I was very familiar with the issues at the forefront of the minds of all those involved. By way of an introduction, I want to say that throughout most of those discussions, although there were, of course, issues upon which people did not agree, we found a very strong area of commonality in thought around three things.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>The first was that, in dealing with industrial relations issues generally, it would excellent if we could have solutions that grew out of common sense and a process of discussion among the principal parties. It <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC98"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC98</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

was felt that that was a very good part of the industrial relations tradition of the United Kingdom and would be particularly important for the CAC. Indeed, I can remember a number of colleagues on the employers&#039; side of those discussions making the point, with which I wholly agreed, that the industrial tribunals&#151;they became the employment tribunals&#151;were also designed to work on that basis.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>The second big factor, which my noble friend Lord Lea mentioned, was that everyone is trying to restrain themselves to reasonable costs in whatever they do. I was quite taken by the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, about small firms and the costs of expensive judicial processes, whether in judicial review or appearances at many of the other senior courts of the land. Those of us who had to try to live on relatively slim trade union budgets often had to gulp hard and wonder how we could manage in those circumstances. I think that everyone was very keen on keeping within the constraints of reasonable costs.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>The third element&#151;although distinct, it is very close to the first&#151;is that, as everyone always seemed to emphasise, there are great advantages in not drifting accidentally into what I would describe as perhaps an American model where litigation is at the forefront, rather than the better option of the techniques of the industrial relations process. It was felt that people could get together and find a solution, which was not always possible under the more adversarial system which inevitably operates in the courts. That is the way in which lawyers argue with one another.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>I hope that that was not too much of a digression. I was trying to describe how we set the scene which became for everyone, I believe, employers and employees alike, part of what I described in an earlier debate as the 1999 deal.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>This amendment deals with two separate issues. The purpose of subsection (1), as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said, is to establish a right of appeal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal against any decision or action taken by the Central Arbitration Committee under the statutory recognition and de-recognition procedure. Currently, as we have all acknowledged, parties have the right to seek judicial review of any decision taken by the CAC under the statutory procedure. We believe that is sufficient and that the creation of an additional right to appeal to the EAT would be counter-productive. I hope that I will shortly be able to illustrate why I believe that that is so.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>When the CAC considers an application, it needs to take into account a large number of decisions. Introducing additional rights of appeal against the individual decisions of the CAC would be very likely to cause long delays to the process, especially if proceedings could not continue until the appeal was determined. These delays would tend to favour employers at the expense of trade unions and also encourage exactly the sort of legal wrangling that, as I hope I have made clear, we are all seeking so hard to avoid.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>It is also of vital importance to remember that the CAC is a specialist body that operates in a very specialised area. When it makes its decisions, it relies <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC99"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC99</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on its members applying their industrial relations expertise and experience, and long may that be so. That could not be matched by any appeal court, not even the EAT. In the Kwik-Fit judicial review, the High Court and the Court of Appeal concurred with that view. When the matter was debated in the other place, my honourable friend Gerry Sutcliffe quoted Mr Justice Elias of the High Court&#151;I quote this because I think it is a way of summing it up&#151;who said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;courts do not have the relevant expertise, nor is it desirable that these procedures should become a happy hunting ground for lawyers&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-37_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>Although he may have been damaging the income of some members of his profession, the wisdom of his words sticks with me.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>Parties feeling aggrieved about the manner in which the CAC has reached its decisions are currently able to challenge the decision through judicial review. I suppose that there is always an aggrieved party in a decision that goes one way or the other; people will feel that they should have had a certain decision. However, despite all of that, there have been only seven applications for judicial review. In only two of those was the CAC found to have acted improperly, although one case remains outstanding. I think that that suggests that the CAC has exercised its legal powers responsibly when they have been tested in the courts.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, made a fair point about whether the judicial review system properly reflects people&#039;s feelings about whether things are working well. I am inclined to the view that, on its own, it should not be the only test. The CAC has consistently conducted customer surveys among both the employer side and the union side. Those have shown a level of satisfaction with the work that is just a shade below 80 per cent. That would probably not be a bad customer survey outcome for any of us.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>I think it right to ask the two questions that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, also asked about the consistency of decisions, how they are reported and how people might know that there is consistency. The CAC members themselves&#151;and I remember this from the way in which the CAC was set up&#151;receive detailed training in their roles. They all operate with procedural guidance that the CAC has developed. We consider that that generally ensures consistency across the different panels and the way in which they process cases. We have lifted from the website&#151;I promise that I will not read it&#151;the very long document in which these procedures are set out. It comes very close to what one might regard as pretty specific codification and I think it no bad thing that that has happened.
<a name="time_6"></a>
<a name="40609-37_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40609-37_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>Should there be law reports? It is also true that on the CAC website there are full details of all the activities and cases. The amendment would not alter that; that would remain the case. At the moment we cannot legislate for the production of law reports in this area because they are produced by commercial <br>&nbsp;<br>

bodies which I presume engage in the business if they regard it as a credible business activity and there is a gap in the market.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>I apologise for the length of my reply but these are very substantive issues.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>I turn to subsections (2) and (3) of the amendment. These provisions place a duty on the Secretary of State to promulgate rules of procedure. I have touched briefly on the issues of consistency and reporting. The Government have examined in considerable detail this question in our review of the Employment Relations Act 1999 and concluded that it is not desirable to create procedural rules for the CAC&#039;s decision making under the statutory procedure. The CAC operates under a lengthy schedule that is enshrined in primary legislation. I am told&#151;I have not counted it&#151;that it is more than 27,000 words long, a little less than the length of a good-length novel.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>The schedule sets out in detail how the CAC should deal with applications under the statutory procedure. It would not be appropriate for the CAC to be subject to a further layer of procedural rules as that would complicate the procedures further and be likely to make the decision-making process more rather than less confusing.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>As I said, the CAC does not have the trappings of a conventional court with testimony under oath and so on; nor do the Government think it should. We are very confident that it operates a clear and rigorous process. The CAC currently produces excellent guidance for the parties which sets out its normal procedures so that the parties are clear about them and provides clear and relevant information about how and when their evidence will be used. It is an accessible and helpful document which I have read and, unlike some official documents, it is certainly clear. I believe it to be of far greater value to the parties than a complex and legalistic set of rules of procedure. The CAC has exercised its powers in this sensitive area appropriately. That is supported, as I said, by good evidence of customer satisfaction.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>The Government are aware of concerns that new measures to outlaw unfair practices will become new areas of activity for the CAC, which will be called on to make decisions that are different in nature from those for which it is currently responsible. I am pleased to inform the Committee that the CAC is considering how best to approach those new functions under these provisions. Sir Michael Burton, chair of the CAC, has indicated his intention to review the CAC&#039;s procedures in the light of the Bill. I understand that the CAC secretariat intends to consult all key stakeholders in the coming months to ensure that their views can be expressed on these matters.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>I was a bit surprised that the noble Baroness did not provide a role for Parliament in the amendment. As drafted, it would give great discretion to the Secretary of State to promulgate whatever rules she sees fit without regard for the views of any other party and without parliamentary scrutiny. I wonder whether that does not expose the statutory procedure to the risk that governments of different persuasions might seek to skew the procedure in favour of one side or another.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC101"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC101</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-37_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>The Government are of the view that, given its considerable expertise and experience, it is far better to leave this matter in the hands of the independent body. As Sir Michael Burton himself is also the president of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, he has both those points of view.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>I have heard a bit from the CBI but much more from the EEF about concerns regarding details that it feels are not fully clear. The body has been pressed on the point, but, apart from expressing a certain dissatisfaction, it did not tell us what happened, when it happened and what it felt went wrong. I feel that answers to those questions might carry us further.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>The Government do not believe that it would be appropriate to create procedural rules for the CAC&#039;s handling of applications under the statutory procedure, nor have we seen any evidence to suggest that the current approach is lacking in any way. Moreover, I believe that the amendment provides dangerous scope for elected politicians to interfere in the workings of an independent judicial body led by an eminent High Court judge without proper parliamentary scrutiny.
</p>

<a name="40609-37_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>I hope that I have covered the matters properly rather than just at length. I urge the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="40609-38_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   I thank the noble Lord for his very comprehensive answer to the points I made. I should like to make a couple of comments before I almost certainly seek leave to withdraw the amendment; there is no question about that.
</p>

<a name="40609-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>I shall have to read the Minister&#039;s reply very carefully because it was quite lengthy; by the time one reaches the end one is not absolutely sure about what was said at the beginning. However, I have tried to make a few notes. He said that I suggested that there should be a statutory right of appeal from the CAC in recognition and de-recognition cases. I made it clear that that applied only to matters of law and not to matters of fact. I was not going to suggest that, and that is not how I read it. I would not like him to think that everything should go that way because that is not the case at all.
</p>

<a name="40609-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The Minister&#039;s comments about judicial review also were interesting. I think he said that there have been only eight and that, although one case is outstanding, a mistake had been made in only two. Nevertheless, the CBI has made the case that there would have been many more cases had employers not found the costs prohibitive. So that does not necessarily mean that only eight people wanted a judicial review. They may simply have ultimately decided that it was best to let it go.
</p>

<a name="40609-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>I was very interested to hear the Minister&#039;s comments about the 27,000 words already in the rules of procedure. When I was talking about the rules of civil practice, I was told that they comprised very many thousands of pages, never mind thousands of words. So I understand that there might be a problem.

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>Clause 21 [<i>Information about employees to be balloted on industrial action</i>]:
</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="40609-38_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman </b>   moved Amendment No. 40:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>Page 22, leave out lines 38 to 40 and insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_5"></a><br>
&quot;&quot;(c)   containing&#151;


(i)   the lists mentioned in subsection (2A) and the figures mentioned in subsection (2B), together with an explanation of how those figures were arrived at, or


(ii)   where some or all of the employees concerned are employees from whose wages the employer makes deductions representing payments to the union, either those lists and figures and that explanation or the information mentioned in subsection (2BA).&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_71"></a>The noble Lord said: The Government&#039;s review of the 1999 Act concluded that the essential features of pre-1997 law on industrial relations should be retained. This body of law has become an accepted and workable feature of our employment relations system. However, some aspects of the law continue to trip unions up so that even where the unions meet the essential requirements of the law, they can still make technical mistakes that leave their action open to time-consuming and costly legal challenge. That cannot be right and it does not constitute good regulation.
</p>

<a name="40609-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>Clauses 21 and 24 of the Bill have been included to simplify and clarify the provisions requiring unions to provide notices to employers in advance of industrial action ballots and in advance of any subsequent industrial action. Clause 21 relates to the ballot notice and Clause 24 relates to the notice of industrial action.
</p>

<a name="40609-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>We propose amending these two clauses in very similar ways, though there are some minor differences. For the most part my introductory remarks apply equally to our proposed amendments. As I go through them, however, I should like to note the differences. 
</p>

<a name="40609-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>Let me outline the operation of the clauses as they stand. The clauses define the information that must be provided in the notices. The requirement is to provide two lists identifying the categories of workers involved and the workplaces involved. In addition, the notices must contain figures identifying the total number of workers involved, the number of workers in each category, and the number of workers at each workplace.
</p>

<a name="40609-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>The clauses are based on the information a union can realistically be expected to provide to the employer. They remove the need to provide detailed matrices. But the union&#039;s duty is clear and the essential needs of the employer are met. No longer would unions be required to supply data of questionable accuracy and usefulness to employers.
</p>

<a name="40609-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>Our proposals for the Clauses have been generally approved by unions and employers have not raised serious objections to them. However, it has been drawn to our attention that the new requirements could be improved on in an important respect if we made allowance for information to be given by reference to the established practice of deducting <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC103"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC103</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

union subscriptions at source where that practice exists, because of the formality and accuracy of the records involved. This system, which we colloquially know as &quot;check-off&quot;, remains widespread in this country, and covers many millions of workers. It is a common way of paying union subscriptions in large organisations&#151;across the public sector trade unions, for example. In practical terms, the system involves the employer deducting the subscriptions from the wages of union members and then paying those moneys to the union. I shall not describe the whole process, as I suspect that it is well known.
</p>

<a name="40609-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>It has been established through case law that unions can meet their current legal obligations by referring in notices to their members paying by this system. This arrangement has provided unions with a ready means of referring accurately to their members. It has also allowed employers easily to identify those individuals through their payroll systems. It is clear to us that Clauses 21 and 24, as currently worded, provide less scope to unions to refer to check-off information as a reasonable short-cut to meeting their legal obligations. That is regrettable and both employers and unions would lose as a result. Our intention, therefore, in tabling this group of amendments is to ensure that check-off information can be drawn upon by unions to meet, in whole or in part, their obligations.
</p>

<a name="40609-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>In relation to ballot notices, the key changes which achieve these objectives are made by Amendments Nos. 40 and 41. Their equivalents for industrial action notices are Amendments Nos. 44 and 45. I shall concentrate here on the first pair of amendments as the wording in the second pair is virtually identical.
</p>

<a name="40609-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Amendment No. 40 provides that notices may contain information other than the lists and figures specified in subsections (2A) and (2B) where some or all of the balloted employees pay their subscriptions by check-off. Amendment No. 41 then goes on at new subsection (2BA) to set the condition which other information must meet. Namely, the information must be such as would enable the employer &quot;readily to deduce&quot; for himself the same lists and figures. The only conceivable way in which a union could meet this condition is by referring to specific classes of employee who pay by check-off.
</p>

<a name="40609-38_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>I have one or two examples to illustrate the point; if the Committee is dissatisfied with the explanation and would like worked examples, I could give them. However, it would not be reasonable to go through them if the generality of the point of using check-off as a sensible way in which to work is accepted by the Committee.
</p>

<a name="40609-38_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Finally, a union will be balloting some members who pay by check-off and, inevitably, other members who do not. In respect of the non-check-off employees, the union will always have to provide lists and figures relating to them. There is no movement away from that. I can give a quick example: 100 union members are to be balloted, 90 of which are workers whom the employer employs and who pay their union subscription by check-off. The 10 others are not; they may work in another place or another department. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC104"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC104</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The union meets the legal requirements if its notice states that it is balloting all those employees who pay subscriptions to the union by check-off, plus 10 others. Those 10 others belong to such and such a category and work at such and such a site.

I wanted to describe the amendments because, although we want to lighten and make more flexible any parts of the regulatory burden, I do not want any noble Lord to feel that we have stepped aside from rigorous conditions to be met in the unfortunate circumstances where industrial action must be contemplated.

branches at the sharp end of the union&#039;s activities are not necessarily <i>ex officio</i> officers of the union. They are often volunteers, who are not paid and hence are not employees. On the other hand, unions, for very proper reasons, try to operate in a decentralised and local way whenever circumstances permit.
</p>

<a name="40609-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>It is very likely that the sort of records of the lists and figures that must be supplied in accordance with subsection (2C) are not in the possession or control of an officer or paid employee of the union but are in the possession of a branch run by, say, an unpaid shop steward. It cannot be right that such information cannot be supplied to the CAC because, with the best will in the world, headquarters cannot get its hands on it.
</p>

<a name="40609-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>In the case before the High Court of <i>Willerby Holiday Homes</i> v <i>UCATT</i>, the union unsuccessfully sought to excuse itself from providing information that was readily ascertainable from its local branch but which was not held in the union&#039;s head office.
</p>

<a name="40609-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>Proposed new subsections (2C) and (2D) are nothing less than an attempt to reverse the very reasonable and proper decision of the High Court to prevent any union that might be minded to do so from hiding behind a specious subterfuge. That subterfuge is to pretend that information in the possession of a branch is not in the possession of the union.
</p>

<a name="40609-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>I do not suggest before the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, or the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, that that is what they would do. Nor do I suggest that every union branch, perhaps one confined to a single, very large workplace, would, for some nefarious reason, try to withhold the information, first from union headquarters and hence from the CAC.
</p>

<a name="40609-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>But branches have been known to be at odds with their leaders. Branches may not have the facilities to comply with the requirements within the time limits, and, in common with some political parties, some branches like to guard their membership details from headquarters to preserve a degree of independence. This amendment removes that temptation from the unions and maintains the common sense decision of the High Court. It ensures even-handedness between unions and employers.
</p>

<a name="40609-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>It would be intolerable for an employer to pretend that it could not comply with a proper request for information under the Act because the data was not held in its head office but in some local branch. Any such attempt would, quite rightly, be given short shrift by the CAC and the court. The same rules should apply to a union seeking recognition. I am amazed that the Government should seek to overturn an entirely reasonable decision of the court in that way. I wondered where that idea came from.
</p>

<a name="40609-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>All the amendment does is to ensure that the pre-existing definition, as confirmed by the High Court, remains in force, and that a possible loophole to hinder the work of the CAC is not created. I beg to move.

I cannot think what incentive they would have in saying that they could not produce the information if that were not true. Nor can I think what incentive they would have in not giving names that they have. It would not make the ballot any easier for them to conduct. I do not know whether such a matter has ever caused any difficulty in a recognition ballot with the CAC; perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Lea, knows.

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>In response to the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, I did not go to the trade unions to sort out the matter, and I know not whether the EEF did.

<a name="40609-39_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   As I outlined when dealing with Clauses 21 and 24 on the law of pre-industrial action notices, the current law in this area has been shown to be too complicated. It places unrealistically high demands on unions and opens up the way for legal actions on what turn out to be relatively minor breaches of the law. Nobody condones a breach of the law whether it is major or minor, none the less the risk of running into a minor one, almost by misadventure, is quite great.
</p>

<a name="40609-39_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>It is probably fair to say that there are huge variations in union structures. I know hardly any unions that have the same structure as another. There are hugely complex layers of responsibility between paid employees, those who have time off to assist the union and others who assist the union but do not have any time off. That includes the national structure and branch structures, which the noble Baroness <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC107"></a>

mentioned, and often those at regional level and on a national level in Scotland and Wales. There is a huge variety of structures.
</p>

<a name="40609-39_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>Having thought about it in some detail and after representations, the Government concluded that the provisions of the Bill must simplify the law without giving ground on the fundamental duties and responsibilities of unions. We have made it clear that a union needs to supply only the information that is in the possession of, or under the control of, union employees or officers of the union. Both those terms were chosen not least because they are clearly defined. We can see in each case who is responsible and we can define them in a way that allows all of the individuals in the process to understand who is responsible. The formulation ensures that unions are not under an obligation to assemble and present information held by their lay officials around the country.
</p>

<a name="40609-39_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>The requirement is therefore confined to what the union can realistically be expected to assemble; namely, information held by, or accessible to, the officers and staff of the union. For a large union, this definition would cover information held at head office or by any of the regional or district offices and so on from which their full-time officers operate. That will often be a very large network.
</p>

<a name="40609-39_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>Trying to impose the same kind of requirements on the lay officials of a union&#151;to use the terms in exactly the same way as the noble Baroness used them&#151;would, from the experience of all those who have run such an organisation, be an extremely difficult thing to do. In some areas, there are people who are quite exceptional and have time to work for the union, have some support around them and are capable of doing it. In other areas, unions will have people who are not of the same ability or do not have the same kind of logistical support&#151;

However, there is vast variability in the quality of lay officials and in what they have available to them.
</p>

<a name="40609-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>The amendments seek to widen considerably the information on which the union must draw when constructing these notices. As well as including information held by, or under the control of, the union&#039;s officers or employees, the union will also be required to draw on information held by other officials or lay representatives. The union would be required to contact its lay officials up and down the country who, in most cases, work on union business for a very limited part of their time and to extract from them any information that they might hold. For large unions, involved in large disputes, we would be talking about thousands of people.
</p>

<a name="40609-40_para1"></a>

business. Their rights to paid time off for union business are limited, and have become more limited over the years, especially where a union is not recognised. Unsurprisingly, the ability to maintain accurate or up to date records varies from location to location. The ability to communicate that information to full-time union employees is also similarly varied in a way that it never is for the full-time officials, who can be instructed to do things and will have to deal with those instructions as being binding on them.
</p>

<a name="40609-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>The formulation used in Clauses 21 and 24 is based on the reality of the information systems held in voluntary organisations. We should not frame the obligations on the basis of the circumstances in which employees of the union operate or the circumstances in which the employers operate. That is why there is a duty on employers to disclose information in Clause 3, which is framed in a different way and is different in its scope.
</p>

<a name="40609-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>From what she said, I think that the noble Baroness may be concerned that unions may try to evade the law by deliberately switching information to their branches or lay representatives in order not to be able to comply. Someone would then say that the union tried hard but could not comply. I wish to counter that point strongly.
</p>

<a name="40609-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>Unions need good information in order to function efficiently. They need that information for many purposes such as communicating with their members, collecting subscriptions, reporting to the certification officer and being able to deal with any inquiry that the certification officer makes of them. It is not correct to suppose that unions will want to move information around to try to avoid meeting those provisions. I do not think that it is useful to amend the clause in that way.

<a name="40609-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>I have some difficulty with the amendments as regards clarity. They refer to &quot;officials&quot;, for which a definition is provided in Section 119 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. That definition refers to representatives elected or appointed in accordance with union rules. However, I am not clear what a &quot;representative&quot; means in the amendment, where it appears to be a separate category. It could include, for example, individuals who take it upon themselves to represent the union without express authority. I must say that I have run into a good many such individuals in my time.
</p>

<a name="40609-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>Pre-industrial action notices should be based on information that a union can realistically be expected to provide for the employer where the obligations are absolutely clear. The definition of qualifying information is already broad and includes all the main data held by unions. The requirement in the Bill ensures that the essential needs of the employer are met without placing an unnecessary burden on unions and without resiling on the commitment to provide that information to the employer. The EEF may be unduly apprehensive in these circumstances, with a perhaps not entirely realistic view about what unions can do on the ground.

<a name="40609-40_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   We oppose Clause 22. In Clause 22 the Government propose to amend Section 227(1) of the 1992 Act, which apparently has worked perfectly well for some 12 years, during which we have enjoyed considerable industrial peace as a result of the previous government&#039;s trade union legislation, which this Government are dismantling&#151;only slice by slice, but it adds up in the end to quite a long sausage.
</p>

<a name="40609-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>The insertion of the words &quot;by the union&quot;, which this amendment proposes, narrows the scope of those whom the union must ballot about taking industrial action. I find it ironic that in a Bill where the Government are providing for a greater amount of consultation between employers and their workers, they are simultaneously providing for much less consultation with the workers between themselves.
</p>

<a name="40609-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>Superficially, the proposal may seem to some, especially the unions that have promoted this clause, to have some sort of logical attraction. &quot;Why&quot;, they doubtless ask, &quot;should the union ballot those whom it does not ask to take part in industrial action?&quot; That is a fairly straightforward question. I note that the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, said, &quot;Yes, that&#039;s right&quot;. I understand his point of view.
</p>

<a name="40609-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>There are several equally logical answers for why they should. First, it is a fact of life that when a strike or go-slow takes place&#151;and they are the usual forms of what is euphemistically called &quot;industrial action&quot;&#151;woe betide any worker, even if he is not a member of the union, who crosses the picket line or works normally. He is quite often subjected to a degree of harassment, which often continues long after the original dispute is resolved. The enmities and bitterness engendered by the last coal miners&#039; strike continue in some areas even today. If a worker is to suffer the consequences of being expected, if not coerced or feeling forced, to take part in industrial action, with those consequences including economic loss and possibly the risk of losing his job or his <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40609-40_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>In the case of <i>RMT</i> v <i>Midland Mainline</i>, the Court of Appeal said, in words that I have just more or less echoed:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;It is overwhelmingly probable that there will be some . . . who in the knowledge that their colleagues will expect them to take part in industrial action, will do so . . . In those circumstances it would not be reasonable for the union to believe that . . . all such unballoted members would not take part in the action. It therefore follows that such unballoted members should have been . . . accorded entitlement to vote&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-40_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>I have pr&#233;cised it somewhat by leaving out a couple of words, but the meaning is the same. I am not sure whether the Court of Appeal meant to use the word &quot;members&quot; or &quot;workers&quot;, but in either case the meaning and the principle involved are the same. It is obvious that if there are workers whom the union expects to go on strike, either as a matter of union discipline or because of what the union would call solidarity, all such persons must be balloted. That is what the current law of the land, as enunciated by the Court of Appeal, says. There is no reason to change it except for the fact, I presume, that the unions do not like it.

<a name="40609-40_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   I may be wrong, but I thought that the words in Section 227(1) came from a much earlier trade union Act. This is a consolidation. In fact, I think that they came from an early Conservative government. The idea was that you wanted only the people whom the union wanted to be involved in the strike to have the ballot. Mr Tebbit was a suspicious man at that time. He thought that they might pack in all kinds of militants who would vote, but should not be entitled to vote because they did not have to go out on the stones. It would be only those people who were involved. I thought that these were old words that did not need to be changed, certainly not by representatives of the Conservative Party.

I have a feeling that this is one such occasion, for exactly the reasons that my noble friend Lord McCarthy has just given. When the Conservative legislation on trade unions came through in its sequence of Bills and Acts, there was a strong belief that unions would try to define the people who were taking part in industrial action with sufficient breadth to ensure that the vote for industrial action was certain to be achieved. If you could define a significant number of people who you may in fact never call on to take industrial action, but who were known to be pretty tough and committed to industrial <br>&nbsp;<br>

action, you would get the right poll result, and that would lead to the industrial action that you were seeking to take.
</p>

<a name="40609-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>On the other hand, it would scarcely be a fair or truthful reflection of the group of workers who were to be called on to take the action. I have a feeling that the Engineering Employers Federation, or whoever else, may now feel that there is a need to stand that history on its head. My own view, for what it is worth, is that in our legislation we should ask trade unions only to ballot those who really believe that taking action is the right thing to do, since they are the people on whom the burden would fall.
</p>

<a name="40609-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>Section 227 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 defines those individuals to whom the union must give an entitlement to vote in an industrial action ballot. Currently the section requires unions to ballot those members,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;who it is reasonable at the time of the ballot for the union to believe will be induced to take part . . . in the industrial action in question&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>Until 2001 the accepted interpretation of the section was that the entitlement to vote applied to those who were likely to be induced &quot;by the union&quot;. Those words were in the Act, and are also a quotation. However, the phrase from the Act, &quot;will be induced&quot;, has been shown, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, rightly pointed out, in the case of <i>RMT</i> v <i>Midland Mainline </i>[2001] to be unclear. The noble Baroness pointed to a lack of clarity that exists between the original intention and the outcome of that case.
</p>

<a name="40609-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>In its judgment, the Court of Appeal considered that the phrase related to any union member who might take part in the action, even though they had not been induced to do so by the union. In other words, the union had a rather serious dilemma on its hands, in that it had to predict how members whom it had no intention of inducing to take industrial action might act, if a strike were to be called among a group of people whom it did wish to induce to take action. Problems might arise; for example, if an individual were induced to take action by a colleague or took action of his own volition. A group of people might feel, as the noble Baroness accurately put it, some sense of solidarity that induced them of their own volition to take the action.
</p>

<a name="40609-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>The very varied circumstances described in what we have just been discussing are ones in which the union would be required by statute to ballot an individual, if that individual suddenly decided that he wanted to take action in solidarity, when it reasonably believed that by calling the action it might prompt the individual to take part. Clearly, it is difficult to foresee how that would ever be possible; I suspect that it would generally be impossible. Unions would find it very hard to forecast the possible reactions of the members that it does not induce with any accuracy. A consequence might be an overreach in trying to get lots of people to ballot on an industrial action who had no intention of taking it and who would never ask to take it, and getting a very distorted result in favour of industrial action, when the group that the union <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC112</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

wished to take industrial action might not wish to do so. We would find ourselves trapped by those circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40609-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>In the view of this Government, requiring unions to predict an outcome over which they have no control is unnecessary. Therefore, Clause 22 amends the provisions relating to entitlement to vote in an industrial action ballot and clarifies that the entitlement to vote applies to those who are likely to be induced &quot;by the union&quot;. I want to be clear about this matter because the changes from the 1992 Act are central to what is being discussed. The words &quot;by the union&quot; are not found in the 1992 Act. I hope that I have not mistakenly given the impression that they were; they need to be inserted by the Bill, which is the burden of the point that I am trying to make.
</p>

<a name="40609-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>This clause removes ambiguity in Section 227 by placing a reasonable requirement on unions and improving the way the law reads. I hope that the Committee feels able to support Clause 22 standing part of the Bill.

</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="40609-41_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McCarthy </b>   moved Amendment No. 50:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>Page 25, line 21, leave out &quot;eight&quot; and insert &quot;twelve&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_90"></a>The noble Lord said: We return to the question of industrial action and protected action, which, I am afraid, is at the cost of taking a little longer than I would want. I have to tell a rather long story because there is an historical context, which begins in 1992 with Mr Tebbit&#039;s trade union Act and his celebrated provision that came to be called the &quot;frightener clause&quot;. Section 229(4) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;If you take part in a strike or other industrial action, you may be in breach of your contract of employment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>I shall not go into why that went into the Act, but it did. It crystallised and specified a situation that had always been the case. Mr Tebbit said that. Indeed, the overwhelming number of workers who went on strike in the past usually did&#151;how could they otherwise?&#151;break their contract of employment.
</p>

<a name="40609-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>However, it was not really appreciated that that was the case. The clause did not act as a frightener or a disincentive. From time to time, employers have felt that it was in their interests to dismiss people&#151;or, perhaps, some people but not others&#151;on the grounds that they were breaking their contract of employment. If that was thought to be a very likely event, the customary solution was that the last thing that the union did before it returned to work, as part of the settlement, was to ask for a no-victimisation arrangement. But that only happened sometimes.
</p>

<a name="40609-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>The decision by the Conservative government to put in what was called the frightener clause has had a number of consequences. Apart from anything else, it has led to the current difficulty of trying to find some way of allowing industrial action to continue, given the frightener clause. Of course, if you do not want industrial action and you think that it is always wrong, you will not be interested in anything that might be done.
</p>

<a name="40609-41_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>As I said, three things happened. First, the measure helped undoubtedly to discourage strike action. It had to be put into contracts of employment, so the employers had no alternative. Secondly, in some cases, it stimulated more militant action than would otherwise have been the case. Most importantly, it wrote repeal on to the TUC&#039;s agenda. There was not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC114"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC114</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

much hope that the TUC would get anything done about that in the days when there was a Conservative government&#151;that is what they put in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40609-41_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>During that period, the difficulty was that the continental doctrine of suspension was discovered. They discovered that in other countries there is no problem because, every time you go on strike, your contract is suspended and it goes on the shelf. I am simplifying, but so far as the law is concerned one could strike for ever because the contract is suspended. What brings people back to work is the money that they are losing, rather than the threat of dismissal.
</p>

<a name="40609-41_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>Undoubtedly, it was going to be the case that if a Conservative government was defeated in an election and a Labour government returned the question of what to do about the frightener clause would arise. We have been talking for the past two days in Committee about the settlement, the balance, the arrangement, the negotiation, the fudge or whatever it was that the Labour Government had to construct between the CBI and the TUC when they came back into power in 1997. What to do about the frightener clause was one of the central issues.
</p>

<a name="40609-41_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>The frightener clause is still there; it never was repealed. It was given a period of eight weeks during which the striker was protected&#151;he could not be dismissed during the eight-week period of protection. But the parties had to make reasonable attempts to settle. That worked for a while or worked imperfectly for a while.
</p>

<a name="40609-41_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>With this amendment, I am arguing that that is not a satisfactory long-term solution. In previous employment debates, my noble friend Lady Turner and I have argued that we should accept what happens in every other civilised country; namely, that we should have the doctrine of suspension. It could be argued that this Government have signed international agreements that embody the doctrine of suspension but that they do not carry it out.
</p>

<a name="40609-41_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>We are trying to do something much more modest than that. There have been a number of notorious cases in which employers have deliberately filibustered through the eight weeks. They have refused to negotiate until the end of the eight weeks when they have dismissed the workers. In this Bill, something is being done to try to do something about that: something was done before and something is being done in this Bill. But I put it to the Committee that on looking at the Bill it is very difficult to see precisely what is being done to improve the situation.
</p>

<a name="40609-41_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>The best explanation is in the Explanatory Notes, which I know are not legally enforceable. There are two pages of Explanatory Notes. If the matter goes to a tribunal, it would have to consider how far the parties have accepted that the services of a conciliator and a mediator will be used. It would have to consider whether meetings have been held on behalf of the employer, and so it goes on. One wonders whether it would be settled within the eight weeks.
</p>

<a name="40609-41_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>The real weakness is that there can still be prevarication. We do not suggest that if there is another four weeks added to the eight weeks that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC115"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC115</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

prevarication would be at an end, but it would, at least, give some opportunity for the workers to have a little longer. Some people may think that this would result in a significant increase in industrial action, but we can comfort ourselves by looking at recent strike statistics produced by the Government. In a year when there were very few strikes, last year there were only two strikes that lasted long enough to be affected by this legislation. Nevertheless, it would be a modest way forward to adjust the balance. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="40609-42_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   This is a matter of some importance to trade unions and their members. We are referring to what happens where there has been legitimate industrial action within the procedures laid down in legislation. Currently, employees who are engaged in such action where the necessary procedures of ballots and so forth have been complied with they have a protected period of eight weeks during which time they cannot be dismissed.
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>That period of eight weeks is not long enough. If all the processes have been gone through, we do not really see why there should be a protected period at all and why there should not be protection for the whole period of industrial action. Since the Government have committed themselves to supporting ILO conventions that provide for the right of workers to withdraw labour, we do not see why there has to be any arrangement under which an employer can dismiss while action that has already had the support of existing legislation is continuing.
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>As my noble friend pointed out, there is nothing to prevent an employer prevaricating&#151;it has happened&#151;and deliberately prolonging a dispute beyond the eight-week period so that he can utilise that period in order to get rid of people that he wants to get rid of. That is entirely unsatisfactory.
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>As my noble friend has indicated, we are prepared to press for a rather modest amendment. We seek to extend the eight-week protected period to twelve weeks in order to make it just that bit more difficult for an employer to mess about and generally prevaricate so that he can get rid of a few people that he wants to get rid of. I hope that the Government will be prepared to look with some favour on this modest attempt to amend the existing legislation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="40609-42_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   I shall listen with particular interest to the Minister, which I hope that he will not accept. Before I say why I think that, I should like to make one general comment. The legislation introduced by my noble friend Lord Tebbit and the Conservative government considerably reduced the amount of strikes over a period. I agree that industrial relations are much happier now than they were then.
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>It may be that I am just ignorant of these things, but I have never heard of the frightener clause. I should be interested to know whether that word was used by the trade unions or whether my noble friend Lord Tebbit called it a frightener clause. I certainly have never heard that expression before.
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, said, this amendment would simply extend the period for which a striker is protected from dismissal from eight weeks <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC116"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC116</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to twelve weeks. I believe that eight weeks is long enough. It is long enough to concentrate the minds of both parties on settling. We could just go on and on with lengthening the time. In fact, the noble Baroness has said that she is not sure that twelve weeks would be enough. She does not know why there should be any limit.
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>Today, in general terms, there has been an extension by the addition of the lock-out period to the protected period. Sometimes it is quite a long time before the matter is resolved. I think that the quicker that these matters are resolved, the better it is for both sides who are involved in the dispute.
</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="40609-42_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   It is automatically unfair to dismiss an employee for taking lawfully organised, official industrial action during the first eight weeks of that action or subsequently where the employee ceased taking industrial action within the eight-week period. For the sake of clarity, the amendment seeks to extend that period from eight to 12 weeks.
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>This issue has been debated many times both during our consideration of this Bill and the passage of the Employment Relations Bill 1999. The issue was looked at in detail during the review of the Employment Relations Act 1999: it is right that it should have been looked at in detail and reviewed. One of two cases made it extremely important that that review took place.
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>The Government take the position that it is necessary to put a time limit on the period during which it is automatically unfair to dismiss someone for taking industrial action. We need to take into account the legitimate interests of the employer as well as those of union members. We also want to encourage the early resolution of disputes. That is the purpose of much of the effort. 
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>I should add that other protections extend beyond the eight-week period. Most notably, it is unfair for the employer to dismiss an employee at any time for taking protected industrial action if the employer has not taken reasonable procedural steps to resolve the dispute with the union. That unlimited protection is very important and unfortunately receives very little attention. It is hardly ever discussed because I think that the unions and others tend to focus on the simpler, numerical aspects of the protective regime.
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>After the consultation of the Government, in the judgment of the Government, eight weeks remains a fair period. The eight-week protections cover the vast bulk of industrial action.
<a name="time_10"></a>
<a name="40609-42_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40609-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>Analyses by the Office of National Statistics suggest that over a three-year period 93 per cent of strikes lasted less than eight weeks. If the period were extended to 12 weeks that proportion would not increase noticeably but the dispute would become more protracted and a scenario in which all parties would be likely to suffer.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC117"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC117</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>I should also add that there are measures in this Bill that strengthen the protections introduced in the 1999 Act. They do so in a targeted way, which resolves problems that have arisen in practice. One case which has been brought under this legislation has been at the forefront of thinking; namely, Friction Dynamics in which the employees concerned won their case. It is extremely important and has stirred a great deal of quite understandable passion.
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>In that case an extension of the protected period from eight to 12 weeks would not have helped in any sense the resolution of the dispute. The employer had already determined his position and the course of action to take however long it would have taken. Probably, most Members of your Lordships&#039; House would express sympathy to those who were involved in that dispute. As I say, the increase from eight to 12 weeks sadly would not have made any difference to the outcome.
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>The Government chose eight weeks for the protected period and at that time determined to keep its operation under review. As I have explained, the review concluded that this provision is working adequately. Extending the protection to 12 weeks might mean that disputes would become unnecessarily protracted. Furthermore, because the eight-week period is intended to cover the bulk of cases, the proposed amendment would only afford further protection&#151;if, indeed, it affords protection&#151;to a very small percentage of employees.
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>A point has been made in relation to 40 per cent or 21 workers or to any of the numeral thresholds of which this is another. There is always something that is potentially relatively arbitrary about a figure that is hit on in the first instance. I suppose that all of us who have concluded agreements&#151;whether as someone who has concluded agreements with trade unions as an employer or with employers as a trade union&#151;arrive at a figure for a pay settlement or for other arrangement that is not exactly what either side want. The figure lies somewhere between the two.
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>Someone could say, &quot;Is there an absolute and precise logic for that figure compared with a figure that is slightly wide of that in either direction&quot;. But the truth remains that it is an agreement. That is how the figure has been arrived at and that is why its durability is of some importance if it can be shown that it has not caused reversals of a kind that were never intended by the figure in the first place. On that basis, I ask my noble friends to withdraw their amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="40609-42_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   First, I shall deal with the questions asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon. I never said that Mr Tebbit had called the clause the frightener clause. He had a much more elevated way of describing it. I said that that is what the trade unions called it&#151;the frightener clause. It frightened people, which it was bound to do. I would not go so far as to say that that never crossed the mind of the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit. He said&#151;he had a case&#151;that people had a right to know. In fact, he did not make it as specific as he might have done. He said, &quot;You might breach your <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC118"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC118</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

contract of employment&quot;. But it is stronger than that&#151;you almost certainly do. It was the trade unions that called it the frightener clause.
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>Perhaps I may now turn to what the Government are saying. I do not believe&#151;I am not certain that the Government are convinced&#151;that anything terrible would happen if we changed the law to what we are suggesting. As the Minister said, it would affect very few people. I quoted the evidence from a recent government publication on last year&#039;s strike statistics, which are the lowest since the war. It is not the lowest since the beginning of strike statistics, but it is a very long time. Our strike figures are very low.
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>Most strikes do not last as long as the protection period, so it will not make much difference. It is not really credible to make our flesh creep while saying all that, and then saying, &quot;Well people will make strikes last longer&quot;. If strikes last for the length of the period, they are very unusual strikes. Most people who know anything about strikes know that if one does not win in the first fortnight, one will not win at all. In fact, if one is really going to win, one will win in the first 24 hours because people will be on the phone. I do not know of a strike that has been won after all that time. But people sometimes want to feel that they are sticking it out. Lots of people go back to work, other people never come out in the first place, but some people feel very deeply and they loose a very considerable amount of money but they want to stay out and they do. In the end, of course, they either get another job or they get the sack.
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>All we are saying is that this would be something that would make some recompense for people who are sticking it out on strike. It would not make it impossible for employers to prevaricate for seven weeks. One cannot make it impossible for employers to prevaricate but some might prevaricate a bit less.
</p>

<a name="40609-42_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>Finally, the noble Baroness has said that we are signatory to international obligations that say that we should do something better than this. But we must point to the fact that in many countries, particularly in Europe, there is a very effective suspension system and it does not lead to anything dreadful. It does not lead to anything dreadful because the reason why people return to work is either because they know that they cannot win or because they are losing so much money. So we are only asking for something that operates in many other countries. I find that continental trade unionists cannot understand why we have not had it for about 50 years. We have not had it and we did not do it when there was a possibility of doing it because nobody really appreciated that when one went on strike one broke one&#039;s contract. It was not a live issue. What the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, did was to make people conscious that that was the law. We are trying to mitigate that just a little bit but I am not going to get anywhere tonight. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

&quot;(7E)   For the purposes of this section, an employee shall not be deemed to have been locked out if his employer shall have suspended him for refusing or failing to work wholly or in part in accordance with the terms of his contract.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_96"></a>The noble Baroness said: Clause 25, which was originally Clause 21 in the Bill as introduced in the other place, was generally welcomed on both sides as remedying what was perceived as an injustice in the decision in the case that the Minister has already mentioned, <i>Davis</i> v <i>Friction Dynamics</i>.
</p>

<a name="40609-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>It extends the period in which a worker cannot be dismissed during a strike from the present eight weeks by adding any period during which the worker is locked out by his employer. &quot;Locked out&quot; are two words inextricably mixed up in the more pejorative lexicography of industrial relations. Indeed, there have been occasions when negotiations to resolve the substance of a dispute have been side-tracked by the issue of whether there was a strike or a lock out. For example, an employee, or a group of employees, refuses to adopt a new method of working, or to operate a new machine, so the employer sends them home. Are they on strike, or have they been locked out? Perhaps it is a bit like the definition of an elephant: it is something that everyone can recognise when they see it, but it is impossible to describe it accurately.
</p>

<a name="40609-43_para1"></a>

</p>

<a name="40609-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>The textbook points to the problem that arose as to whether the definition of the words to be found in Section 246 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 should also be incorporated into Section 238.
</p>

<a name="40609-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>It appears that different divisions of the Employment Appeal Tribunal took opposing views on this subject. As an aside, these differences underline the point that I made when speaking to my amendment to Clause 20 when I pointed out the need for consistency in these quasi-judicial proceedings. So confusing was this issue, at least for the purposes of the 1992 Act that in one case Lord Justice Eveleigh, a judge of the Court of Appeal, said that he thought:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;It would be strange if a strike for the purposes of Section 238 was something different from a strike for the purposes of the 13th schedule&quot;</p>

<a name="40609-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>In the course of the passage of the Bill through the other place, the Government failed to make use of the legislative time available to solve the problem by proposing a clear and unequivocal definition, if only for the purposes of this new clause. The Minister said that he thought that he hoped that the courts would supply a suitable definition in time. I have good news for the Minister: the courts have given a definition.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;What is material is that in my view the ordinary meaning of lock-out comprehends not merely the act of the employer in refusing to allow his employees to work, but the reason why he so refuses&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>The learned judge went on to give the example of a manufacturer faced with employees who refused to work normally on an urgent order unless paid at double the normal rate. He said that in such a case, if the workers were suspended, the employer could not be regarded as having locked them out. That is where the definition contained in this amendment comes from. It incorporates Lord Justice Glidewell&#039;s definition.

<a name="40609-43_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>At the meeting that the Minister was courteous enough to have with me after the Second Reading, I drew his attention, and that of his advisers, to Lord Justice Glidewell&#039;s ruling and definition. I hope they have taken the time to consider it very carefully. In the absence of an alternative equally clear definition by the Government, I hope they will accept the clear, unambiguous one that I have proposed.
</p>

<a name="40609-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>What is not an option is for the meaning of this phrase, which has been given even more importance by the extension of the eight-week period created by this Bill, to continue in the uncertain state it is in at the moment, with one Employment Appeals Tribunal ruling one way, and another ruling the other way, and with the Court of Appeal also finding great difficulty in giving a dear definition of the legal principles, in clear unambiguous legal terms.

<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>It is Parliament&#039;s duty to make the law, and for the judges merely to interpret it.

<a name="40609-43_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   May I ask the noble Baroness two questions? Her amendment says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;For the purposes of this section, an employee shall not be deemed to have been locked out if his employer shall have suspended him.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>That is a distinction from &quot;dismissed him&quot;; we are not saying that he was dismissed but that he was suspended. But of course he is not working, so he is losing money; he is suspended; he is in limbo. The employer suspends the employee&#151;says, &quot;Don&#039;t come in tomorrow&quot;. But all he has done, it is said, is to refuse or failed,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;to work wholly or in part in accordance with the terms of his contract&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>My next question is, does that happen within the protected period? If it does, the employee cannot be dismissed, can he? The distinction is whether he can be suspended.

suspended, in a sense the employee is subject to a lock-out, because the employer is refusing to allow him to work. He has committed no offence&#151;he is acting perfectly lawfully&#151;so is that not a lock-out?

<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="40609-43_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   Those are the words I have. The entire definition came from the decision by Lord Justice Glidewell in the case I referred to earlier. I used it simply as an example of what I thought, and the definition in the amendment comes from that by incorporating Lord Justice Glidewell&#039;s definition. It is not only the one covering an employer refusing to allow his employees to work, but also the reasons why he does so. Obviously, that is what would happen in this particular case. You cannot suspend someone for no reason.
</p>

<a name="40609-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>As I said when introducing the amendment, to give the reason is like trying to describe exactly what it is: you know it only when you see it. I gave what I thought was a fair example that if a rush order suddenly came in and the employer said to the employee, &quot;I would like you to help me put this through&quot;, because part of the employee&#039;s contract was to do that work, but the employee refused, if he was then suspended, it would be appropriate for the reason to be taken into account.
</p>

<a name="40609-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>I do not know if that answers the point put to me by the noble Lord.
</p>




<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="40609-43_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   That seems a bit odd. Any industrial action involves a breach of contract. If you take industrial action and refuse to work, you are in breach of your contract. This would appear to give the employer an opportunity to impose a lock-out but to call it a suspension.
</p>




<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="40609-43_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   That is right.
</p>




<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="40609-43_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   The lock-out would operate, although the employer would have said, &quot;You cannot come into work, but we are not locking you out. This is a suspension&quot;. I see no difference because the individual would have breached the contract of employment presumably in order to take part in industrial action during the protected period, but because the employer called it a suspension, it would not be a lock-out within the terms of the Bill. I cannot understand that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="40609-43_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   The noble Baroness has made her point, as has the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy. If it is necessary for me to look again at the wording, I shall do so. However, no doubt the Minister will have something to say.
</p>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="40609-43_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The 1999 Act introduced landmark new protections for employees taking &quot;protected industrial action&quot;; that is, official industrial action that is lawfully organised. Generally speaking, the new protections have worked well, but there are some areas where we think they could be improved, drawing on experience in the case of Friction Dynamics. That case showed that an employer might be tempted to instigate <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC122"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC122</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a lock-out after the action has begun and thereby negate the protections. In such circumstances, the employer&#039;s intention is to sit out the eight-week period and dismiss the employees as soon as it has ended. That is certainly against one of our policy intentions, which is that the eight-week period should encourage a negotiated return to normal working. Lock-outs usually ratchet up the tension in disputes and can often make it more difficult to resolve the underlying issues.
</p>

<a name="40609-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>Clause 25 addresses this by stipulating that lock-out days do not count towards the protected period during which it is automatically unfair to dismiss. So, where lock-outs are not used, the protected period lasts eight weeks, or 56 days. But where, for example, the employer locks out the employees for the first two calendar weeks of the industrial action, then the period during which it is automatically unfair to dismiss would be extended by 14 days. In other words, it would end 70 days after the action had begun.
</p>

<a name="40609-43_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>Our industrial action law, which is brought together in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, has referred to &quot;lock-outs&quot; for many years. However, the 1992 Act and its immediate predecessors have never included a definition of a lock-out. The interesting question is whether that was an omission because people could not describe the elephant or whether it was deliberate. However, when going back over the history, it is quite clear to me that it was deliberate. Historically, lock-outs take place against varied backgrounds and in widely different circumstances. We, along with earlier governments of both parties, have thought it best to leave it to the tribunals and courts to decide whether a lock-out has occurred, basing their judgments on the facts of each case. So we have followed this accepted approach and have not included a definition of a lock-out in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40609-43_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>The absence of a definition has not presented difficulties for the courts or others. The Court of Appeal decision in <i>Express & Star</i> v <i>Bunday</i>, to which reference has already been made, is a key case in understanding the legal position on lock-outs. I too want to quote from the judgment, but from another of the judges concerned, Lord Justice May. He said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;each of these cases must be decided on its own facts and merits and . . . I have no doubt that the best appreciation of what is or is not a strike or lock-out will come from either an Industrial Tribunal or the Employment Appeal Tribunal, highly experienced in these matters as these bodies respectively are. Indeed, I have little doubt that the draftsman omitted any specific definition of a strike or a lock-out because it is difficult, if not impossible, to draft a definition which is likely to fit every case and because it was going to be experts who would have to decide whether one or the other of these states of affairs had occurred&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-43_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>I am deeply sensitive to the notion that two non-lawyers in this case may end up juxtaposing Lord Justice Glidewell and Lord Justice May.
</p>

<a name="40609-43_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>We see here that the absence of a precise definition causes concern in some quarters, but the lesson of the remarks made by Lord Justice May is that any definition is likely to create more problems than it resolves. We know that that is the case because it is so hard, as has been said, to describe the elephant. That point was very fairly made.

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC123</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40609-43_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>It has been put to me that Lord Justice Glidewell did not define the term &quot;lock-out&quot;. He gave an example of a case in which he did not think there was a lock-out, and which the noble Baroness has described, and her amendment extrapolates from that example.
</p>

<a name="40609-43_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>I think that Amendment No. 51 illustrates the dilemma very well. It seeks to define certain behaviours that do not fall within the meaning of a lock-out for these purposes, but it does so in ways which are likely to narrow the meaning of a lock-out much too far. The amendment states that the suspension of an employee,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;for refusing or failing to work wholly or in part in accordance with the terms of his contract&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40609-43_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>does not constitute a lock-out. But in taking any industrial action, there is almost always a breach of contract. I would go so far as to say that it would be extremely rare for there to be no breach of contract. A lock-out is usually an act that the employer contemplates only in response to industrial action or because it is likely to take place. In most cases, therefore, this amendment would permit the employer to suspend a person indefinitely for taking or proposing to take industrial action while the eight-week period continued to run. Apart from the fact that this was more or less what happened at Friction Dynamics, the amendment renders the amendments proposed in the Bill almost, if not entirely, ineffective.
</p>

<a name="40609-43_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>The Government therefore cannot accept this wording as it would encourage retaliatory behaviour in the form of lock-outs against those who are taking protected industrial action. With respect, my noble friends sought to illustrate that point in the questions that they rightly asked. It would provide an easy escape mechanism for a ruthless employer to dislodge the protections, and it would substantially undermine the very purpose of Clause 25. From what the noble Baroness said, I do not believe that that was her intention in raising the issue.
</p>

<a name="40609-43_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>This amendment seeks to establish hard and fast rules in an area where, regrettably, such rules cannot be fairly applied. We need to leave space for tribunals to exercise their expert judgment, taking into account all the difficult issues they have to face. I therefore strongly urge the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, to withdraw her amendment.

</p>

<a name="40609-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>The intention of the amendment is to provide that an injunction should not be granted against a union unless the employer can show that he would be likely to succeed if the case went to a full court hearing. The reason for that is that from time to time injunctions have been sought and obtained against unions even when a threatened dispute was being conducted in accordance with the full requirements of the law. Nevertheless, the courts occasionally grant injunctions. The effect of that is to interfere with the right to conduct effective industrial action. As anyone who has had to run an industrial dispute knows, timing is often crucial. The delaying effect of an injunction, even though when the case is heard in full in the court it is lost because the union has followed the correct procedures, is serious.
</p>

<a name="40609-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>I understand that there have been several unsuccessful attempts to change the law in this direction since it is manifestly unfair to unions. If the injunction is granted but not complied with, the union is obviously in contempt of court and could be fined. Eventually that may take the path that leads to the sequestration of assets and so forth.
</p>

<a name="40609-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>I hope that, on this occasion, the Government may be prepared to consider what we are saying sympathetically. The law is not even-handed between employers and unions in this respect. Until it is, the positive right to take industrial action in accordance with the provisions of the ILO conventions which our Government support, and which we in the trade union movement have always supported, should be protected. I hope that my noble friend will be prepared to be sympathetic to this amendment. I am sure that he knows all about it because it is not the first time that this subject has been raised. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="40609-44_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   I am sure that the noble Baroness is correct to say that this is exactly the sort of amendment that the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, would have moved had he been able to be with us today. I believe that he is not very well. I hope that he is making a good recovery and that in due course we shall see him moving amendments and so forth in his customary way.
</p>

<a name="40609-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>I have listened carefully to the noble Baroness and I wish to put a brief question to her. Am I right in understanding that the court already has the power under civil practice rules not to grant an interim injunction if it does not think it reasonable to do so? If that is the position, I can say only that perhaps the amendment is not necessary.
</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="40609-44_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   No, unfortunately that is not the position. Although it has not been brought out into the open, we are dealing here with the effect of the <i>American Cyanamid</i> v <i>Ethicon</i> case. That was not a case in the field of industrial relations, but in the commercial field. Essentially, before that ruling, it was not possible to impose an interim injunction unless a number of things could be established, most important of which was that there had been some wrongful act. Therefore if the American Cyanamid case had not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC125"></a>

been brought, so long as someone acted within the protected period of around eight weeks, they would not be liable to an injunction.
</p>

<a name="40609-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>The worry is that, because of the way common law works, that case has naturally been transferred over into industrial relations law, so that now someone only has to have a serious case to consider, and the process then starts. That does not mean that if the court decides to consider the case that the injunction will be granted. The noble Baroness is quite right: it could decide against. But we are concerned about the basis on which it could decide to impose an injunction.
</p>

<a name="40609-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>No one can deny that an interim injunction is effective because the penalties that follow on defiance of an interim injunction are horrendous. On the other hand, an injunction is no real problem because it will take a long time to get there; there will be further and better particulars, which will go on and on; meanwhile the strike will go on.
<a name="time_12"></a>
<a name="40609-44_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40609-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>However, there have been industrial relations cases where employers have applied for an interim injunction and it has been granted over the weekend. Once you get the first trip into consideration, as a result of the <i>Ethicon</i> case, then all the court must consider is whether the damage to the employer will be worse than the damage to the union. If the court decides&#151;there have been such cases&#151;that the damage to the employer is horrendous, immeasurable or horrific, whereas the damage to the union is negligible, it will grant the injunction.
</p>

<a name="40609-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>It is not easy, but it is not too difficult, for an employer to produce evidence to show that a particular strike at a particular time will have very substantial consequences in terms of lost revenue, disruption and impact on the general viability of the firm. That can all be added up and a conclusion reached; it looks very impressive. But if the union can be subject to an interim injunction, even if it has obeyed the law, it will be very difficult for it to make or sustain the argument that putting off the strike compares with the easily calculable costs of the immediate strike to the employer. Therefore, they will almost always lose. The union will be talking about intangibles, saying that the dispute has been going on for a long time; that they have had a ballot; that they have done all kinds of other things to obey the law; and now they will have a strike. They may even be on strike and the strike may be winning or at least looking solid. But it will suddenly be called off indefinitely until the injunction comes to be heard in the normal process. It is the end of the strike. From the union&#039;s point of view, the strike has been destroyed by the granting of an interim injunction over the weekend.
</p>

<a name="40609-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>Once again, that does not happen in other countries and they seem to manage it. So we ask the Government to consider, not going back to the pre-Ethicon formula, but something rather less definite, precise and significant. We ask merely that lawyers look at the evidence and decide whether they are likely to succeed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC126"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC126</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

if a trial went forward. Lawyers can look at the evidence one way or the other; all we suggest is that they do not act quite so automatically.
</p>




<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="40609-44_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   This amendment seeks to change the matters to which the courts are to have regard when deciding whether or nor to grant an injunction against a proposed industrial action. I wholly accept that injunctions can have a critical impact on the progress of a dispute, that timing is fundamental and the stakes high for both parties. The union stands to lose the impetus in its handling of the dispute if the injunction is granted and the employer&#039;s business will be disrupted if the industrial action goes ahead. In the midst of all that it is important, therefore, that the arrangements concerning such injunctions are fair and reasonable.
</p>

<a name="40609-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>This amendment seeks to bring about a significant change in industrial action law. My noble friends would like to see various other far-reaching changes to the law in this area. I acknowledge that this is certainly as far reaching as any of those other changes. However, on taking office in 1997, we said that we would retain the key features of the law on industrial action. We reiterated that commitment during last year&#039;s review of the Employment Relations Act 1999. The Government consider the main features of the current law to be workable and that unions have, by and large, successfully adapted to them.
</p>

<a name="40609-44_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>We have taken steps, however, to simplify and clarify aspects of the law. I do not think that we are slicing it away, as has been suggested; I hope none the less that we are clarifying it. Our proposals on industrial action notices fall into this category. As a result, there should be less scope for unions to fall foul of the law through minor, technical slips. That can easily happen, and it can be extremely aggravating. It should be easier for unions to show that their proposed line of action is lawful and, accordingly, that the statutory immunities apply.
</p>

<a name="40609-44_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>When contemplating a request for an injunction, the court must look at the likelihood of a union establishing that it would have the protection of the law if the case should reach a full hearing. The amendment seeks to transfer this responsibility to demonstrate likely success to the employer or other claimant. This would be a retrograde step. The union is, of course, in a better position to know what has actually occurred; it is its actions, or failures to act, that are at issue. Therefore it should have the information at its disposal to show where the facts of the case lie and to argue, in the light of those facts, however complicated, how it complied with the law.
</p>

<a name="40609-44_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>I have referred to &quot;the union&quot; and will continue to do so, but it is worth bearing in mind that in principle Section 221(2) applies equally to acts done by others that they believe to be in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute. Though the onus is placed on the respondent, the claimant still needs to show that he has an arguable case and to demonstrate that there is a serious issue to be tried. This ensures that frivolous or weak claims cannot get very far in the process. So it is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC127"></a>

<b>9 Jun 2004 : Column GC127</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

not accurate to depict the current injunctive system as providing an automatic or easy way for the employer to spike the union&#039;s guns.
</p>

<a name="40609-44_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>I fully appreciate that the law in this area impacts on the balance of power in industrial disputes. I understand that my noble friends want to shift that balance of power a bit more towards the union. As I have stated, that runs contrary to government policy. I can recall in the discussions that led to the 1999 Act my honourable friend Ian McCartney setting out how those balances across the whole of the system ought to work. That did show what the policy was going to be, and we are adhering to that policy this evening. In no sense is it altered. I therefore urge my noble friend to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40609-45_head1"></a><h3 align=center>Iraq: Export Licence Application</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="40609-45_spmin2"></a><b>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </b>  Following consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry recently approved a further licence to export military list goods to Iraq. The arms embargo against Iraq remains in place under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 (2003), with the exception of &quot;arms and other related material required by the (Coalition Provisional) Authority to serve the purposes of this and other related resolutions&quot;. As this includes promoting the development of free and fair media, Her Majesty&#039;s Government consider it appropriate to grant exemptions for the export of body armour and helmets for use by media organisations working in Iraq. Such licences are issued with provisos that: items will be for the sole use by newsgathering staff and will remain under their control at all times when in use or in storage and items must not be left in country or gifted to local organisations after newsgathering staff leave. The export is consistent with the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria. Future applications will continue to be assessed on a case by case basis against the UN embargo and consolidated criteria, taking into account the circumstances prevailing at the time.

<p><a name="wa_st_2"></a>
<a name="40609w01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   Regional management boards are joint committees set up for the efficient delivery of the six areas identified in the White Paper <i>Our Fire and Rescue Service</i> as benefiting from cross-regional collaboration. Start-up costs, which are not expected to be significant, will in due course be reflected in the accounts of the constituent fire and rescue authorities. The information requested is not held centrally.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>The Government have no plans to establish regional fire and rescue authorities outside the three areas that are holding referendums this autumn on the creation of an elected regional assembly.
</p>

<a name="40609w01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a>In regions where there is a &quot;Yes&quot; vote it is unlikely that any new authority will be set up before 1 April 2007, and it is therefore too early to say what such an authority&#039;s annual operating costs will be.
</p>

<a name="40609w01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a>For 2002&#150;03, the most recent year for which outturn figures are available, the total expenditure of the existing fire and rescue authorities in the north-west, north-east and Yorkshire and Humberside was respectively &#163;249 million, &#163;108 million and &#163;169 million.
</p>

<a name="40609w01_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a>The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does, however, expect there will be considerable medium term savings from a reduction in the number of fire and rescue authorities, in addition to those savings we expect to be generated by greater cross-regional collaboration between existing authorities.

<a name="40609w01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   The financial costs of rebilling are among the arguments that designated authorities have made against being capped in-year.

<a name="40609w01_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   The process of demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of former combatants is under way in five provinces and due to begin soon in a further three. As of 27 May, a total of 6,819 personnel had been demobilised in Kunduz (1,008), Gardez (584), Kabul/Parwan (2,452), Mazar-e-Sharif (1,917) and Kandahar (858).

<p><a name="wa_st_7"></a>
<a name="40609w01_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   Heavy weapons cantonment sites in Afghanistan are controlled by the Afghan National Army (ANA), under the guidance of the UN. The heavy weapons survey, the first step in the cantonment of all heavy weapons by the September elections, has been completed in all areas, except Herat and Panjshir. Cantonment of the heavy weapons began in Gardez on 29 May and will now spread to the rest of the country. Usable weapons collected under this process will be used to equip the ANA. The rest will be destroyed.

We discussed Reverend Damanik&#039;s case with the Indonesian Ambassador at our roundtable discussion with NGO&#039;s in November 2003. We will also continue to stress to the Indonesian Government the importance of a fair and transparent judicial system, and of applying the law in an even-handed way to all. In April 2003 the Indonesian Government accepted our offer of human rights training for Indonesian Supreme Court judges. Five judges attended a human rights training programme in 2003. We hope to offer this training to more judges later in the year.
