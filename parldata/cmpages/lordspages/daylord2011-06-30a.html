<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="11063052000508"></a>"My Lords and Members of the House of Commons, I received your kind message of congratulations on my ninetieth birthday with the greatest pleasure. I have derived much satisfaction from the many years that I have been able to help and support the Queen. Few others, if any, have had the satisfaction of witnessing the affection and respect that so many people round the world have shown for the Queen since the beginning of her reign. I acknowledge that the position that I have held has made it possible for me to support and encourage a great many valuable and worthwhile organisations in this country and further afield. It has been a particular pleasure to be associated with so many organisations that have encouraged the development of the younger generation in this country and in the wider world".</p>

Yesterday, the Queen sent a rare gracious Message to both the House of Commons and to this House to initiate parliamentary consideration of the Civil List and other financial support of the Royal Household. In his comprehensive spending review statement last October, my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed that the Civil List and separate grants in aid to the Royal Household be abolished and a new, single sovereign grant, linked to a percentage of

Prospective acquirers will be asked to provide a view on the impact of their acquisition on competition. UKFI also expects prospective acquirers to lay out their plans for the company's headquarters and branches.</p>

They are still very worried people, although they appreciate the sympathetic response that the Minister gave on 16 June when this question was originally raised. On the other hand, they are very concerned because of the employment situation there and very keen on mutualisation, which they believe would be much better from the point of view of employment and as far as the community is concerned. Would the Government give serious consideration to that?</p>

However, it is important to recognise that the Chancellor believes that a sales process is most likely to generate the best value for the taxpayer, and that is why that is being explored as the lead option. Of course, the Government are committed to promoting mutuals and we very much welcome bids from mutuals as part of the sales process that is to start.</p>

Does he agree that maintaining a headquarters function for the bank in the north-east of England remains important? In that context, could it be a condition of sale that the Northern Rock Foundation, the largest charity in the north of England, should continue to have support from whoever buys the bank in order to maintain the good work of the Northern Rock Foundation?</p>

Incidentally, for all the very significant reductions in the number of employees that there have been, the bank still has a footprint of some 75 branches-little changed since before the collapse of the bank. As for its commitment to the foundation, the bank has a signed agreement with the foundation, signed in March 2011, under which Northern Rock plc agrees to donate 1 per cent of pre-tax profits to the foundation under a covenant with an initial expiry date of December 2012. It will be very much in the interest of prospective purchasers to make clear, if they want the support of people in the north-east, what their plans are for the headquarters, for their support for the foundation and for other matters.</p>

I was slightly troubled by what the Minister said about the commitment that has been made so far, because it appears to be a very short date. Could he perhaps be a little more enthusiastic, to use the word used by my noble friend Lord Borrie, about the importance of the foundation and put it more firmly on the agenda when it comes to issues of sale?</p>

The first thing to say is that not only has the foundation done good work in the north-east but its footprint covers Cumbria. We must not forget Cumbria. The previous Government agreed that Northern Rock would donate £15 million per annum to the foundation for a three-year period, 2008-10, and that commitment was honoured. Yes, the new agreement has an initial expiry date of December 2012, as I said, but it has the potential for a rolling one-year extension by mutual consent, to be agreed under certain terms. The door is open there, and it will be one of the things that I am sure prospective purchasers will want to take into account.</p>

These meetings are opportunities to discuss a range of issues and occur at both ministerial and official levels. Prior to, and during, the Polish presidency, the Poles have outlined their priorities as being divided into three general themes: European integration as the source of growth; a secure Europe in terms of food, energy and defence; and Europe benefiting from openness.</p>

Obviously, there are a lot of elements in this debate as we move forward to a new energy mix and the energy transition throughout Europe. Poland will play a leading part in that, whether or not it accepts the immediate renewables targets, because it is seeking to change its own economy away from a heavy coal base and a reliance on Russian gas to a more modern mixture of energy developments. That will include renewables and, possibly, the major development of shale gas and other unconventional gas sources.</p>

The proposals for the next multi-annual financial framework are issued today, so it seems pretty pointless to speculate ahead of that.

May I take this opportunity of congratulating Her Majesty and the President of Ireland on a very successful royal visit to the Republic of Ireland? In the light of this outstanding success, do the Government agree that it is important to build on the results of the visit in a constructive way so as further to improve relations within these islands and between the two parts of Ireland? In particular, do the Government agree that if Ireland, as an independent republic, was to rejoin the Commonwealth, or have a new association with the Commonwealth, this would be calculated to be of benefit to Ireland, and more particularly greatly improve relations between the divided communities in Ireland?</p>

The noble Lord is absolutely on the right track there. However, I have to reiterate that the initiative on which he is questioning me-membership of the Commonwealth-really is a matter for the Irish Government to look at. In many other areas I suspect that the state visit has provided an impetus and a momentum on both sides of the water for new initiatives to bring the Republic of Ireland and all aspects of the United Kingdom still closer together. They are our good friends and we are theirs.</p>

There is no doubt that, as we move into the 21st century, the particular nature of the Commonwealth, with its linkages, close associations, common elements of trust, understanding and friendship and its capacity to expand trade and investment, is the kind of club which many countries want to join. They look at the example of Mozambique and see a new Commonwealth pattern emerging, not necessarily precisely related to the old question of which countries were members of the British Commonwealth or the British Empire. It is a very successful platform for the 21st century and many other countries are queuing up to join it, which is very flattering.</p>

The unionist parties did not request it so that moment has passed. However, it seems to me that perhaps an application will only follow invitations. Will my noble friend undertake to explore with the Secretary-General and other members of the Commonwealth whether the Irish Republic might be invited as a guest to Commonwealth events, perhaps even the Commonwealth Games, to help move us in a direction whereby it would not have to make an application but would nevertheless be welcomed in?</p>

Secondly, does he accept that, in the case of Mozambique or, more recently, Southern Sudan, a decision to join the Commonwealth was left to the peoples of those countries, not through any encouragement from the United Kingdom?

Other countries want to be associated-they may not qualify as members. Our friends in the Gulf are all extremely interested in observer or associate membership if that can be achieved. Countries far outside the original pattern of Commonwealth membership are also very interested in what is going on in the Commonwealth, because it is one of the most exciting and developing platforms and networks of the 21st century.</p>

If in addition the bank was allowed to borrow, could that not be a powerful instrument for economic recovery and long-term development by mobilising shares for which there is no present business use?</p>

The reason why we have an enormous monetary stimulus through the interest rates-last night, 10 years were at 3.33 per cent-is precisely because we are sticking to the plan to reduce the deficit. Otherwise nothing else would be possible in terms of growth for the economy. Indeed, one of the potential downsides of handing shares out free is that it would have a negative effect on the public finances, which is one of the issues that must be considered.</p>

Can he see the strength of the argument that once the Treasury has its money back, best value for the British people might best be served by giving them some cash in their pockets to decide for themselves the best way of spending the upside of the privatisation of the banks?</p>

While that is one of the issues to be considered, there are other questions-of distribution, of the impact on the banks' own funding, of share overhangs and so on. All of these things would have to be looked at.</p>

Perhaps I may begin by returning to Tuesday evening and the brief discussion that we had right at the end on the issue raised by my noble friend Lord Greaves. He asked-and I called it a conundrum-why a petition signed by 5 per cent of the people calling for a referendum should prevail over a petition signed by 10 per cent or even 20 per cent against one. At first reaction, and at that late hour, it appeared a complex question. I have since reflected on the issue.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="11063052000060"></a>It seems complex because it is founded on what I might describe as a false premise-that is, that having a referendum is in itself the final decision on an issue. It is not. Having a referendum is merely a way of opening the door to obtaining the views of local people. In the particular circumstance described by my noble friend, there is clearly a difference of view among local people; and where a number of people-we think 5 per cent is about right, as we discussed on Tuesday-want to have that view tested in a referendum, we think that they should be allowed to do so.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="11063052000061"></a>So my short answer to my noble friend's conundrum is simply this. If 5 per cent want the issue tested in a referendum, then we believe that it should be tested. That is not denying choice to others. They can express their view in the referendum. As I made clear in my response to all this, it is within the defined scheme; and that is that unless there is a petition, the full council must agree to hold a referendum; and where there is a petition, the council must hold it if it meets the appropriate tests on costs, appropriateness, and duplication, which we will discuss in this group. These tests enable local authorities to exercise discretion and not to hold a referendum.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="11063052000062"></a>Now I turn to these government amendments, to which I alluded the other evening and which I think greatly help this debate to go forward. Government Amendments 120A, 120D, 120F, 121A, 126G, 128E, 128F, 128G and 129J all deal with the issue of the grounds for an authority to decline to hold a referendum, notwithstanding the receipt of a petition with the requisite number of signatures. These amendments address concerns raised during the passage of the Bill in another place that local referendums could be very costly or otherwise inappropriate. Such concerns were also expressed by the Greater London Authority and Transport for London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="11063052000063"></a>Members in another place also expressed concern that the Secretary of State exercising his power in Clause 47 to specify matters that need not trigger a local referendum could result in a council rejecting a valid petition for a referendum on a manifestly local matter. Having considered these concerns, the Government accept that, in line with our localist agenda, removal of the Secretary of State's power of specification in Clause 47 will not remove any necessary protections in the referendums scheme. If the amendments we have tabled are accepted, councils will have the power to determine whether a referendum should be held in difficult cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="11063052000064"></a>There are circumstances in which a referendum could be inappropriately expensive for a council or could cut across or effectively duplicate other statutory consultation processes for which there is also a statutory right to review or appeal. This would include planning applications. We therefore propose to remove the power of specification in Clause 47(5) and replace it with provisions that give councils increased flexibility to decline to hold a referendum in special cases. Those cases, defined as "special case petitions", are where: first, the cost of holding the referendum would be more than 5 per cent of the council's council tax requirement for that year; the referendum matter has been the subject of a previous referendum within the previous four years in that area; or the referendum relates to a matter subject to other statutory consultation processes for which there is a right to review or appeal. I have already given the example of planning applications. These provisions reflect our view that councils should be able to refuse referendums that are unduly costly or are on substantively the same issue as a previous referendum. They also reflect our view that the mechanism for local referendums should not duplicate or cut across existing statutory processes.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="11063052000065"></a>Where it is proposed that a referendum should be held across the whole of London, we want to be sure that the matter is truly a pan-London issue-as I explained the other evening to the noble Lord, Lord Beecham. We therefore propose a requirement that for a petition to be eligible for such a referendum, in addition to the 5 per cent threshold of London-wide signatures it should have the signatures of 1 per cent of the electorate in each London borough. This would prevent a situation where a matter of vital importance to just one part of the capital might attract a very large number of signatures to a petition-enough to reach the 5 per cent threshold across London-yet would be more appropriate for a referendum in the London borough or boroughs where the affected citizens live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="11063052000066"></a>I hope noble Lords will agree that these amendments address some concerns that are raised by amendments in later groups and will feel able to agree them. This will colour the debates that follow. I will address other amendments once they have been moved.</p>

I will not speak to Amendment 128A in the group. I spent some time last night and this morning trying to liberate it from the group but failed miserably. I am now degrouping it, and it will come back in the group that starts with Amendment 126A. I hope that that does not cause the Minister too much difficulty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="11063052000068"></a>I thank the Minister for dealing with such seriousness this morning with the question I asked at the very end of our proceedings on Tuesday. It was a cheeky question, but it is nevertheless one that people will ask because it is a fairly obvious cheeky question. I am grateful to him for dealing with it. It does, in many ways, underline some of the things that are wrong with the whole of this provision.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="11063052000069"></a>However, I welcome the main substantive amendment that the noble Lord has just introduced in this group-Amendment 128E, on what are known as "special-case  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1868"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1868</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>petitions", which are petitions where for various reasons the council will be able to decide not to have a referendum. I think that the phrase "special-case petition" is in some ways symptomatic of some of the things that are wrong with the Bill. What is a special-case petition? I can just imagine somebody spending a lot of time and effort getting a petition together and presenting it to the council for a referendum and one of the council officials ringing the organiser and saying that it had been classified as a special-case petition. The petition organiser will say, "Oh-thank you very much indeed. That sounds good". The official will say, "No, it's not. It means that you cannot have a referendum". It is not a sensible name and I hope that the Government think of a name that actually describes the process and the fact that the petition will not be carried out. It could be called an invalid petition, for example, or something similar.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="11063052000070"></a>The proposed new clause on special-case petitions includes the provision:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="11063052000511"></a>"The petition is a special-case petition if the proper officer of the authority is of the opinion that the matter to which the referendum question relates has been, or has substantially been, the subject of at least one local or other referendum held-</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="11063052000512"></a>(a) in the four years ending with the date on which the petition was received by the authority, and</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="11063052000513"></a>(b) in the area to which the petition relates (whether or not in that area alone)".</p>

<p><a name="11063052000461"></a>Therefore, there are two qualifying provisions for the authority to be able to say that it will not have the petition. One is that there has been one in the last four years and the other is that it took place in the area to which the petition relates.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="11063052000071"></a>I shall speak to an amendment on the second of those. Before I do, however, I have another amendment, which is bound up with some other stuff, that proposes that the period during which there should be a moratorium on holding a new referendum on the same or similar issue should be 10 years, not four. I will not be pressing that heavily when we get to it because at least we have a four-year moratorium here. Nevertheless, it seems to me that four years is not long enough. It will still be quite easy for people to bring back the same thing every four years and it will become very repetitive and they could keep going until they get the right answer.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="11063052000072"></a>I speak now to Amendment 128EZA, which would insert the words,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000577"></a>"or part of the area",</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000462"></a>where it reads,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000578"></a>"in the area to which the petition relates";</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000463"></a>so it would read,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000579"></a>"in the area or part of the area to which the petition relates (whether or not in that area alone)".</ul>
<a name="110630-0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="11063052000073"></a>It is quite clear that what the Minister has moved means that if there has been a petition in an identical area it qualifies as a special case and if there has been a petition in a bigger area, which includes the area of the petition, it qualifies as a special case. It is not clear what will happen if the new petition is in area larger than the area that previously had the petition. For example, let us imagine that there is a town with four wards. If there was a petition in a ward, and then the petition came along for the county electoral division,  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1869"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1869</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which might include two of those wards, the area would be twice as big. All the Minister is proposing at the moment is that it should have been substantially in the same area. I do not know what "substantially" means, except that it is quite clear that if they managed to find an area for a petition that was 10 per cent greater, it would probably qualify as a special case. But does it qualify as a special case if the area is twice or three times as big? What is to prevent people coming back with a steadily larger area if they do not get the result that they want in the first place? They might have a petition for a referendum in a ward, then in two wards, then in a county division that includes three wards, and so on. They might have these petitions every year until they get the result they are after. That is the question underlying this amendment.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="11063052000074"></a>While we are on Amendment 128E on special-case petitions, I have two more points. One is about the council tax requirement. I am one of the few people in your Lordships' House who does not understand local government finance in great detail, but I know that there are great experts here. What is meant by the phrase "council tax requirement"? Exactly what that means has a bearing on the meaning of the proposal that the Minister is putting forward in subsection (2), which he explained when he moved the amendment. I will not say anything more on that until I have heard what a council tax requirement means and decide whether I want to pursue it further.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="11063052000075"></a>Subsection (4) of the new clause is about not having a referendum if there is a statutory process and that statutory process includes giving members of the public an opportunity to make representations on the matter as well as statutory rights of appeal or to instigate a review. This is extremely welcome. It clearly refers to the planning system. It obviously refers to planning applications. I assume that it applies to local plan making because that includes a whole series of public consultations. It almost certainly applies to all licensing matters, so we are not going to have petitions on whether Joe Bloggs should get a taxi licence or whether a particular shop should get an off-licence licence. Do the Government have any sort of definitive list, or a greater list, of the sort of things that might be caught by this provision, or have they got further than planning and licensing in their thoughts on the matter? It will be extremely helpful if they have an idea of more or less the full list. We can probably never have a completely full list.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="11063052000076"></a>I look forward to the Minister's response to my amendment and to the questions that I have asked.</p>

Knowing the strength of feeling against Gypsy sites in most localities in England, we can envisage that if people can conceivably find a way of lodging petitions against anything to do with a proposal for a Gypsy site, they will do so. I was quite relieved to hear what he said, but is it his opinion that new subsection (4) provides adequate safeguards against that kind of petition which would be unnecessary because the protection, if needed, is provided by the planning process?</p>

Anybody can put forward a petition on anything. When planning applications come in, people often present petitions on planning applications and they are perfectly entitled to do so, whether or not my noble friend and I agree with what is on the petition-that is nothing to do with it. The point is that this is a provision for a petition that triggers a referendum. As I understand it, what the Minister is proposing would prevent a referendum having to be held on a planning application while the planning application is being considered, which would obviously not only be stupid but would cause such huge delays in the planning system that the whole thing would fall apart.</p>

First, I apologise to the House for not having been involved in this long and very complex Bill before. I am intervening now because I am a member of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which met yesterday to look at this Bill. We have a real problem with this incredibly complex Bill, and with many amendments coming forward, in understanding the full implications of some of the sections. I want to refer to some aspects of the report which is out this morning as a result of the meeting we had yesterday. Two of the sections relate both to petitions and hybridity and to referendums. I am not sure that they strictly apply to the Minister's new clause but they apply in general on the issue of referendums.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="11063052000080"></a>In his opening comments the Minister agreed the possibility of a local authority being able to decide whether it wants to hold a referendum, which is fine. However, in paragraph 31 on page 9 of the committee's report we recommend that regulations under Section 9MG of the 2000 Act, which is added in the Bill-they relate to,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000580"></a>"the conduct of elections and referendums the results of which have significant legal effect",</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000081"></a>and we had quite a discussion on that yesterday-</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000581"></a>"should be subject to affirmative procedure".</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000464"></a>I am sure that the Government will consider that in the usual way. Given that we only had an opportunity to look at this yesterday, it is quite difficult to get this in the precise position.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="11063052000082"></a>The other thing I wanted to mention, because it affects petitions and hybridity, is the recommendation in paragraph 29 on page 9 of our report, which refers to the hybrid instruments procedure. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="11063052000514"></a>"Given the lack of any statutory requirement to consult before making an order under section 9HF, the Committee is concerned that the disapplication of the hybrid instruments procedure-and thereby the opportunity to petition Parliament-leaves inadequate means to ensure private or local interests are taken into account when the power is exercised".</p>

<p><a name="11063052000465"></a>We wish to draw that power to the attention of the House, as we do in paragraph 32 to the,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000582"></a>"disapplication of the hybrid instruments procedure by paragraph 77 of Schedule 3 to the Bill, so that the House may satisfy itself that there will be suitable alternative procedures in place".</ul>
<a name="110630-0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="11063052000083"></a>I do not wish to delay the House with an issue with which I have not been involved and do not have great knowledge about, but we expressed considerable concern

There are others in our report, but the two I have focused on are, first, the conduct and the effect of referendums where they might have a legal impact. There was considerable discussion on what would happen if it went to court on an appeal. The second was this issue of hybridity. That is not directly relevant to what the Minister has just said but it picks up on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, about petitions. It is an area of which the House needs to be aware and I very much regret that this is all rather rushed from the way the legislation is being put through. My ability to assimilate this enormous Bill in the fewer than 24 hours since the Delegated Powers Committee met yesterday might put me slightly out of the normal amendment procedure, but the two issues have a general impact and I hope that the Minister will take them into account. I know that the Government will respond to the report in the usual way but, speaking as a member of the committee and not on behalf of it, anyone who reads our report-I hope that people will have a chance to look at its main recommendations today even though it is very short notice-will see its considerable importance for this Bill.</p>

I am one of the few without that. All that I want is to ask a question for clarification, which picks up on the questions raised by my noble friend Lord Greaves. It is clear that these amendments are intended to deal to some extent with the concerns expressed about planning and licensing. I should like to be absolutely clear. The new clause on petitions and special cases to be inserted under my noble friend the Minister's amendment refers to a special-case petition.

<p><a name="11063052000466"></a>From my experience as an MP, my understanding is that if it is your planning application and it is refused, you have a right of appeal. But if you are the neighbour or the neighbourhood who objected to the planning application and it is granted, you have no right of appeal.

It is a complex and important area, on which I expect we will have to have discussions as the Bill proceeds.

I have a number of concerns, which are perhaps not addressed by these proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="11063052000087"></a>Since I was in charge of my authority's finances for some time, it would be alarming if I did not understand the council tax requirement. In my authority the council tax requirement is defined in our budget resolution currently at a little more than £100 million. Therefore, 5 per cent of that sum would be several million pounds. I know that our authority is exceptional in terms of having a heavy requirement on council tax to raise its resources but I do not think that we would find that provision helpful in resisting referendums. I should be grateful if my noble friends would give some consideration to that rather brutal financial reality as the Bill proceeds.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="11063052000088"></a>As regards the other elements, the power for a proper officer to determine whether something has substantially been affected and might be the subject of a referendum was a rather localist answer to the points made by my noble friend Lord Greaves. In the light of local circumstances, it is probably reasonable to leave it to the local authority to make that kind of determination and I welcome that wording. Being an arch-localist, I am slightly less fearful of referendums than some other noble Lords in this Committee. Four years may be too long in certain circumstances but I can see nothing in this provision that prevents a local authority from authorising a referendum in less than four years if it wishes to do so. It simply defends the local authority against the vexatious demand to have a referendum more frequently than four years. If I have interpreted it correctly, I would be happy to accept the provision as a welcome offer by the Government and a very useful compromise position.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="11063052000089"></a>I have troubled the Committee before on this matter and I am afraid I will trouble it later on it, but I am worried about the way in which this alleged referendum right will operate in those areas of the country that are still subject to regional government-again I declare my interest, as I have done several times in Committee, as leader of a London borough council. This has an inter-relation with the position not in terms of specific, small-scale planning applications, about which my noble friend Lord Newton has raised a point, I believe, but in terms of the planning process determining a planning brief for an area of a borough.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="11063052000090"></a>Yesterday I read that the mayor, whom I strongly support and wish to see re-elected, had intervened on a planning proposal by a London borough. I do not wish to comment on that because I do not know the circumstances on either side, but let me give an example with which I am more familiar. There is a strategic site within my borough. For the last year or so, the council has been making strenuous efforts to agree, with local residents, a community brief for that site when it comes up potentially for development. We hope to have that brief adopted by our borough council before too long, subject to a public ballot. It may well be that at a later date, perhaps propelled by a desire for a community infrastructure levy, to promote Crossrail or for some other purpose, another mayor might come along and say, "This is not an appropriate planning brief for this site. We have a regional authority and a regional spatial strategy and we wish to propose a different use for that site". It might have more housing or less housing on it, more industry or whatever, and that could be put forward. What is the position then of  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1873"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1873</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the residents of a London borough in those circumstances, who have laboured to agree a community brief for a large site that may determine the character of that part of their borough? It has been their choice in the spirit of localism for a long period, and then a higher authority, a reasoned authority, says, "No, it is not going to be that way". Can we have a referendum on that; and, if so, by what mechanism?</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="11063052000091"></a>I agree with noble Lords who said we do not want to get into having referendums on every planning application; that way lies the road to perdition. However, I believe that there are circumstances such as the one that I have set out where-if we are charting this way towards genuinely giving local people authority over decisions that affect their lives, and the lives of their children in terms of the long-term decisions on the development of a substantial area of a city-it is clear that we must have some mechanism by which people have the right to petition against an authority that is overriding the settled will of the local community. Maybe my noble friends can assure me-not today but perhaps later by correspondence-that there is a mechanism by which my local residents can be insured against the fear of that happening, but I think there are serious potential difficulties. There could be smaller examples. Like my noble friend Lord Greaves, I am not clear on where the boundaries of the statutory right of appeal lie, and the noble Lord, Lord Newton, has obviously raised a point. My residents in this case, with their community brief, would not necessarily have an appeal. What about transport issues or something controversial such as parking? All these things have statutory procedures and provisions for consultation. Where do the bounds lie there? I do not know whether they would be open to petition or not. Again, I do not expect an answer today.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="11063052000092"></a>Let me posit another example, a real-life one from another London borough. I was speaking to the leader, who told me that a town centre improvement scheme was proposed by a central London authority after consultation with local residents. The local authority suggested amendments that were supported by the residents in a ballot, but the higher authority, in this case London Buses, came in and said, "No, we don't agree. We are going to proceed with our original plan". Do local residents have a chance to petition and say, "Actually, we like our plan rather than the one being proposed by the higher regional authority"? That is a much smaller example than the one of a statutory planning area, but it is a complex area.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="11063052000093"></a>I do not seek an answer from my noble friends on these matters today and I do not want them to feel that I am not grateful for the amendments that have been put forward. But there is a serious issue in the Bill in relation to the rights of members of the public living in areas where there is still regional government.</p>

We are here on the fourth day in Committee on this Bill and I have listened to the noble Lord, Lord Soley, with what I have to say is some dismay. I have certainly not had  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1874"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1874</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>his committee's report drawn to my attention, so I have not seen it. No doubt it is in the Printed Paper Office nestling among the volumes of other papers for us to pick up. I recognised almost all the papers set out there as things I have already. This is really a question of how the House works. From what the noble Lord said, the committee has made important recommendations, but they will have to be dealt with on Report, once we have had a chance to look at them. I doubt whether amendments could be tabled, debated and approved in the remaining days of the Committee stage. This does seem to be something that the House authorities might like to take note of. I appreciate the difficulty of the committee, faced with this huge Bill from another place. It had its Second Reading and we then moved fairly smartly into the Committee stage. However, this is not a very satisfactory way of proceeding. We ought to have had those recommendations before we started the Committee stage, but we did not, although I understand that it is no fault of the committee.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="11063052000095"></a>My second point is that, in welcoming the amendments that have been tabled by my noble friends, I should like to say particularly how much I appreciate the way the Government have listened to the representations made in another place about the question of a petition that might be called for by the Greater London Authority. The suggestion they have come up with, that there needs to be a 1 per cent vote in every London borough before the GLA has to call a referendum, is a wise one. As my noble friends have suggested, it will prevent a fuss in a particular area, one that might arouse considerable public opposition, forcing the GLA to hold a referendum at huge cost-estimated at somewhere between £5 million and £12 million depending on whether it happens on the same day as another election. The Government's suggestion that a 1 per cent vote in every borough would trigger the obligation to consider whether a referendum should be held therefore seems absolutely right.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="11063052000096"></a>My third point arises from representations that I have had-I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Best, will be interested in this-from the Local Government Association. Noble Lords may remember that, on the second day of Committee on 23 June, I expressed some dismay that the opportunity had not been taken in the Bill to follow through the general power of competence, which Clause 1 gives to local authorities, by substantially lightening the burden of central direction on them. I said during my brief remarks then that both the London Councils-I declare an interest as a joint president-and the Local Government Association, of which I am a vice-president, had said, "Yes, Patrick, we agree but it would be an entirely different kind of Bill". I remarked in my speech on the difficulty of trying to amend the Bill to try to remove some of what I see as retaining an over-complex power for central government to tell local authorities what to do and how to behave. Giving a general power of competence requires trusting the local authorities to do things in a sensible way. They are accountable to their local electorate if they do not.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="11063052000097"></a>I think that the Local Government Association saw that as a bit of a challenge. It has produced for me a list of amendments designed to return to local authorities the responsibility for deciding when and how to conduct  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1875"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1875</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a referendum. That is the good side. Unfortunately, somehow I only received that yesterday afternoon when I was engaged on other business. By the time I was able to turn my attention to the e-mail from the Local Government Association, it was clear that we were already too late. I will make the case that the LGA has decided on and give notice that I may wish to return to these matters on Report.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="11063052000098"></a>The LGA makes the point, just as I did on the second day in Committee, that it seems absurd in this day and age that central government should retain such an overwhelming control over how local authorities continue to manage their business. It draws attention in particular to Part 4, Chapter 1 of the Bill and the whole question we have discussed of holding a referendum. The LGA says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="11063052000584"></a>"This section of the Bill is symptomatic of the difficulty Whitehall has had in translating Ministers' localist ideas into legislation. Instead of freeing local people, and their councils, to decide how best local consultation and challenge should take place, the Bill lays down an extremely prescriptive process, managed from the centre, determining exactly how localism should work on the ground".</p>

<p><a name="11063052000467"></a>I have every sympathy with that sentiment. My only regret is that, like the report of the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Soley, it has come to me rather late. There will be another opportunity and, as I said, I will want to raise the matter again.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="11063052000099"></a>I shall want in particular to ask that it should be the local council rather than the Secretary of State who determines the threshold for a petition to trigger a referendum and that the Bill should allow the local council rather the Secretary of State to determine whether a petition or a signature thereon is acceptable-and decide what is a local matter.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="11063052000100"></a>That is spelt out in the Bill as something that the Secretary of State has to determine, not the council, which strikes me as being little short of absurd.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="11063052000101"></a>I want also to see the local council, rather than the Secretary of State, determine the conduct of its referendum, including choosing the date and deciding how to publicise it, who is eligible to vote, how votes are counted and so on. Are the councils not capable of doing that? There may be some that will fall short but so be it: if we are serious about localism and about pushing decisions down from central government to the local level, we have to trust the local authorities to deal with that. I am much encouraged by seeing nods all round the Chamber and I am only sorry that, because of the late arrival of these suggestions, we are not able to discuss them on specific amendments this afternoon.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="11063052000102"></a>I will want to return to this matter. The Local Government Association has now risen to the challenge that I threw out at Second Reading and produced proposals which would involve removing quite large elements from this part of the Bill in order to make sure that it is local councils that decide how they are going to run their own affairs, not the Secretary of State.</p>

The noble Lord is right, but I cannot help recalling a little ruefully that a few years back, I was a council leader and he was the Secretary of State responsible for local government. I wish he had spoken in those terms in those days, but better late than never.</p>

I did so at Second Reading, when I mentioned how I failed to persuade the senior officers in a conference of chief executives that the Government were entirely justified. I did not convince them, mainly because I could not convince myself.</p>

He is absolutely right in what he says. I, too, was looking at this briefing-I was in fact in Brussels until this morning and looked at it coming back-which, like the noble Lord, makes the point:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="11063052000515"></a>"The most ironic example of this is the power in Clause 44(6) for the Secretary of State to state what constitutes a local matter".</p>

<p><a name="11063052000468"></a>That is so absurd that it is just laughable. The noble Lord and this briefing are both saying that if we were to do all of this, and I suspect a bit more too, we might have something that could be called a Localism Bill. That is what this is about. If he chooses to return to this at a later stage, we will certainly be sympathetic to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="11063052000106"></a>My original intention in standing up was on the second point from the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and, for once, to congratulate and be thankful to the Government for their amendments on the pan-London referendum. Perhaps I speak as a London taxpayer as well. He made the points, so I will not repeat them, but the proposals are clearly both necessary and very sensible and it is very welcome that we will now have a sensible provision. Should there ever be a pan-London referendum, it will not be called because of some probably serious issue in some part of London that does not apply to the whole of London. By making this provision, such a referendum will truly be on a pan-London issue, as it should be.</p>

He liked that phrase and I liked what the noble Lord said today, particularly in relation to the Delegated Powers Committee report. It is interesting that it was compiled in such a hurry that the title of the printed document is the "Localsim" Bill report. I do not think that it has any connection with telephony. It is certainly very late and I congratulate my noble friend Lord Soley on managing to master as much of it as he apparently has. I have only just seen it this morning.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="11063052000108"></a>I agree with the thrust of the noble Lord's argument about centralism and too much central prescription. I do not entirely agree that it would be wise and safe to leave some of the structure entirely in the hands of local councils. Most local councils would perform perfectly adequately and properly, but we need to consider that there may be some councils which would choose not to develop a proper procedure and we need to protect the interests of those in those authorities. That, in my view, should not be done by the Government, but the Local Government Association itself should perhaps produce a model against which councils' performance could be judged. That is the local government family, as it were, assuming responsibility, as opposed to the Secretary of State, and it strikes me that, in this and perhaps other areas, that might be a better way forward.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="11063052000109"></a>The noble Lord, Lord True, referred to areas with regional governments. Of course, thanks to the present Government's "settled determination", in the phrase of the noble Lord, to abolish all regional structures except that in London-it is only London that is privileged to have a regional body, although it is a privilege that the noble Lord may not be too comfortable with-it is probably right to encourage and facilitate petitions for the kind of issues that the noble Lord referred to, rather than referendums, in the same way that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, answered the question put to him earlier.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="11063052000110"></a>Having said all that, I thank and congratulate the Government for responding so constructively to so many of the points that have been raised around these issues. It is very welcome. I particularly celebrate the removal of Clause 47(5), which stipulated that the third ground for determination was,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000585"></a>"that the referendum question related to a matter specified by order by the Secretary of State".</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000111"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, I think, tabled an amendment to that effect and the Minister has adopted it, if not him. That is also very welcome.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="11063052000112"></a>My last point relates to the strange provision about the cost of a referendum. The noble Lord, Lord True, referred to the figure of around £1 million as representing about 5 per cent of the council tax requirement of his authority. I believe that it is roughly the same-the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, may recall and confirm, or otherwise-in Newcastle. There will be many authorities where 5 per cent is an enormous amount of money. If an authority presented and circulated petitions inscribed in gold leaf on vellum, it would still not reach 5 per cent of most councils' expenditure. It seems a ridiculous figure. I wonder whether a decimal point has been missed somewhere-the printers have clearly had difficulties with the Bill, as I have already indicated. Five per cent seems extraordinary and I wonder whether any proper estimate has been made-or any estimate at all-by the Government, or those advising them, about what the cost of a referendum, perhaps on a city-wide basis, or district council basis, to take a lower level, would be. It may be that, if we are going to have guidance of this kind, differential provision ought to be made according to the size of the authority; perhaps something on a per capita basis, rather than on a percentage of revenue.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="11063052000113"></a>If we are to have a cap, as it were, of a percentage kind, should that relate to an individual referendum, or cumulatively? If there were a large number of referendums in the authority of the noble Lord, Lord True, or in mine, or in any other, one could reach even the high figure. I do not ask the Minister to respond to that thought, which has only just occurred to me-I cannot expect him to answer that-but it might be considered when he looks again, as I hope he will agree to do, at this provision. I welcome the provision; it is right that there should be some consideration of a financial limit by an officer-rather than a member in this case-but the one suggested seems to have little justification and little relationship to reality on the ground.</p>

A number of interesting points have been raised which probe again at the boundaries of the referendum principle. Noble Lords are right to point to the balance between the Secretary of State and local authorities, but on examination they will discover that the powers of the Secretary of State are residual powers, usually to modify arrangements as a result of experience, rather than to impose a pattern of governance on local authorities throughout the Bill. However, some forms, some articulation of the form of referendums and suchlike are in legislation, because Parliament exists to ensure that, in the context of a citizen's relationship with a local authority, there are certain rights. If a referendum is considered to be something which citizens can combine collectively to seek, those rights need to be established in law and it is Parliament's job to establish them in law. I ask noble Lords to differentiate between the two things.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="11063052000115"></a>It was said-in jest, I hope-that the Secretary of State was empowered to decide what was local. If noble Lords had looked at our amendments, they would know that our amendment removes that power from the Secretary of State. My noble friend Lord Jenkin asked whether we can leave it to local authorities to decide when and how to conduct referendums. I have made the point about the protection of the citizen within local government. We could, of course, leave it to local authorities, but localism is about more than empowering local authorities, it is also about empowering people. This part of the Bill enables local people to require a referendum, but contains some sensible safeguards to combat abuse. I hope that my noble friend will be able to see the Government's position in that context.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="11063052000116"></a>I, too, received the Local Government Association briefing asking me to table some amendments and to speak in its support-it is very wide in its mailings. However, that was drawn up before the Government's amendments were known, so some of its criticisms-it generally welcomed many of the provisions of the Bill in this area-were made without the advantage that we now have of knowing what the Government's proposals are.</p>

Under the approach that we have taken, it would be for councils to decide. We have no list. Amendments in a later group illustrate just how difficult such a list would be to apply. It is up to local authorities to decide what is excluded under the special case provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="11063052000118"></a>My noble friend Lord Greaves asked whether a petition would qualify as a special case if it covered a large area. Yes, it would. The council would be able to refuse such a petition under the provisions as drafted. He also asked what "substantially" meant. I can give him only a quasi-legalistic answer: it means more than incidentally. I hope that that helps him in his appreciation of that.</p>

However, there is now another report-indeed, the ink is scarcely dry on it; it is rubbing off on my hands here-about these matters. I reassure the noble Lord that in general terms we take the opinions of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee seriously, and it is likely that we will respond positively to its suggestions and observations. I hope that the committee will accept that.</p>

As he said, though, it clearly says in subsection (4) of his long new amendment about special case petitions that it is a statutory process by which there is a statutory right to appeal or to instigate a review. Surely it is not the job of a local authority to decide what is a statutory matter. A statutory matter is set out in law, so there might be a bit of interpretation to take place but by and large the local authority's hands would be tied.</p>

We were concerned, rightly, that the costs should not be disproportionate to the budget, and that is why that provision was made. It is not a cap or an upper limit on how much can be spent on a referendum, but it means that no local authority should be subject to a disproportionate proportion of its budget being spent on any one referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="11063052000132"></a>I was asked about the whole business of planning briefs and indicative planning. My noble friend Lord True kindly suggested that I might write to him and other noble Lords on this issue. It is probably a good thing that I do so, defining the nature of this general view of that planning applications are in fact subject to the special case treatment. There is the question of indicative plans and planning briefs, and I would like to make the position on those absolutely clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="11063052000133"></a>My noble friend asked how referendum schemes will operate in areas where there is regional government. The Government are committed to abolishing regional spatial strategies. I have already set out the details of how our amendments will ensure that London-wide referendums will take place only on true London planning issues.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="11063052000134"></a>I have explained to the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, my point about the cap. We have some information about what we estimate to be the cost of a referendum. Our impact assessment estimates the cost to be between approximately 50p and £1.50 per voter, depending on whether or not it is held with an election. I think that I have covered the questions raised.</p>

Looking at it objectively, though, I am bound to say that the whole area of the application of planning policy would turn into a nightmare world, so I very much welcome the clarity of what has been said.</p>

I would not normally come back on this issue, but it is very important. The job of the Members of this House and of the House of Commons is to hold the Executive to account. I had a note put into my hands a few moments ago from <I>Hansard</I> saying:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="11063052000516"></a>"Please may we have sight of the report you quoted from".</p>

<p><a name="11063052000469"></a>The note then says in brackets:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="11063052000517"></a>"(The copy from the Printed Paper Office finishes on page 8 with section 25)".</p>

<p><a name="11063052000470"></a>Of course, I was quoting from clauses after that. I picked up the papers just before Questions finished. This means that anybody else who came into the House for this debate this morning probably would not have got a copy of that report; here I am grateful for the comments and support of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. It is hard to hold the Executive to account if Members cannot get a copy of a report which is regarded as important by the House in all cases.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="11063052000140"></a>Having handed the note in-which is I why I was not in my place when the Minister referred to me, as I was trying to get it-it has now gone, and they are now going around looking for another report. It is deeply unsatisfactory. One reason the Government are getting into problems in a number of areas is that business management is failing. The noble Lord, Lord Newton, and other Members on that side of the House who have been familiar with managing government business in previous years will know precisely what I mean by this.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="11063052000141"></a>I emphasise that, like all members of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, I am aware of the sort of Bills we will have to look at in advance. When you get something like this, you make yourself aware of the basics but do not get down to the detail until you are close to the date of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee meeting and when you are in that meeting. You have to go into the small print to get it in order and so it is very difficult to speak to it the following day when the report has not been available to any Members of the House except those who were fortunate enough to get a copy before I picked up what must have been one of the last ones. That is deeply unsatisfactory. The Government should take this very seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="11063052000142"></a>I know that the Government take seriously the reports of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. Indeed, since I have been a member, most of our recommendations have been accepted. This Minister, most notably, has been very good on this as well. However, we are looking at how the Executive are held to account by the House. To have a situation develop where a particularly complicated and large Bill like this is before the House and an important report from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee is not readily available must cause concern. You cannot even refer to it. Obviously, I knew what the arguments were because I was in the committee meeting yesterday, but it is not satisfactory and I think a number of Members know it. Although I welcome the Minister's comments that he will be taking on board the committee's report, that is like saying, "We hope that we will be able to meet the committee's concerns" when it might be too late after that until we get to Third Reading.</p>

I make no criticism of either the committee or the House authorities. I am grateful that we have indeed had the observations of the report on the Bill. It is a pity that they are last minute, and I was not aware that copies were not available. I picked one up as I came in. I had a hasty look at it; we did not have very long before we started.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="11063052000147"></a>"Mr Speaker, earlier today I placed a Written Statement before the House outlining the next steps in my consideration of the potential merger between News Corporation and BSkyB.

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="11063052000148"></a>As I outlined, the consultation did not produce any information which caused Ofcom or the OFT to change its earlier advice to me. I could have decided to accept

However, a number of constructive changes have been suggested and, as a result, I am today publishing a revised, more robust, set of undertakings and will be consulting on them until midday on Friday 8 July.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="11063052000149"></a>Significantly these changes strengthen further the arrangements for editorial independence and business viability of the new spun-off Sky News. In my view, they provide a further layer of very important safeguards. As amended, I believe that these undertakings will remedy, mitigate or prevent the threats to plurality which were identified at the start of this process. If, after this next consultation process, nothing arises which changes this view, I propose to accept the undertakings in lieu of a reference to the Competition Commission. Before coming to this view, though, I will of course seek once again the advice of the independent external regulators".</p>

I do not think that its content has come as a surprise to anyone in your Lordships' Chamber. What has come as a surprise is the fact that, knowing the degree of interest in this subject in both Houses and among the wider public, the Secretary of State has tried to slip this decision out rather than coming to the other place to make a proper Oral Statement.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="11063052000151"></a>This is the continuation of a rather sad state of affairs. The initial delay supposedly arose from the need for a consultation on the Secretary of State's in-principle decision. As the Minister made clear at the time:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="11063052000518"></a>"I am opening a consultation period, during which time all interested parties will be able to express their views on the undertakings. Once I have considered representations, I will reach a decision on whether I still believe that the undertakings should be accepted".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 3/3/11; col. 519.]</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="11063052000152"></a>I am curious to know what responses were received to that consultation. For example, did the Secretary of State take into account the views of the public, who, after all, have a keen interest in maintaining diverse news sources? If so, what is the Minister's response to the fact that a recent poll showed that 64 per cent of the public are opposed to the merger because they think that it will give News Corp too much power? Or did the Secretary of State take into account the submissions made from the Alliance of Media Organisations, representing most of the media household names, including BT, Guardian Media, Associated Newspapers, Trinity Mirror, Northcliffe Media and the Telegraph group, all of which wrote to oppose the merger? They argued, among other things, that Newco would not be independent but would be economically dependent on News Corporation; that there are insufficient safeguards for editorial independence; and that the proposals put too much power in the hands of the Culture Secretary rather than independent regulators. Can the Minister confirm whether these views have been taken into account? It appears, on the face of it, that the only organisation which remains enthusiastically in favour of the merger is News Corp itself.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="11063052000153"></a>There is a fault line at the very heart of the process which the Secretary of State has adopted for the consultation, because by narrowing down the debate  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1884"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1884</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the content of the undertakings originally offered up by News Corp it neatly sidesteps the much wider concerns about plurality which still exist but which the Secretary of State chose to ignore when he made the decision not to refer the whole issue to the Competition Commission, which he could have done quite legitimately and which would have been the correct course of action pursued by these Benches in these circumstances.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="11063052000154"></a>This decision is taking place against a backdrop of outstanding legal cases arising from the phone-hacking scandal, and other noble Lords may wish to comment on that. Of course, the current police investigation must pursue its course to enable those responsible to be brought to justice. However, it undoubtedly brings into question whether this is the right time, when so many questions still hang over the ethical principles underlying News Corp, to give it so much additional media power in this country. I very much hope that the Minister will support our call for an independent inquiry into press standards once the investigations are complete.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="11063052000155"></a>I have a number of specific questions for the Minister. First, the new deadline for the latest consultation is 8 July. That is an eight-day consultation. In the previous consultation the media organisations in particular protested that there was insufficient time for them to formulate a detailed response. What chance have they got on this occasion, and how can the Minister be serious about conducting a proper consultation in such a short period?</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="11063052000156"></a>Secondly, given the further consultation taking place, when does the Minister intend to bring the matter back to the House to enable a full debate to take place? Thirdly, to enable a full debate to take place, will the Government give a commitment to publish not only the latest undertakings but the full independent legal advice on all aspects of the acquisition which the Government have received? Fourthly, is the Minister now able to state categorically that the financial and editorial independence of Newco has been prescribed in such a way that there cannot be a seepage of influence or control back to the main News Corp board? Finally, can the Minister give an assurance that the shareholder register for Newco will be published so that there is full transparency regarding the ownership of that company?</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="11063052000157"></a>This is not a great day for media plurality or British journalism. I foresee that in years to come there will be cause for many people who believe in open democratic debate to rue the day that we allowed so much power and influence to be centralised in one media organisation. I do not know what it would take to persuade the Secretary of State to carry out one of the Government's infamous U-turns, but on this issue I can assure the Minister that it would be widely welcomed across both Houses and among the wider public.</p>

There was no surprise as there has been ultimate transparency: at every stage of this discussion, debate and decision-taking the Secretary of State has published every single document relating to his meetings.  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1885"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1885</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The 2002 Act, which was passed by the noble Baroness's Government, gave authority to the elected Secretary of State to take these decisions. Hacking, which is a very serious problem, will no doubt come up in further questions, so I will leave it for now and try-as the noble Baroness has asked so many questions-to answer her other points. As for coming back to the House, that, of course, is the responsibility of the usual channels.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="11063052000159"></a>On 3 March the Secretary of State informed the House that, based on advice he had received from the Office of Fair Trading and Ofcom, he was minded to accept the undertakings offered by News Corp in lieu of a reference to the Competition Commission. As the Enterprise Act 2002 requires, he published these undertakings for public consultation which ended on 21 March.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="11063052000160"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the representations. The Secretary of State received more than 40,000 representations to this consultation, including a very large number of near-identical responses as a result of internet campaigns. The summaries of the main responses are on the DCMS website. He met representatives from Trinity Mirror, Guardian Media Group, Telegraph Media Group, Associated News and Media and Slaughter and May on 24 March, and met Avaaz on 15 April. Notes of these meetings will be published at the end of the process. The substantive points have been carefully considered by the Secretary of State, advised by the independent regulators. Regarding the public values, Sky will have less power than it has at the moment and will be cross-promoting for stability in financial areas.</p>

It was only when two PNQs-one in this House and one in the Commons-were tabled that we had the Statement that we have just heard. Will my noble friend tell the Secretary of State that it would have been much better to have freely volunteered an Oral Statement in both Houses? That would have been much more convenient for Parliament. This is an important decision but, frankly, we are now being presented with a done deal. Therefore, I have two questions. First, would a British company be allowed to take full control of an American media company, or is it not the case that we are limited to a maximum stake of 20 or 25 per cent? What are the Government doing to break down that barrier? Secondly, is it not clear that we have a position today in which too much market power over the British media is being exercised by one company? I hope that the Government recognise that very many people in this country regard this concentration of power as unacceptable. I urge the Government, even at this very late stage, to review and strengthen the rules on media plurality.</p>

Given recent events and controversy surrounding the acquisition of BSkyB and the fact that in March the Secretary of State said that the existing check on media plurality "may not be as robust as it should be", and ahead of the upcoming and very important communications Bill, is it not time that the Government set up an independent commission to look at the issue of plurality in order to ensure that, in future, we have a robust mechanism for dealing with threats to media plurality?</p>

She is absolutely right that plurality is one of the major concerns at the heart of this. During the consultation period a number of issues were raised that were not material to the issue of media plurality. A number of respondents raised competition issues, which were dealt with by the European Commission, but the Secretary of State said today in the other place that he would be looking further at various areas of plurality. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for raising that point. I add to my response to my noble friend Lord Fowler: the previous Administration removed foreign ownership restrictions, which is why foreign companies can buy UK media companies.</p>

The undertakings provided by News Corporation provide a stronger degree of independence for Sky than the original provisions for the <I>Times</I>. Those safeguards operate at a number of levels and, taken together, should make certain the editorial independence of Sky News. In particular, to cover concerns expressed by the noble Lord, News Corporation will remain a minority owner. The new company will have a majority of independent directors and be independently chaired. At least one independent director must have senior editorial or journalistic experience, and the company's articles of association explicitly contain the principle of editorial independence and integrity in news reporting. There will be a corporate governance and editorial committee to make certain that there is compliance with those requirements, which will also have a majority of independent directors and be independently chaired. The Secretary of State feels that, with those new, binding words, he is and the public should be totally satisfied.</p>

It is about the credibility of the person who is purchasing BSkyB. First, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, and say that it was terrible to hear on Radio 4 a report on what the Minister was putting out in a Written Statement today, when this House should have been given a proper Statement on what is clearly a very controversial issue.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="11063052000172"></a>My concern is about the company to which we are now considering that ownership should be given-whether it is a done deal or not, I shall wait to see, but I suspect that it is. That is an indication of the Government's change since 3 March. They have listened to the consultation; they have made proposals; and, yes, there are some changes. That is not the only change that has taken place since 3 March, when a Statement was made to this House about the purchase of BSkyB. Many other things have changed, not least the admission now that it was not a single rogue operator. Other reporters have been arrested who were working for the Murdoch press who were committing these criminal acts. Also, we know that a chief executive has now admitted that she was paying-the Murdoch press was paying-the police for information. That is the company that we are now considering should have control of a major media organisation.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="11063052000173"></a>On top of that, Mr Murdoch himself, in settling a case with Sienna Miller, has now admitted-he has not only apologised for what they were doing-that they did not provide all the information. Withholding information is a criminal act under our laws as well. That is the man, Mr Murdoch himself, who said, "We were not robust enough in our inquiries in providing

The provision of information was to the police in the early stages, and the police came to the wrong conclusions. In those circumstances, the man we are talking about who is bidding for this deal, for which we have had the Statement today-do you want to get in?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="11063052000176"></a>Plurality is a minor part. The credibility of the person who is purchasing is an essential issue for us.

Of course, I cannot say that anything happened there, but we have a decision, a change and a commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="11063052000177"></a>Is the Minister aware that all those things have gone on? Are there not issues about due process to be considered in the company? Are the Government now prepared to have a public inquiry? Are they prepared, as I have constantly asked, not to do anything until the criminal inquiries have been completed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="11063052000178"></a>My final point, just before I finish, is that what I found alarming in the settlement of the Sienna Miller case is that the agreement was not to say everything in court but to tell Miller after, in private. That is about what other criminal acts have gone on. There is no exposure in that. Our courts are not considering all that has gone on. This man, to my mind, is not a fit and proper person to be purchasing such an organisation, and I hope that we will come back to have a debate followed by a public inquiry.</p>

It is a serious crime and no company is above the law. The Secretary of State has taken the view that News Corp has offered serious undertakings and has discussed them in good faith. Hacking, as I said, is a serious matter but it has been around for a very long time. That does not make it any better but this is not the first case of hacking, and perhaps they are not the only people hacking. We have had four Questions and several debates on this in your Lordships' House, but the hacking aspect is not part of today's Statement.

This is a response to representations that these arrangements could be undermined if this Director was often unavailable for meetings for whatever reason"-</p>

<p><a name="11063052000474"></a>the majority of directors are independent, so there is no voice in the wilderness.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="11063052000521"></a>"The change will ensure that Sky News organises its business so as to ensure that there is always appropriate senior editorial and/or journalistic expertise at relevant meetings. The appointment of a Monitoring Trustee whose main role is to ensure that News Corp complies with the undertakings and make sure that News Corp does not do anything 'that would prevent Newco [i.e. the spun off Sky News] being placed in an overall position of editorial, governance, commercial and financial independence in which it will contribute to plurality as Sky News did prior to the Transaction'".</p>

Without the backing of a large media organisation, one wonders how long it can possibly last. It does not make any money as an organisation as part of News Corp, so how long is it likely to survive? We need this as part of the news plurality in the UK. Perhaps the Minister can give us a little information on that one.</p>

The carriage and brand licensing agreements are an important part of this process. The Secretary of State will only accept the undertakings once he has approved these agreements. These documents have been reviewed in great detail by the Office of Fair Trading, Ofcom and external lawyers. We believe that their independent, expert advice provides confidence that undertakings in key agreements are robust.

There is a need for 80 per cent of votes to change the articles. News Corp must vote against changes for so long as they have less than 50 per cent of the shares. The Secretary of State has made it clear throughout that we are committed to maintaining the free and independent press for which this country is famous and proud. The Secretary of State has sought and published independent advice throughout this process. He has listened carefully to the points made in the consultation and amended the undertakings where appropriate. He is fully aware of the importance of the financial side of this. He has also gone for maximum transparency while taking reasonable account of commercial confidentiality considerations. He continues to believe that if he allows this deal to proceed, Sky News will be able to continue its high quality output and will have greater protections for its operational and editorial independence than those that exist today.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="11063052000190"></a>Female genital mutilation is an African practice, common to many of the countries of Africa since time immemorial-not Muslim or tied to any particular religious faith, but cultural and often tribal. It began to take place in this country when immigrants from Somalia and Sudan, as well as Kenya, Nigeria and Sierra Leone began coming to live in the United  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1891"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1891</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Kingdom. FGM was brought here but did not diminish in its countries of origin where, in Somalia, for instance, 100 per cent of the female population has suffered this procedure. In parts of that country death from loss of blood and infection is as high as 10 per cent. FORWARD, the Foundation for Women's Health Research and Development, puts the figure of women at risk from FGM each year as 3 million in Africa alone. When we see on our televisions mothers and children in drought-stricken Somalia at starvation point, suffering the effects of famine, we should remember that these women will all have been mutilated, and some crippled by mutilation.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="11063052000191"></a>In some communities the practice is embedded in coming-of-age rituals, sometimes for entry into women's secret societies. In spite of the intense pain caused by performing surgery by an untrained person without use of anaesthetic or sterile instruments, and in spite of this operation permanently denying them pleasure in sexual intercourse and making childbirth more painful and hazardous than it would otherwise be, girls themselves may desire to undergo it as a result of social pressure from peers and family. Those who have not undergone it may not be allowed to milk the cows or go to certain parts of the farm. Such women believe that they can never become a real wife, and parents are convinced that they are doing the best for their daughters in insisting on it, having a good marriage in view. In parts of northern Kenya young men will not marry an uncircumcised girl. FGM is thought to make a girl clean and beautiful and to preserve virginity. In fact, it is unhygienic and damaging to fertility, leading to infection, bladder disease and fistula.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="11063052000192"></a>As I have said, FGM was brought here 40 years ago and more; a practice which in African countries was, and is, so common that talking about it was no more necessary than discussing the age-old preparation of certain kinds of food or some system of making clothes. This was the way it was done, so women who came here saw no need to speak of a practice that was accepted and taken for granted. It became, and still is, a secret. It is this secrecy in families and communities, not to mention contact with the outside world, which has made changing the attitude of immigrants and the children and grandchildren of immigrants so difficult and near-impossible. People will not speak of it. They will not talk to their non-African neighbours about it, still less to doctors or the police. It is only when a woman becomes pregnant that her FGM is discovered and a doctor or midwife asks, "Where did you have this done?".</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="11063052000193"></a>They want to know because performing it is against the law in the United Kingdom. The Female Circumcision Act was passed in 1985 and superseded by the Female Genital Mutilation Act in 2003. This later Act makes taking a female person out of this country for FGM to be performed abroad punishable by a maximum of 14 years' imprisonment. Yet FORWARD estimates that 24,000 women are at risk of FGM in the UK and over 66,000 live with its results in England and Wales, figures which may be grossly underestimated since the data were based on the 2001 census.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="11063052000194"></a>Although the police are intent upon bringing a prosecution-it is hoped for more its deterrent effect than as punishment-no prosecution has yet taken  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1892"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1892</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>place, the secrecy factor being in great part responsible for this failure. Girls who can be heard in north London talking to their friends about being "cut" as initiation into a kind of community membership will say that FGM was performed on them as babies or before they came to the United Kingdom. Women presenting themselves at ante-natal clinics may well say the same and midwives are naturally wary of inquiring too closely into this highly sensitive and delicate cultural area.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="11063052000195"></a>The public at large know little about FGM and many of those who have heard it called female circumcision believe it to have some connection with male circumcision and be therapeutic or a mere formality. I have told those who have asked me what it really is and my explanation has been received with horror and in some cases, "I don't want to know". But I believe that the more people who know the details of this practice the better; that they know that some victims-the word is not an exaggeration-are babies of three months or even newborns; many are infants and five year-olds.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="11063052000196"></a>Obviously, because of its nature, it cannot be the subject of a widely advertised and well illustrated campaign of the kind that alerts the public to the dangers of, say, heart disease, prostate disease and many forms of cancer. Does the Minister believe that such widespread advertising of what FGM is and what remedies are possible-I am thinking of reversals-could be achieved and might be effective?</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="11063052000197"></a>Reversals are now being performed and they are of enormous benefit to mutilated women. Parts of the excised genitalia cannot, of course, be restored. No surgeon, however skilful, can do that, but reversal is of great benefit to women, restoring ease in urination and establishing straightforward menstrual periods. Most of all, perhaps, it ensures easier childbirth and less danger to mother and child.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="11063052000198"></a>I am constantly asked by those who know what FGM is, why, if it happens in the UK, there have been no prosecutions eight years after the passing of the Act. It is not for want of trying that the police have so far been able to bring no prosecutions, against either practitioners carrying out FGM here, or those taking a child abroad for mutilation to be performed in a country less aware of its dangers. The police are anxious to prosecute, as much to provide a deterrent as to punish the perpetrator. They would be much assisted by public awareness. It would be particularly valuable in the struggle against FGM if teachers, especially in primary schools, were to be on the watch for female children who tell them that they are being taken to the country of their parents' origin for a holiday or to visit family in Somalia, for instance, Nigeria or the Côte d'Ivoire.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="11063052000199"></a>The Metropolitan Police, in conjunction with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Kids' Taskforce, have made a film to raise awareness of the issue which will be launched next Monday at the Lilian Baylis Technology School in Kennington. The National Clinical Group against female genital mutilation has had worldwide success and benefited a large number of women with its DVD showing a surgical reversal being performed. I understand, too, that there are films being made, often by schoolchildren, all over this

Do the Government support the making of such films showing the pain and suffering caused by FGM and exposing the superstitious beliefs which help it to remain an ongoing custom? There are 16 specialist FGM clinics in England, 10 of them in London. Unfortunately, many are at risk of closure due to funding and staff cuts. Does the Minister agree that it is essential these clinics remain open? Again, does she agree that encouraging teachers to be aware of what is a very real danger to young girls can be of help to the police in bringing perhaps the single prosecution which would be such a major deterrent and factor in putting an end to this practice in the United Kingdom?</p>

We all hear harrowing stories of unthinkable cruelty to women around the world, but female genital mutilation has to be one of the most disturbing and dangerous practices still very much ongoing. As we all know, it is not just confined to faraway lands, but sadly is extremely prevalent and commonly happening right here in the UK. Sadder still is that not only women but girls and baby girls even less than 12 months are also subjected to this most grave act of violence. I have heard many depressing estimations of the amount of women it is affecting worldwide, and just in the UK the numbers are in excess of 20,000. The World Health Organisation suggests that the figures worldwide are between 100 million and 140 million.</p>

Noble Lords perhaps will be aware that the perpetrators of these barbaric acts often choose summer holidays to carry out this practice. The reason for subjecting young girls to female genital mutilation at this particular time is thought to be that the girls are given time to heal during the summer months. This avoids arousing suspicions from teachers and peers when they resume their studies in the autumn.</p>

It has come to my attention that communities in Bristol have come together since 2008 to raise awareness of female genital mutilation and to mark their zero tolerance of it. The campaign is highly commendable. However, does the Minister agree that the time has come to launch a nationwide campaign highlighting the dangers of this practice?</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="11063052000203"></a>It is a sorry state of affairs that there have been no prosecutions under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003. The Act was intended to protect females from this practice, but unfortunately it has failed to do so. A barrier to prosecution appears to be a fear of reprisals from the perpetrators of this crime. There is also consternation on the part of the victims by their communities if they speak to the relevant authorities about their ordeal. I ask the Minister why there have been no prosecutions under the Act. Furthermore, will my noble friend explain what more can be done to investigate and undertake prosecutions under the legislation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="11063052000204"></a>In July 2010, the United Nations General Assembly created UN Women. Will the Minister tell your Lordships' House how we are involved with this group and whether we are currently working with it on any projects connected with the issues that we are discussing in this debate?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="11063052000205"></a>The perpetrators of this most harrowing and dangerous act are brainwashing their victims, and in many cases the girls may be subjected to compulsion. The activities are kept underground and the communities involved keep silent about them. We must meet this challenge with vigour and determination. An Act is in force and I am confident that the Government appreciate the seriousness of the problems and intend to protect vulnerable women and girls. I look forward to hearing the Minister's ideas and updates on progress.</p>

I start by declaring an interest as patron of FORWARD, the Foundation for Women's Health, Research and Development. As my noble friend said, two pieces of legislation made FGM illegal, but the question has to be: why have there been no prosecutions? We need to examine the legislation again. Perhaps there have been no prosecutions because the law is applicable only to UK citizens and UK permanent residents; perhaps because the law makes it difficult to prosecute perpetrators as it does not protect temporary residents; or perhaps because, as a recent case review demonstrated, there is a lack of co-ordination, awareness and information-sharing among key professionals.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="11063052000207"></a>In February, the Government published practice guidelines aimed as a resource for front-line professionals, but they did not include a plan for disseminating the guidelines to key professionals such as police officers, teachers and social workers. To truly raise awareness we must create an environment of positive change, protective policies, the generation and sharing of knowledge, and the forging of strategic partnerships with policy-makers, statutory bodies and civil society organisations. That procedure was on its way in the form of the cross-government FGM co-ordinator, but the post was abolished by the Government in March this year, leaving individual departments to take on the responsibilities. This makes it even more essential for the Government to set out a clear, comprehensive and long-term strategy for tackling FGM. Will the Minister say whether such a strategy is being proposed, and how it will be financed and co-ordinated across government? The loss of this post is compounded by the fact that many organisations working to eliminate FGM are struggling to survive through lack of financial support, leading to closures-most notably that of the internationally recognised African Well Women's Service.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="11063052000208"></a>There are 66,000 women in the UK who live with the consequences of FGM, and 24,000 girls are at risk. The consequences can vary from short-term health implications to serious problems in pregnancy and childbirth and serious psychological damage. An important piece of peer research carried out earlier this year showed that type 4 FGM, known as sunna, which includes pricking, piercing or incision, is widely

This is a significant barrier to elimination.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="11063052000209"></a>The research also identified that although the majority of cases happen to young children, there is a wider age range of girls being subject to FGM, including in their late teens and early 20s, and that FGM is not discussed even within practising communities so there are differing and contradictory views between the generations about its prevalence. These barriers clearly identify that projects and language must become more adept, dealing with FGM not only as a health issue but also as one of child protection, gender and human rights. To do that there must be greater awareness raising, greater participation and engagement of key communities, including diaspora communities, funding to support existing outreach programmes, the provision of sustainable specialist health and support services, long-term investment and an FGM action plan.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="11063052000210"></a>In conclusion, FGM is not only a dangerous and life-threatening practice but a gross violation of the human rights of girls and women. Everything possible should be done to eliminate the practice and ensure that the perpetrators face the consequences of the law.</p>

Only this week we received a bulletin from the End Violence Against Women coalition, which estimates that 15,000 to 20,000 girls under 15 could be at high risk of FGM. No civilised country can find justification on any ground whatever for even a single woman to undergo this vile practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="11063052000212"></a>This subject causes revulsion. Women, and in particular young girls, deserve the support of all those who care about their rights and freedoms, which we cherish and yet are denied to some who are part of our community. I am afraid the FGM Act of 2003 seems not to have been effective. So if the law is ineffective, what else should we be doing? First, let us destroy the argument that this is a religious ritual or practice. I do not know of any religion that prescribes mutilation. There are perpetrators who advance the argument that FGM protects virginity, ensures marriageability and contains sexuality. It does nothing of the sort. We now have to make a clear statement that those who have chosen to be part of our multicultural society should be in no doubt that the law is designed to protect victims, and that perpetrators will have no place to hide.</p>

Let us examine what this entails. Article 2 provides the right to equality, irrespective of sex. Article 19.1 provides protection to children from all forms of mental and physical violence and maltreatment. Article 24.1 is designed to provide the highest standard of health. We can add to this the important provision under Article 24.3 to take effective and appropriate measures to abolish traditional practices prejudicial to the health of children, and Article 37(a) which specifies freedom from torture, cruel or inhuman or degrading treatment. I have cited this convention to remind the Government that we have an obligation to

We need answers to the following questions. What guidance is given to social workers regarding registration and action in relation to this practice? What common code of conduct is there for all healthcare professionals regarding FGM? What programme of public education is undertaken for refugees who arrive here from certain countries where such practices are prevalent? Do we publish information in other languages so that refugees and others are aware of the law in the United Kingdom? What training and guidance is provided to teachers and students, making them aware of FGM and the law? What financial and other support is available for women's groups and advocacy groups? These groups are vital as a catalyst for opening discussions and breaking the taboo around FGM. What impact will the police cuts have and are there plans to ring-fence some of the funds so the activities are not downgraded?</p>

First, I want to take the opportunity to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, both for instigating the debate and for her untiring work to develop awareness of FGM, to support the many groups working to get it stopped and to support the doctors who do the reversal surgery. Secondly, I want to take the opportunity to mention very briefly-and I must stress that I am no expert on the subject-what I learnt in Kenya during my stay as a volunteer, arranged by Voluntary Service Overseas, with the Coalition on Violence Against Women, an experience which I hope has some relevance in the UK. I participated in the programme the coalition is involved with in the rural areas to persuade whole communities that the time has come to stop this practice. Kenyan law makes it clear that FGM is unlawful. It is illegal under the Children Act, 2001 and official figures show the numbers dropping considerably since 2001, although some commentators think all that has happened is that it is now being done in secret.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="11063052000217"></a>In Masai communities, with which I was involved, young girls are traditionally circumcised amid great ceremony in preparation for a hoped-for marriage. To avoid this, some girls, who dream of a different life for themselves, run away to safe houses where they are looked after. I visited a school in a rural area which a number of these girls attended. They were being clothed, fed and educated with money raised by various sources from the coalition as their parents would no longer support them. They seemed very determined to avoid the circumcision ceremony and early marriage and to stay on at school. However, the pressure on them to give up and go home was enormous, so I heard. Their parents were telling them, "You will never get married.  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1897"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1897</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>What will become of you?". Their peer group was saying, "I had it done. I got lots of presents. Now I am going to get married". The girls I met were very brave and defiant-standing there in their hand-me-down clothes-and very admirable. Their lives were very difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="11063052000218"></a>The Coalition on Violence Against Women also organised educational efforts in the villages, spearheaded by men, to spread the word that men would be better off with educated wives who had not been circumcised. While the law is essential and it is imperative that it is clear that this practice is outside the law, it is education of men and wider opportunities for girls that will in the end make it no longer culturally accepted. I was impressed with the Government's multiagency practice guidelines and I thank the Library for providing me with these. Can I ask the Minister whether they are widely known and distributed? Since we are expecting people to resist a powerful traditional force, how far are the Government able to support civil society groups, which can support women and their mothers who want to resist this and to have a very different life?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="11063052000220"></a>We all know that female genital mutilation is a horrendous practice. In this country I am told that at the moment there are 74,000 first-generation immigrant African women who have undergone it. A research paper published a few years ago tells us that in any given year between 3,000 and 4,000 girls are subjected to FGM. Obviously, it is a cultural practice and, like all cultural practices, it is sustained by a personal belief that it is right and by social pressure. How do you tackle a practice based on deeply held personal belief and constantly reinforced by the pressures of others? I want to emphasise this point because, although the law is important, we should bear in mind how deeply seated in the consciousness of this community this practice is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="11063052000221"></a>Some years ago when I was writing about this, I spoke on the subject at a conference. A fairly distinguished academic from Nigeria came up to me and said, "Don't sound off. I have undergone this practice recently, after the birth of my last child". I asked why, at the age of 35, she had done it. She said, "To remind myself that from now onwards I am a mother and not a woman". When I asked whether this was common, she said it was fairly common in certain circles. In certain parts of Africa it is not uncommon for widows to go through this voluntarily and it happens in many groups of immigrants in Europe and the United States as well.</p>

I want to suggest some things based on my own research

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="11063052000223"></a>Law is important because it sets the tone of society, but there have to be strong and rigorously pursued prosecutions. I am really disappointed that there have been no prosecutions of the same kind that we had in relation to honour killings or forced marriages. We need to take communities into confidence. There are many men and women in those communities who are appalled by this and they ought to be involved in suggesting ways for it to be tackled. It is also important that social pressure is exerted because everyone thinks other people are doing it. Communities should be collectively persuaded to pass resolutions and to say openly why they would not do this and why they would not allow this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="11063052000224"></a>It is also important to bear in mind that we should not be concentrating only on women. This practice takes place because it is part of the patriarchal system and, more importantly, men want it. I do not have the time to go through all this but if you were to ask in whose interest this is being done-women obviously do not enjoy it-I am told that men enjoy it and it is their way of regulating women's sexuality and behaviour. Therefore, unless we persuade men and boys to recognise that this does not deliver what they think it does, we will not be able to get very far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="11063052000225"></a>It is also important to be able to identify girls at risk fairly well in advance.

It is difficult to confirm its prevalence in Europe but the European Parliament estimates that as many as half a million women in Europe are suffering the consequences of FGM.</p>

The Association of European Parliamentarians for Africa, which is known as AWEPA, of which I am an advisory board member, UNICEF and UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, have pledged to co-operate in the implementation of a joint programme for ending FGM. This is recognised as the privileged instrument within the UN for human rights-based social change. The objective is to accelerate social change in favour of human rights, and to increase the rate of abandonment of FGM in the 17 African countries considered a priority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="11063052000230"></a>Across Europe and Africa, AWEPA has agreed to organise parliamentary action to abandon the practice of FGM. Three target countries were identified-Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal-out of the 17 where the practice is most widespread. An analysis of the relevant legal provisions in each country is being made, and the leeway afforded to parliamentarians as power brokers is being quantified and identified. An analysis is being made in relation to each Government's executive branches and their relevant parliamentary committees as well as to civil society organisations and, not least, women's rights groups. In parallel and in partnership with the Pan-African Parliament and with input from UNICEF and UNFPA, the joint programme is developing a parliamentary handbook in which the UN agencies' policy expertise in the area of FGM combines with knowledge of the parliamentary processes in each country. The handbook is being promoted by parliamentary champions in all three countries through the networks of national bookshops. The issue of FGM is closely linked to the attainment of UN MDG3, promoting gender equality and empowerment for women, and MDG5, improving maternal health. The overall objective of AWEPA's programme is the abandonment of the practice of FGM in Africa and Europe by 2015.</p>

Laws alone will not end the practice, but parliaments can lead the way in bringing about the societal change needed. At the very least, we should find room in DfID's maternal health budget to support this UNICEF project. Norway, Italy, Ireland and Australia have already made generous contributions to the programme. A further £20 million is all that it will take to fund the five-year programme and see the first target country free from FGM. I look forward to my noble friend's comments on whether DfID will come across and stump up.</p>

The practice continues despite the criminalising of the process both here and back in most of the countries where it is widespread. I want to reiterate what my noble friend Lord Parekh said: it is very clear what the purpose is. It is about preparing women for marriage. My experience is that it is not often performed on babies nowadays; it is performed on girls, usually prepubescent girls between the ages of eight and 12, and it is done because there is still, if not child marriage, the betrothal of girls when they are still that young.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="11063052000233"></a>The idea is to keep women chaste, to remove their opportunity for sexual pleasure and to remove concerns that women with a clitoris will somehow be more promiscuous. Not all circumcision involves the removal of the clitoris, but for most women, it involves the stitching of their vagina and labia. Sometimes it even involves the removal of the labia. In Africa, I have heard practitioners and older men and women claim that it makes girls less wild, more placid and therefore exactly marriageable material.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="11063052000234"></a>I have gone to Africa with the charity SafeHands for Mothers and, like the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, I have heard the testimony of women and men and seen how traumatised women are having gone through that experience, especially if you talk to girls who have escaped the possibility or who have just undergone female genital mutilation. I have visited hospitals in north London to see photographs taken of the damaged and mutilated vaginas of women who attend hospital because they are pregnant. Obstetricians have to give them guidance on what to expect in labour and tell them that they will have to have an episiotomy in order to give birth. After giving birth, the women beg those same doctors to stitch them up the way they were in order to please their husbands. Doctors have to explain to women that they will play no part in that practice, but they know that those women return to them with a second pregnancy, and their vagina has been restitched. We have to ask ourselves how that is coming about. Doctors in this country are satisfied that women in the communities here perform these practices.</p>

<a name="110630-0001.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="11063052000235"></a>In Africa, I have heard doctors saying that a practice current there is the performance of symbolic cutting where there is no removal of the clitoris and it is simply, they insist, a small nick that answers the community's cultural demand for the continuation of the practice. I hope that those in authority, in the medical profession and in the police are making it clear that a medical practitioner performing even the small nick will not be endured in this country and that prosecution will ensue. It must contravene the belief that we should do no harm.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="11063052000236"></a>I want to hear from the Minister about what is being done about reaching general practitioners, doctors in private practice and cosmetic surgeons to find out whether things are being done to women who want their vaginas restitched after birth. I want to hear what efforts we are making to breach the silence on this issue and whether we are doing enough in our outreach to the communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="11063052000239"></a>The All-Party Group on Population, Development and Reproduction Health, which I now chair, has produced two reports that are extremely relevant. The first was way back in 2000. It was specifically on female genital mutilation and covered most of the points that have been made in this debate and, indeed, reiterated a lot of the experience that noble Lords have told us about today. The second was the 2009 report on maternal morbidity <I>Better off Dead</I><I>?</I>-that was my title. Both reports highlighted the global human rights violations of FGM, which affects about 130 million women and girls worldwide, 500,000 in Europe and an estimated 66,000 in England and Wales. These women and girls are brutally mutilated and that has long-term physical and mental consequences. Their future reproductive health is violated in the most brutal and disgusting way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="11063052000240"></a>If we had time, I would like to have a debate on the origins of this practice and a debate on the origins of male circumcision too, which is very interesting. It is being questioned in some circles nowadays. It is said that it started as a public health measure to stop irritation and infection when men did not wear Y-fronts. Women certainly did not have underwear. Is it conceivable that back in the mists of time, it was in some way seen as a healthy or hygienic practice? I do not know, but we all know how it is interpreted nowadays and we have heard from many noble Lords that it is, in a sense, to control women. Both practices are in my view violations of the rights of the child. They are against the human rights of children, who are unable to give their consent, and the practices should stop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="11063052000241"></a>Some of us may have heard recently that a brave teacher in Bristol has encouraged a group of girls in her care from different cultural backgrounds who have experience of FGM to make a film called "Silent Scream", to which I draw the attention of the House. It has its premiere at the Watershed Cinema in the centre of Bristol tonight; it will then go online. I am glad of the opportunity to publicise it. However, this teacher has received little support, with parents and colleagues condemning her for allowing the girls to make the film. I ask the Minister what the Government will be doing to encourage teachers to do this sort of activity and make these sorts of films with their pupils.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="11063052000242"></a>I have just a few more questions before I finish. Why has not a single prosecution taken place in this country, compared to the 50 prosecutions that have taken place in France? Where are the support services for girls who have undergone this procedure? Currently there are only 16 such facilities in the UK. What will happen under GP commissioning-who will be responsible for this? What training is being organised for teachers and the police? Where are the statistics on FGM and why are they not collected? Lastly, why has the cross-government FGM co-ordinator post been abolished? I hope that the Minister can answer these questions.</p>

As noble Lords have commented, the Female Genital Mutilation Act was introduced in 2003, but there have been no prosecutions since it was brought in. As my noble friend Lady Rendell said, clearly there are police forces who would wish to prosecute but so far the evidence has not come forward.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="11063052000244"></a>I ask the Minister to respond to the point raised just now by the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, as to the reason for there being no prosecutions at all, and whether we can learn anything from other countries such as France, if indeed they have been able to find ways to prosecute? It would be very interesting to know whether her department has been able to undertake some research into the experience of other countries.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="11063052000245"></a>My noble friend Lady Gould wondered if the law needed revisiting and made a number of suggestions for improving the law. Will the Minister very kindly consider those proposals?</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="11063052000246"></a>My noble friend Lady Rendell suggested a public awareness campaign. Will the Government support this, including, as she said, films showing the pain and suffering caused by this dreadful practice? In her opening remarks, my noble friend mentioned a DVD that she supported. I have seen it-it is very telling. Will the Minister give support to such initiatives and to the initiative mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, by a schoolteacher in Bristol? It was very concerning to hear that, far from being supported, she had come in for criticism. This is extremely disappointing.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="11063052000247"></a>Fantastic work is being done in clinics. Can the Minister assure me that a way will be found within the new health service structure to ensure that those clinics continue to be funded and supported? The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, raised the issue of police funding. We know that one of the consequences of cuts to police funding has been the closure of specialist units. There is a real problem with prosecutions-will the Minister consider whether there is a need for some kind of regional or national unit to gather expertise to advise police forces generally? The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, also mentioned the role of the Children's Commissioner. Will she consider that, as well as his suggestion about the need for education for refugees?</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="11063052000248"></a>I also ask the Minister to respond to my noble friend Lady Kennedy about practitioners in this country because it is clear from what we said that there are some who are involved in these practices. My noble friend's analysis of the causes was very helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="11063052000249"></a>Picking up a point made by my noble friend Lord Parekh, what work are the Government doing in relation to UK communities, particularly men and boys in those communities? The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, mentioned the Kenyan experience. It would be helpful if we could establish whether the work being done there would be relevant to the UK. I also pick up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, about DfID programmes, which I thought was very important indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="11063052000250"></a>Finally, my noble friend Lady Gould asked whether the Government would develop a long-term strategy. I ask the Minister to consider that very carefully indeed.

The noble Baroness illustrated so vividly the horrors of this practice and I hope that I will have time to respond to the noble Baroness and other noble Lords' questions. If time does not permit, I will write to noble Lords.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="11063052000252"></a>This debate is absolutely crucial for women and girls across the world. Female genital mutilation is a form of child abuse which this Government are committed to eradicating. Similarly, the UN Committee on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women has clearly denounced the practice of FGM in its general recommendation No. 14 on female circumcision. The UN General Assembly's resolution of January 2002 on traditional or customary practices affecting the health of women and girls called upon all states to ratify or accede to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and to adopt national measures to prohibit harmful traditional practices such as FGM.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="11063052000253"></a>We have to protect girls from this abuse and ensure that all those living with the consequences of FGM are given the care and support they deserve and so badly need. Front-line professionals who have responsibilities to safeguard children and protect adults from the abuses associated with FGM play a vital role in identifying children and young women who are at risk or who have been subjected to FGM. It is unlikely that any single agency will be able to meet the multiple needs of someone affected by FGM and therefore it demands a multiagency response.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="11063052000254"></a>Similarly, the coalition Government have recognised the need for a joined-up approach to tackle FGM and this method has been successful in drawing together, co-ordinating and driving work from a number of government departments. We are trying to raise awareness of this barbaric practice and have made progress. However, our key focus is prevention and we have undertaken considerable work in the past year across and between nine government departments to advance efforts to prevent and tackle FGM in the UK and around the world. In February, the Government launched multiagency practice guidelines on female genital mutilation for front-line professionals such as teachers, GPs and nurses. The guidelines aim to raise awareness of FGM, highlight the risks of the practice and set out clearly the steps that should be taken to safeguard children and women from this abuse. This is a key step towards ensuring that professionals are able and confident to intervene to protect girls at risk.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="11063052000255"></a>We know that FGM causes significant harm to the physical and mental health of girls in many ways, which many noble Lords have raised today, and increases the risk of life threatening complications during childbirth for both the mother and baby. There are 15 specialist  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1904"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1904</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>clinics in the NHS which treat women and girls who have been subjected to FGM. These clinics all have trained and culturally sensitive staff who offer a range of healthcare services for women and girls, including the commonly called "reversal" surgery. A clinic based in the Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London sees more than 300 clients per year and carries out between two and three reversals of FGM per week. It may surprise noble Lords-although I suspect it does not from listening to the contributions-that 30 to 40 per cent of those clients are British nationals.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="11063052000256"></a>The Royal College of Midwives has identified FGM as a key issue to its members and is conducting a survey of midwives to understand more about the numbers of women being seen by health services and the training needs of health staff. The results will be used by the Royal College of Midwives to input into national strategies and plans, and to provide better support to midwives by way of providing information and appropriate educational resources. We applaud this and other such initiatives.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="11063052000257"></a>Communications about FGM are key to bringing the issue to people's attention. More than 40,000 leaflets and posters have been circulated to schools, health services, charities and community groups around the country. This is not the only method we are using to raise awareness and we know that it is not an end in itself but a foundation on which to build. Guidance has also been issued to British embassies and high commissions to protect British girls and women at risk of FGM overseas. We must be clear that the long-term and systematic eradication of FGM in the UK will require practising communities to abandon the practice themselves.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="11063052000258"></a>Through the regular government-chaired female genital mutilation forum, we will work with the well established network of FGM civil society organisations to co-ordinate activities and input into government policy-making as well as to examine how we can support and facilitate their engagement with practising communities in the UK. We have reached out to work with a range of charities and civil society partners active in this area. Their wealth of experience has been absolutely crucial in shaping our work and we thank them for their input and for sharing their expertise with us. It has been an excellent example of partnership working that we are keen to continue going forward.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="11063052000259"></a>Looking forward, we will continue to examine how FGM can best be included in existing statutory training for professionals, and to offer other areas of specific, tailored training to the relevant agencies, both of which are key to the prevention and tackling of female genital mutilation. There have also been some successful initiatives from the police. The Metropolitan Police's Project Azure work at Heathrow, which speaks to families potentially taking the girls overseas for FGM, has strengthened our last line of defence for these girls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="11063052000260"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, referred to the interesting work being done with the Metropolitan Police at the Lilian Baylis Technology School in Vauxhall, which was approached to take part in a female genital mutilation film project. In further illustrating the project, it was decided to hand the film production over to a  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1905"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1905</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>group of young people to decide how this sensitive subject should be presented to their peers. The school's well-being group was thought to be the ideal place for the project. The group included girls from Eritrea and Somalia, two of whom had already been "cut" and who shared their experiences and knowledge with group members. One pupil revealed that her father had refused to allow her to be cut despite her mother being keen for her to have FGM. The film should be ready for delivery to schools in September. I think that it will be a very powerful tool in a crucially important area, for we know that the education and safeguarding sectors play a vital role in identifying and intervening when girls are suspected of being at risk of FGM. I think that the idea of directly involving children, including those who have already sadly experienced the horror of FGM, is a brave and innovative idea.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="11063052000261"></a>We need to tackle this issue at its root. By reaching out to children directly, we can hope to change the mindset of our future generations to ensure that when these girls become mothers they will abandon the practice for good. While FGM needs to be addressed in a comprehensive manner by all parts of society, change must come from the communities which carry out this practice, and we commend and applaud communities which have taken a strong stance on this issue. Internationally, we recognise that FGM is a serious problem and the Government's aid programme is committed to empowering women and girls, including preventing violence against women and girls, including FGM where appropriate.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="11063052000262"></a>The Government will support sensitive measures to counter all forms of gender-based violence internationally and will support measures to eliminate FGM indirectly through their core funding of the key UN agencies that address FGM-namely, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Children's Fund and the World Health Organisation-as well as supporting NGOs which focus on tackling FGM. Closer to home, we will also work with other EU member states and EU institutions to examine how and where the EU can add value to global efforts to tackle FGM.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="11063052000263"></a>The Government are frustrated by the lack of prosecutions in the 25 years that female genital mutilation has been illegal in the UK but the success of the legislation cannot be measured only by the number of prosecutions. We hear anecdotally that the legislation has been a deterrent, stopping families from proceeding with their plans to have FGM performed on their daughters.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="11063052000264"></a>Legislation alone cannot eliminate the practice altogether. Families and communities need to take ownership of the issue and must help to stop committing this terrible crime. Prosecution after the fact, although desirable, does not relieve the victim of a lifetime of pain and discomfort. We want to prevent FGM from happening in the first place. Despite the lack of prosecutions, the Act is intended to deter this unacceptable practice and anecdotal evidence suggests that it has had some deterrent effect. The Act has also provided an impetus for outreach work with the practising communities and has been widely used to raise awareness among the police, judiciary, health

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="11063052000265"></a>Research suggests that the most likely barrier to prosecution is the pressure from the family or wider community that leads to cases going unreported. Victims may be too young and vulnerable or too afraid to report offences to the police or to give evidence in court. Family and community pressure can make it very difficult for girls to come forward to notify the police about what has happened to them. We recognise that more needs to be done.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="11063052000266"></a>The Crown Prosecution Service will shortly issue new guidelines for prosecutors on FGM to ensure that the CPS is able to prosecute cases of female genital mutilation that satisfy the evidential and public interest tests within the <I>Code for Crown Prosecutors</I>. Together with police training, we hope that every case of FGM can be investigated and, if it meets the relevant evidential and public interest tests, prosecuted to ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice. We hope that the publication of these guidelines will be the first step towards a successful prosecution in the UK really to press home the point that we will not tolerate the unacceptable abuse of girls and women in this way.</p>

I conclude by thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, for initiating this debate. I hope that it is noted and goes some way to ensuring that this important issue remains on the agenda in order that girls and women are protected and this unacceptable form of abuse is eliminated for good. As always, this subject highlights the expertise and the passion for which this House is known and respected across the globe.</p>

These amendments address the question of who can call referendums under the provisions of this chapter. We approached the question of  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1907"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1907</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>referendums with some scepticism-that has become obvious. Nevertheless, we understand that there is a localist case for referendums regardless of whether referendums themselves are a suitable part of local democracy. The case was made well by the noble Lord, Lord True, before the lunch break. We are troubled by referendums not just because they present various practical dangers and difficulties, which we talked about last Thursday and this morning, but because of the question of whether local democracy should be plebiscitary or deliberative. The problem with referendums is that they demand a yes or no answer to questions that very often require a great deal of careful discussion and deliberation and are not answerable in a yes/no sort of way; they are answerable in a much more complex way that requires amendment, mediation and compromise between different interests in the community. This is at the heart of the question of who should call referendums.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="11063052000271"></a>This suite of amendments would delete those parts of the Bill that allow referendums to be called by a small number of elected councillors. It would also delete the provision that an elected mayor, whether in London or elsewhere, could call a referendum. It would also, perhaps for different reasons, delete the provisions that allow a council itself to call a referendum. I will take those points in order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="11063052000272"></a>In our view, the provision that allows a small number of elected members to call a referendum in their wards is open to a great deal of misuse and abuse. In particular, if,</p>

<ul><a name="11063052000589"></a>"member for an electoral area",</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000476"></a>or,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000590"></a>"a majority of the members",</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000477"></a>in a multi-member area can call a referendum. It is not clear whether councillors for adjoining wards could join together and jointly call for the same referendum in two or more wards. I put that question to the Minister.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="11063052000273"></a>Last Thursday we discussed the danger-so I will not go into it in great detail now-of councillors using referendums in their wards as a tool for re-election, calling a referendum on a populist issue on the same day as they are due to face the electors. An equally dangerous prospect is rivalry within a ward, if perhaps two out of three councillors called a referendum in order to do down the election campaign of a colleague of a different party. A further problem is that wards do not necessarily, and very often do not, match communities.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="11063052000274"></a>For all these reasons, many of us find undesirable the possibility that a small number of councillors-one, two or three-can call a referendum in their part of the borough and, as long as it fits the provisions of the Bill, the council will not be able to stop it. The arguments apply equally to elected mayors, who could quite easily call populist referendums to coincide with their own re-election or to boost their popularity. There seems no reason why a mayor should call a referendum about issues that relate to the mayor's powers because the mayor can address them without a referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="11063052000275"></a>As far as the resolution of the council is concerned, these provisions seem unnecessary. Councillors can call referendums at the moment under their existing general powers, and presumably they will continue to be able to do so. They are also able to make arrangements appropriate to the particular referendum that they might want to call. We were given an example in the King's Lynn area where a referendum called by the district council cost £80,000. It resulted in an overwhelming majority one way, and then the county council ignored it. The argument for not having a referendum on the basis of the resolution of the council is that it is not necessary, and the council can do it anyway without being constrained by the detailed rules and regulations in this Bill.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="11063052000276"></a>My final point is that the Bill suggests that referendums can take place within a ward or an electoral division or they can take place in a whole area. However, if you think about towns such as Keighley, which is a clearly separate town within the city of Bradford, why should it not be able to have a referendum, if we are going to have referendums, in a clear community like that? In the case of Burnley, Padiham is a clearly separate town in the Burnley district, but it consists of two wards and bits of other wards; so why should it not be able to have a referendum in the natural community rather than the artificial wards? I beg to move.</p>

In particular I entirely concur with his view that the provision for council members to requisition a referendum is apt to lead to mischief and is unnecessary. It is open to the whole council to choose to have a referendum if it wishes. Perhaps the Minister would confirm that it would even be the case in a mayoral council, that the council as a whole could pass a resolution for a referendum. However, to extend that principle to individual members is unnecessary and likely to be a source of considerable nuisance as well as expense. I hope that the Minister will feel, on reflection, that that particular part of the Bill can be safely abandoned without prejudice to the rights of the public at large.</p>

I should reassure him that councils in neighbouring wards can get together to hold a referendum covering a community. I cannot help the way that warding is done. Generally speaking, we have to have building blocks in local government and the ward system is the one that is used, but under the provisions of the Bill it would be possible to hold a referendum that just addressed the interests of Keighley or Burnley, which he illustrated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="11063052000280"></a>Perhaps I can address the implications of the amendments and say why I will resist them. Amendments 120B, 120C, 126ZZA, 128QA, 128R, 128VA and 128W would remove the provisions that would allow councillors to call for local referendums and councils to pass a resolution to hold a referendum. These amendments would have the effect that if an authority were keen to hold a referendum on a local matter, it would not be able to use the powers to hold a formal referendum conferred by the Bill and would only be able to use the rather informal powers contained in Section 116 of the Local Government Act 2003. We accept that local authorities have the power to hold advisory polls under Section 116, but those polls are limited to the council's services or its expenditure on such services and are therefore not as far-reaching as the provisions in the Bill.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="11063052000281"></a>We want to enable councils to hold referendums on any issue of local importance. We believe that as leaders in their areas, it is right for them to be able to do so. It is open to a council under the provisions to hold a referendum on any matter. However, any decision must be taken within the parameters of administrative law. It would need to be a rational decision with reasoned grounds for it. In answer to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, these provisions apply also to mayoral councils. Clearly it would not be rational to hold a referendum on a matter about which no practical decision would be possible by those who were able to take the decision. For example, a decision on whether the country should invest in a programme-the illustration that I have here is rather far-fetched, to send a person to Mars; I am not sure who the drafters of this text had in mind-would not be a rational subject for a referendum by a local authority. Further, the local authority would need to consider very carefully the holding of a referendum on a matter over which it, its partner authorities or the people of the locality had little or no influence. It is not rational for the authority to incur the cost of a referendum which can serve no possible purpose.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="11063052000282"></a>I do not see any great advantage in denying authorities access to the referendum framework that we are setting up under this Bill if they want to use it. Nothing in the provisions that my noble friend seeks to omit imposes any obligations on authorities, so I urge him to withdraw the amendment and to support the localism that they promote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="11063052000283"></a>Some of these amendments, Amendments 129K and 129L, refer to the mayor as a member, and I am grateful to my noble friend for bringing them forward. They would remove elected mayors from the definition of "member", meaning that they could not use the power in Clause 45 to call for a referendum in the area of the council that they have been elected to lead. In fact, this may not be such a great hardship for elected mayors, since they could initiate a referendum by seeking a resolution of the authority under Clause 50. I accept the point made through Amendment 129L-to remove the Mayor for London from the provisions set out in Clause 58(2)-and we will want to consider these points carefully with a view to returning to them at a later stage. I thank my noble friend for submitting those amendments.</p>

Unless I missed it, I do not think that he addressed the particular concerns referred to by both noble Lords, which is what happens with split wards. What would happen to a three-member ward where two are from one party and the third is from another? In my own borough, one-third of the wards are in that position, so it is a significant point. A long time ago I was an opposition councillor, and I would suspect that in the run-up to the council elections, which in London is only a one-in-four-year opportunity, it would be almost irresistible for two opposition councillors seeking to oust their third, unwelcome friend from another party, to seek to trigger a referendum, if only to force the majority party to turn it down shortly before the election. I am sure that that is not what the Government have in mind. I speak with the confidence that none of the opposition councillors in my borough will ever read <I>Hansard</I> and know that I am saying this, but I suspect that this is a tactic that may well enter the minds of some. It is not what the Government intend. I therefore wonder whether we ought not to think a bit more about tightening the provisions to prevent what I must not call frivolous campaigning, but very opportunistic opposition campaigning, by whichever party, because I am sure that, in opposition, we would all do it. Perhaps we should consider that point.</p>

I referred to this on an earlier amendment so I will not labour the point, but I agree strongly with the points made by my noble friend Lord Tope. In these circumstances the councillor power needs further examination, and I hope that my noble friend will be prepared to consider that. On the question of area and ward boundaries which my noble friend referred to, the reality is that, in many cases, as real localism emerges, people will choose areas that do not coincide with the boundaries of wards. We as an authority accept that we are defining areas in terms of what local people have chosen as their communities. Indeed, the most recent referendum held in our authority did not follow ward boundaries but community boundaries, and people participated in it enthusiastically. I do not want to press my noble friend further on the point, but the language of the "electoral area" used in the Bill, whether at this point or elsewhere, could create serious obstacles to the actual implementation of localism in the way that communities would choose. I hope that my noble friend will consider that further.</p>

However, the points raised by my noble friends Lord Tope and Lord True need some consideration. The Bill makes no reference to a political party.

While the question of a council being able to call a referendum under these provisions seems unnecessary and more in the way of detailed prescription, I understand that it is not a significant issue. The one significant issue that has come out of the debate is the question of whether individual members should be able to call referendums in their own wards. I just want to take the Committee through what the Bill says.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="11063052000291"></a>Clause 45 is about a request for a referendum by members. It says that a request complies with this section if a member for a ward-or, if it is a multi-member ward, a majority of members for that ward or division-asks for that referendum. That is subject to Clause 46(2):</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="11063052000524"></a>"The principal local authority must determine whether it is appropriate to hold a local referendum in response to the petition or request".</p>

<p><a name="11063052000480"></a>That is the point that the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, made. But Clause 47, which we will come onto in some detail in the later group, clearly says in subsection (1):</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="11063052000525"></a>"A principal local authority may only determine that it is not appropriate to hold a local referendum in response to a petition or request"-</p>

<p><a name="11063052000481"></a>and that request is a member request-</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000592"></a>"on one or more of the following grounds".</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000482"></a>The way in which the local authority, the council, treats a member request as far as grounds for determination-that is, deciding whether it can go ahead-is exactly the same as if a petition is received. We will discuss some of the stuff in Clause 47 a little  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1912"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1912</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>later but the point is that, if it complies, the council does not have any discretion. It still has to make a formal decision but that decision is whether it complies. If it does, the referendum goes ahead. In an absolute way, the case made by the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, is not what it says in the Bill. If I am wrong, this is a crucial issue that needs to be settled and sorted out.</p>

Amendment 120G simply requires that the electoral registration officer should check that the signature of the person on one of these petitions requesting a referendum is the signature of that person on the register. Amendment 129A says that they must be on the register, not just entitled to be on the register. That is an important issue of clarification. Amendment 129H says that they must be on the register on the date that they sign. Amendment 188 says that this process cannot really start effectively and properly until we have individual voter registration, so that we have on the register the signatures of the people signing these things and those can be checked against it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="11063052000294"></a>On Tuesday, we listened to many discussions about how many signatures should be required to trigger a request for a referendum of this nature. Apart from the arguments over whether it should be 5, 10, 15 or 25 per cent, it is of considerable importance that, if we are collecting any signatures demanding that such a referendum be held, we know that the people signing petitions are on the electoral register, on it on the relevant day and that their signature on the petition matches what is recorded by the electoral registration officer. That is as will be the case in future for all voters with individual voter registration but is at present the case only with postal voters. At the moment, people sign nomination forms for elections but it is not possible to check their signatures. There are so few signatures required on a nomination form that it is possible quickly to make enough inquiries to see whether those signatures really are the signatures of those people nominating a candidate. However, if in future we are going to trigger perhaps expensive referendums requiring dozens, hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of signatures, we must have a process for checking that they are genuinely the signatures of local electors. There will be nothing to check that these signatures are really the signatures of those people until we have individual voter registration in place. We will have it before the next general election campaign. Otherwise, there will be accusations that small groups of people may be able to fill in the forms with different signatures from names that they simply find on the register. There will be no effective way of checking that they really are the electors that they are supposed to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="11063052000295"></a>I have often argued in this House that we need greater security in our election process. We do not really know how much abuse there is of the election process. If more people knew how easy it would be to cheat on some of our election rules, there would perhaps be much more cheating in elections. The previous Government moved and this Government are moving to tighten up our electoral processes as a safeguard against potential fraud. We should have proper safeguards against fraud in relation to these petitions.</p>

It was clearly the view of this House, the other place and the Government that if you make a donation to a political party as an individual you should definitely be on the register-not simply able to claim that you are entitled to be on it, had not gone on it and had been missed out. The same principle should apply for these petitions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="11063052000297"></a>Finally, in these various provisions considering how referendums may be triggered, what consultation has there been with the Electoral Commission about such matters? I beg to move.</p>

<a name="11063052000298"></a><b><a name="110630-0002.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="11063052000801"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> My Lords, before we consider the implications of these amendments, it is important to remember that we are not actually talking about voting in the referendum itself but about the petition. It is the view of the Government that it is up to a local authority to determine the validity of any referendum that is presented to it.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="11063052000299"></a>Amendment 120G would introduce a new layer of bureaucracy requiring that an electoral registration officer must validate each petition to check the names, addresses and signatures of each person who signs a petition. This potentially places a significant burden on the ERO and could lead to delays in the holding of a referendum. An authority will clearly be able to check signatures on the petitions if there is a serious thought that it might be filled with forgeries but it must be for the local authority to decide how it wishes to do so. The authority may consider it unnecessary to verify every signature before it can determine whether the petition is a valid expression of local opinion. Those authorities that wish to devote their time and resources to check each signature may do so. The Government's view is that most will take a sensible approach. There is no need to impose this extra burden.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="11063052000300"></a>It would also be impossible for local authorities to comply with the amendment at present. As my noble friend Lord Rennard admitted, our voter registration does not require the signatures of each elector on the voter registration form, only a signature from one member of the household. As such, local authorities do not hold the signatures of each individual voter, as this amendment would require. My noble friends may have sought to address this point through Amendment 188, which provides that the whole chapter on local referendums cannot be commenced until universal voter registration has been introduced. This would delay commencement of the local referendums regime and thus delay giving local people the mechanism to make their voice heard on issues that matter most to them. I do not believe that is the thinking of the coalition.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="11063052000301"></a>Amendment 129A suggests a drafting change to the definition of who would be entitled to vote in a local referendum, probing why we have used the form of words that are currently in Clause 54(1). The answer is somewhat technical: there are some categories of people who are local government electors but who are not entitled to vote in a local election; for example if they are in prison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="11063052000302"></a>Amendment 129H would restrict the category of person who can sign a petition calling for a referendum to those who are registered by a particular date specified in the petition. This is just the sort of procedural

There really is no need for it. It would implicitly give rise to an obligation on all petitioners to include such a date expressly.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="11063052000303"></a>I therefore hope that with these assurances the amendment will be withdrawn. There is no requirement for a signature as part of our plans for individual voter registration because that would prevent registration by phone or e-mail, for example, which may be included in those proposals. With those considerations, I hope that the noble Lord will be able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I might ask him for a little further clarification on the issue of being on the register or entitled to be on the register, given that he cited specifically the case of prisoners. Those who are in prison are not able to vote in elections. Is he suggesting perhaps that they should be entitled to sign these petitions? That thinking seems a little muddled, if that is perhaps the case. I continue to have reservations about whether petitions that may be costly to the public purse should be triggered without more safeguards than the Bill currently provides. On that note, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This amendment is not about a parish council conducting a referendum or about the existing provision for parish polls. There is an amendment about those matters later on. It suggests that there may well be circumstances-in my view, there are lots of circumstances-where, if there are to be local referendums, a parish is the appropriate area for the referendum to take place.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="11063052000306"></a>There are many examples of where parishes are grouped together to form ward boundaries for principal councils yet those parishes are often more natural communities than are the wards themselves. That is why parishes are as they are, whereas wards are arbitrary and have to be within a certain size. Therefore, very often, wards do not reflect one natural community. They might reflect a series of natural communities or slice communities in two-that very often happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="11063052000307"></a>Where parishes consist of a village or a small town it is often the case that they are the appropriate unit to hold a referendum if that is what people want and that provision exists. By definition, parishes will consist of one or more polling districts, which exist in order to be able to hold parish council elections. I therefore suggest that even if the referendum applies to a principal council, at whatever level, it ought to be possible to call a referendum within a parish area, rather than what may be a much more cumbersome and inappropriate ward boundary area. I beg to move.</p>

I see where he is coming from, although I initially felt that this could loosely be reclassified as "Son of Clause 56 stand part". I appreciate that he has made a distinction which prevents me from pressing that in particular. I will leave most of my comments for the question on Clause 56, because there is a generic process about parishes and how they fit into the thing.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="11063052000309"></a>I am a little concerned about inserting the principle regarding parish into something that relates to principal authorities. I question whether it rightly sits there, bearing in mind that the Bill proposes that the Secretary of State can make a separate set of provisions for parish councils. It seems to me that there are very good reasons for that, because we have to be rather careful about what template we are using for the purposes of referendums, so I question whether the insertion of the reference to a parish here is the right one, unless the intention is to eliminate Clause 56 altogether.</p>

I understand all the misgivings as far as rural parishes are concerned and do not wish to follow along that line, but it would perhaps not be wise to add my noble friend's suggestion to the Bill. I point out that in the recent referendum in my own authority which I referred to, the area chosen for it was in fact the boundary of a parish because that ran across more than one ward. It is not right to write that into statute but it reinforces the point that I and other noble Lords made earlier: that some power to enable local authorities to define an area, which might or might not be a parish, would be a useful broad, localist and permissive power. I would not favour writing it into the Bill in this way but it may be one of the instruments and measures that a local authority ought to be allowed to choose other than a ward.</p>

They are not only historic but often relate to particular communities in a way that local authority wards do not, certainly in my part of the country. That is because wards are driven by numbers, not by community. This seems a good and proper issue to raise. There is of course already the power for parishes to call their own

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="11063052000312"></a>However, the legislation here is making reference to particular issues relating to local authorities.

I say to my noble friend and namesake that I do not know how big Goss Moor is, but Holbeach has a population of some 8,500 people in one parish. Some parishes are remarkably large and other parishes are remarkably small, so it is very difficult. One size, or system, fitting all is very difficult. There are provisions, of course, for a local referendum, or parish poll, under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972, to which the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Goss Moor, has referred.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="11063052000314"></a>The amendment would include parishes in the definition of a "relevant area" as that applies to a principal local authority. We do not think that this is appropriate, particularly because we are looking at how we might look at referendums at parish level in legislation within the Bill and as a result of a consultative process, as I said before. Indeed, I mentioned to the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, that I foresaw his organisation being very much involved in this consultative process.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="11063052000315"></a>Our approach to local referendums is to enable referendums on local matters at the relevant council area, but for the issue at hand. If it is a district council matter, or a matter over which the district council has influence, the referendum can be held at the district council level, whether it be across one or more wards of the district, or the entire area of the district council, but it is the district council that is the triggering authority for this poll, other than having a parish poll. If it is a parish matter, we believe that a parish poll is the most appropriate method. We will discuss our intended approach to parish council referendums later, and I can assure noble Lords that the parish sector will be fully catered for. We want to see a modernised and proportionate local referendums regime for parishes, on which we will fully consult. I hope, therefore, that with these assurances my noble friend will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="11063052000317"></a>Let me just give one example. In the parish of Laneshaw Bridge, which is in Pendle in the ward of Boulsworth, a huge issue that has split the village is the question whether the village school should be very considerably expanded to take in a much larger area than the village. The village was split. Nobody knows what the majority opinion in the village is; what we know is that there were campaigning groups on both

Yet a referendum within Boulsworth ward relating to that issue-which would be a classic and typical example for a referendum-would be irrelevant, because the village is only one fifth or so of the entire ward. The rest of the ward consists of another much larger village, another couple of larger villages in a different parish, in which I live, and part of the town of Colne. Having the referendum in that arbitrary area would be irrelevant to knowing what the people of Laneshaw Bridge think.</p>

The issue is not whether the matter is one which lies with the local authority or with the parish-that is readily understood and, if it lies with the parish, the parish poll would suffice-but it may well be a matter which lies for decision with the local authority but only affects a small community. It is the nature of rural local authority wards that they often cover a number of communities, many of which would not be affected by the issue at hand, even though it is the local authority that is the decision taker. That is the issue that was not really responded to earlier.</p>

There is clearly an issue here and it is clearly one that will continue to be discussed. We look forward with interest to seeing the Government's proposals for parishes, but the continuation of the point made by my noble friend Lord Taylor is: who pays for the referendum? If it is a district, county or unitary issue, surely that authority should pay for the referendum and the cost of it should not fall upon the parish council, which may well have a view on the matter and be involved in the discussions, but is not responsible in any way for the issue before the referendum. That is a very important matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="11063052000320"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Beecham, made the point that there is possible provision in the Bill for local authorities to define appropriate local areas which are not co-incident with ward boundaries. It seems to me that a provision that they should be one polling district or a collection of polling districts is one that ought to be looked at by the Government, because polling districts, by their very nature, already have the machinery in place for elections, yet polling districts in most wards are smaller than the wards of which they form part. I put that suggestion to the Government and, on that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I have seen examples, which I have been given by lobbying organisations, where a big company has decided that it wants to build something and make a lot of money from doing so, but it understands that the relevant local authority might consider, even if there is a desirable benefit to the community, that it is not a priority for that community to build such a project. Rather than try to persuade the local authority that that is what it should do, the company hires people to go around canvassing door to door and in shopping centres and persuading them to sign petitions.

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="11063052000323"></a>When the initiative then has to be agreed to because there is seen to be public demand for it, and not to agree to that public demand would be seen to be a problem for the local authority, then the moneyed interests hire the lobbying company to run direct mail campaigns and adverts in the local paper, persuading people that this is what should be voted for. When the initiative is successful, those interests benefit significantly in a commercial sense from something that has not really been proven in a democratic way to be the desire of local people, but where money has paid for the collection of petition signatures and has been very decisive in determining the outcome of the ballot. That is not at all the intention of the Government with this sort of process, but it could open up the democratic system to that sort of abuse. For those reasons, I beg to move.</p>

They refer to Clause 54, which refers to regulations about voting in, and the conduct of, referendums. Clause 54(6) states clearly:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="11063052000539"></a>"Regulations under this section may not include provision ... about the limitation of expenditure in connection with a referendum ... for the questioning of the result of a referendum by a court or tribunal",</p>

<p><a name="11063052000483"></a>or,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000593"></a>"creating criminal offences".</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000484"></a>The question here is: does that mean that established and understood election law, in these areas and in others, will not apply in the case of a local referendum? Will normal election law not apply? What redress does anyone have if it is believed that someone is rigging the referendum if there is a considerable degree of personation taking place-despite the complacency that there still is in many quarters, quite a bit of old-fashioned personation goes on at polling stations in some parts of the country-or the rigging of postal votes, which takes place on a frequent basis in some parts of the country and in any case is perfectly easy to do? If the system is that there is no criminal or other redress against this happening, the odds are that where some people think that the question behind the referendum is very important, the odds are that this sort of thing will continue.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="11063052000325"></a>If there are freestanding referendums, that may simply be a matter for the referendum. However, it is quite clear that, for reasons of cost, where referendums are taking place councils will do their best to make sure that they do so at the same time as elections-probably on the first Thursday in May, whenever the local elections are taking place or European elections in June and so on. Under those circumstances, if I read the provisions of Clause 54 correctly, rules will apply to the election campaigns but some of them will not apply to the referendum campaigns taking place alongside them. Given what we all believe will happen-

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="11063052000326"></a>If I were campaigning in a local election and there was a referendum going on at the same time, I might well include reference to the referendum and what I thought people should do-both for and against it-in my election literature. Indeed, this happened on a large scale among all the parties during the AV campaign, but less so with the Labour party because it could not make up its mind whether it was in favour or against. It happened on a large scale with the Conservative Party and to some extent among the Liberal Democrats. Leaflets were put out saying, "Vote for Joe Bloggs and, by the way, vote"-yes or no-"in the referendum campaign". Or it was the other way around: leaflets went out which were 90 per cent "vote no" in the referendum campaign, and also "Vote for your local Conservative candidate". I compliment their skill in doing that; it won them a lot of seats.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="11063052000327"></a>It is going to happen, certainly at local level. So what about rules like election law, such as the need for imprints on leaflets? Will that apply to referendum material? What about the rules about payment of canvassers? My noble fiend Lord Rennard referred to the possible payment of canvassers for collecting petition signatures, but what about paying canvassers to go around and persuade people to vote one way or the other in a referendum, which is illegal in elections? What about offences relating to what you can and cannot do at the counting of the votes? What about offences relating to intimidation of voters? Particularly where there are joint elections, common sense suggests that there should be common rules. The provision in Clause 54 suggests that there should not. I would be grateful if the Minister could explain what it means and whether it needs some amendment before the Bill completes its passage through this House.</p>

Given what he indicated this morning, I assume that the Minister is inclined to adopt the position of the Delegated Powers Committee; namely, that these regulations should be subject to affirmative resolution. I certainly hope that that would be the case. He nods assent, for which I am grateful.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="11063052000334"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rennard, touched on an interesting issue when he talked about paying people to requisition a referendum. I do not know of a precise precedent but certainly an analogous situation arose not too long ago in Greater Manchester, where a large commercial concern, Peel Holdings, was, among others, very hostile to the notion of a congestion charging scheme for Greater Manchester. It launched a campaign in the metropolitan borough of Bury to call for a mayoral referendum in the hope and assumption that an anti-congestion charge mayor of whatever political affiliation would be elected, and because in the great scheme of things a single authority in Greater Manchester-only one authority-could veto the whole scheme, that would be sufficient to jettison this scheme, which the company felt was against its interests.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="11063052000335"></a>I understand that the company invested a considerable amount of time, energy and cash in securing the signatures to enable a referendum to be held. It was held and there was a low turnout-I recall that something like 11 per cent or so of people voted in the referendum for the holding of a mayoral election, which then took place. Happily, from my perspective, an equally small proportion of the electorate turned out to vote against having a mayor. That is an indication of the dangers that might arise if there was no restriction on what  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1923"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1923</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>commercial interests might get up to in the context of securing local petitions. Of course, the difference is that that referendum was binding and other referendums would not be; nevertheless, there is a real danger in that regard. However, I take note of what the noble Lord, Lord True, has said-one must be careful about creating new offences. Although the matter is certainly worth exploring, I do not rush to an immediate view that creating another offence of this kind is necessarily the answer. Having said that, I find it difficult to think of a better solution, so one might have to have recourse to that.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="11063052000336"></a>I have an amendment in this group, the number of which escapes me, which relates to Clause 54(7) about the making of regulations, and would require the Secretary of State to consult not only the Electoral Commission but the Local Government Association as well. I hope that the Minister will accede to that. It seems sensible to me to involve the LGA in matters of this kind. However, I do not understand some of the provisions that Clause 54 makes for regulations to be made by the Secretary of State. This goes back to some of the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, yesterday. Clause 54(4) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="11063052000541"></a>"Regulations under this section may make provision about-</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="11063052000542"></a>(a) when, where and how voting in a local referendum is to take place;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="11063052000543"></a>(b) how the votes cast in a local referendum are to be counted".</p>

<p><a name="11063052000486"></a>A simple assimilation of electoral law, in so far as that prescribes these matters, would surely be sufficient. The notion that detail of that kind needs to be made the subject of a Secretary of State's regulation strikes me as absurd. On the other hand, if there are to be regulations, I do not quite follow the position of the noble Lords, Lord Rennard and Lord Greaves, and, for all I know, his colleagues on the Lib Dem part of the government Benches, who wish to take out of subsection (6) regulations,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000594"></a>"about the limitation of expenditure ... for the questioning of the result of a referendum by a court or tribunal",</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000487"></a>or for "creating criminal offences.</p>

The difference between the two is that a referendum is not mandatory, it merely advises a local authority and it is therefore not unreasonable to say that it may be covered by a lighter touch than an election whose outcome is definitive, where the problems to which noble Lords have referred apply. I have spent a lifetime in active party politics, and I know how important it is to try to create a proper framework. I was grateful to both my noble friend Lord True and the noble Lord, Lord Collins, for pointing out the problems that could arise if we tried to set up regulations that criminalised activities in collecting petition names, and the like.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="11063052000340"></a>Amendment 129E creates a criminal offence, and Amendment 129C broadens the Secretary of State's regulating powers to allow the regulations to provide for referendum results to be questioned in court. The creation of criminal offences is simply unnecessary for a regime that is, effectively, non-binding.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="11063052000341"></a>One problem that the coalition is trying to deal with is the profusion of unnecessary criminal offences on the statute book. I suggest that the incurring of expenditure to pay someone to campaign to collect signatures falls well below the hurdle that needs to be cleared before persons should be at risk of receiving a criminal record.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="11063052000342"></a>I have not examined the situation fully, but my first impression was that the noble Lord, Lord Collins, might well be right, because the reason why it is possible to pay people to work in elections is that their fees are part of the election expenses. It could create problems if they were also involved in a referendum.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="11063052000343"></a>Amendment 129B expands the scope of the Secretary of State's power to make regulations on the conduct of referendums to include regulations about the limitation of expenditure in connection with a referendum. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is right about what the Bill states on that. We will be discussing the wider issues about publicity arrangements for referendums in a later group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="11063052000344"></a>Clause 46(6)(b) distinguishes between the procedural regulations that may be made in respect of local referendums which are not binding and those which may be made in respect of binding referendums, such as whether to have an elected mayor. We intend that local referendums should be more light touch, given their non-binding nature. The intention behind the amendments may be to limit restrictions on authorities in connection with the question. In fact, the equivalent provision in regulations for binding referendums is used to impose spending limits on petition organisers and those opposing petitions, and they are invariably accompanied by criminal offences for breaching spending limits. We are not convinced that such requirements are necessary for this scheme of non-binding referendums.</p>

It would remove the words "of the referendum" from Clause 55(8). These words may be considered unnecessary but they do not cause

The Electoral Commission is expressly included in the Bill as it is standard practice in all such electoral matters. I neglected to say in reply to the previous debate that we are consulting the Electoral Commission. However, I can assure noble Lords that we intend to consult widely before making regulations, which will include local government associations. I hope that noble Lords will see these non-binding referenda becoming a very different category from ordinary electoral law and I hope that with these assurances, my noble friend will withdraw the amendment.</p>

Whether we like it or not they are all about the possibility for graft and corruption-perhaps not at the same level as for an election itself, but nevertheless graft and corruption over an important matter. If they are not important matters, why are we spending all this money having these referendums?</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="11063052000348"></a>I just want to make two very brief points. First, within electoral law for elections there is a clear and well understood distinction between paying canvassers and paying people for doing other things, such as delivering leaflets, manning committee rooms, or whatever. You can pay helpers in elections but you are not allowed to pay canvassers. There is a growing area between the two but the distinction is well understood and by and large adhered to.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="11063052000349"></a>My second point, which is more fundamental, is the point I made about joint campaigns. It is inconceivable that there will not be joint campaigns of trying to get someone to vote for or against a referendum and an election campaign at the same time, with joint literature, posters and other things that money is spent on. Unless the regulations referring to the referendum are similar to those referring to the election, it will drive a coach and horses through the limits on election expenditure. There must be the same rules for the same two things if people are campaigning for the two things together in the same place at the same time. That is common sense otherwise it is a recipe for a huge amount of misunderstanding and chaos, and as I said, driving a coach and horses through some of the local election rules, not least on the limits on expenditure. That question needs a bit more thought by the Government.</p>

When we are looking at this petition process and these referendum issues, we have to look rather more carefully than we have done up to now at how we avoid abuse within the system. From my noble friend Lord Greaves and the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, we have heard some genuine concerns about how the system could be open to abuse. We have also heard from the noble Lords, Lord True and Lord Collins, that there is no appetite for what might be considered to be further regulation or offences.</p>

That is a fundamental principle of democracy. We try to have fair rules in elections; they are not perfect and are often grey. Many of us are trying to work to improve them, but we try to have some rules to make sure there is a balance in funding and safeguards to avoid people cheating. Some of those rules and regulations are important in elections and they should also be considered as relevant and necessary in the petition process and for these referendums.</p>

So far in this discussion of referendums we have tended to see it almost in a bilateral way between the public, who might petition and support a referendum, and the local authority, which might be disposed to agree to hold a referendum and have to deal with the results. These amendments are concerned with the third party: a person or company whose activities may have been the cause of suggesting that there should be a referendum. Putting it briefly, they should be involved in some way in the process, being consulted at the different stages and having the opportunity to have their say. This is what these three amendments are about.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="11063052000356"></a>When we come to it later, the Bill is perfectly clear on how and why a referendum might be held. It is also clear that it would not be binding on the local authority, but the processes are not as clear as they should be. I will take the example of an airport. I have had the advantage of consulting the company that runs Gatwick Airport, but the issue could apply to similar projects and institutions around the country. Of course, if the proposal is of the major kind that comes within the purview of the Infrastructure Planning Commission, or the MIPU that will take its place under the Bill, there is a separate procedure: I will not touch on that.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="11063052000357"></a>In the case of airports, the level for application of the processes of the IPC is if a development would involve more than 10 million passengers a year. That is a pretty big hurdle. A great deal of what goes on-this may apply to power stations or even reservoirs, but will certainly encompass airports-including a great deal of the ongoing development that falls below that limit, will therefore have to be considered by the local authority.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="11063052000358"></a>I am not referring now to the question of planning, which we will deal with later when we debate the next clause. The question is whether a project may be put forward that has aroused opposition and may therefore provoke a referendum. Gatwick Airport is a good example because it exemplifies exactly what might be expected. Gatwick is the UK's second largest airport. As I have learnt in the course of my discussions, it has the busiest single runway in the world. That is an astonishing fact, but it is what I am told. The airport  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1928"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1928</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>serves 200 destinations in 90 countries, with around 33 million passengers a year. The airport recently had a change of ownership. The new owners are very busy developing the airport so that its potential can be properly utilised for the benefit not only of the local economy but of the country as a whole. The airport provides around 25,000 jobs on campus and another 13,000 across the region. It generates a very large amount of wealth, as noble Lords may imagine.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="11063052000359"></a>The airport does not operate in a vacuum. It is surrounded by local communities and is close to a number of towns. The owners are very conscious of the need to be responsible developers and to take account of local opinion. They have always done that and I suspect that the new management are doing it rather better than their predecessors. Therefore, we are talking about how to achieve a balance between the very desirable objective in the Bill of giving local residents a bigger say in what happens in the areas in which they live, and giving investors the confidence that is necessary if they are going to develop their business. That is the issue. Hitherto we have been talking about the first aspect: the question of how local communities can have a say. The second, of course, is what these amendments are intended to address.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="11063052000360"></a>One should remember that a commercial institution like Gatwick Airport often has to work to extremely tight timetables. It has to raise finance and have regard to its regulator. An economically regulated airport such as Gatwick can face severe financial penalties if the targets set by the regulator are not met. Investors need the certainty that there will be no potential obstacles to meeting those timetables so they can be reasonably sure of avoiding the penalties.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="11063052000361"></a>How is this new system going to be applied to them? How are you going to deal with this? The purpose of my amendments, as I said at the beginning, is to provide the clarity which the Bill does not have at the moment. They would provide for a transparent consultation between a local authority and an affected third party-in this case the company running the airport-which might be named in a local referendum as to whether it is appropriate that a referendum should be held at all. Further, if a referendum is to be called that relates to it, it should be notified.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="11063052000362"></a>Finally, Amendment 129CA would ensure that a named third party-in this case the manager of the airport or it might be any of the other investors with ongoing development requirements-should be consulted before the local authority chooses whether to give effect to the result at all. We have already discussed that the referendum is not binding: it is a decision the local authority would have to take. All the clause asks is that the affected third party should have an opportunity to have a say and that the local authority should have regard to any representations.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="11063052000363"></a>It might be said that these things are so automatic they ought to happen already. I am sure that is not always the case. People can sometimes plough ahead. It may be an unpopular development. I have not been told, but I suspect that around major airports there are communities deeply hostile to what goes on there; it would not surprise me in the least. I used to live near Stansted Airport and, as we have all seen, the opposition to the expansion has been immense. There has been  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1929"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1929</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>intense opposition. Every airport will have that but they need to be reasonably sure that the managers and the developers can have a proper opportunity to have their say and for their views to be taken into account.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="11063052000364"></a>That is what these three amendments do. They provide a level of safeguard against what one might call the unintended consequences of what is otherwise a desirable development. It is people having more of a say about what happens in their own areas. When I questioned the people from the airport they told me firmly, "We agree it is right and proper that local people should be able to express their views on issues specific to their area". I come back to the point that it is a question of holding the balance. My amendments simply intend to provide reasonable procedures which would enable a better chance with the local authority holding the balance as it should. I beg to move.</p>

On the kind of issue the noble Lord has addressed, such as a very controversial issue like an airport or major development, it is inconceivable that a prospective developer would be unaware of a petition doing the rounds. On the other hand paragraph (b) of Amendment 126ZA says,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000595"></a>"any person who is the owner or occupier of any land to which the petition or request relates".</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000489"></a>I can think immediately of situations in my own ward where we have empty properties about which there is considerable concern. There might well be petitions coming to the local authority to do something about them but very often it is impossible to know who the owner of the property is or how to contact the owner. Again, that would create a significant burden and, with the best possible motive, it is overegging the responsibilities of the authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="11063052000366"></a>I have a little more sympathy with the after-the-event process that the noble Lord refers to in Amendment 129CA because it requires the authority to consult. There will potentially be same issue on paragraph (b) but, in general, it is not unreasonable to require the authority to consult in a referendum those affected although, bearing in mind again that we are talking about non-binding referendums, this is a less significant issue than it would otherwise be. Nevertheless, it is good practice for an authority to consult if it is going to do that, and I see no harm in that provision. However, if the Government are minded to accept it, I urge that there be some qualification to paragraph (b) about the ownership or occupation of land, which may be very difficult to identify. On the other hand, paragraph (c),</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000596"></a>"any other person whom the authority considers to have an interest",</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000490"></a>is so wide that I think it is a bit much. If the Government are at all minded to respond sympathetically to the noble Lord, and I hope they are in respect of the second point, it should really be combined to paragraph (a) and a modified paragraph (b). That would be my respectful suggestion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="11063052000368"></a>I support these amendments as I consider them to be in the spirit of the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, gives a useful example in Gatwick Airport, but there is a wide range of third parties that may be affected by any referendum. When decisions are being taken, those impacted by them should be notified and consulted openly. It is right that local authorities consult those potentially affected about whether it is appropriate to hold a referendum at all, as well notifying them if it were to happen and consulting on what steps are taken afterwards. Referenda should be a positive tool and, to that end, they should be well considered and thoughtfully implemented if they are to have the best possible impact on communities. I hope the Minister agrees.</p>

I live within what is known as the Gatwick Diamond economic area, so I know very well what he is referring to. I know of situations where, for instance, residential development takes place near to industrial premises through normal course of development and re-use. Gatwick Diamond, along with many other areas, is now a 24/7 operation. It is near enough to coastal ports for large lorries to be coming along and near enough to all sorts of aviation-related and other downstream industries.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="11063052000370"></a>Local residents may not much like 44-tonne lorries coming along in the wee small hours of the morning. I can quite see that, but it is not fanciful at all to suppose that they might not wish to procure a cessation via triggering a referendum with a view to protecting what they see as their interests. Nor is it a planning-only issue because it may relate to a whole raft of regulatory functions for which local authorities and other bodies have responsibility. While I cannot vouch that the wording that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, uses is cohesive, I think there needs to be some regard for the economic consequences of what is being sought by a referendum. It seems that a referendum can be formulated on quite a narrow premise. If that is the case, it is quite possible for it to concern things of a much broader spectrum. It is worthy of consideration by the Minister.</p>

There are ways of doing that through petitions or by addressing local councillors through the local media that would be much quicker and more likely to have an effect than the necessarily rather cumbersome processes that would be involved in a referendum. In those circumstances, therefore, is there perhaps less urgency and potency in the noble Lord's amendment than might otherwise have been the case?</p>

The provisions of the Bill cover a very large spectrum of possibilities and we are effectively empowering the Secretary of State to make orders. It is legitimate to lay down a marker as to what the parameters might be-I suspect that is all the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, is doing at the moment-and just to sound a word of warning. It is timely in that context.</p>

<p><a name="st_171"></a>
<a name="11063052000373"></a><b><a name="110630-0002.htm_spnew49"></a><a name="11063052000836"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I am going to speak in support of what my noble friend Lord Beecham said. It is the mention of airports that I cannot resist, of course, because we have one in Luton. I know how important it is to the local community and what a generator of jobs it is. In many ways, airports are the organisations least likely to need the measure that the noble Lord proposes because they have consultative committees anyway so there is automatically a wide engagement with the community. The principle of somebody who is potentially on the receiving end of a referendum or a petition knowing about that and the local authority having to make a decision to engage with them seems to be entirely reasonable. What we are balking at is that the specific amendment is a little too prescriptive and takes us too far down an unfortunate path. However, we are all well aware of the challenges that airports in particular face.</p>

It is the third arm of this that worries me most. It says,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000597"></a>"any other person whom the authority considers to have an interest which is likely to be affected by any steps that the authority may take to give effect to the result of the referendum".</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000375"></a>It is not just airports. Major commercial developments, for example, have effects over a wide area. Leaving aside Stansted, about which I know a good deal, and which would certainly be said to have effects over 30, 40, 50 or 100 or more miles, Lakeside at Thurrock has had effects on shopping centres all over Essex. It is unimaginable that the local authority would really have to consult the people of Thurrock, Chelmsford, Colchester, Braintree and Brentwood-to name the Secretary of State's constituency and indeed that of the noble Baroness, Lady Smith. We need some caution before going down the path scripted in this amendment. That is all I would say. There may be merit in the purpose but the wording needs very careful consideration.</p>

I am not entirely sure whether my noble friend Lord Jenkin, who has presented these amendments, is the same noble Lord who just the other day was urging me to trust local people to run these affairs. Localism is the name of the Bill; localism is what it is about. I urge him to read his own speech in <I>Hansard</I> to realise why it is that the Government do not want to bind this policy up.

I am sorry to be so frank but I am motivated by the nature of this argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="11063052000377"></a>I do not think that the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, was in the Chamber when I introduced government amendments earlier today which excluded planning applications from the referendum process. That is very important to understand in this context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="11063052000380"></a>As regards the amendments tabled by my noble friend, I share his concerns that no person should find himself featuring in a referendum without an opportunity to make representations on the matter. But that I am sure is in the nature of these things and the dialogue within local communities. I understand that my noble friend is using the word "person" in the strictly legal sense of meaning company and corporate activity. In my estimation, it would be a rare case, as I have said, that a referendum will in practice concern a situation where people are totally unaware of the issues that are subject to a referendum.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="11063052000381"></a>Similarly, in deciding whether to give effect to a referendum result, the local authority will have regard to the need to balance the views of all interested groups. It will have regard to the economic interests of the area as perceived by it as a local authority and as elected representatives. To take such decisions is what local government has to do all the time. If there was any doubt that it would be appropriate for authorities to consult people directly affected by referendums, I hope that what I have said will dispel that. We believe that the amendments are unnecessary burdens on authorities and I hope that my noble friend will not press them.</p>

I am very grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, and the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, for their support. Nevertheless, in response to my noble friend on the Front Bench, I feel myself in a sense wanting to say touché. Of course, I am not seeking to impose centrally or to tell local authorities the details of how they should do this. But it is part of the function of central government to protect local communities and ratepayers against possible abuse of processes by local government. One would always say that. But it does not need the great mass of legislation in this Bill.</p>

There is a useful Labour amendment in the group but I will let the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, speak to it.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="11063052000386"></a>Clause 47 is an important clause because it sets out the grounds on which the council should make its decision when it receives a petition or indeed a request from a member about whether a referendum takes place or not. This is not a trivial decision. We have heard that referendums across London might cost many millions of pounds; but for any big councils in big cities, we are talking about millions of pounds. Even for smaller councils, it can be an important item in their budget, or one that is not in their budget, which nevertheless they have to find a way of covering. In the present financial circumstances this might well mean cutting other useful services.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="11063052000387"></a>This is a list. Whenever we put forward lists, we are always told by the Government to be very careful because, if we put things in the list, they are in, and if we do not put them in the list, people might think they are not in. In this case, we know that they are not in because Clause 47(1) says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="11063052000547"></a>"A principal local authority may only determine"-</p>

<p><a name="11063052000491"></a>I emphasise "only determine"-</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000598"></a>"that it is not appropriate to hold a local referendum in response to a petition or request on one or more of the following grounds".</ul>
<a name="110630-0002.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="11063052000388"></a>The list in Clause 47 is extremely important because it ties the hands of the local authority. It does not say to it, as the Minister has pointed out, that if it is in the   


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1934"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1934</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>list, it cannot have a referendum; however, it provides grounds by which a referendum can be refused. Regardless of whether we agree with referendums, I think that everybody agrees that we do not want a proliferation of them. We do not want dozens of referendums taking place all over the place. We want them held on important and useful things.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="11063052000389"></a>These grounds are vital. Amendment 126A refers to the first ground. It is a probing amendment to find out what the words mean. Clause 47(2) says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="11063052000548"></a>"The first ground is that the authority thinks that action taken to promote or oppose the referendum question is likely to lead to contravention of an enactment or a rule of law".</p>

<p><a name="11063052000492"></a>When I read this, I thought, "What does it mean?". The phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000599"></a>"action taken to promote or oppose the referendum question",</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000493"></a>refers to something happening during the referendum campaign. It is not about the question itself-what the effect would be of carrying out what the referendum wants brought about; it is about action taken during the campaign which,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000600"></a>"is likely to lead to contravention of an enactment or a rule of law".</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000494"></a>I can only think that this refers to the possibility of public disorder of some sort. Will the Minister say what the Government think it refers to? It is very difficult to see how this could be made to stick if it was challenged, because how would you know that the referendum question would be likely to lead to an unruly campaign? Alternatively, what else does it refer to? If it refers to a referendum question that is, for example, overtly racist, it would be easy to reject it, but the chance of getting such a referendum question is very small indeed. Racists who want to use a referendum to promote their cause are going to be more careful about how they word the question. So this is a probing amendment to find out what it means.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="11063052000390"></a>Amendments 126B and 126C challenge the word "influence", and again are probing amendments. We suggest that this should be brought in more tightly to a council's powers; that is, the things it can do. Even the general power of competence might be very wide. It is difficult to think of things that people might want to hold a referendum on but over which the council does not have some sort of influence. I suppose that a referendum about the melting of the Arctic ice cap might be thought out of order, but even then it might be tied to the council's climate change policies, so it is difficult to think of areas where the council has absolutely no influence. Some clarification of what the influence of a council is, in this sense, would be helpful.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="11063052000391"></a>Amendment 126D refers to subsection (4)(b):</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000601"></a>"a principal local authority or a partner authority has an influence over a matter if the authority can affect that matter by the exercise of any of its general or particular functions".</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000495"></a>That is very wide indeed, and I assume that it includes the new general power of competence. Is that true, because it means that it does go very wide? Amendment 126E seeks to insert a new subsection:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="11063052000549"></a>"The third ground is that the action requested by the question is unlawful or discriminatory, or would contravene the authority's codes relating to equality of treatment or its financial regulations".</p>

<p><a name="11063052000496"></a>Other noble Lords may think of other things that should be included, but this is clear. Surely it should be laid down that if the action requested by the  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1935"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1935</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>petition and the referendum question is actually unlawful or clearly discriminatory against an ethnic group, the disabled, men, women or anyone else, and would contravene all the codes an authority has on equality of treatment, or if the council could not do something because of its financial regulations, then it should be able to be thrown out without question. Indeed, anything which it would be impossible for the council to do but is being asked for in a referendum should be more clearly set out.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="11063052000392"></a>I turn to Amendment 126F. However, as the Minister has already moved an amendment today, this amendment is not needed, and we are grateful for that. Amendment 126H refers to the grounds set out in the Bill. At the moment they do not seem to be sufficiently wide. A council ought to be able to refuse a referendum if it judges that it concerns a trivial matter and spending money on it would simply not be worth the candle. Similarly, if the council or someone else is doing something anyway, the referendum would be a waste of time because the decision has been made. The Government have already moved an amendment to deal with repetition which provides that another referendum on the same subject cannot take place for four years. That, too, is extremely welcome. Our definition of "disproportionate" is that the cost of holding a referendum is excessive when bearing in mind the cost of carrying out the proposal in question. If a council is being asked to spend £80,000 to hold a referendum when to do what the referendum is asking for would cost only £15,000, it is a pointless waste, whether or not the council wishes to do it.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="11063052000393"></a>Finally, we suggest that the fifth ground for the decision is that it is not appropriate because what is being asked for is the allocation of a disproportionate level of resource in one area when it is absolutely clear to the council that it is either not practical due to financial constraints or it would be unfair; that is, it would be possible but it would mean taking resources from existing schemes and services to put into a particular scheme or service that was being requested by an area in a way that would not be equitable across the authority. Knowing that before the referendum takes place, the authority can show that it is not financially viable and that holding a referendum would be a waste of everybody's time and money.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="11063052000394"></a>These amendments may not be perfect but the criteria that the Government are putting forward at the moment in this clause are not sufficient to give a council enough flexibility to carry out the kind of localist decision-making that the Minister talked about not long ago-on a common-sense basis, without holding referendums which will simply waste a lot of time and money and not achieve anything. I beg to move.</p>

<ul><a name="11063052000602"></a>"determined to be so by the principal local authority".</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000497"></a>In other words, in addition to the conditions for what is local, it gives the authority the power to determine an issue of locality.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1936"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1936</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110630-0002.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="11063052000396"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has come forward with a mixed bag of amendments here. First, I will address his last proposition on the cost of the project relative to the cost of a referendum-or, indeed, the question of equity. That is Amendment 128A, to which he referred, on the deployment of extra resources in part of an authority's area. I am not quite with the noble Lord on this. Actually, a petition for a referendum is an opportunity to debate an issue that might be of significance to that part of an authority's area. Incidentally, I am not sure whether the amendment could extend to the whole of an authority's area or just part, and if so how that part is to be defined, except perhaps by the petitioners.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="11063052000397"></a>If there is such an issue, it is proper that it should be debated. Initially, no doubt, those promoting the referendum would be invited by the council to explain their position and the council would respond. That is a sensible way of proceeding. If they then wished to proceed to a referendum they should not be prevented from doing so. That is an opportunity, certainly for the residents or petitioners to make their case but also for the authority to exercise some leadership and explain what it is doing and the constraints within which it operates. It can make that clear not only for the purposes of the particular referendum but as a matter of general interest to the area as a whole. We all face these decisions about priorities all the time. They are perhaps insufficiently acknowledged or understood by the electorate. If referendums are a way to bring home some of these truths, particularly as they are non-binding, I would not want to resist them taking place.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="11063052000398"></a>The noble Lord's amendments include a reference to the question of influence as opposed to power. He cites the issue of the melting ice cap, implying that that is not a matter of local interest. The noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, is not in his place today, but if he were he might say that the residents of Norfolk have good reason to fear the melting of the ice cap. Saving the presence of the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, that issue might not be specifically related to the ice cap, but climate change and its impact on a community might well be a matter over which an authority has some influence and which it is relevant to ask it to look at. Influence would surely include a power, whereas the other way round it would not necessarily be the case. I would have thought that influence is actually a better way of looking at that issue.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="11063052000399"></a>I want to refer to one other amendment that the noble Lord spoke to. It is Amendment 128D, on the disproportionate cost of the referendum,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000603"></a>"bearing in mind the cost of carrying out the proposal in ... question".</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000498"></a>Again that raises a difficulty, as a matter might be of considerable significance to people but not involve much cost. There might be, let us say, a traffic issue or something of that kind which might be felt to be of great importance in an area. The referendum might be more costly than the exercise of dealing with the issue but I would not like it to be precluded simply on those grounds. Again, I hope that the very process of getting to the point of a referendum might facilitate the resolution of matters. As I indicated in an intervention on the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, there are other methods.

This might be an example of going a little too far to restrict the right, so I would not support the noble Lord on that amendment.</p>
<a name="time_36"></a>

<a name="11063052000400"></a><b><a name="110630-0002.htm_spnew58"></a><a name="11063052000845"></a>Lord True:</b> My Lords, I would also like to warn against this. Although I have some sympathy with some of the amendments spoken to by my noble friend, I think that Amendment 128A could cause great difficulties. As is emerging in this Committee, I am rather more enthusiastic about or tolerant of referendums than my noble friend perhaps appears to be. The reality is that when local authorities are being forced to restrain their spending, as they are at the moment-in our case £30 million was taken out of the budget-the last line,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000604"></a>"taking into account the resources available to the authority",</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000499"></a>would mean that, at a time of contraction, a local authority would effectively be able to say no to any referendum on the general basis that, "We can't afford what you're asking for". That could be used by some authorities simply to say, "We can't do any of it, so bye-bye".</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="11063052000401"></a>Equally, it would be quite difficult to resist calls for referendums, per contra-if ever that day comes; I do not expect to see it in the foreseeable future-when there are more resources coming into local authorities. I would be nervous about that and I rather agree with the noble Lord, Lord Beecham. Let us say, for example, that a community wished to see its local school expand but it was not possible at that time. Why would it not be reasonable for them to put their case forward in a referendum and put a marker down for some time in the future? I could not follow my noble friend on that amendment.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="11063052000402"></a>I think that Amendment 126CA, which was tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, and states,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000605"></a>"determined to be so by the principal local authority",</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000500"></a>is also in this group. I must tell my noble friend that I have some sympathy with this amendment as it emerged in earlier discussions. This is linked to the power that we discussed for individual councillors or pairs of councillors to launch referendums. Unless the local authority is able to determine what is a local matter to that authority, we could perversely be creating a situation where, for example, in its standing orders the local authority forbids discussion of the wars, perils and plagues around the world and yet a member of the council who wishes to have that matter discussed could use the referendum power to say, "Let's have a referendum on this subject". They might get some support and it could be a way of getting round it.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="11063052000403"></a>Again in the cause of localism, it should be open to the local authority to determine in every respect the way in which matters to be discussed impact on it, either directly or indirectly through a referendum. It should be left to the local authority at least to be able to have enough influence to align the mechanisms with a simple, coherent definition of what is a local matter. Apart from my liking for localism, the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, may have at least a useful argument there.</p>

<p><a name="st_182"></a>
<a name="11063052000405"></a><b><a name="110630-0002.htm_spnew60"></a><a name="11063052000847"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> This has been a useful debate. I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, for opening it, but even more grateful to my noble friend Lord True and the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, for their contributions. They recognised that there are difficulties in seeking to restrict the use of referenda too far. For example, Amendments 126A and 126E would replace the generic reference to,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000606"></a>"action taken to promote or oppose a referendum question leading to a contravention of an enactment or rule of law".</ul>
<a name="110630-0002.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="11063052000406"></a>I suspect that my noble friend Lord Greaves is presenting this as a probing amendment to find out what this is about and what sorts of enactments are considered unlawful. Clearly, no local authority could be obliged to consider through a referendum something which is unlawful. I hope that I can reassure my noble friend that the provision as drafted achieves the result that he requires. The Equality Act 2010, for example, is clearly "an enactment". The way in which Clause 47(2) is drafted actually caters for all the sorts of things that we would all want to catch and leaves no space for mischievous attempts to get round the protection, such as by phrasing a question cleverly so that it is not "the action requested" that would be unlawful, but the campaign surrounding the referendum.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="11063052000407"></a>The second ground that my noble friend mentioned was that the matter was not a local one over which the local authority has influence. My noble friend wanted to know what influence was and what would be the effect of replacing the word "influence" with the word "power". Amendment 126D removes Clause 47(4)(b), which contains the definition of "influence". We can appreciate the intention behind these amendments; nobody wants councils to be forced to hold irrelevant referendums and we have seen how the unconstrained power for electors to force parish polls has sometimes been misused by particular lobby groups to force polls on matters that are far removed from the remit of parish councils. However, if my noble friend is asking whether "influence" in Clause 47(4)(b) includes the general power of competence, I would say that indeed it does.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="11063052000408"></a>I do not believe that the alternative drafting suggested by noble Lords improves on what is in the Bill. When one considers the impact of Clause 1, one needs to be quite cautious about referring to situations where local authorities have "power" in future. I hope that noble Lords will accept my assurance that the formulation in Clause 47 is framed broadly enough to differentiate the circumstances where there is a manifestly inappropriate attempt to abuse the referendum system from one where there is an issue of local importance in which the local authority has a genuine role. My noble friend has acknowledged that his amendment is unnecessary in the light of the government amendment.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="11063052000409"></a>Amendments 126H and 128D seek to expand the fourth ground to give local authorities greater scope to reject a petition. We accept that there is a case for giving councils the flexibility to reject repetitive petitions or requests for referendums, and I hope that my noble  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1939"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1939</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>friend will accept that the proposals set out in the government amendments that I outlined earlier will meet his concerns. I contend that the arrangements in those amendments offer a better solution to what we all hope will not in fact become a problem in practice. The key to deterring frivolous calls for a referendum is to have in place a robust system for dealing with such things.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="11063052000410"></a>I am not sure that my noble friend is right. The noble Lord, Lord Beecham, grasped the point that cost is not the proper equation to be taken into account in judging whether a council should be able to refuse a referendum. Something may be extremely important to a local community that may involve little expenditure in terms of its implementation but would have a great impact on people's lives, and it is perfectly proper that that should be a subject for a referendum if the local authority feels that that is correct. So long as we get the framework right, and I believe that we have, there will be no point in anyone attempting to abuse the system and so they may not bother.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="11063052000411"></a>On Amendment 128A again, I agree with my noble friend Lord True. As he has said, that amendment would enable any referendum to be refused. I cannot see that that is the purpose of the legislation, and I hope that my noble friend Lord Greaves will reflect on that.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="11063052000412"></a>Amendment 126CA of the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, seeks to provide that a local matter will be a matter determined to be so by the local authority. We agree that it is for local authorities to determine whether or not it is appropriate to hold a local referendum. Our provisions give local authorities discretion to do that, subject to certain safeguards that we have discussed today. I am therefore not convinced that this amendment either is necessary or would make any practical difference, given the wording of Clause 47(3), which refers to whether the local authority,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000607"></a>"thinks that the matter to which the referendum question relates is not a local matter".</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000501"></a>So, that phrasing is already there. I hope that, given these assurances, the amendment will be withdrawn.</p>

Clearly I am not going to win on some of the amendments in the group, such as Amendments 128A and 128D, and it may well be that the clear majority view in the Committee is right. However, this has been a useful discussion and I thank noble Lords who have taken part.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="11063052000414"></a>The Minister said, and I think I quote him accurately, "So long as we get the framework right, then it'll all be okay". However, we are talking here about some of the framework, and you cannot rely on local authorities to get the framework right unless the legislation is right.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="11063052000415"></a>There are two areas that require more thought. The first and by far the most important concerns things that are illegal or contrary to council codes of conduct. The Minister said, rightly, that no council would want to carry out actions as the result of a referendum, or indeed to carry out a referendum, calling for things that were not legal. However, I think that what words say in legislation is important. As I read the proposal, and as I said when I was moving the amendment, the unlawful thing set out there is not the request in the

That must mean what happens during the referendum campaign, not what happens after people have voted and the consequences that occur if the council decides to go ahead with a proposal as the result of a referendum being passed. There is a real difference there. Perhaps the Minister can tell me why I have got it wrong.</p>

I have listened to what he is saying, and there is no way that any campaign of any description can be based on illegal acts. I hope that I have not misunderstood my noble friend. If I have, perhaps he might have a word with me and explain where I have gone wrong. Not only is it not possible for a referendum to be put that demands a council to perform illegally, it is clearly wrong for campaigners to offend against the law in the nature of the campaign or statements that they make in seeking to petition for a referendum.</p>

The law is the law, and if people break the law, they break the law. My point is that, as I read the legislation, the illegality refers to the likelihood of people breaking the law during the election campaign as a ground for refusing to have a referendum. Although I tabled an amendment to remove that, it was a probing amendment and I am not suggesting that it should be removed. I am suggesting that it should be made absolutely clear that the ground for refusing to have a referendum is that what is being asked for as the outcome of the referendum is not legal. I cannot understand why that should not happen. That is different from the conduct of the campaign, but I am happy to discuss this informally with the Minister.</p>

Perhaps, if I am wrong about that, my noble friend can explain. I am principally interested in the way in which allowing planning matters in under a referendum would make a mess of the provisions for neighbourhood planning. We have extensive provision there for referenda and there should not be a cross-cutting system which allows that process, which is difficult and expensive enough to organise anyway, to be upset by people running competing referendums, or in other ways trying to upset the decision once it has been made.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="11063052000421"></a>My noble friend's amendment looks at the granting of planning permission. I am much more interested in the creation of a neighbourhood plan. Subsection (4)(b) of the government amendment refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000608"></a>"a statutory right of appeal in respect of the substance of the matter or decision",</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000502"></a>on the part of persons adversely affected. In other words, it is saying that this provision does not apply if there is no third-party right of appeal, which I think there is not in a lot of planning permissions. I view the scope of subsection (4) of Amendment 128E as being very limited compared with the sort of exclusions that I would like to see. As all planning is dealt with very satisfactorily in the neighbourhood planning section, it should not be allowed in the local referendum section in any form. I beg to move.</p>

However, like all amendments, there was a supplementary purpose lurking behind it, which was to try to probe the wider interaction between the facility of referendums generally, especially in their cumulative effect-the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, who is not in his place at the moment, touched on that a few minutes ago-and the wider family of the statutory functions of local authorities. It is instructive to note Amendment 128C relating to transport.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para124"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="11063052000423"></a>I have lost count of the number of times that the burdens on local authorities on the one hand and the need to get at the authentic voice of people on the other have been referred to in this part of the Bill. We are considering the effects for a democratically elected representative body whose functions might not work terribly well, or be effectively discharged, if a referendum is imposed. The Bill cannot be all things to all men. We have to have a balance between vox populi on the one hand and the effective administration of local government on the other. That balance needs to be explained.</p>

I do not think that we have given the Government enough credit for the amendment that we heard of earlier today, because that seemed to me to satisfy, if not entirely-I want to dwell on that-a good deal of the misgivings that we have had about referendums applying to the world of planning. We now have an amendment that will mean that planning applications are taken out of the reach of petitions and referendums. That is an enormous difference from where we were yesterday. I want to place on record my appreciation to the Government for taking that forward. It means that another laboriously prepared speech of mine is now redundant, but the amendment is extremely welcome.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="11063052000426"></a>Our hesitations about where we have got to are as follows. We understand that discretion is there for local authorities not to go ahead with referendums if there is a statutory process that gives members of the public opportunities to make representations and a statutory right of appeal or of investigation through a review. However, although that clearly applies to individual planning applications-great stuff-does that apply to all of the processes of preparing local development plans? I think that it must cover the preparation of the local development frameworks. If it did not cover the local authority preparing its local development plan, that would be disastrous. Throughout local government, we are already way behind in getting those local development frameworks undertaken. The abolition of regional spatial strategies means that we will be in limbo if local authorities do not have their own local development plans. We must get on with that. It would be incredibly difficult for the Government to pursue their growth agenda and do the good things that they want to do in terms of the development of renewable energy and the development of new homes if the threat of referendums was hanging over the creation of local development plans.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="11063052000427"></a>Beyond that, there are supplementary planning documents. They may not have the full panoply of examination in public and independent inspection in all cases. For removal of doubt, it would be better to have an amendment such as that in my name or in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that takes the whole of the planning scene out of the referendum process. If we cannot, can we at least have firm reassurance that the process of producing local development plans, with the supplementary elements that go with them-the whole of that process-will be excluded by this excellent amendment?</p>

I think it is entirely justifiable-indeed, desirable-that there should be a referendum in those cases. It would be most unfortunate if the legislation ruled out such an eventuality. It would disfranchise people on some of the most basic and fundamental issues that affect their lives and the nature of how their community develops.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para129"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="11063052000430"></a>I certainly could not support an amendment ranging as widely as that of my noble friend Lord Lucas. "Planning matters" is wording far too widely cast. Of course I agree with the point established in Committee; I think that most noble Lords agreed that we do not want to encourage referendums on individual planning applications. I also have very grave doubt about how far we should cast it in relation to local development plans and frameworks.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para130"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="11063052000431"></a>We have a local development framework at the moment, which it is clear that the public do not find satisfactory. As neighbourhood planning develops, a referendum might well be desired by people or wished for by the council. That is a useful device in an age of localism in involving people in such fundamental issues.</p>

<a name="110630-0002.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="11063052000432"></a>I hope that my noble friend will resist casting that constriction on the right of people to be heard on the neighbourhood and place in which they live. Nothing to my mind is more fundamental in the 21st century to the role of a local authority than the spirit of place. People's opportunity to express their view about the nature of their place in terms of the broad planning framework under which they live in their communities seems to be absolutely vital. It would send a hard and difficult message if the Committee were to constrict that opportunity in the way suggested by the noble Lord.</p>

I discovered that my area in London recently increased car-parking fines to £130-a phenomenal increase.

That is within the structure of the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Best, made an important point about LDFs. We need to get on with that as so many of them are not yet completed. We have a lacuna, with regional spatial strategies going before many of these plans were in place, and the data associated with all of those are in danger of disappearing. We propose to deal with that by transition arrangements but that is a debate for another day, if not another week at the rate we are going.

I am, however, in a less than satisfactory situation in the sense that we can see that a number of factors now come into play. The definition of planning appeals, an appeal process, and the rest of it means that it will require some further thought to see what the implications are. It is clear that a referendum on planning applications can be ruled out, but indicative planning and the like with consultative processes are a matter that we need to consider, as well as how exactly they might be brought into this process. My noble friend Lord True carefully articulated the importance of making sure that the public voice in these matters is not stifled. We accept that, but on the other hand we do not want the whole referendum process to be totally absorbed on planning matters.</p>

If there were a case where hundreds and thousands of people had been involved in indicative planning and the process of planning, clearly a referendum that then came along from a group would potentially be vexatious. A local authority could resist that. Maybe "vexatious" is not the right word, but what concerns me is the case that I cited of a regional body, London, interfering with a lower body where there has been no effective consultation, it was a choice between two visions of the future and there has not been adequate public involvement. It might in those cases not be vexatious to have a referendum. It might be illuminating and that is the difference. Perhaps in considering this, my noble friend might want to look at the application of Clause 47(6) and how that would bite on these potential powers.</p>

My noble friend and other noble Lords-including my noble friend Lord True-have raised many subjects to which I will be very interested to read the answers. My particular worry is that proposed new subsection (4)(b)(i) in Amendment 128E seems to suggest that this is a matter in which injured and adversely affected persons have a right of appeal. In the case of most planning applications, one can consider oneself adversely affected if one has to look at an ugly monstrosity across the street, yet one does not have the right to appeal because there is no third-party right of appeal. I am concerned that the wording of the amendment does not exempt most planning applications, but I am sure that the Minister will cover that in his reply.</p>

The noble Lord could have his referendum on parking charges and the council would meet the cost of the referendum by increasing the charges even more. Who knows what unintended consequences may occur? I will now speak to the amendment before the Whips start glowering at me.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="11063052000450"></a>Amendment 128H is about the publicity that a principal local authority has to give to a determination that it is not appropriate to hold a referendum. Clause 48(4) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a><a name="11063052000573"></a>"If the determination is that it is not appropriate to hold the referendum ... the notification must give the reasons for the determination, and ... subject to subsection (5), the authority must publish those reasons when it publishes the determination".</p>

<p><a name="11063052000503"></a>That all seems fine. But then subsection (5) says a quite extraordinary thing:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a><a name="11063052000574"></a>"A principal local authority is not obliged to publish those reasons if it thinks that in all the circumstances it would be inappropriate to do so".</p>

<p><a name="11063052000504"></a>I cannot think of any circumstances in which it would not be appropriate to publish the reasons why the local authority has decided not to hold the referendum when it gets a petition which otherwise matches all the necessary conditions.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="11063052000451"></a>The grounds for determination are set out in Clause 47 which we have been discussing at some length and they are fairly clear-they would be even clearer if some of  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1949"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1949</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>my amendments were passed. Even so, the Bill is going to include a clear statement of the reasons why a council can decide not to have a referendum even though it gets a petition.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="11063052000452"></a>Amendment 128Q is exactly the same wording in relation to a request for a referendum from a member. Whether it has to tell the member the reasons why it is not going to have the referendum the member is asking for, I am not quite sure, but it seems quite extraordinary that this is the case. It takes me back to my very early days in local government, which are far too long ago, when the council I was on-and no doubt many others-used to publish a minute for a decision that said something like, "That the action now mentioned be carried out by the officer now named".</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="11063052000453"></a>That sort of thing does not happen any more. My understanding is that local authorities are now under a general obligation to state the reasons for all the decisions they make and publish. That is certainly what the local authorities I know all do and I think that is now required. If a decision can be made not to hold a referendum without having to say why, then if the people asking for the referendum are rich enough it is a recipe for lining the pockets of a lot of lawyers. If they are not rich enough they will just get very angry and the whole process will be undermined.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="11063052000454"></a>I am challenging similar provisions in Amendments 129D and 129CAA which cover what a local authority does after a referendum and the action it decides to take. Again, it is suggested that if no action is taken then the authority has to publish the decision. In this case what the Bill says is right: the authority has to publish the decision and the reasons why if it decides not to do anything about a referendum that has been carried by a majority of people voting and calls for action. However, it does not have to say anything at all if it decides to carry out what the referendum wants or it decides partly to carry out what the referendum wants or to do something slightly different which might achieve some of the same objectives.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="11063052000455"></a>It seems to me that whatever the decision is on the basis of the referendum that has taken place, the local authority ought to make a clear statement of what it is going to do in response to the referendum, the decision of the referendum and give the reasons why. In this case, I suspect it is that the people drafting this have not thought through it 100 per cent. I would have thought the Government could have redrafted this part without any real problems. The first two, where it clearly says that you do not have to say why you are rejecting it, are clearly wrong and must be challenged.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="11063052000456"></a>Amendment 128J is the other amendment in this group and takes us back to some discussions we had on the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act when it was going through this House on the question of identification of the organiser of a petition. It was all very unsatisfactory when that Bill came to this House. We got it right. This is less unsatisfactory but it is still not quite right. Clause 48(6) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a><a name="11063052000575"></a>"In this Chapter 'petition organiser', in relation to a petition, means-</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a><a name="11063052000576"></a>(a) the person designated in the petition as the person with whom the authority may deal in relation to the petition".</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1950"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1950</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="11063052000505"></a>It is possible that a petition will come in and the person is not actually designated in the petition but the person identifies themselves as the organiser, they turn up and hand it in, they have a covering letter that they have signed or something like that. Amendment 128J suggests a slightly better wording. Instead of,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000609"></a>"designated in the petition"</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000506"></a>it suggests,</p>
<ul><a name="11063052000610"></a>"notified when the petition is delivered to the authority".</ul>
<p><a name="11063052000507"></a>All the authority needs to do is to ask who the person in charge of the petition is. It might be the first name on the list; it might be the person who has simply signed the covering letter; it might simply be the person who turns up at the council offices or hands it to the mayor, or whatever they do, and identifies themselves as the organiser. The subsection just needs to be clarified a little. I beg to move.</p>

My question can loosely be attached to this group of amendments.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="11063052000458"></a>The problem that has been brought to my attention is that when local authorities are bound to publicise and take the outcomes of referendums into account in decision-making, it could result in them being pressured by local communities into disregarding welfare issues and the rights of Gypsies, Travellers and others. We know that there is form on this. Local communities have had that kind of attitude. My question for the Minister is: is there any safeguard to deter that?</p>

<a name="11063052000459"></a><b><a name="110630-0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="11063052000874"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> Perhaps I may help the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker. She may not be aware that one of the government amendments makes it clear that planning applications-it is often under planning applications that these matters arise-are excluded from the provisions for referendums. The noble Baroness will remember that we had a brief exchange about this earlier. The whole business of provision for Traveller populations is subject to direction and regulations as far as local authorities are concerned, so it is an area in which local authorities are obliged to act properly. It is also an offence for people to campaign on these issues in a way that breaks the law. I hope that the noble Baroness is content on that matter.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="11063052000460"></a>The amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, require the council at all times to publish its reasons for such a determination. We believe that the vast majority of local authorities-in fact, almost without exception-will publish their reasons for such a determination. They want local people to know why their petition or the request from their councillor was not considered appropriate. However, removing the discretion not to publish those reasons could mean that the council is required to publish details that may be confidential or otherwise inappropriate. For example, the petition could relate to an individual for whom it would cause further embarrassment to publish details of the petition or breach their human rights. In such a case, the authority would be able to report that the petition had been rejected but without any further detail.</p>

I thought that the Minister had just given the reason which the local authority would give in those circumstances for not accepting it. If I remember rightly, the question asked by my noble friend Lord Greaves was, "What are these exceptional circumstances?". The example that has just been given is not one of them because the local authority would give the reason which the Minister has just given us.</p>

<a name="11063068000003"></a><b><a name="110630-0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="11063068000141"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> Perhaps in continuing to respond to this set of amendments the answer might become clearer. The noble Lord went on to suggest that with the words "designated in the petition" and in seeking to get a particular person named as the petition organiser, it would be reasonable to expect that a petition will usually make clear who an organiser is and that in most cases the organiser will welcome being the contact point for the petition. However, it is possible that a petition could fail to specify the organiser and we expect authorities to act reasonably in seeking to identify who might take on that responsibility. Little is added to this clause by imposing a requirement on anyone to provide a notification. Where the petition is clear, the person identified will be the organiser; where it is unclear, the discretion in Clause 48(6)(b) enables an authority to decide who appears to be carrying out the role of organiser. My reaction in considering this amendment is rather overshadowed by my political campaigning background. I have explained the difference between electoral processes and the petition process, but I see what my noble friend is driving at. If there is ambiguity in this matter, I am prepared to look at this again.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="11063068000004"></a>I am not convinced that Amendments 129CAA and 129D are necessary. It is reasonable to expect that if a council or partner authority decides to give effect to a referendum they will tell people about how they have listened and acted on their views or that local people will notice it anyway. However, the provision in Clause 55 is important in that it ensures that where partner bodies decide not to give effect to a referendum result, local people are made aware of the reasons why. I hope that that explains that. Sometimes giving the reason for the rejection can give the game away; for example, it could identify that an individual had a criminal conviction. This is another reason why it might be essential to have discretion in the Bill. However, given the contributions made by noble Lords, we will look at this and see if the wordings do reflect exactly what it is the Committee would wish to see in the Bill.</p>

I suspect that as he was speaking he was remembering many of the things that I am only too well aware of in the reality of petitioning.

These are not major points that will hold up the Bill but we should look at them to see whether there can be better wording. If there really are exceptional circumstances that the local authority is unable to state-and I am bound to say that I cannot think what that might be, because if something is of a confidential nature then that would be the reason-then we should say what they would be. I cannot think that there are any that cannot be covered by the appropriate form of words.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="11063068000006"></a>Amendment 128H, which is in the name of my noble friend Lord Greaves and refers to "designated in the petition", once again reminds me of the happy hours we spent on the local democracy Bill and all that that legislation prescribed on petitions. I recall that my noble friend brought in some petitions to his council, which did not look like petitions to Parliament in any sense. We all know that they are not usually neat and tidy, with the petition organiser's name at the top. Again, this is not a major point. My noble friend has suggested an alternative wording which I think would meet it very well. However, the term "designated in the petition" does not meet it. Most of the petitions to my council that I have seen-and I suspect that the Minister has had similar experience-do not designate anyone in the petition itself. It just does not work that way. Therefore, a rather simpler, looser way would serve the point much better and save people getting into an unnecessary tangle.</p>

The first point that I was going to make has just been made by my noble friend. Councils deal with decisions all the time-for example, not giving licences to people because they have criminal convictions. Sufficient reasons are given for those decisions without going over the top and hauling them out into the open and putting them in the local stocks, which we have in my town. I cannot think of any decisions minuted by my council in the past two decades for which the reasons have not been set out. People are perfectly capable of writing decisions that are appropriate in the circumstances.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="11063068000008"></a>However, I cannot quite understand how criminal convictions will come into this. I suppose that the petition organiser might turn out to be a complete rogue, but why should that invalidate a petition that was otherwise perfectly valid, especially as the Minister said earlier that people in prison should be able-it is slightly extraordinary-to sign these petitions even though they cannot vote? I cannot see why a person should not be able to organise a petition in his community simply because he has criminal convictions. The petition itself is hardly likely to reveal people's criminal convictions. Is it? I do not know.</p>

<ul><a name="11063068000124"></a>"function of passing of a resolution",</ul>
<p><a name="11063068000102"></a>in this chapter is, in the case of the Greater London Authority, a joint function of the mayor and the Assembly, and that the function is to be discharged in the same way as the Greater London Authority discharges any other functions that are specified as the joint responsibility of the mayor and the Assembly.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="11063068000011"></a>Government Amendment 128K removes the requirement for the Greater London Authority to hold a meeting to decide on a resolution to hold a referendum. It reflects the constitutional arrangements of the authority, which does not hold joint meetings of the mayor and the Assembly and will instead enable appropriate arrangements to be made for the mayor and the Assembly to come to a decision about whether to hold a referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="11063068000012"></a>Government Amendments 128N and 128P make consequential changes to Clause 49(3), again removing the requirement for the Greater London Authority to hold a meeting. I hope that noble Lords will agree that this clarification is helpful and I urge them to accept these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="11063068000013"></a>In this group we have some amendments from my noble friends Lord Greaves and Lord Rennard. Amendment 128L seeks to make it clear that a resolution to hold a referendum may be taken at the next ordinary meeting of the authority following determination that it is appropriate to hold a referendum. Amendment 128M in consequence removes Clause 49(3), which requires a meeting to discuss a resolution to be held as soon as practicable. These amendments assume that the wording of Clause 49(2) currently requires a meeting to be specifically convened for the purpose of resolving whether to hold a referendum. I can assure noble Lords that that is not our intention. We believe that the inclusion of the word "for" in Clause 49(2) makes it clear that a meeting must not be specifically convened but that the issue may be added to the agenda of any meeting of the full council. I will listen to the debate of my noble friend and then perhaps I can respond to his proposal.</p>

I was just concerned about the cost of these referendums to local authorities. The cost of organising an extra meeting of the full council is not cheap for any authority, especially for a small one where the cost is a larger proportion of its budget. It is not a trivial expense. If the Minister is putting that assurance on the record, then my amendments have achieved their purpose.</p>

They have been tabled to probe the appropriateness of the word "misleading" as the criterion a local authority can use to change the wording of a referendum question. It must consult the people who have forward put the petition before doing so, but I am not sure that the  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1955"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1955</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>word "misleading" covers everything. For example, an authority might want to improve the grammar of a question. As my noble friend Lord Tope said, petitions to councils even for something as important as a referendum are not necessarily written in the most appropriate phrases. If more felicitous wording can be introduced, it may be an improvement, but I am not sure whether that would make the question any more or less misleading. There may be inappropriate words in the question, which the council thinks are slang or rude, but once they are removed the petition remains perfectly valid.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="11063068000017"></a>More substantively, a question might be asking for action from the wrong people. It might ask the council to do something which it cannot do, but the council might be able to do other things. I am trying to think of an example. There is a gap in the railway line between Colne and Skipton on the Lancashire-Yorkshire border, and a campaign called SELRAP is working to have it reinstated. Noble Lords might have had communications from the group because it is vigorous in pursuing its case with everybody. I am not sure whether I should declare an interest as a patron of SELRAP since I am talking about it, but I was bullied into it. A petition might ask Pendle or Craven council, or even Lancashire or North Yorkshire county council, to reinstate the railway line. Regrettably, that is not within the power of any of those local authorities. On the other hand, it is within their power to provide funds to SELRAP and to push the process of assessing proposals for the reinstatement of the line further along the road. The GRIP process is a series of steps that all cost money, and the authority could contribute towards it.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="11063068000018"></a>A petition might come in asking any of the councils to put in a new railway line, but it would be rejected on the grounds that it had nothing to do with them. On the other hand, the councils could ask for a differently worded petition so that SELRAP could be funded to undertake the next batch of work necessary to get Network Rail, the Government and everyone else to pay attention. Alternatively, it might be a county council matter but the petition is sent to the district council, or vice versa. Those are helpful changes, and I do not think the word "misleading" describes them.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="11063068000019"></a>Amendments 128T and 128V were meant to probe the question of holding the referendum on the same day as elections, and whether that is a good or a bad thing. We have discussed this in some detail so it is not necessary to pursue it any further. Amendment 128U looks at how quickly a referendum has to take place once a council determines that it should be held. If it is generally thought that in order to save money and for general convenience, a referendum should be held on the same day as an election, and that election is due within 12 months, the amendment would make it possible, at the discretion of the council, to delay the referendum for up to 12 months rather than only up to the six months provided for in the Bill. In most cases referendums brought forward during the summer and autumn would have to be freestanding and would therefore cost perhaps three times as much. I beg to move.</p>

I really do not see what business it is of the Government to come in and say that a local referendum is to be delayed until the date of an election or another referendum. If it is an urgent question relating to a matter of concern that might involve a small number of people in a borough, it need not be that expensive. Why cannot the local authority just get on with it and use its own discretion?

As I have already said, we believe that the provision in Clause 52(3) as drafted is sensible and practical. Councils may not know 12 months in advance whether a poll will be triggered.

On the other hand, the wording ought not to preclude having the referendum on the same day as the next round of elections, as far as fixed elections are concerned-general elections now appear to be fixed but we will see-so long as they are not more than 12 months away.

I have also put down Amendments 128Y and 128Z, which say that if the local authority produces material in support and/or opposition to the question, it has to do so in a fair and balanced way. It has to give,</p>
<ul><a name="11063068000130"></a>"equal prominence to the arguments",</ul>
<p><a name="11063068000109"></a>on each side. That mirrors what happens in national referendums, where the Government, or the Electoral Commission on behalf of the Government, publish statements which say, "On the one hand, vote yes; on the other hand, vote no". They put a fair and balanced argument. In this new world of local referendums, it is not clear to me whether local authorities are going to be able to churn out publicity on one side only, or to be strongly in favour of one side and against the other, and whether that is intended or desirable. This is a very important question that needs careful bottoming.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="11063068000032"></a>My understanding is that the Electoral Commission has expressed some concern about this and believes that there should be balance, although I was looking for the stuff that I think I have had from it before this debate and I could not find it. I cannot quote exactly what it is saying but it would be interesting to have a definitive view from the Electoral Commission on this matter, certainly before we get to Report. It is fairly obvious that this is an important matter and that there may be different views on it, but our view is that a council ought to be putting out fair and balanced publicity, if it wishes to put out publicity at all. It ought to have the option not to spend any more money than it is already and to keep out of the argument altogether. The Bill suggests that it can because it says:</p>
<ul><a name="11063068000131"></a>"the principal local authority may publish, or arrange for the publication of",</ul>
<p><a name="11063068000110"></a>with the clear implication there that it does not have to if it does not want to.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="11063068000033"></a>Particularly where a referendum is tied in heavily with the local political argument and where referendums and local elections get intertwined, as I think will be inevitable, it will be dangerous for local authorities to get involved on one side of an argument. The political party running a local authority may strongly be on one side with the party in opposition, which might be ready to take over if it wins enough seats, on the other. For the local authority to weigh in with public money in those circumstances seems to me to be wrong in principle. I am not saying that people should not campaign; people should campaign, but they should go out and organise their own campaigns.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="11063068000034"></a>Amendment 128AA seeks to put some controls on expenditure on this kind of publicity in a referendum on which the local authority spends its own money. It seeks to harden up the word "reasonable" by saying that it has to be approved by a meeting of the council. The meeting of the council that determines that a referendum should take place should also decide whether the local authority spends any money on it and how much; it should set a budget for it, because, in any case, this will be all be money outside the council's agreed budget. I assume that councils will not put contingency sums in their budget in case they have

They will all be hoping that they do not have any, from that point of view. They will not want to put the council tax up or cut other services at budget time in order to put money aside for referendums, so I assume they will not do that and therefore it may well need a supplementary vote by the full council anyway, if it is a full-scale referendum and is costing tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds. Where is it going to come from? The council will have to decide, so it would be part of that.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="11063068000035"></a>I would only put forward Amendment 128AA on the basis that the council was going to be even-handed. The council being able to vote sums of money to one side in a highly politically contentious question is a very dangerous way forward. This is put forward as genuinely probing, to find out what the Government's views are, but it is also a considerable concern that might need a bit more thought before Report.</p>

I do not think that this is a matter that we can resolve in this Committee. It is important and perhaps in the period up to Report we may see some guidance and thoughts as to how the Government, the Electoral Commission and others see it developing. There is a difference between a national referendum about an unresolved policy question and certain circumstances of local referendums. The noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe, is no longer in his place; he has rushed out to organise a referendum against the parking-charge policy of his own council. In those circumstances it is surely reasonable for the council to defend its policy against the proposition that is put on the other side, so I do not think that we can be absolutist on this matter. I do not favour the extensive spending of public money, but I hope that my noble friend, as we discuss these things over the next few weeks, will not rule out and disarm councils-elected representatives-from putting their case in referendums.</p>

<ul><a name="11063068000132"></a>"enables the authority to incur only such expenditure as is reasonable".</ul>
<p><a name="11063068000038"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has already indicated that it is not at all clear what "reasonable" might be, but I put it another way: if expenditure is unreasonable, then, of course, it can be challenged by the usual audit processes. I think that that is sufficient safeguard in that respect. What is more complicated is the question of equal prominence. Amendment 128AA states that the decision is only to,</p>
<ul><a name="11063068000133"></a>"be exercised following a resolution authorising the maximum amount to be spent".</ul>
<p><a name="11063068000111"></a>This raises some difficult issues. On the equal-prominence argument, who is to provide the case for the petitioners-for those who are seeking the referendum? It can hardly be suggested that the local authority should provide their case for them. There will be cases in which there is a well resourced, articulate group of people who can produce a substantial case. If, on the other hand, it is a community group, or some organisation which produces a three-line question for a referendum, it may not be able to do that. Is the council then

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="11063068000039"></a>I am also somewhat doubtful about the notion of a council specifying a maximum amount to be spent at the beginning of a process. One does not know what form the campaign will take. To go back to my example-although it is not on all fours with this issue because it related to a binding referendum rather than to these, which are not binding-Peel Developments was a well resourced company putting substantial amounts of money into a campaign locally. There may well be a situation where a well resourced commercial interest-for instance, a private residents' group-put a lot of money together to campaign legitimately on an issue. I suggest that the council could not tie its hands in advance by indicating a maximum amount. Flexibility is called for here.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="11063068000040"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is on a probing expedition. I would like to join him on that expedition, although I am not sure that we will end up in the same place. There needs to be some serious consideration here. While the Electoral Commission's views may be valuable, we again have to bear in mind that these are not binding decisions. It is therefore less important, though not unimportant, to be as precise as on the major constitutional issues on which the commission adjudicates or indeed regarding the electoral process itself, where there are limits to be employed.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="11063068000041"></a>Given that referendums can be authority-wide or merely confined to a ward or a smaller area-or, given the right percentages, across the whole of London-it is very difficult to be at all precise about how matters should be couched in financial terms or even about how they should be expressed. Within that area, the case for a referendum on a simplistic notion to reduce council expenditure or abandon a particular project might be advanced in a few short paragraphs, while the arguments against might be complicated. On perhaps an environmental issue or any one of a number of issues, the case against the referendum might be complicated, but the case for it could be presented simplistically. It cannot be right that the council is constrained from putting the full picture to its population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="11063068000042"></a>I do not know quite where we end up with this, but I am not particularly happy with the thrust of some of the noble Lord's amendments. I would not like to see much in the way of constraint on how councils can respond to petitions.</p>

We would certainly not want councils to be innocent bystanders when important local issues were being debated. I am grateful to my noble friend for tabling these amendments because at least they give us an opportunity to check whether the words in the Bill reflect what we want out of this process. I suspect that not just the Electoral Commission but the LGA itself will want to reflect on this area. Currently, any publicity published by an authority will have to be in accordance with the code of recommended practice on local authority

It is necessary for the recommended practice to allow local authorities to put their case in a proper fashion. Generally, authorities are restrained from publishing any publicity material relating to a referendum question on issues such as whether to adopt executive arrangements. The scope of local referendums, however, is such that there is the possibility of questions being put which could have significant impact on communities. We believe that it is right that councils should be able to play a part in the process when the referendum has been triggered by a petition or request. Referendums such as have been proposed by my noble friend unnecessarily restrict the position of local councils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="11063068000044"></a>The arrangements for authorities to control expenditure are already set out in Clause 53, coupled with an authority's wider duty to have regard to the code of recommended practice on local authority publicity. They are adequate to ensure that excessive amounts of public money are not spent on publicity material for referendums. I hope that these explanations and assurances persuade my noble friend that he can withdraw his amendment. This is an area where local authorities are likely to want to satisfy themselves that the arrangements as set out in the Bill meet their need to protect community interests as they see them. With that, I hope that my noble friend will withdraw his amendment.</p>

It is an indication of the complexity of the issue that I have agreed with most of the things that most noble Lords have said on all sides; it is in no circumstances straightforward. As I hope I said, I moved the amendment to probe and, in order to probe, I proposed something quite different from what was in the Bill. There are good arguments on both sides. I firmly believe that local authorities, faced with what they might think of as a hostile referendum question, should be able to put their point of view forward and, if it is a complex question, should be able to explain it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="11063068000046"></a>It is quite possible, of course, that the local authority will be in favour of the referendum question, in which case it is not clear why they should spend any money at all.

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="11063068000047"></a>I am firmly of the countervailing view that local authorities ought not to be able to get involved in promoting referendum campaigns which are effectively being put forward by parties or party-political candidates-or any candidate in local elections-for political purposes.

It is difficult to see how to draw up regulations which cater for both the extreme circumstances of a hostile referendum which the authority thinks would seriously wreck its strategy and policies in key areas and, on the other hand-</p>

Although it is important that local authorities should not get involved in party-political campaigning, the present code of conduct on local authority publicity is too restrictive. Local authorities ought to be able to campaign in a general way more easily and widely than they can at the moment if they believe that what they are campaigning for is in the interests of the people that they serve and represent. However, that is a wider issue. We have the code as it is and I do not think that there is any prospect of it being changed much in the near future. However, it will be very difficult to find satisfactory wording that stops local authorities intervening in elections and political matters, but allows them to defend their well thought-out and agreed policies and strategies against hostile attack. This matter has to be further discussed and considered and the various organisations involved, including the LGA and the Electoral Commission, have to be involved in that.

In my parish in Norfolk, with only 50-odd electors, the 5 per cent figure would mean that three people could call a referendum. Perhaps different percentages could be applied according to size.

Is what is in the Bill to be taken at face value in that the Government realise that they have to think about how referendums will interact with parish and town councils, and inevitably therefore consider the relationship between the existing legislation for parish polls and the new provisions for referendums which are altogether more complex and involved?</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="11063068000053"></a>The provisions for parish polls are really very simple. A very small number of people can turn up to a parish meeting-what used to be called the ratepayers' meeting when people paid rates-and requisition a parish poll. The parish poll is a referendum of all the local government electors in the parish, but it is often on a fairly small scale. Sometimes it is not. Sometimes it is run as a normal election, with all the polling stations open, except that the polling hours are from 4 pm to, I think, 9 pm-the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, will correct me if that is wrong-so there are restricted polling hours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="11063068000056"></a>In my experience of parish polls, there is sometimes agreement between the council concerned and the district council or borough council, which has to organise the polls from its normal election process, not to have all the polling stations open. I am aware of a smallish town which has six or seven polling stations. They have a parish poll and they opened only one of the polling stations in the town centre on the grounds that it did not cost them as much. That flexibility is available, and it is an altogether simpler process. Of course, it is open to abuse because of the small number of people who can requisition a parish poll. Even if the Government are keeping provision for parish polls, I would think that, as part of the review, they will consider how the referendum provisions will impact on parishes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="11063068000057"></a>There are now a lot more much bigger parishes than there ever used to be. A lot of places which, before 1974, were urban districts or small boroughs, have now become town councils. If you have an electorate of 18,000 or 22,000, or even more, having 10 people able to turn up at a parish meeting and only a small number of those being able to requisition a poll is nonsense. The parish poll provision is there for small, rural parishes, and the world is, in many places, not like that any more.</p>

If they have firm plans, can they tell us what they will be before Report? The Bill's provision about possible central government funding for referendums in parishes, organised by parish councils, is interesting, but I cannot believe that it is serious. It would leave it open to organise referendums in parishes on a large scale without any financial implication locally. The more that we discuss this in Committee, the more I come to the view that the number of referendums which will take place is probably a great deal less than some of us feared when we started looking at this, simply because of the financial problems.</p>

That was a very effective way of campaigning, and I am coming to the view that local referendums will meet a huge amount of opposition simply on the basis of cost. When people go around trying to organise them, once the cost and the implications for the council budget are revealed, a lot of them will not go ahead.</p>

I suspect that this is very much work in progress in terms of discussions going on with the department on how to deal with this rather difficult issue because of the problem of trying to make one size fit all.

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="11063068000063"></a>My purpose was to flag up some of the things that the Secretary of State might need to consider. As I say, I am aware of ongoing discussions and I certainly do not want to be in any way prescriptive. In the parish council, being the smallest unit of local government, there must be a proper balance between engagement with representative democracy and the referendum facility. That is likely to be exacerbated in future because, as localism brings an involvement by parish

We must have robust systems to guard against that. It is also the case that that can add to the risks of people wanting to reach for the referendum solution. It is beginning to look like a question of how many bites of this not very large cherry in some places is to be provided for the public.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="11063068000064"></a>I will not labour the point about the engagement with the democratic and representative function of parish councils. The burdens of referendums on parish councils are by and large disproportionately high. I mentioned that in a previous Committee sitting and gave an example. Currently, the trigger for a parish poll under paragraph 18 of Schedule 12 to the Local Government Act 1972 is by common consent too low. But that is no argument for removing it altogether. I was very pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, say that that was not his intention. I look forward to something better than that provision in the Local Government Act coming forward at a later stage, but I do not know whether discussions will have proceeded that far ahead. There is a need to prevent the parish being hijacked by the referendum provision. To that end triggers must be in some way relevant to the issue and possibly to the parish size. I cannot go further than that because we are dealing with tiny parish councils on the one hand and some very large town councils on the other, some of which have budgets that would exceed principal authority sizes.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="11063068000065"></a>There has to be a genuine local interest. I was very pleased when, some time ago, one of the smaller political movements tried to hijack the process for national political aims. I seem to recall it was something to do with the European Union and it was ruled out of order. Quite right too, because what should a small parish be doing with something concerning the European Union? Small parishes in particular are vulnerable, if we are not careful, to these sorts of pressures.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="11063068000066"></a>In addition, there needs to be protection for referendums cutting across other issues that have to be dealt with-the other powers and functions. I mentioned this earlier in connection with principal authorities. The same thing needs to be built in; not necessarily on exactly the same model, but in essence something similar. There needs to be a cost benefit out of all this, not for it to be completely disproportionate in the manner that I explained when I addressed this issue at our last Committee sitting.</p>

The Bill that addresses localism must indeed address the issue of parish councils, the most local form of government. In providing for referendums in this Bill, the Government have said that they will be consulting about the way they take place.

It relates to parishes where electors have long enjoyed the power to demand a local referendum or parish poll under the Local Government Act 1972. It removes the power of local government electors to demand a parish poll. However, as my noble friend says, he has no intention of anticipating that this amendment might achieve that objective until replacement facilities are in place.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="11063068000069"></a>We know that a poll must be organised if the chairman consents, or if it is demanded by 10 or one-third of the electors present at the meeting, whichever is the lesser figure. So the triggers for parish polls can be quite small. None the less, I understand the concerns expressed about the varying size of parishes and this is a matter that will be considered by the review that the Secretary of State has put in train. This, along with whether parish provisions apply to parish meetings as well as parish councils, are all part and parcel of the mix. We will see if there is pressure to bring this in and if it is possible within the review that the Bill provides.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="11063068000070"></a>I agree that the current parish poll rules need reform, but accepting the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, would remove the provisions without replacing them with anything. We want to see a modernised and proportionate referendum regime for the parish sector and we propose to create this with regulations under Clause 56, which empowers the Secretary of State to apply the scheme to parish councils with such modifications as may be necessary. The effect of the clause would be to allow the replacement of the existing archaic parish poll regime with a modernised local referendum regime tailored to the particular circumstances of parish councils. While we seek to retain this important element of direct democracy that has been enjoyed for years by voters in parish areas, we want to modernise the existing regime and make it fit for purpose in the modern world.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="11063068000071"></a>Before making any regulations, we will consult widely on the reforms that people want to see. We will consult on whether all or some of the referendum provisions in the Bill should apply and on whether the ability of electors to demand a poll at a parish meeting should be retained; and, if it is, on what the threshold should be. Decisions on the appropriate modernised regime for parishes will be taken following the consultation, and subsequent regulations will be subject to affirmative resolution, giving noble Lords the opportunity to ensure that the replacement regime is better than the existing provisions. I hope that the assurances I have given will allow noble Lords to accept that Clause 56 should form part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_246"></a>
<a name="11063068000072"></a><b><a name="110630-0003.htm_spnew37"></a><a name="11063068000175"></a>Lord Shipley:</b> My Lords, I will speak to this clause on behalf of the noble Lord, Lord Tope, and will address some of the principles that stand behind it. In practice, the clause continues a capping regime. Councils will not want to risk losing a referendum because there will be a significant rebilling cost. Clause 59, and Schedules 5 and 6, create a duty for a billing authority to determine, in line with principles set out by the Secretary of State, whether a proposed council tax increase is excessive. Authorities will be required to hold a local referendum on the proposed rise if it is deemed to be excessive.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="11063068000073"></a>The difficulty is that it should be for local people to determine whether they find a proposed council tax increase excessive rather than for the Secretary of State to decide what constitutes excessive. Local people should trigger the referendum, not the Secretary of State. Therefore, there is a strong case for saying that amendments to the Bill should be introduced that would limit the Secretary of State's power to determine what constitutes an excessive rate of council tax and would give that power instead to local people under proposals elsewhere in the Bill for holding local referendums so that they can decide what constitutes an excessive rate of council tax.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="11063068000074"></a>Secondly, councils, rather than the Secretary of State, ought to be able to decide when a referendum will be held and to decide the arrangements for it. We should also delete powers for the Secretary of State to make non-specific regulations on matters such as the question to be asked in the referendum, the allowable publicity accompanying that referendum and how votes are to be counted. We have already discussed the percentage levels required to trigger a referendum and it seems to me that this is an example of where we do not need to have the Secretary of State interfering with what local people could perfectly well handle for themselves.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1968"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column 1968</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110630-0003.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="11063068000075"></a>There are two issues that I feel concerned about and I have raised them at previous stages of the Bill. When a billing authority is determining whether a council tax proposal is excessive it might be appropriate for a referendum to be held on whether the council tax level and increase proposed is deemed by some to be too small. True localism should mean that local people have the right to hold a referendum on whether the council tax might be raised higher than the level that the Secretary of State deems to be excessive. I do not propose that one should have a higher rate-simply that if you really want to implement localism it should lie within the power of local people to make that decision.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="11063068000076"></a>There is a further complication to this. Under the Bill, referendums can be held within electoral areas within a council area. It is inevitable that referendums will be held on issues that might require additional expenditure to be made within that area. It might be unreasonable to expect the whole of the council area to fund the additional increase. The increase could be for a specific local facility that might otherwise close down, such as a swimming pool that people would like to preserve that requires additional cash. At the moment parish councils have certain powers to raise additional money. We could see referendums being held to save local facilities such as the swimming pool where local people might be willing to pay for the facility and would wish a referendum to be held on generating the necessary resource.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="11063068000077"></a>This seems to strike at the very heart of localism. Ultimately, if we permit referendums to be held within one or more electoral areas of a council, logically those people should be allowed, as those who have a parish council are allowed, to vote to spend additional money. I speak from my perspective as a member of Newcastle City Council. Half of my ward has a parish council, which has the power to raise additional money, and the other half does not and is not able to raise additional money. That is a complication that will become very important.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="11063068000078"></a>The broader issue in terms of Clause 59 is whether it is for the Secretary of State to decide to hold a referendum or whether it is for local people to use the facilities that exist to generate that referendum.</p>

<p><a name="st_247"></a>
<a name="11063068000079"></a><b><a name="110630-0003.htm_spnew38"></a><a name="11063068000176"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, we should thank the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, for introducing this clause stand part debate and for his very clear exposition of localism and what it means in terms of council tax. I agree with him that the provisions in the Bill amount to a capping regime. I am sure the Government will argue that local people do determine what is excessive if they support a referendum. That is a very narrow interpretation of the Bill. This is capping by another name.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="11063068000080"></a>We also have to acknowledge that successive Governments have reserved the right to limit increases in domestic taxation when they have been judged to be excessive. We certainly did as a Government, and I believe that the Conservative Government did. I am not sure whether the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, is culpable as well. There are arguments about whether that is important for the overall management of the economy.</p>

I was not suggesting that the noble Lord would have judged council tax to be one of those things, but I think there is an argument that it is. The impact assessment reminds us that some 36 authorities have been capped under legislation that this Bill will replace-I think that is since the power was first used in 2004-05-and 16 of those were subject to in-year designation and had to redo their calculations. Indeed, the architecture of the Secretary of State setting principles with the opportunity to look at different categories of authorities has been imported from the existing capping regime.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="11063068000084"></a>We feel constrained in denying the Government powers which effectively amount to capping powers and their right to influence levels of taxation in the broader interests of the management of the economy, anti-poverty strategies, et cetera because the reality is that each year the Secretary of State will set the benchmark for council tax increases and it is probably right that few councils will run the gauntlet of a referendum, given the costs and consequences of an adverse outcome. The impact assessment estimates the cost of a council tax referendum to be between £85,000 and £300,000. Should a referendum not be successful, the administrative consequences could be convoluted, with year-end refunds or credits against future liabilities and the possibility for people to ask for an in-year refund, so the systems and costs involved in those choices could be significant.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="11063068000085"></a>We are coming on to discuss the powers that the Secretary of State has taken for himself in framing how the referendum question is to be put and the constraints around expenditure. According to the impact assessment, the authority will not be able to campaign for its proposed council tax level. Given the debate we have just had about the authority's role in referendums, perhaps the Minister will confirm that an authority cannot campaign for the council tax increase that it thinks is appropriate. Of course, we might expect the cards to be stacked against those proposing the increase. Councils are facing unprecedented dilemmas at present with budgets severely constrained and with front-end loading because the coalition Government's approach to the deficit is to cut too far and too fast. The system will have to cope with the challenges of the localisation of non-domestic rates. If this is to happen, will not local councils be forced to look to that as a source of extra income before running the risks of referendums that would increase council tax? I am not sure that that would be good news for the business community, but perhaps the Minister will tell us-I know these things are embryonic at the moment-whether there will be equivalent capping-type regimes for a localised,

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="11063068000086"></a>One of the other issues that arise from this in making an assessment about whether council tax levels are fair is how council tax rebate is going to work in the future. The Government are localising council tax rebate. Not only are they cutting 10 per cent off it in aggregate, but it seems as if it is going to be left to local authorities to make individual judgments about the scheme that they want to introduce and maintain. That runs contrary to giving powers to government to manage these things centrally, and is an added complication.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="11063068000087"></a>For the present, we will focus our efforts on trying to improve the provisions in the Bill rather than to do away with them, but we are mindful of the strong localist argument for not having these powers at all.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="11063068000089"></a>Clause 59 gives effect to Schedule 5, which inserts a new Chapter 4ZA into the Local Government Finance Act 1992. This enables local electors to approve or veto excessive council tax increases in a referendum. It also gives effect to Schedule 6, which removes the Secretary of State's powers to cap council tax in England and makes consequential amendments to various Acts as a result of the provisions for council tax referendums. The clause will ensure that excessive council tax increases occur only where they have a clear mandate from local people. This is in contrast to capping, where Ministers take the decisions and local people have no say at all. It will strengthen local democracy and ensure councils are more accountable to their electorates, but it will allow the electorate to vote for increased expenditure if they want it.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="11063068000090"></a>A set of principles defined by the Secretary of State will be used by authorities to determine whether their council tax increases are excessive. These principles must be submitted in a report to the House of Commons for its approval. A comparison of basic amounts of council tax could be the only principle, but the Secretary of State can include other principles as he sees fit. It is necessary for the excessiveness principles to be determined by the Secretary of State with the approval of the House of Commons.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="11063068000091"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, touched upon the wider economic issues of council tax expenditure. It would be impractical and excessive to require a referendum for every single council tax increase. The flexibility allows for different sets of principles for different categories of local authorities. For example, principles relating specifically to town and parish councils could ensure that the great majority of councils-indeed, all but large, high-spending parish councils-would not be required to hold referendums. The report for the House of Commons must be laid before the date on which the local government finance report for the year is approved. Authorities will therefore know, when

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="11063068000092"></a>Where an authority determines that its council tax is excessive, it will normally hold a referendum no later than the first Thursday in May-the usual date of local elections. However, the Secretary of State can specify a different date by order, such as to allow the referendum to be held on the same day as local government elections if this date is not the first Thursday in May. Entitlement to vote in the referendum is based on the register of local government electors and entitlement to vote in local government elections for a particular area.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="11063068000093"></a>Where an authority sets an excessive council tax increase, it must also make substitute calculations to determine a basic amount of council tax which does not exceed the excessiveness principles. The substitute calculations would take effect in the event that the authority's increase is rejected in a referendum or the authority fails to hold a referendum by the required date. The Secretary of State may make regulations concerning the conduct of referendums, which would include such matters as the wording of the question to be asked in the referendum, the publicity to be given and expenditure limits. There are obvious reasons why this may be necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="11063068000094"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, asked whether authorities can campaign for the proposed increase in council tax. No, it is intended that they cannot. They must put the facts to the electorate and leave them to decide but individual councillors will be free to campaign.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="11063068000095"></a>The Secretary of State will have the power to direct that the council tax referendum provisions should not apply. The power could be exercised only where it appears to the Secretary of State that unless the authority is allowed to increase its tax excessively, the authority will be unable to discharge its functions in an effective manner or be unable to meet its financial obligations. This is a reserve power and the expectation is that this would be used only in exceptional circumstances, such as where the High Court has exercised its powers to appoint a receiver where an authority has failed to service its debt within a set time period.</p>

And I have not got the foggiest clue what that is about. It replaces all that with a simple concept; namely, that local people and not Ministers should take the decision to approve or veto excessive council tax increases.</p>

<a name="110630-0003.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="11063068000097"></a>Sadly, council tax has more than doubled since 1997. If councils want to set excessive council tax increases-that is, those that exceed the norm-in future they will have to prove their case to the electorate. I urge that Clause 59 should stand part of the Bill.</p>

We ended our session on Tuesday by reaching Clause 2. We had a very interesting debate about whether there should be statutory training for any teachers who are considering doing a search of a child. This and the subsequent group of amendments refer to other aspects of the measures which extend the powers to search. This group is about tightening up what can be searched for and for what reasons; the next group is all about whether you can search alone and children of a different gender.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000005"></a>Amendment 13 probes issues concerning the burden of proof and highlights the potential problems that arise for schools as a result of the expansion of the powers. I am sure that head teachers and other members of staff would wish to have that power clearly defined and be without fear of contravening the Human Rights Act or prosecution for an offence against the person. Teachers are not law enforcement officers and they have no reason to risk assault upon them by insisting on searching a pupil who is capable of a violent reaction. Equally, few teachers will wish to use the power if they feel that it will jeopardise their relationship with pupils and generate a climate of suspicion in their school.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC246"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC246</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000006"></a>A simple Google search of the phrase "primary school rules" illustrates the need for more careful consideration of these provisions. They vary enormously. I wish to insert "reasonably" so that the Bill will say that a search can be made for,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000366"></a>"any other item which the school rules reasonably identify as an item for which a search may be made".</ul>
<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000007"></a>Some school rules do not allow toys to be brought into school, but it would be quite disproportionate to body-search a child for a little soft toy brought in for comfort. As the Bill is not clear on what exactly is meant by school rules, many schools might feel that they need to revisit to their rules, such as: sweets, cans and glass bottles are not allowed in school. When they do so, I would remind them of their duty to consult the pupils. In any case, rules are more likely to be followed if the children have been involved in their drafting and have signed up to the need for them.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000008"></a>The Joint Committee on Human Rights has called on the Government to issue guidance which makes it clear that,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000367"></a>"only items capable of being disruptive to teaching or learning, threatening to the safety of pupils and teachers, or which breach criminal law can be identified in school rules as items for which searches of pupils can be made".</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000322"></a>That is the sensible approach, and inserting "reasonably" indicates that schools must not go over the top.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000009"></a>Amendments 21, 22 and 23 were suggested by the JCHR in its report on the Bill. The committee criticise the very wide powers to examine and erase data or files on a mobile phone or other electronic device. We all want to give heads and teachers the powers they need to keep discipline and to prevent bullying, which is why I do not oppose the extension of these powers. It is clearly legitimate for a teacher, if he has reasonable cause for suspicion, to see whether there are any files on a confiscated phone that could be used for bullying or distribution of images that the subject of the images would not want the world to see-even pornography. However, we need checks and balances. The JCHR points out that there is nothing in the Bill to restrict the scope of the powers in relation to the purpose for which the power is to be exercised. That should be linked to the reasons for the search and the justification for the suspicion that an offence has been, or is about to be, committed.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000010"></a>Given the potential for serious interference in the pupil's rights to respect for a private life, the JCHR proposed Amendments 21, 22 and 23, about which I questioned the Minister at Second Reading. In the absence of an answer, I have tabled them myself. The amendments make it clear that it must be established that the device is likely to be used for something that is either unlawful or contrary to the school rules.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000011"></a>I tabled Amendment 24 because I remained concerned about the power to erase files. There may be all sorts of things on the phone that are very private to the family-things that the family would rather the school did not know. There may also be things on the phone that the pupil may not want the school or his parents to know-for example, that he or she is gay. Let us bear in mind that the pupil and his phone may be entirely innocent. Indeed, pupil A reporting to a teacher that pupil B has some questionable images on his phone  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC247"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC247</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>may, in itself, be an act of bullying by A on B-trying to embarrass Bill or get him into trouble. Pupil A may want to expose the fact that B is gay. I would call that homophobic bullying, and this Government have made clear their determination to stamp that out. I have tabled Amendment 24 to ensure that guidance includes consideration of the private life of both the pupil and his family, and the circumstances in which it is appropriate to involve parents in the deletion of files.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000012"></a>I ask my noble friend the Minister whether the Government will conduct a review of the existing search powers-as was recommended by Sir Alan Steer to the previous Government, but not carried out, before they extended the powers. We need more post-legislative, as well as more pre-legislative, scrutiny. Will the Government publish draft guidance relevant to the search powers before Report stage? Will such guidance be statutory? Will the Government accept these amendments? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000013"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="11063072000408"></a>Baroness Jones of Whitchurch:</b> My Lords, I support the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. I shall speak also to our Amendment 25. As has already been identified, under the previous legislation school staff already have the power to search for and seize from pupils prohibited items, including weapons, alcohol, drugs and stolen goods, and we are very conscious of the sensitivities in extending those powers.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000014"></a>Therefore Amendment 25 places on the Secretary of State a requirement to give more explicit guidance as to what should be included in the school rules, and on the items for which searches can be made. This amendment would very much enable some of the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, to be followed through. I also echo her point that if guidance were to be produced, it would be helpful if it were in the form of draft guidance on which we could all comment.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000015"></a>In addition, there is currently a statutory definition of school rules in maintained schools, but there is no statutory definition of school rules in independent schools, which will, in due course, include academies and free schools. Therefore, this underlines again the case for the Government to consider and advise very carefully on what can and cannot be banned under school rules for all state-provided schools. As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has mentioned, this was picked up in the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11063072000346"></a>"There is a risk of the new provision falling foul of that requirement"-</p>

<p><a name="11063072000016"></a>to protect pupils-</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000368"></a>"unless the new power to search is circumscribed in some way by reference to the purpose for which such a search may be made".</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000017"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, quoted some useful paragraphs from the report, but that one is also helpful.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000018"></a>When we debated this on the first day in Committee, a case was well made on the issue of mobile phones. For one person a mobile phone is some sort of weapon or something that can be used in a derogatory way; for others it is a teaching aid. We need to be clear about pupils' reasons for carrying mobile phones in school. In some cases it is a link to important caring responsibilities  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC248"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC248</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and so on. Therefore, we must be very careful about proscribing some of these things and the wording that is used.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000019"></a>We have seen the 15th report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which was handed out as we came in. It draws the attention of the House to the fact that the department's own memorandum on its delegated powers,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000369"></a>"does not explain why it is thought appropriate that the list of articles in section 550ZA(3) that may be searched for ... should in future be capable of being supplemented by the school in question, apparently to include any kind of article whatever".</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000020"></a>Again, the Delegated Powers Committee questions the extra powers that the Government are trying to give themselves without being explicit about what the articles should be and what it is appropriate to take into a school. Therefore, I hope our Amendment 25, which makes it necessary for guidance to be produced by the Secretary of State on what is and is not to be prohibited by school rules, is a common-sense measure. I hope the Minister will agree and that he and noble Lords will feel able to support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000021"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="11063072000409"></a>Lord Elton:</b> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment 14 in this group, which addresses two angles of concern. The first is about definition. My noble friend Lady Walmsley said that it is not clear what is meant by school rules. The noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, also said that they needed definition. That is the purpose of my amendment, which requires a definition to be made by the Secretary of State. I say this trailing my coat, since there may well be a definition of school rules buried somewhere in law. The waving of the corn on my left suggests that that is the case. However, it is not only a matter of what is in the school rules, but of whose authority those rules have. School rules can be made by head teachers on their own in solitary majesty, or by the head teacher with the heads of department, and with or without the endorsement of the school governors. Each would have an effect on what is in the rules.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000022"></a>My second concern is that rules, if they are to succeed, should have the broad understanding, sympathy and support of the school's pupils. Should some guidance be laid down as to how that is to be achieved? Should it be through school councils, for instance? In small primary schools with small children, the rules could be talked through at the beginning of every term and agreed to by the children. The courts will want to know what the school rules are. I regret to say that we are on very litigious ground. It is essential that the courts should have a definition before them or a great deal of money and time will be wasted by the courts in arriving at a definition of their own. That time and money should be spent by us on deciding now, or by giving the Minister the power and responsibility to define what a school rule is.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000023"></a>With it, I would give him the duty to get advice from somewhere on what should be in school rules in general terms, and on how school rules should be introduced in a way that means they will have the support of the school's pupils. This is not in the amendment, although I think it will emerge on Report. Children will then think that the rules are part of the way they live. Therefore, when some rebel child starts scrawling obscenities on the walls or doing other

<h5><a name="11063072000388"></a>2.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="11063072000024"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="11063072000410"></a>Baroness Massey of Darwen:</b> My Lords, I follow on briefly from what the noble Lord, Lord Elton, has just said. I have experience of school councils working extremely well. Not only do they discuss the usual problems of boys' toilets, dining, eating snacks and so on but they discuss discipline issues. I am a governor at a primary school and the youngest children are involved in deciding on the school rules and discipline. As a result, a contract is passed down to each classroom regarding how the children should participate and how they should behave in the school. I am glad that the noble Lord mentioned school councils. I think that school councils should be included somewhere in the Bill in relation to consultation with school pupils. In my experience, that is one of the best ways of consulting pupils in deciding what the school rules should be and how they should be applied.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000025"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="11063072000411"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord Hill of Oareford):</b> My Lords, before I respond to the points raised in today's debate, I should like to pick up briefly on the issue that we were discussing when we ended our session on Tuesday, including the points raised by my noble friend Lady Walmsley and other noble Lords about training in relation to searches. In the intervening day and a half, I have reflected on some of those points and I agree that some additional advice to schools would be useful. Therefore, I am happy to commit to recommending to head teachers in guidance that, when they designate a member of staff to undertake searches, they should actively consider whether that member of staff requires any additional training to enable them to carry out their responsibilities. This revised advice will be published in July before the start of the summer holidays.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000026"></a>So far as concerns today's amendments to and discussion on Clause 2, the main purpose of the clause is to try to give schools as much freedom as possible to respond to their own circumstances and challenges. We know that under the existing legislation head teachers and authorised members of school staff can search for knives and weapons, alcohol, illegal drugs and stolen property. The current situation, as set out by my noble friend Lady Walmsley is that the person conducting the search must be the same sex as the pupil being searched and the search must be witnessed by a member of staff. Where practical, the witness should also be the same sex as the pupil. That is where we are now.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000027"></a>With regard to the provisions in Clause 2, we propose to extend these powers to allow schools to search for any article that they suspect has been or could be used to commit an offence, cause injury or damage property. It will also allow them to search for items banned by the school rules where they have been identified in the rules as an item which may be searched for.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC250"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC250</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000028"></a>In addition to adding to the range of items which may be searched for, the provisions will make changes to how searches can be conducted, as my noble friend said. They will allow searches to be carried out by a member of staff who is of the opposite sex to the pupil being searched and also searches without a witness. I emphasise that these changes are subject to what we believe to be strict safeguards. Searches can take place only where the searcher reasonably believes that there is a risk that serious harm will be caused to a person if they do not conduct the search immediately. Therefore, these powers could not be used to search for innocuous items banned under the school rules; there must be a risk of serious and imminent harm.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000029"></a>Amendments 25, 13 and 14 relate to searches being conducted under the school rules provisions. Perhaps I may briefly set out our intention behind this provision and the safeguards here that I think will help to guard against it being used inappropriately.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000030"></a>Our intentions in including a specific power which enables teachers to search for, and confiscate, any item identified in the school rules are to enable teachers to deal effectively with items which, although not harmful, can still cause problems in the school.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000031"></a>The current powers to search pupils without consent are already subject to a number of safeguards. Searches can be carried out only by the head teacher or someone authorised by them to search; they can take place on school premises or off the school premises only when the member of staff has lawful control or charge of the pupils; and they can be conducted only if the staff member has a reasonable suspicion that the pupil is in possession of a prohibited item. The pupil cannot be required to remove any clothing, other than outer clothing.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000032"></a>The school rules provisions introduced by this Bill will be subject to additional safeguards. First, an item can be searched for only if it is identified in the school rules as an item that can be searched for; and secondly, the school rules must be determined and publicised by the head teacher in accordance with Section 89 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 or, in the case of academies, in accordance with regulations that mirror Section 89. That point was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch. This means that the head teacher must publicise the school behaviour policy, in writing, to staff, parents and pupils at least once a year. Furthermore, the use of force is explicitly excluded from this provision. These specific requirements will help to ensure that teachers, pupils and parents will know which items are subject to searches. The power is, in the Government's view and in that of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, compatible with convention rights.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000033"></a>I turn to the test of reasonableness and the points raised by my noble friends Lady Walmsley and Lord Elton. I understand the thinking behind the amendment moved by my noble friend Lady Walmsley; she is obviously concerned that schools could include frivolous or unreasonable items in the list of items that can be searched for. While I do not believe, and I do not think that she would believe that in practice governing bodies and heads would be likely to behave in a frivolous way, we think that there are existing safeguards in place which govern how schools set their school rules. That  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC251"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC251</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>relates to the question posed by my noble friend Lord Elton. These are set out in Sections 88 and 89 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006. Section 88 requires that the governing body of a school must make a written statement of general principles from which the head teacher will draw up the school's behaviour policy, which includes the school rules. The governing body is required under Section 88 to consult parents and pupils as part of this process. I hope that in some way that will reassure my noble friend. The governing body is also required, when making the written statement of general principles, to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State. There is also a legal requirement on head teachers to have regard to this statement in determining the school rules and to bring the school's behaviour policy to the attention of staff, pupils and parents at least once a year.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000034"></a>The Government intend to use that guidance, among other things, to explain the nature of the obligations of necessity and legitimate aim under Article 8.2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. As with public authorities generally, the head teacher in drawing up the school rules would have to act reasonably. So I hope overall that my noble friend may accept that there are safeguards in place and that with those safeguards we should feel more reassured that we can trust schools to judge which items they need to search for in the context of their particular school.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000035"></a>I turn to the content of electronic devices and the examination and deletion of what might be on them. Clause 2 would permit the member of staff who seizes an electronic device to examine any data or files on the device, if they think there is good reason to do so. Following such an examination, the person may erase any data or files from the device if they think there is good reason to do so. I think that this point was accepted earlier in the week. There is agreement that the misuse of mobile phones and other electronic devices is a growing problem in our schools. According to Bullying UK, around one in seven young people have been threatened or harassed by mobile phone.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000036"></a>A study by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers published last year in March, suggested that one in seven teachers had been the victim of cyber-bullying by pupils and parents. I was struck that the Association of School and College Leaders welcomed this provision in its evidence to the public evidence session for this Bill in the other place as a way of schools dealing with cyber-bullying without involving the police, which is an important point. We do not want to get to the point where schools have to call the police to deal with matters when they could deal with them with some common sense and in a safe and orderly environment within the school.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000037"></a>I understand the concerns of my noble friend Lady Walmsley that the provisions in the Bill might give members of staff carte blanche to examine or delete the content of a pupil's mobile phone. But we believe that by requiring the member of staff to have a good reason before doing so, and to have regard to guidance, the clause protects pupils from random searches of their property and provides a robust test which must be passed before a pupil's personal information on his or her mobile phone can be deleted.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000038"></a>I did, however, listen to what my noble friend said and obviously like her read the comments from the JCHR. In order to address those points, I think we should make more explicit in our guidance that any examination or erasure of data or files must be justified. By this I mean that the guidance should make it clear that the staff member must reasonably suspect that the data or file on the device in question has been, or could be, used to cause harm, to disrupt teaching or break the school rules in some way. I can also commit to the guidance providing advice on the circumstances in which data can be erased and when that can be handed to the police. I hope that that provides my noble friend with some reassurance.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000039"></a>My noble friend also raised the point about the need to respect the private life of the pupil and the pupil's family, and on the circumstances in which it is appropriate to involve the parents of the pupil. I understand her concern that pupils are protected from any unnecessary intrusion into their private lives. The Secretary of State's guidance will make it clear that any examination or erasure of data or files must be justified. It will also explain to schools the nature of their obligations under the ECHR and emphasise the importance of respecting a pupil's personal information and right to privacy.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000040"></a>As my noble friend Lady Walmsley suggested, I would be happy to share with her and other Members of the Committee who would be interested a draft of the Secretary of State's guidance in advance of Report, so that she can be assured of its helpfulness and we can benefit from their expertise.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000041"></a>I hope that that reassures noble Lords that checks are in place to ensure that these powers could not be used inappropriately. I have committed to include additional safeguards in guidance and to share that guidance as the Bill progresses through this House. On the basis of those reassurances, I hope that my noble friend Lady Walmsley will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000042"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="11063072000412"></a>Lord Lucas:</b> My Lords, I would be very grateful if my noble friend would include me in that correspondence. I do not yet understand why, under any circumstances, a teacher should be able to delete something from a mobile phone. Surely, the point of finding something is that it then becomes evidence that can be used. In fact, it may be important to show it to the child's parents so that the parents become aware of what is going on. I do not understand the need to delete.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000043"></a>I am also concerned that while one might want and need under some circumstances to explore what is happening on a child's mobile phone, any teacher doing so will discover a lot of stuff that is personal and irrelevant. There is a problem over how that is dealt with. Perhaps it should be done by somebody not involved in teaching the child who can therefore keep separate any knowledge gained from looking at the mobile phone. I agree that there has to be this power in the Bill, but it has to be carefully used.</p>

<h5><a name="11063072000389"></a>2.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="11063072000046"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="11063072000414"></a>Baroness Jones of Whitchurch:</b> My Lords, I want to pursue an issue that I mentioned in passing in my introduction: that of mobile phones. I refer not to whether a child could be searched but to whether they are carrying a mobile phone in the first place. My noble friend Lord Knight made the point that in the olden days pens could be scurrilous and used inappropriately, so we have to be a bit careful about what we are proscribing here.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000047"></a>I believe I am right in saying that the latest draft guidance on searching states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11063072000347"></a>"Ministers have already announced their intention to make regulations to add to the list of prohibited items (cigarettes and other tobacco products, pornography, fireworks and specific personal electronic devices (mobile phones and iPods etc))".</p>

<p><a name="11063072000323"></a>I read that to mean that mobile phones and iPods will be included on the list of prohibited items. I hope that we can have a broader debate on whether that is sensible in the round because, as I said earlier, mobile phones can have a range of functions in a school, not all of which are damaging or unhelpful to the education process.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000048"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="11063072000415"></a>Lord Storey:</b> I want to re-emphasise the importance of parents being aware of the school's behaviour management policy and I welcome the fact that that duty exists. In that behaviour management policy, it will be an important responsibility of head teachers in schools to indicate the items that pupils should not be carrying on their person.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000049"></a>I also emphasise the dangers of mobile phones in schools, something that I have experienced on a regular basis. The amount of bullying that goes on, and the passing of offensive messages and images, is a real problem no doubt in secondary schools but certainly in primary schools. The fact that schools, parents and pupils-one hopes through the school council-are involved in putting together the behaviour policy and understanding that will be really important for our school system.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000050"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="11063072000416"></a>Baroness Hughes of Stretford:</b> I want to explore a little more whether a school ought to be able to search and erase material, as mentioned by my noble friend and the noble Lord. Should a mobile phone be a proscribed item for every child in the school? If that is what the Government are proposing, I question that approach and hope that the Minister can clarify the issue.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000051"></a>I agree with all noble Lords that bullying is obnoxious and is a form of terrorism towards children and those exposed to it. It is absolutely invidious and needs to be dealt with very strongly indeed. I believe that if a child is using a phone for such a purpose, they will be using it not only in school but more likely outside too. I question an approach that, instead of instilling responsible behaviour towards mobile phones, seems to allow

A more effective approach would be to enable a school to ban the use of a mobile phone by an individual pupil who has shown to be misusing it rather than applying a blanket ban on bringing phones into school. If that is the approach the Government are proposing, I would support them. However, I believe that the other approach is dangerous and contrary to the way in which we deal with other kinds of issues. We are allowed to take mobile phones into the Chamber but, I guess, if we started taking pictures of Members opposite we would be banned-and quite rightly so.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000052"></a>I would be grateful if the Minister could, first, say whether the Government's approach is to allow a school to issue a blanket proscription and, secondly, if that is so, to comment on the points that I have made.</p>

I was not going to speak, but this important point strays into another agenda that is relevant here because we could be doing something that is not great. When I have visited schools, I have seen that mobile phones present a real issue-a huge potential advantage and a current problem. Schools are struggling to know what to do.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000054"></a>Coincidentally, on Tuesday I was in a good secondary school in Cambridge that, to be honest, was not faced with huge behavioural problems. I accept that it was not your average challenged secondary school. Its approach to mobile phones gave a clue as to how important they will be on the information technology agenda. Given that the Government do not have much of an IT agenda, with the abolition of Becta we must look at what schools are doing on that. I hope that in the coming months we might get to the point technologically at which we can as a society support schools in using devices such as mobile phones as an essential part of learning in school and with links to home.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000055"></a>That is not for now and that agenda is not quite here at the moment. I would hate to do anything now that would give a message that would make it difficult for some unconfident schools to move along that road in future years.</p>

I agree with the point made by my noble friend Lord Storey and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, that one must be careful not to legislate in a blanket fashion that stores up problems for later. I listen in particular to my noble friend Lord Storey because he knows what he is talking about. He has day-to-day direct involvement and we should listen carefully to his reminder of the problems faced by schools. However, I also accept that a lot of technology can be used for good or for ill. That is to do with what people make of it rather than with the nature of the technology.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000057"></a>In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, our purpose in a number of these approaches is to give individual schools discretion in what to do, taking their circumstances into account. On the regulations that list the items mentioned by the noble Baroness,  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC255"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC255</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we have not laid them before the House because I thought that it was important first to take these issues through the House and Committee and to have this debate. We are not seeking to have a blanket ban on mobile phones, but we want to reach the point at which schools can exercise discretion. More generally, the Government will need to take into account the points that have been raised.</p>

Before dealing with the issues debated today, I thank my noble friend for his comments on our debate on Tuesday. He told us that there will be advice in guidance from the Government to head teachers that they should consider the level of training of the teacher who is designated to be allowed to search. That is all very well, but what happens if they do not do that? What happens if the school designates a teacher who has not had adequate training? What if someone is hurt and the teacher in question was not trained? Would my noble friend like to answer now or would he prefer to come back to me on that?</p>

<p><a name="11063072000061"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="11063072000422"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> I will come back to my noble friend.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000062"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="11063072000423"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> I thank my noble friend. A number of points have been made in the debate today, and I absolutely agree with those who have emphasised how important it is that schools consult parents and pupils when setting their school rules. Indeed, I believe my noble friend Lady Sharp and I were slightly influential in getting that duty to consult pupils into the Education and Inspections Act 2006, if my memory serves me correctly.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000063"></a>It is incredibly important that pupils and their parents understand what the school rules say. It is quite right that the Government do not seek to specify exactly what a school bans and what it will search for if that ban is flouted, but the rules should state why the school is going to ban the items that could be used. The school should ban only the things that could interfere with teaching and learning or that could be used to commit an offence, cause disruption in the school or be otherwise unlawful. Schools should not go over the top and be silly about what a pupil might want to bring in.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000064"></a>As for phones, my noble friend Lord Storey, who the Committee will know is still a practising head teacher, has reminded me that schools already deal with these matters in their own way. Most schools have a mobile phones policy-indeed, many local authorities  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC256"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC256</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>such as my noble friend's own authority in Moseley have one-and many schools are sensible enough to allow children to bring in a mobile phone if the parents feel that they would like the child to have it for their own safety or on the way home in case they have a problem with their transport and need to contact the parents. However, they insist that the phone is either handed into the school office during the school day or locked up in a locker. That is quite a sensible approach, as the phone cannot be used to distract lessons or to take photographs of other pupils-one head teacher who supports what the Government are going to do told me recently of a boy even taking photographs of one of the girls in the toilets. We do have to bear in mind that children sometimes do horrendous things. Of course this is not just about phones; DS games can send messages, and most schools would not wish pupils to use those during lessons, and the more affluent pupils might even have an iPad.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000065"></a>I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Knight, the other day that these devices can be used for good educational purposes. This is a difficult matter for schools, which is why it is more and more important to specify that these things should be searched for and confiscated and files deleted only if there is reasonable suspicion that they are going to be or have been used to disrupt, to bully or to do something unlawful.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000066"></a>That is why I welcome what my noble friend the Minister has said about sharing draft guidance with us as soon as possible, certainly before Report. I also welcome what he said about the Government wanting to avoid police involvement wherever possible. Of course the criminal justice system must be involved if a very serious offence comes to light, but I certainly believe-and I see many Members around the Committee today who I know agree with me-that we should not get children involved in the criminal justice system unless it is absolutely necessary. Then, of course, we should deal with them properly, but that is another debate altogether.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000067"></a>I have some questions for my noble friend the Minister. If files are erased and the teacher who erases them has reasonable justification for being suspicious, can the child challenge the erasure? If the child loses files of particular sentimental value to them, such as photographs of the family that they do not have on any other electronic device, what is the challenge?</p>
<h5><a name="11063072000390"></a>2.45 pm</h5>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000069"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, suggested that the files be searched by a third party who does not have that close relationship with the child-which the teacher/pupil relationship is-just in case there is something that will completely destroy that relationship in future if the teacher knows something about the child's private life. It is an excellent idea.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000070"></a>In welcoming the promise of guidance, I suggest that, depending on what is in it, we might want to come back to the matter on Report. I thank all noble Lords for their contributions and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000073"></a>The amendments would make it unlawful to search a child of the opposite gender and never, in any circumstances, without another member of staff being present. Amendment 16 refers to schools and Amendment 28 to FE colleges.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000074"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, said on Tuesday, searches can be very invasive and unpleasant experiences that cause children embarrassment, anxiety and humiliation. In addition, searches might have different and more pronounced implications for children with a history of physical or sexual abuse, children with a disability or special needs, or children from different cultural backgrounds.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000075"></a>That is why I believe the person should always be searched by a teacher of the same gender and always with a witness. I am not so concerned about searches of property or lockers, although doing that alone can also open up a teacher to allegations of theft, but searches of the person open the door to allegations of improper behaviour if he or she is either alone or of the opposite gender or both. At a time when the Government have found it desirable to bring in reporting restrictions on allegations against teachers, which we will discuss when we reach Clause 13, why are they attempting to open up teachers to this sort of allegation by encouraging them to search a child of the opposite gender alone?</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000076"></a>Clause 2(3) allows a member of staff to search a child alone if they believe that,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000370"></a>"there is a risk that serious harm will be caused to a person if the search is not carried out as a matter of urgency, and ... it is not reasonably practicable for the search to be carried out ... in the presence of another member of staff".</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000324"></a>I believe that those are the precise circumstances in which a search should not be carried out alone. Let us imagine the situation in which the child and the teacher are nervous and hyped up. The child might know that he has a knife or a gun in his pocket-in these circumstances, the police should be called anyway, as carrying a knife or gun is a very serious matter. However, nothing is more calculated to stimulate the child to do something silly than the pressure of an immediate and perhaps forceful search in front of their peers. It is much better to calm the matter down and send for a senior member of staff so that the search can be carried out more safely.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para50"></a>

I can think of no circumstances in which it would be safe for a teacher to search a child for a knife alone and no circumstances in which it would not be possible to send for reinforcements. If the child is wielding a knife, there is no need to search for it-it is on full view. The teacher has a right under common law to defend himself and protect the other children, and so we do not need this legislation for that situation. However, even then, the teacher would be wise to send for some support.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000078"></a>I believe that these amendments are absolutely necessary, and I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000079"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="11063072000427"></a>Baroness Jones of Whitchurch:</b> My Lords, our Amendment 17 mirrors much of what is in Amendment 16, but with slightly different wording in that it reinstates the protections that were introduced with very good reasons in the first place. They were to have a witness and for searches to be carried out by members of the same sex. I very much echo what the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has said in this regard. We have touched on these issues in previous debates-it has been a bit of a running thread-but it does not diminish the force of the argument or the need to firm up the checks and balances that we need when teachers are operating in day-to-day school life.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000080"></a>Head teachers already have the power to search pupils. The powers already give teachers and head teachers the power to search, to use reasonable force to control or restrain a pupil, to stop a pupil committing a criminal offence, to prevent injury or damage to property, and to maintain good order and discipline.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000081"></a>In the Commons stages, colleagues debated why these new powers were necessary in addition to the existing ones and when they would be used. The answers at that time from the Government were unclear, and the Minister, Nick Gibb, was unable to give a convincing example of when these new powers would be needed. For example, when would a teacher need to search a pupil's possessions without a witness being present? Moreover, in the evidence-taking sessions in the Commons, Brian Lightman, the head of the ASCL, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11063072000349"></a>"I have been a head for 15 years. I cannot imagine a situation where I would sanction any of my staff searching a member of the opposite sex without a witness present. In fact, I wouldn't allow anyone to search a member of the opposite sex, full stop".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Education Bill Committee, 1/3/11; col. 24.]</p>

<p><a name="11063072000325"></a>Similarly, the representation from the teaching unions made it clear that their members would be very wary of using these new powers.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000082"></a>Perhaps more importantly, children's rights are paramount in this regard. Many of us will have received the mailing from an alliance of children's charities raising concerns about the extended search powers. It rightly draws our attention to the protection of children's privacy in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Human Rights Act. It agrees with our position that the case for extended powers has not been made. Instead, it urges the Government to conduct a review of how the existing search powers have been implemented before commencing with any new powers. To me, that makes perfectly good sense.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000083"></a>In addition, these powers are so broad that they give teachers greater search powers than a police office would have under the stop and search provisions. For example, in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 the police powers to stop and search require,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000371"></a>"reasonable grounds for suspicion, before they may be exercised, that articles unlawfully obtained or possessed are being carried".</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000326"></a>Under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, stop and search must be based upon a reasonable belief,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000372"></a>"that incidents involving serious violence may take place",</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000327"></a>or that people are,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000373"></a>"carrying dangerous instruments or offensive weapons".</ul>
<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000084"></a>We do not need to give teachers these additional powers. As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, rightly pointed out, if anything this will endanger the pupil/teacher relationship and put teachers at risk. In all these circumstances, we do not believe that the case has been made for opposite sex searches and searches without a witness. Therefore, we commend Amendment 17, as well as Amendment 28, which applies the same principles to FE colleges. I shall not rehearse the arguments, but we believe that the same ones apply.</p>

If I were the parent of a child who had been searched at school by a same or opposite sex-but particularly opposite sex-teacher, I think I would be mightily cross if I had not been informed. If I were a head teacher, I would hate to be on the receiving end of a parent's anger at their child being searched. The witness should ideally be a parent. Has that been thought of in the Bill? Are parents excluded from this procedure? It is an issue that should be considered.</p>

If a child who had gone through that kind of procedure were searched at school, it would have a devastating effect on them. I remember once launching one of our projects for Barnardo's-I declare an interest as one of the vice-presidents. I put my arm around a young girl because I always like hugging people, but when I did that she flinched like an animal. I wondered why and the counsellor told me that she had been groomed since she was a 10 year-old child. She was now 15 and people showing her any type of affection had a devastating effect on her. Imagine what that girl would go through if she had to be searched at school. I fully support my noble friend Lady Walmsley's amendment. This is something that should be carefully thought through before we put it into the Bill.</p>

We accepted that when we discussed related points on Tuesday. However, there is a need to lean in the other direction and expose the argument. My focus is particularly on the question of having another witness available. I realise and accept that being searched by someone of a different sex is a more complex matter, and maybe we need to differentiate these two.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000088"></a>I make the point about whether another witness is necessary by quoting what my noble friend Lady Perry said on Tuesday. "There are crisis incidents" she said, and:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11063072000350"></a>"At that point, a teacher has to take action".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/6/11; col. GC 230.]</p>

<p><a name="11063072000328"></a>I am concerned about the parent who discovers that their child has been injured at school when perhaps an intervention would have made a difference.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000089"></a>This is a difficult point to make, but the issue in principle that we touched on and now face full on today is whether the legislation should preclude the possibility of a teacher exercising judgment. We all have the respect for teachers that we properly should have and we have insisted on the need for professional training and back-up. That is why the training has to be school-wide, not just for a specialist teacher who does this kind of thing. However, can we not leave room in the legislation for crisis incidents and for the exercise of good professional judgment by a teacher in a situation in which we hope none will be tested?</p>

<p><a name="11063072000090"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="11063072000431"></a>Baroness Brinton:</b> My Lords, I want to argue against the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland. One of the benefits of having someone else to act as a witness to a search is that there is a cooling-off period in a crisis when things could calm down; immediate intervention might well escalate the crisis.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000091"></a>My second point, which has not been made so far on this group of amendments, is that there has rightly been much concern about opposite-sex searching. Frankly, there are also issues about same-sex searching because, sadly, there are allegations against staff of homosexual acts, and there might be some incidents, again sadly, of same-sex abuse. I know that is very rare, but that is why we need to have a witness. You can then start to ensure that, first, the situation is de-escalated if it is rising rapidly, and, secondly, with a witness you can balance that with the safeguard of both the child and the member of staff.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000092"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew24"></a><a name="11063072000432"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> My Lords, not for the first time I find myself welcoming the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland. I might have this wrong, but the provision seems to be designed entirely to deal with a crisis. Of course, if we think there will never be a crisis, we do not need this section. I say that because paragraph (a) of new Section 6A in Clause 2(3)(c) states:</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000374"></a>"the person carrying out the search reasonably believes that there is a risk that serious harm will be caused to a person if the search is not carried out as a matter of urgency".</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000329"></a>That must mean that the person who thinks they have to search is faced with someone in the room making an absolutely open threat, either to the person who might do the searching or to someone else in the room.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000093"></a>Paragraph (b) of new Section 6A says that the condition is satisfied if,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000375"></a>"in the time available it is not reasonably practicable for the search to be carried out by a person of the same sex as P or in the presence of another member of staff".</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000330"></a>I feel strongly that that is meant entirely as a back-up power to deal with a crisis that could not have been foreseen. In considering whether this provision should

We should in no way confuse it with the wider issue of the powers to search.</p>
<h5><a name="11063072000391"></a>3 pm</h5>

First, I hope your Lordships might agree that this highlights the importance of teachers and their development and their need to be highly reflected practitioners-not to get drawn into emotional situations but to have that professional capacity to stand back and be dispassionate. I very much welcome what the Minister is doing to help teachers to reflect on their practice with young people.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000095"></a>I spoke with a head teacher of an EBD school recently. He described a particular situation on a school outing. One of the children picked up a piece of glass on the beach, perhaps, and put it in his pocket, and the teacher was told about it by one of the school children and acted very quickly to search the child and take it away. For schools or institutions that deal with high numbers of children with challenging behaviour issues, it might be helpful for teachers to have this discretion. The head teacher's point was that it was very important for teachers to be able to exercise their discretion and not feel inhibited by too much regulation in the background. I do not have particular experience in that area, but I share it because I heard it recently from a head teacher.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000096"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="11063072000434"></a>Lord Storey:</b> I understand noble Lords' concerns about crises, but I want to paint a different picture. In most situations, there will be teaching assistants in the classroom and learning mentors-a whole plethora of support staff who can support a particular situation. If there is a crisis, the best way to deal with it is not to provoke the situation further but to calm everything down. My concern is that if a teacher carries out this act by themselves and no one else is present, it could put them at risk. I can see all sorts of legal actions being taken whereby pupils, particularly at secondary school level, make allegations about what the teacher did to them. The police and law courts might become involved and it might become an absolute nightmare for schools and schooling, so I understand the concern about the crisis that might occur, but I am equally concerned about the well-being of the individual teacher and pupil. To put that teacher in that situation is potentially quite dangerous.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000097"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew26"></a><a name="11063072000435"></a>Lord Lucas:</b> My Lords, when I think of my own childhood, members of the opposite sex were not the ones who caused the problems. Certainly these days when the staff of many schools are entirely female, you have to allow women to search men, and therefore men to search women, if those are the circumstances in which people find themselves. It must always be advisable to have a same-sex search, and it must almost be always advisable to have a witness, but imagine a situation in which a teacher is alone with a group of pupils and believes that one of the pupils has on them something that they could easily dispose of if they had the chance, whether it was drugs or a weapon. If they were out in the country, something could be dropped easily before they came back.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC262"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC262</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000098"></a>Searching consists of having the power to search, but actually saying, "Palmer, turn out your pockets". The pupil would know that the member of staff had the power to search if they did not comply, and would therefore do as requested. This is a necessary part of the structure, but I am sure that no head teacher is going to advise any of their teachers to search when they do not have a witness, except in circumstances when nothing else is possible. I think that we can trust teachers and head teachers to use the clauses as they are in the Bill wisely.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000099"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew27"></a><a name="11063072000436"></a>Baroness Howells of St Davids:</b> My Lords, having spent practically my entire life in this country fighting against stop and search, and marching on the streets about it, I can tell you the effect that being stopped and searched has on any human being. Why try to impose this on a child? Teachers have adequate powers with which to take the child away or do all sorts of things, but one should not take away the dignity of the child. In any number of cases when the police could not find anything, they made something up and criminalised the child. Some policemen have been known to say, "I am not changing my mind". At that time, people in uniform were respected and believed. We had to confront those cases. I urge noble Lords to think very carefully about providing that power in the classroom. Children are there to be nurtured, loved and taught what is right and wrong.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000100"></a>It is a difficult situation because we have taken away from parents powers to discipline their children. I was told that I was a Victorian when I said, "My child does not do this or will not be allowed to do the other". That was the attitude of most Caribbean parents. Children were children. We are turning them into fodder for the criminal courts. I ask the Minister to look very hard at this measure and take it away if he can. I have seen no empirical data that suggests that searching a child in the classroom will in some way prevent damage to other children-although it may prevent criminal damage to the building. I ask you to think about the child.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000101"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew28"></a><a name="11063072000437"></a>Baroness Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Lords, I had not intended to intervene, but I am inclined to think that this is yet another area that will require a longer time to work out the right solution. All of us are aware of the reactions of children-not necessarily young children but those who have been abused at some stage in their lives. We know, sadly, that that has happened in a number of homes, quite apart from outside when children have been abused. There are new methods of abuse, including cyber access and so on. Such activity is, alas, spreading.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000102"></a>However, I am worried about totally removing the passages from the Bill. What the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, said needs a little more thought. I also want to listen to what the Minister will say in reply before I come to any full conclusion on this. The very best way in which schools operate is when everyone co-operates and trusts one another. We have a head teacher opposite. However, there are situations where that co-operation does not happen, and there can be situations in which children are in danger through lack of action. I am going to wait.</p>

That underlines our argument, which echoes what the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, said, that surely what we need to do is to review how the existing legislation has been working so far. It has been in existence for 15 years. If there were going to be crises, they would have happened by now and we should know about them. We should therefore know what extra legislation, if anything, is needed to deal with it. I can genuinely say that there does not appear to be a chorus of demand from the teaching professions saying, "We were in this awful crisis and we were constrained from what we could do by your really unhelpful legislation". There does not appear to be that demand, but maybe it is out there. Maybe we should do what the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, is saying and find out what is happening on the ground, but without rushing into the new proposed legislation, which opens us up to other problems and repercussions, which we have not yet fully identified.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para65"></a>

I was saving them for my withdrawal speech, but it might be helpful to my noble friend if I emphasised them now. I really would like to know what sort of crisis we are talking about, because nobody has yet described to me the sort of crisis that would make it impossible for a teacher to send a child to fetch a senior member of staff or a member of staff of the correct gender.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000106"></a>Furthermore, what evidence is there that it is necessary to allow searches of a pupil alone, by a teacher of any gender? Like the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, I have not heard an outcry from the teaching profession telling us that the checks and balances in the current legislation need to be withdrawn to allow them the freedom to deal with the situations that they are being faced with. I am hearing it from some head teachers, though not all, but I am certainly not hearing it from teachers themselves. As I said at Second Reading, there is this disparity of opinion within the profession itself, which makes it very difficult for us as legislators and non-teachers-most of us are non-teachers-to legislate on what is right. Perhaps my noble friend can give us some evidence of the need to remove these checks and balances and a clear description of the sort of crises that we are talking about. Are we talking about a child with a grenade in his pocket and his finger on the pin? That I would describe as a crisis-but I have never heard of it occurring. But a child with a knife or a gun in his pocket and not with his hand on it and not wielding it is a situation that would allow you to send for somebody else. If a child has it in his hand, it is on view and you do not need to search for it. You have a common law right to remove it. But if you have to search for it, you have time.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000108"></a>My question is simply this. If there is no evidence that this is needed, is there evidence that training is needed, in the many other provisions of the Bill? We are all very strong on the importance of training. I am just concerned about having blanket legislation that could rule out the unforeseeable-and I think we have accepted that just occasionally some teachers have experienced that.</p>

The teacher thought, "This boy is rather dangerous and it is dangerous for him to have that glass in his pocket-the best thing to do is to quickly check his pocket and get rid of it". That may be an exceptional circumstance, but I can imagine that in working with those particular groups that might be when those exceptional circumstances came into play.</p>

The key issue was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland of Houndwood; namely, whether legislation should in every respect preclude the possibility of some situation that none of us sitting here can necessarily envisage, although the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, raised one such possibility, or whether we should take the view in approaching legislation that, if we are going to be serious in what we say about trusting professionals, we should provide them with a bit of space to exercise their professional judgment and give them support in doing so. That seems to me to be the argument of principle that lies behind, and has already emerged in, our discussion. The decision that we ultimately reach on these provisions will hinge on it. Are we prepared to allow that small bit of space in emergency situations, or do we take the view that we would prefer to close down that possibility by legislating?</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000112"></a>I accept the points made from the outset by my noble friend Lady Walmsley and by a number of other noble Lords. Opposite-sex searches are extremely sensitive-more so at secondary school than at primary school. We have discussed previously the practical issue arising in primary schools from the fact that there are no male teachers in 25 per cent of them. That may have been the relevant age in the instance to which the noble Earl referred. I recognise the sensitivity of searching without a witness. Given that I do so not being a teacher or being in these difficult circumstances, I believe that every teacher or head will understand the sensitivity of the matter even more sharply, because they will know that the consequences to them, professionally and personally, of making the wrong judgment would be disastrous. As a head teacher put it to me the other day, "Any teacher will be very careful about putting themselves in harm's way". That is an extremely important point for us to remember. It links to the concerns that the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, quite rightly raised about putting teachers in danger by giving them such powers.</p>

Under provisions relating to searching powers, head teachers may not require anyone other than school security staff to undertake the search-that will not change-so teachers can draw on this should they feel it necessary for them to do so. There would be very few instances where this situation would ever arise, and, even if it did, an individual teacher may say, "No, thank you. That's not for me", and exercise their professional judgment.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000114"></a>I know that I shall have a hard job persuading some noble Lords, but I will attempt to set out why the discretion granted to school and college staff in Clauses 2 and 3 to use their professional judgment, combined with the safeguards which we have included in both, is a sensible way forward.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000115"></a>A number of safeguards already apply to all aspects of the powers to search in Section 550ZA of the Education Act 1996 and Section 85AA of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. I shall not go through them again, but they are in place. There are additional safeguards, which my noble friend Lady Walmsley referred to, for the new powers. Searches would be permissible only where there was a risk that serious harm might be caused to the person if the search was not conducted as a matter of urgency and if, in the time available, it was not practicable for the search to be carried out by a person of the same sex or in the presence of another member of staff.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000116"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Massey, raised the point about a parent. The response given by the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, is the one that I, too, would give: that is, if it is an emergency situation, trying to get a parent there-although, all other things being equal, it would be rather nice-would not be relevant here. However, I understand the thought that lies behind it.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000117"></a>Given that this is an emergency provision and, by their nature, emergencies can arise at any point, and while I hope that schools and colleges will have little cause to use this power, it is important that they should have the flexibility to act in the interests of students and staff where their safety is threatened in the kind of case that the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, mentioned. We expect that the vast majority of searches in future will still be conducted by a member of the same sex and will still be witnessed by another member of staff, as my noble friend Lord Lucas argued. The extension of the provisions is simply intended to give staff the power to act in the interests of the safety of all in emergencies.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000118"></a>In terms of who supports this extension, I take my noble friend's point that it is clear that some teachers and heads do not want it, but it does have the support of the Association of Colleges, the Sixth Form Colleges' Forum, the Independent Schools Council. Our broad approach on search has support from the Association of School and College Leaders.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000119"></a>I recognise that there are concerns and that this is not a simple and straightforward case, as the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, reminded us. We have listened to what the JCHR said. In wanting to help buttress the position of teachers who find themselves in difficult situations and to help protect other children, I recognise that a balance needs to be struck. I think that the  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC266"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC266</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government should take those concerns on board and include in their guidance the specific points raised by the JCHR; namely the expectation that powers to search pupils of the opposite sex or carry out a search without a witness are likely to be used only on rare occasions. Also, the expectation of privacy should increase with the age of the pupil. That point was made by the JCHR and is a matter of sheer common sense. That is the right thing to do and I am happy to give that commitment today.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000120"></a>I know that we will want to discuss these issues further, but as I suggested on Tuesday, the department's expert adviser on behaviour is organising a meeting for noble Lords when I hope we will have a chance to go through some of these issues. I think that the invitation is on its way today and that the date is fixed for next week. I hope that he will be able to share his experiences and that noble Lords will be able to raise their concerns with him.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000121"></a>I hope that the safeguards in the legislation and the fact that we will address in the guidance points raised by the JCHR will, to some extent, reassure noble Lords and that my noble friend may, for now, feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000122"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew33"></a><a name="11063072000443"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> I thank the Minister for his reply and all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate. I will pick up a few points. The noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, suggested that if I had my way there would be no need for training, but I point out to him gently that the current situation requires training. There are currently pretty wide powers for teachers to search pupils for quite a wide range of objects.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000123"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, raised the scenario of the young child with a piece of glass in his pocket on a school trip. My noble friend Lord Storey may be able to correct me, but on the vast majority of school trips, there is more than one member of staff because the dreaded health and safety rules and the risk assessments that schools have to do these days would ensure that there are at least two members of staff. I do not think that the situation of having to act alone would arise in that scenario.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000124"></a>The Minister mentioned that he did not want us to close down possibilities. But possibilities are closed down by sensible checks and balances under current legislation. He said that these are permissive powers. But I am afraid that when you give people permission to do something, at some time some idiot will go and do it in ridiculous circumstances. Yes of course I accept that 99.999 per cent of teachers would be sensible, but I do not want to open up the possibility by repealing some of our current sensible checks and balances for that 0.001 per cent of teachers to do something silly. The Minister talked about the safeguards that appear in Section 550ZA of some Act of Parliament or other. I ask him whether teachers know about that; I certainly do not. It is important that teachers are very clear about what they can and cannot do, which they will not be if we leave it to those obscure little bits of legislation.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000125"></a>I finish by asking the Minister: have any injuries occurred to any child because a teacher had to send for a witness or a member of staff of another gender?

Looking around the Room and seeing the vast experience that is seated here, I realise that the link between Amendments 33 and 100 may be slightly unusual. Therefore, I begin by offering the Committee an apology and the feeble excuse that I have been waiting for some time for a minor operation on a troublesome tooth. Those who are more experienced than me calculated that the day when Amendment 100 would come before the Committee would be the very day that the surgeon was wielding the knife. Therefore, I am extremely grateful to those who have helped me and been so understanding, particularly the House authorities, who have been very helpful. I am grateful for the support of the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Whitaker, and the noble Lord, Lord Low, who is unfortunately out of the country today.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000127"></a>I also thank the Minister, who wrote to me on this topic. The Committee will not be surprised to hear that his letter was characteristically thoughtful. I appreciated it greatly. However, I regret to say that I did not find it altogether persuasive. That is because Clauses 4, 30 and 31 strike at the very heart of the proper development of children and the responsibilities that we all have, particularly the education services. The Committee will have noticed that the Bill removes the duties placed on the education services by the Children Act 2004 to co-operate with local authorities in promoting the well-being of children and young people in their area. These clauses could not be more comprehensive in their intention. They specify that they extend to schools, governing bodies, proprietors and FE institutions; they are indeed comprehensive. They make clear that, in future, these bodies will no longer even have to have regard or contribute to local plans for the well-being of children and young people.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC268"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC268</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000128"></a>In every inquiry that has followed a tragedy to a child with which I am familiar, two key messages have permeated every report like the lettering through a stick of rock. The first is that in future each service, including education, must greatly fulfil its particular responsibilities to promote the safety and well-being of each child. The second is that each service must develop the skills to work successfully across organisational boundaries and share information at an early stage. If any noble Lord, but particularly the Minister, can recall a report that does not repeat those lessons, I would be extremely glad to hear of it.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000129"></a>However, this is not just about reports. In every serious case review with which I am familiar-and there are getting on for 100 a year-these same messages are repeated to the point of tedium. Indeed, I recall a seminar in which a senior police officer said with some feeling, "Every time I have sat down to review what has happened to a child, the pattern has always been the same; as each service begins to put what it knew about the child and the family on the table, the meeting became quieter and quieter until someone said, 'Well, if only we'd known that we would have acted much earlier'"-but of course in those situations it is generally too late for the child.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000130"></a>This is more than about keeping a child safe. We need to place child safety in the wider context of our and the education services' responsibility to have the wider vision of promoting the proper development of every child. I hope the Minister will take the time to read again some recently published national reports on matters such as childhood obesity, children acting as carers, sibling care, teenage pregnancy, online grooming, drug and alcohol abuse, children with disabilities and those with special needs-to mention just a few. The unbroken thread through each of these reports is this: all these children are of the age to be in the education services, which have a responsibility for each and every child.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000131"></a>Only last week Mr Lansley, the Secretary of State for Health, went out of his way to make it absolutely clear that in the new arrangements that are being proposed for the National Health Service, the specific responsibilities placed on the health services-not just to safeguard children but, as he put it, to promote their welfare-will continue. In fact, if Amendment100 is acted on, the education services will be the only key services to be excluded from these activities. What is more, it just so happens that the education services are the only services that are universal to every child.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000132"></a>Earlier this week Mr Maude talked about teachers' strikes, and he went out of his way to say that schools not only teach but carry out important wider childcare functions. The Minister in our House did a brilliant job, if I may say so, answering a Question on Monday. Perhaps I may read out his answer rather than my own text. Only yesterday in our consideration in this House of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill, the Government introduced amendments to promote the police's responsibilities with regard to the well-being of children.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000133"></a>The development of children's plans and children's trusts under the Children Act 2004 were designed specifically to place the well-being and the promotion  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC269"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of care of children in this wider context. In the letter which the Minister sent to me, he said that the Bill simply reverts to the earlier position. I urge the Government not to do that and to accept that exhortation and hope have proved to be inadequate ways of ensuring that all the key agencies, but particularly the education services, fulfil their unique responsibilities.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000134"></a>If we remove the duties placed upon the education services, as the Bill promotes, it will give not only a huge message to the education services but a negative message to all the other services that have to play a key role in all this. I know, because of my experience with Members of this House, that this House has a great concern for the well-being of children in general. I very much hope that if the Minister cannot agree to the amendments, he will at least be willing to meet some of us to discuss this so that we can consider the matter more roundly. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000135"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew36"></a><a name="11063072000446"></a>Baroness Whitaker:</b> By adding my name to the amendment in this group, which was moved and spoken to with such authority and experience by the noble Lord, Lord Laming, I want to draw attention to a particular group of children where the role of local authorities and others in areas conducive to education-family issues, justice, mobile families-knowledge of the social services is crucial. If there are problems here, children may be disrupted and may drop out of school. Gypsy and Traveller children are particularly vulnerable to the combinations of circumstances that lead them to drop out. Their drop-out rate is far higher than any other group-very, very much higher. School alone cannot easily know all the factors behind this.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000136"></a>So if you want to give these children a better chance, a fair chance, and a chance that is comparable with that of other children, schools need to co-operate with local authorities over well-being. It must be done without exception and it must be a statutory obligation. Of course, it applies particularly in the harshest measure-exclusion.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000137"></a>The Minister referred in his closing speech at Second Reading to local authority children's services. He said that they had,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000376"></a>"a critical role in the early years".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/6/11; col. 773.]</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000331"></a>Why stop at the early years? The need is just as great in later years. The Government's White Paper on teaching says that local authorities have a role as "champions" of vulnerable pupils. Local authorities cannot exercise this role if schools choose not to co-operate with them. I support the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000138"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew37"></a><a name="11063072000447"></a>Lord Sutherland of Houndwood:</b> My Lords, I am happy to find myself in my more natural position of supporting amendments rather than throwing four anchors astern. I pay tribute to the eloquence and passion of my noble friend Lord Laming and the experience on which that has been built. At Second Reading, I asked a specific question, which was that if there was a possibility of permanent exclusion-and it is included twice in the relevant clause in this legislation-there had to be a plan B. If any pupil is permanently excluded, there is a major problem that we cannot

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000139"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Laming, has given us one possible solution to this-and I should like to think further about the details of Amendment 100-but there must be a solution, a plan B, and we need to know. If someone is permanently excluded, not simply from school but, as mentioned in Clause 2, from a pupil referral unit, we have a problem. What is plan B?</p>

<p><a name="11063072000140"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew38"></a><a name="11063072000448"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> My Lords, you will see from the Marshalled List that I added my name to that of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, in his intention to oppose the Questions that Clauses 30 and 31 stand part of the Bill. Amendment 100 replaces Clause 30. It may be appropriate if I comment now.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000141"></a>It was, I think, the Children Act 2004 that imposed a duty on the local authority and a number of relevant partners to work together to improve,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000377"></a>"the well-being of children in the authority's area"</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000332"></a>and reduce inequalities. Initially, schools were not included in the list of relevant partners, and I seem to recall my noble friend Lady Sharp and I protesting loudly about that. Perhaps we were influential in getting schools added to the list at a later date. Therefore, it will come as no surprise to your Lordships to hear that I am very unhappy about the proposal to take them out again. Schools are the only service that all children access at some time or another and therefore they are in a better position than most to affect children's well-being and equality.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000142"></a>I am not one who believes that the job of legislation is to send out a message but I do believe that, if you repeal a piece of legislation, that sends out a message whether you like it or not. We should remember the outcry when the department ditched the phrase "every child matters". Everyone suddenly believed that every child did not matter to the coalition Government, which I know for a fact to be quite untrue. Therefore, what will be the message that goes out if we repeal the duty on schools to co-operate with local authorities? Some will believe that they do not have to do it any more and that would be a disaster, particularly for children who need joined-up services. Joined-up services are exactly what the recent Green Paper on SEN is trying to achieve. It is what all vulnerable children and their families want. Children's trusts, being unaccountable, may not be the best organisations in whose hands to put the children's plan, but it is essential that there is one and that schools are involved.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000143"></a>There are many special groups with needs that must wrap around the child and not stand alone, and the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, has just spoken about a very important one. Another group is young carers and I shall use it as my example. The Princess Royal Trust for Carers has concerns that, by withdrawing the duty on schools to co-operate with local authorities and the duty to have regard to children and young people's plans, the Bill makes it increasingly difficult for local authorities to deliver against their responsibilities towards vulnerable groups of children such as carers. Services work best for young carers where local authorities retain a strategic role, where they have an overview of all services, including education, and where services  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC271"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC271</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and professionals join together around the needs of the young carer and his family. The <I>Carers Strategy</I> 2010 highlights the coalition Government's commitment to improving support for carers. It advocates a whole-family approach, with services in health, education and social care working together to address the needs when it comes to providing the most effective support. It is also committed to embedding <I>Working Together to Support Young Carers</I>, a model memorandum of understanding between directors for children's and adult services and health, social care and education. Removing the duty on schools to co-operate with local authorities-that is, with all services that matter working together-therefore runs opposite to the Government's policy on supporting young carers.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000144"></a>We are not just talking about a few children. The 2001 census data show that there are 175,000 young carers aged from five to 18 in the UK, and I do not know how many more there are according to the most recent census. One-fifth are caring for more than 20 hours a week, and 13,000 young carers are caring for more than 50 hours a week. Twenty-seven per cent of young carers of secondary school age are experiencing educational difficulties. Where children are caring for a relative with drug or alcohol problems, the incidence of missed school and educational difficulties rises to 40 per cent. As young carers get older, so their caring roles often increase, and it gets more difficult for them to participate fully in education, as well as to take part in leisure and social opportunities. For them, time off is a thing unknown in many cases.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000145"></a>Therefore, young carers are a good example but there are others, as we have heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker. Most schools will carry out this duty anyway but it is those that will not do it unless they have a duty to do so that worry me. I think that we need this duty and it should stay on the statute book.</p>

I support my noble friend in this matter. I particularly want to make the point that education does not exist in a vacuum and that education without an understanding of welfare-I have said this on a number of occasions-does not address the issues concerning children who will not learn unless those welfare considerations are addressed. I have asked on a number of occasions why this clause on co-operation is going to be taken out of the Bill. The answer that I have heard is that it is bureaucratic. Well, if it is bureaucratic, it is the kind of bureaucracy that I like. I have always felt that bureaucracy is not always a bad thing; some of it is really quite useful in terms of enhancing services.</p>

I set up ChildLine and have worked with children directly and continue to do so.

<p><a name="11063072000148"></a>Most children have some sort of difficulty. If we think about our own education and our own backgrounds, we will all identify some point of difficulty when we have needed help. It may not have involved co-operation with social services in the statutory sense, but that kind of understanding and partnership are crucial. However, they are not universal at the moment. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, who I am delighted to sit and listen to again as an advocate for children, that we should not send out the message that it does not matter. At a time of extreme pressure and shortage of resources, it would then be very easy not to take the action that was really needed. There are some local authorities-there are people in this Room associated with them-where I know that it will happen; I am not concerned about those local authorities and education departments. I am concerned about where it does not happen.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000149"></a>Co-operation has great value the other way round. Local authority social services departments can learn a great deal from education colleagues about what is happening to children. Teachers often know more from their day-to-day work than a social worker who sees the child now and again-I declare an interest as an ex-social worker of more years than I am prepared to admit to. Unless co-operation is written into the statute, which then frames it, some of that information will not come forward.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000150"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Laming, was most eloquent on this matter, because he has been involved in many cases. I, too, have read most of the large cases; at present, I have to read serious case reviews as the chair of the children and families court service. I see time and again that the key issues are the exchange of information, co-operation, and people understanding about partnership. For these reasons, it would be disastrous if we were to remove the clause on co-operation. It is such a small thing for the Government to do in relation to what the benefit will be for children.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000151"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew40"></a><a name="11063072000450"></a>Baroness Warnock:</b> My Lords, I strongly support the amendment. I have in mind, unsurprisingly, children with special needs who, as we know, are very much more likely to be excluded permanently from school than any other group of children. Ever since the 1970s, people have tried to encourage co-operation between education and social services in particular, but the medical profession as well. As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, it sends out a bad message to remove the duty. I do not usually like to think of laws being made to send out messages, but this carries the message that it is unnecessary to have a plan B which is understood by all the people who are deeply involved with the child. The amendments are therefore necessary for the well-being of the child. I met the other day the headmistress of a school-she was obviously the very good headmistress of an academy-who said that she never intended to use the local authority supplies because she did not trust them and it was bureaucratic. I was absolutely appalled by this because it simply deprives the local authority of the ability to keep an overview of all the needs of the child, which is of the greatest importance. I therefore hope that the Government will be able to think again.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000152"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew41"></a><a name="11063072000451"></a>Lord Touhig:</b> My Lords, I support the amendments in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, and my noble friend Lady Whitaker. Several noble Lords touched on this question at Second Reading. I was particularly concerned to hear that there are 88,000 autistic school-age children in England. We should ask ourselves: who among us, if we had a child with special educational needs, would not want the co-operation of every agency and organisation to deliver the best we can for that child?</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000153"></a>On Monday I was at the launch of a document, <I>We've Got Great Expectations</I>, produced by the National Autistic Society. Maria Miller, the DWP Minister, spoke at that event. She said that joined-up support from health, education and social services was needed. If it is needed, why are the Government removing this essential element-the requirement to co-operate? The cartoons on the front of the document have captions such as, "Support my child to succeed", "Let's work together", "Help me, don't doubt me", and, as some of the parents I met said, "I can't fight any more". We all know of cases where parents have struggled to get the system to respond. Before I was elected to the other place, I was a councillor for 20 years. Time and again I went into council offices with a problem, only to be told, "Sorry, councillor, he falls through the net". Who created the net? We did. Let us not make a bad net by damaging a very sensible policy and the duty to co-operate.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000154"></a>At Second Reading, I asked the Minister what evidence the Government have that the duty to co-operate does not work effectively. I appreciate, as will anyone who has been a Minister, that it is not always possible to answer every point. However, I did not get an answer on that occasion, so I tabled a Question the following day, which the Minister has kindly answered today. I asked what assessment the Government,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000378"></a>"have made of the effectiveness of the duty to co-operate in so far as education is concerned".</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000333"></a>The Minister's reply, drafted by his officials, was:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11063072000353"></a>"The findings of the Audit Commission's report <I>Are We There Yet?</I> showed that before the duty to co-operate was extended, schools and colleges in most areas were engaging voluntarily as partners in local co-operation arrangements".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 29/6/11; cols. <I>WA</I><I></I><I>430-31</I>.]</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000155"></a>That report was published in 2008. I might be the son of a miner but I had to mine that report just to find any reference to co-operation. The only relevant sentence that I found-perhaps the Minister's officials have found others-says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11063072000354"></a>"In most areas collaborative working has improved, but the new arrangements have yet to settle down".</p>

<p><a name="11063072000156"></a>Is that the basis on which the Government will make this decision? In his Written Answer, the Minister went on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11063072000355"></a>"We are not convinced that the addition of schools and colleges to the list of statutory relevant partners, under Section 10 of the Children Act 2004, was ... effective or appropriate".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 29/6/11; col. <I>WA</I><I></I><I>43</I><I>1</I>.]</p>

<p><a name="11063072000157"></a>If it was not effective or appropriate, what do the Government think ought to be in its place to make it effective and appropriate? I asked a further Question about,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000356"></a>"what impact the removal of the 'duty to co-operate' will have on children with complex needs, such as autism, and their families".- [<I>Official Report</I>, 27/6/11; col. <I>WA</I><I></I><I>358</I>.]</ul>

<p><a name="11063072000158"></a>I have received a two-paragraph reply. I am a great admirer of the Minister and do not wish to be ungenerous to him, but that reply could have been two words: "no idea".</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000159"></a>The duty to co-operate under the Children Act has existed for only a year. It ought to be properly evaluated to see whether there are failures or good points. What key government policy is this duty to co-operate thwarting? What great thing over the horizon can the Government not do because the duty to co-operate exists? How many complaints have the Government received from organisations involved in the duty to co-operate, saying that it is so burdensome that they cannot fulfil it? This is a case on which the Government ought to think again. The strength of this House is that we can try to persuade Governments to think again if we feel that there is a failure.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000160"></a>I conclusion, I share with noble Lords some advice that my late mother gave me many years ago: "My son, in life you will find that sense is not common". Common sense tells us that this duty to co-operate should remain. I hope the Government will be persuaded of that.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000161"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew42"></a><a name="11063072000452"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> My Lords, I should like briefly to say how much I endorse the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Laming, and the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker. My noble friend Lady Walmsley mentioned that we have spent some time congratulating the Government on introducing this provision and on making sure that schools were included in it. We are very sorry to see that the coalition is now going back on this particular duty.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000162"></a>I speak with a particular interest, as I am currently chairing a commission on colleges in their community. Further education colleges are mentioned here. One thing is becoming apparent from this; the commission is to develop the role that colleges can and do play within their communities. It is clear that the best of our colleges have enormous breadth of partnerships with all kinds of community organisations, which are currently promoting the well-being and development of those communities. They have in some senses a regeneration function, but they also have a function of promoting the well-being of the local community.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000163"></a>The Explanatory Notes say that these duties are being dropped so that these bodies will be able to decide for themselves how to engage in arrangements to improve well-being. I very much echo the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, in that we are not worried about those that link up naturally. The ones we are really worried about are those that do not bother to do it. Forming these partnerships and links is so important. Having it in statute here provides that extra push or reinforcement for what we want to see. It will be very sad indeed if we drop this duty.</p>

I declare an interest as the chair of the Children and Young People Board of the Local Government Association. The Local Government Group very much supports the Government's attempts to reduce bureaucracy that schools face.

That means that there is a new piece of primary or secondary legislation every school day over that period. However, we do not necessarily see as excessive the burden on schools of co-operating with the local authority through children's trusts. We do not believe that you can necessarily legislate for good partnership working, but many councils have found that the requirement on schools to co-operate with the children's trusts is a helpful way in which to encourage them to participate.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000165"></a>In many cases, the removal of a statutory duty will not immediately lead schools to refuse to work in partnership with local councils. Good schools will want to continue with good partnerships with councils. However, we worry, when all the messages coming out of the department seem to encourage schools to become academies free from local authority control and become more autonomous, that the removal of this duty will provide the wrong signal about the importance of local partnership working to achieve the very best outcomes for local children, young people and their families.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000166"></a>I believe that safeguarding is a particular issue here. We think it is important that schools should continue to be given a very strong message that they must co-operate in local safeguarding arrangements, including the local safeguarding children boards.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000167"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew44"></a><a name="11063072000454"></a>Lord Elton:</b> Two subjects have been raised in this debate that tempt me to my feet. The first is children excluded from school when the provider of education is not the local authority and the child does not actually receive education because the provision is not there or is not working or the child has escaped from the system. The child is not merely at risk but is predisposed to suffer, because the child who is likely to get into trouble is the child who is likely to get excluded.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000168"></a>When I was working to try and keep children out of crime, rather more effectively than I am now, it was clear that one way of intervening at an earlier stage than normal was to go round to schools and say, "Tell us confidentially who do you expect next to be on the list, on skid row, and into permanent exclusion? Let us provide an adult mentor". Usually one found that the child had no male role models, as would be normal. The difficulty was actually finding them. That was effective intervention, but that also bears out my feeling that a lot of children are at risk, without anyone realising it, who need not be.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000169"></a>I have no informed view on the mechanism that the noble Lord, Lord Laming, proposes to address this issue or to maintain pressure on it, because I do not have the knowledge. However, I assure your Lordships of the importance and size of that problem, and the much more distressing problem that came to my notice in the 1970s in the case of Maria Colwell. That was the first case to my knowledge where there had been a hideously unnecessary death of a child because of lack of information about her-poor thing-running home during the day in a nightdress and nothing else,

She finished up dead. The only way to make sure that communications exist is to have a network within which they can exist. I am not advising the Minister of what he should do about the amendment or how that network should be not merely preserved but made perfect; I am saying that it is a compassionate duty on society to see that this endless repetition of the same syndrome, with desperately sad stories taking place as a result, is addressed. If this amendment is an opportunity to address it, let us seize it with both hands.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000170"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew45"></a><a name="11063072000455"></a>Lord Phillips of Sudbury:</b> My Lords, perhaps I may ask a rather boring lawyer's question about the amendment. I think I am right in saying that in Committee it is possible for the mover of an amendment to say something a second time. I am totally persuaded of the desirability of co-operation, and one has a wonderful example in the amendment of the wealth and depth of experience of Members of your Lordships' House. If they combine together, as they have done, it is like a mighty rolling wave, and I do not envy the Minister having to answer it. However, I have a hoary question on which perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Laming, might help me. His Amendment 100 places on all providers of education,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000379"></a>"a duty to co-operate with local authorities",</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000334"></a>and goes on to say,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000380"></a>"to promote the well-being of children and young people".</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000335"></a>In the case of a school, is that duty confined to the children and young people in that school, or is it more general? On the face of it, it looks to be more general. </p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000171"></a>My second boring old question that the Minister might like to answer is: have there been any cases under the existing law-I see that he is proposing to change the 2004 Act-where a school has been sued or taken to task judicially for a failure to co-operate? If there is no such case and the duty is not justiciable, some of us in this Room might be disappointed.</p>

I have absolutely no hesitation in supporting both amendments and congratulating my noble friend Lord Laming and the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, on the way they have presented the case. One is particularly thinking above everyone else of those with special needs, not least of the age of 19 or 21-whatever the ages are-up to which care is quite rightly to be continued and provision made. It takes me back to my 20-odd years as a chairman of a juvenile court in London. At that time, there was a darn sight more co-operation. All of us-the social workers, probation officers, midwives and magistrates-were trying to find the right solution for the problems that ended up in the courts, and many of them were to do with a lack of schooling. Children were not going to school but the reason for that was not followed up. All that ended with the Children and Young Persons Act 1969. It was a case of, "Magistrates, you make the decision and we the professionals will deal with it". That would have been okay if it had really proved to be the answer but-this is why I come back to the point-we need co-operation. Returning to the phrase used by my noble friend Lord Laming, "If only we'd known that at the time", so much more could have been done.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000173"></a>This issue also takes us straight back to the principles underlying this coalition Government. I refer to the form of localism in which everyone co-operates to do their best, particularly for the least able within our community. I therefore congratulate noble Lords and ask that this duty be reinstated.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000174"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew47"></a><a name="11063072000457"></a>Baroness Morris of Yardley:</b> My Lords, I am not sure that I shall be able to add too much that is new to the debate, but this is an important issue and I am hoping that weight of numbers will affect the way that the Government respond to it. There will be a bit of repetition on my part but perhaps also one or two new points.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000175"></a>I genuinely think that this is one of the most important debates that we have had so far on the Bill. I have a feeling that, if this measure goes ahead, the tide will be turned back and it will be very difficult to reclaim the progress that has been made. The subject was excellently introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Laming, and no one is more experienced than him in understanding co-operation. In some ways, the education service has been on a long journey in getting to this point, having put into law a duty of co-operation. I wonder how far the Minister and his department have reflected on that journey. If he had done so, I do not think that he would have come to the conclusion that he has. First, there is a litany of children's cases where, if only we had known the background, we could have made a difference.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000176"></a>Going back in time, it was clear that the education system did not need to co-operate with everything else. Children were born into and brought up in communities where there was natural communication. There were no social workers, health workers or even classroom assistants and so on; the people in the community looked after the needs of the children. Back then, children very often flourished because their lives were not separated into the needs of many professionals. However, we do not live like that any more. The education and school service is a specialised service in many ways, and long may that be the case because it performs at a far higher level. To be honest, I think that we have spent the past 30 years trying to remake connections that used to be there naturally, and that has been a real problem for schools. They are being asked to focus on education. I look back to the early days of the previous Government, when schools were under a lot of pressure not to act as social workers or counsellors and not to make excuses but to focus on education, and that was right as well.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000177"></a>Over the past 15 years, we have been on a long journey in which schools have focused on educational standards for everybody. I think that teachers have always known it but government came to realise that you cannot deliver on standards unless you look at the development of the rest of the child. When I started teaching in the 1970s, those of us in the education system were too much like social workers and standards came off the agenda. Then, at the end of the 1990s, we focused only on standards, and children fell through the cracks because their wider well-being was not catered for. This proposed new clause has again found the right connection.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC278"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC278</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000178"></a>I am not saying that it worked brilliantly in the past but it is a very clear statement in law that our society understands that, for children to achieve and flourish, adults have to talk to each other, because children's lives are not compartmentalised. It is as simple as that. Sometimes we cannot structure services for children in a way that reflects the people whom they are. It might sound bureaucratic, but I genuinely think that this amendment is an honest chance and an honest wish to reconnect bureaucracies-in the best sense of the word-to meet the lives of children.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000179"></a>Would the Minister ever tolerate or approve of schools not co-operating with local authorities or other organisations? Can it ever be right that a school says, "I am exercising my right not to co-operate with someone else who affects the life of a child whom I teach"? I cannot see that it is. It is obvious that everyone will do things without being told to, but we are not there yet. A Minister in 50 years' time might be able to say that such co-operation happened naturally and was so much embedded in the way schools worked that we no longer needed to have this in the Bill, but honestly we are not there yet.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000180"></a>The sad thing is that some schools that have the most difficult of times, because they have really challenging children with so many barriers to learning, given half the chance will not comply because they have other things to do. It will not be because they are lazy or do not care or think that is it is unimportant but because, in the words of the Government, it is a burden lifted from their backs. In a way, it is those people who have the most need to co-operate.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000181"></a>There are simple reasons why this is the right thing to do. It is good practice. Secondly, it is not yet embedded good practice. Thirdly, I sense in much that has been said over the past year that teachers need to focus on education and standards. Even if that is the reason, they need to talk to other people and help remove the barriers to children's learning. I very much hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to explain the thinking but then to take time to see whether this problem that he is creating can be avoided.</p>

I confess that in the mid to late 1990s, I was chair of education in an authority where we had such an incident before the Act came in and there was a duty to co-operate. I remember at the time the deep shock as a fairly new councillor and certainly as a new Cabinet member at understanding that we had completely failed. The system had failed. I welcomed the Act when it came in.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000183"></a>I also echo the points that the noble Lord and others made-the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, in particular-about a number of cases that have been reviewed since. I would say to my noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury that I do not think you need to take a school to court. All you need to do is look at the serious case reviews where recommendations have been made to schools that have failed to ensure that follow-up happens.</p>

I am sorry to go back in time, but I remember some grant-maintained schools in the 1990s feeling that it was an absolute liberation to be free of the local authority and doing everything that they could not to co-operate with it. I fear that we might end up with that sort of encouragement again among academies and free schools were we to lose the duty to co-operate now. It is vital that we retain it.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000185"></a>I have one further point that is not about safeguarding in the sense that much of this debate has focused on. In many other areas local authorities, not just upper-tier authorities with responsibility for education and social services but district and borough councils, should have a duty to co-operate for services that children receive across the board. That has to include library resources, playgrounds and provision of school places at a strategic level. Where more schools can do their own thing and there is no longer a need for an admissions forum, a duty to co-operate at the highest strategic level to ensure that there is the right provision for children in an area is absolutely vital.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000187"></a>Some of the issues that he and others raised are about not being able to educate without looking at the whole child-a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, and a few other noble Lords.

<p><a name="11063072000188"></a>Before I came to the Committee today, I listened in the Chamber to the first couple of speeches in a debate on female genital mutilation. My noble friend Lady Rendell, whose debate it was, made the point that schools sometimes knew that if a girl went missing or was absent for a while to go back to her own or her parents' country, it was often for the purpose of female genital mutilation. Noble Lords might think that that is not a good example because there have been no prosecutions for female genital mutilation. However, my point is that schools can spot problems at an early stage. They can spot things such as unexplained absences, physical signs of abuse and drug and alcohol use. Schools have a responsibility to share that safeguarding function with other people. They need to know what to do and who to go to about their concerns over a particular child or children. They need to know who to refer to and how to link to other services.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000189"></a>I remember from when I was a teacher that some of the most valuable discussions I had, long before all this, came from case studies of a particular child or family. We brought in all the agencies, or as many as we could at that stage, who were responsible for that child. Those case studies were time-consuming but often addressed the given child's situation-why that child could not learn, why that child was absent and what was going on. All the agencies could share that  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC280"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC280</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>information. The ideal scenario now is that all the agencies we have talked about today should be able to share their experiences of a child and should be encouraged to do so.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000190"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew50"></a><a name="11063072000460"></a>Baroness Benjamin:</b> My Lords, childhood lasts a lifetime. Whatever children go through at an early age will stay with them for ever. Children's well-being should be at the heart of everything we do in society. It should begin at home, but that is not always the case. However, it definitely needs to happen at school. Today, many children face difficulties in their lives. For some, life is like a marathon; it is relentless and the challenges that they face are unbearable. Some even die because of those challenges. The children who are victims and who are vulnerable need schools to support them. Schools have a duty to help them through the traumas that they might be going through by having strategies in place to cement the solid foundation needed to address children and young people's well-being.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000191"></a>Many schools have such strategies in place and take this responsibility seriously. I visit schools up and down the country to give inspirational talks to children and young people. I often identify children and young people who need support, and discover what they might be going through mentally, physically and emotionally. It is so rewarding to know that you can make a difference to a young person's life by giving them support and making sure that their well-being is addressed. It is the responsibility of us all to make sure that this happens time and again. We should have joined-up policies to make sure that it does. I fully support the amendments in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, and the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker. If we can do this, we will do a just service to our children and our young people across the country.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000192"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spmin5"></a><a name="11063072000461"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Laming for tabling these amendments. I have just one quick question for the Minister, following on from the question of the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, who talked about the impact on children with special educational needs. What does he think the impact might be on children in the care of local authorities? In principle, I can see that outcomes might be improved if there is at least a strategy that involves schools working with local authorities and thinking about how children's homes and foster carers could be better meshed into the system.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para128"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000193"></a>Schools already have various duties with regard to looked-after children, but this might be another means of promoting outcomes for them. I should be grateful to the Minister if he circulated some copies of the plans for children and young people. I suppose it would be fairly easy for me to find those plans in the Library, but I should be interested to see how they work. I recognise the Minister's drive to reduce bureaucracy, and I wonder whether the legislation is perhaps going a bit too far in trying to right that wrong.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para129"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000194"></a>Finally, I share the noble Baroness's concern about the academies process. There are many positive sides to it, but there is the danger of schools becoming atomised, and the process would seem to add to that risk. I look to the Minister for reassurance in his reply.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC281"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC281</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="11063072000195"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew51"></a><a name="11063072000462"></a>Baroness Hughes of Stretford:</b> My Lords, I was a little concerned, after listening to our previous debate on searches, when we all became energised and passionately concerned about some of the dramatic situations we were envisaging, that when we came to debate something that sounds as sterile as a duty to co-operate we would not capture what this was about. I am sorry-I need to apologise to noble Lords, because I completely underestimated the ability of colleagues to see the importance of what we are talking about and to get behind the rather dry phrase, "duty to co-operate".</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para130"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000196"></a>I care enormously about this issue. It is one of the most significant aspects to the Bill, as my noble friend Lady Morris and others have pointed out. While I am on this subject, I have to say that I had no idea that the intervention of the noble Baronesses, Lady Sharp and Lady Walmsley, in the genesis of this legislation was partly why schools are included. That was before my time as Children's Minister. I am full of admiration because I know the weight of opinion among civil servants in the Department for Education-with respect to those here-and that they would have resisted this like mad. Therefore, it is a tremendous achievement that the noble Baronesses managed to get it included.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000197"></a>One of the themes in this legislation, which I am sure the Minister will rehearse, is that the Government want to reduce what they regard as burdens and unnecessary duties on schools. We all have some sympathy for the potential for innovation and creativity if we can give professions who are capable of exercising it wisely their head. However, my problem is that the Secretary of State's view-and I absolve the Minister here from responsibility, because it is the view of the Secretary of State-that it is a good thing if he can take away every single duty and burden as he sees them, and he is not necessarily thinking judiciously about the effect of each and every one. The more he can tear up the better. To be honest with noble Lords, that genuinely causes me great disquiet because reducing requirements and duties and thinking about the impact of what you are doing is one thing. Simply to tear them up without thinking about or understanding the impact properly is quite another. The best interpretation of the Secretary of State's proposal here is that he does not know what he is doing and does not understand the issues. I am absolutely convinced that if he understood them properly, he would not be proposing to repeal these duties on local authorities. It is incomprehensible to me-if not indefensible-that anyone should propose this if they really understand what they are doing.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para132"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000198"></a>The amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, are a way of getting to a stand part debate. I know we will not have that later on, which is why I and others are speaking now. The noble Lord, supported by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, gave us a history of all the inquiries, from Maria Colwell through Victoria Climbié and recently up to Peter Connelly, and their identifying the need for agencies working with children to speak together and to work together. That is a process that we still cannot say is perfect, as other Members have pointed out. It is why the legislation placed an equal duty on all those agencies-it was no greater on one than it was on another. They were the local authority and all the relevant partners, including the health,  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC282"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC282</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>schools and employment services and the police. There is a mutual lock on all those agencies to talk and work together. To take one of those partners out of the equation, particularly the only partner that has contact with every single child over the age of five, is incomprehensible.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para133"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000199"></a>The duty was brought in not only to address some of the failures of the past but, in recognition of the limitations of legislation, to start to change culture and practice. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, that simply to remove the duty from schools would send a very bad message and cause problems. It would also start to reverse the improvements in culture and practice that we have undoubtedly seen. I know that legislation cannot determine the behaviour of single school or every single authority, but it can create a direction of travel. To repeal the provisions would be to go backwards. There is still a lot further to go.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para134"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000200"></a>When I was Children's Minister leading up to the implementation of the legislation, I saw that it was a matter not just of schools not co-operating. I heard many complaints from schools that had tried to engage children's social care-they had rung up about a child. They told me, "Do you know what? They said they can come in three weeks' time. Well, that's no good to me". Reciprocity has to be developed between the key agencies. I can see the noble Lord, Lord Storey, smiling, but I can tell him that I got a lot of stick when speaking at local government conferences and directors of children's services' conferences, and I became well known for it, for saying, "Come on, now. It's not just schools; it's you as well". To unpick and start to weaken that apparatus by taking out schools would be very dangerous.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para135"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000201"></a>Many noble Lords have touched on why that co-operation is still necessary. Children with special educational needs are a very important group requiring multi-agency assessment and intervention. The recently published special educational needs Green Paper, when referring to special educational needs and exclusions-a topic that we will come to shortly-states that a whole-family approach to the assessment of needs and delivery of services is necessary and that,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000381"></a>"we will recommend in ... guidance that children are assessed through an effective multi-agency assessment for any underlying causal factors. We will suggest that schools trigger this assessment".</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000336"></a>Here we have a Secretary of State in the Education Bill proposing to repeal the duty on schools to co-operate but envisaging, in addressing the needs of SEN children who might be excluded, that schools trigger the assessment. There seems to be a contradiction in the Government's thinking.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para136"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000202"></a>The assessment is essential not just for children with special educational needs, as noble Lords have mentioned, but for children at risk, for children in care, for those with mental health problems, and for children with parents who are in prison or who are abusing drugs and alcohol. There is a whole range of factors. Indeed, to promote the earlier intervention from the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, who is very experienced, schools-that universal service-are necessary to identify the problems early, to get those services in to intervene early and perhaps to prevent escalation and further problems down the line.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para137"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000203"></a>One response that the Minister might make-his colleague Tim Loughton has referred to this as an alternative-is that schools should be formally represented on the local safeguarding children boards. That may well be a very good thing, but it is not the same as requiring each school to co-operate in the case of individual children. That raises concerns about how far Ministers understand what we are talking about with this proposal. We certainly give our intention to vote against the repeal of these two clauses when we come to Report, but I would be interested in the Minister's response today.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para138"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000205"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Laming, for the way in which he raised and introduced his amendments. I wish him well with the dentist and hope that the exploration that he is about to undergo will not be as painful as the one that I have just been subjected to-and I hope that they will remember to supply him with some anaesthetic. Maybe I will speak to his dentist.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para139"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000206"></a>Before responding to the suggestion with which the noble Lord, Lord Laming, concluded his remarks, I wanted to pick up one point that had been raised about whether removing the duty to co-operate may inadvertently send a signal to schools that the Government do not take children's well-being seriously. I want to put on record the fact that clearly we do, and we have duties on schools to safeguard and promote the welfare of pupils under Sections 157 and 175 of the Education Act 2002. We have retained the important duties on maintained schools to promote the well-being of pupils, which is in Section 21 of the Education Act 2002. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes of Stretford, said, there is a duty on the local authority to take reasonable steps to ensure a diverse range of schools are represented on local safeguarding children boards. Obviously, we have no plan to change any of those duties.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para140"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000207"></a>There is a debate one can have about statutory duties as opposed to a voluntary approach and whether statutory duties automatically work better than a voluntary approach. I think what everyone who has spoken this afternoon would agree with is that it is the importance of people working together in partnership working across a range of different fronts that is the key here. There is no disagreement between us that that is something that we want to encourage.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para141"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000208"></a>I shall not reply at length, but I clearly recognise-as do all noble Lords-the experience that the noble Lord, Lord Laming, brings to this area, as do many other noble Lords who have spoken. It clearly behoves the Government-me-to listen to what he says with great care. I know from having spoken to him before that he understands our concerns about a one-size-fits-all approach and not trying to treat all schools in all situations in exactly the same way. I know that he understands that, but equally I understand the point that he has made. In essence, I clearly need to consider the points that he has made this afternoon. He kindly offered to come in and speak further; I would very

As soon as he is able to speak again, perhaps we can do that, certainly before Report stage. I would invite him to do that if he would.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000209"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew53"></a><a name="11063072000464"></a>Lord Laming:</b> My Lords, I am-I was going to say "most grateful" but that is an understatement-slightly overwhelmed. I am so proud of your Lordships' House. I read the debate on this that took place in what we call "the other place". Being at my most judicious in choosing my expression, I shall say that it was a touch disappointing compared with what noble Lords have said here today. The debate here has stood out. I am not surprised but hugely impressed, as ever, with the calibre of the people who have contributed to this debate, with the experience that they bring and with the quality of compassion that they share.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para142"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000210"></a>We would all like to impress upon the Minister, who responded in a characteristically thoughtful and generous way, that none of us wants to defend duties that are there purely to serve bureaucratic ends. Frankly, too many such duties simply serve bureaucratic ends. I would support the Government if they said that with every duty you had to demonstrate the value that it brought to, in this case, children and young people. We should ask what impact it has. Does it enrich their lives and their life opportunities? If it does not, it is simply serving the machine. Therefore, if the Government wish to remove bureaucratic duties, I assure the Minister that he will have my complete support. There is a huge difference between that and trying to remove these duties, which, as all noble Lords have said, are about co-operation. They are not just about safeguarding but about promoting the welfare and proper development of every child. Today, we have heard many examples of children in different circumstances. However, time is going on, so I shall not mention them.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para143"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000211"></a>I am immensely grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken in the debate. I absolutely understand the Minister's position. I know that by working together-an example that we should set to everyone else-we can do something that will achieve the end that we all wish to see. I shall not delay the Committee further, as I know that noble Lords have a long agenda. I shall follow the good example set by the Minister and just say that, on the basis of the assurances given by the Minister, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I shall speak also to Amendment 42 in the noble Lord's name.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para144"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000214"></a>He would first like to thank the Minister for the offer he recently made to meet him with some of his officials to discuss these matters in more detail. The noble Lord says that he is most appreciative of the Minister's time and for his constructive and helpful approach to the various matters raised.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para145"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000215"></a>I intend to focus my comments on the educational attainment of pupils with special educational needs, notably those who are disabled, and particularly those who have a learning disability. For the record, it is appropriate that the noble Lord, Lord Rix, declares an interest to your Lordships through his role as president of the learning disability charity, Mencap.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para146"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000216"></a>As your Lordships may be aware, the exclusion of pupils with a learning disability remains disproportionately high compared to non-disabled children. Pupils with SEN-both with and without statements-are more than eight times more likely to be permanently excluded than pupils with no SEN. It is for this reason that he has tabled the amendment and Amendment 42, which aim to ensure that children with SEN are not unfairly excluded as a consequence of either their need for additional support to achieve their full potential, or the failure of a school to recognise and provide for those needs.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para147"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000217"></a>The amendment would ensure that where a child's SEN has association to behavioural needs, a school cannot exclude a pupil without demonstrating the attempts made to support those needs.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para148"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000218"></a>Inadequate identification of a pupil's needs denies that pupil access to support and the consequence is a poor education. This in turn leads to children becoming frustrated with the lack of appropriate provision, and a misunderstanding by teaching professionals about the subsequent conduct and behaviour of the pupils concerned. However, all this may have been caused by the initial and ongoing failure of the school to identify that pupil's support needs. In such a climate, what hope is there for the children affected? The tragedy is that once mistakes are made in the early years of a child's education, they can sometimes lead to a repetition of these failings as they grow older and older. Amendment 34 would go some way to tackling some of the issues to which I have just referred.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para149"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000219"></a>This leads to my second amendment in this group, Amendment 42, which provides a trigger for an assessment of a child's support needs if they are excluded more than once in a 12-month period. I understand that when this issue was raised during the Commons Committee stage of the Bill, Ministers claimed that it would be "too rigid in practice" to implement. Your Lordships will not be surprised to hear that I do not share this view. Indeed, I take a contrary opinion: the prospect of the trigger would lead to more schools taking the right steps early on in an attempt to avoid exclusions occurring in the first place.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para150"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000220"></a>I fear Ministers may also overestimate the enthusiasm of some schools and educational professionals for

I also advise a rethink of this position to fall in line with the SEN Green Paper, which states that the Government,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000382"></a>"will recommend in exclusion guidance that children are assessed through an effective multi-agency assessment for any underlying causal factors. We will suggest that schools trigger this assessment in instances in which a pupil displays poor behaviour that does not improve despite effective behaviour management by the school".</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000221"></a>Why can the Education Bill not take note of the Green Paper, rather than wait a further year before accepting this sound advice? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000222"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0001.htm_spnew56"></a><a name="11063072000468"></a>Lord Lingfield:</b> My Lords, I have enormous sympathy with the amendments that the noble Lord, Lord Rix, would no doubt have moved and spoken to if he had been able to stay. His record on behalf of the vulnerable and the disabled is superb. He has spent all his life doing these things.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para151"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000223"></a>The assessments for which he calls in his second amendment raise a question of some difficulty. Most schools in most of the 6,000 cases of permanent exclusion call for some reassessment at that stage. Not all schools do and that record should be improved. However, it is a stage that triggers-at least in the mind, if not in legality-a reassessment under those circumstances. There is a huge problem over that. Most SENCOs, most teachers and many professionals working in this area will tell you that when the assessment is triggered-which does not always happen, as we know-it is not independent. Some local authorities have a fine record in this area but there are some whose record is, frankly, poor. Too many of the professionals I have mentioned believe that because the assessment is made by local-authority-employed educational psychologists, it reflects rather more the funding and provision available in the local authority area than the needs of the child.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000224"></a>The Green Paper, which has already been mentioned, gives us a glimpse of hope on this. We all rather hope that when it becomes a White Paper it will become more definite. It promises that in some trial areas we shall find some real independent assessment of the kind that is necessary here. I hope that that will happen, that we will see many of those trials and that at the end we shall see a new system that will able to assist excluded children in this way.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000225"></a>I suspect that when the noble Lord, Lord Rix, reads <I>Hansard</I> he will find that the Minister has not been able to grant him immediate gratification. Nevertheless, he should be able to give some guarantee that those assessments must become more independent and be conducted by more objective criteria than they are at present.</p>

Children who have been permanently excluded are less likely to achieve five good GCSE results or to be in employment in later life. There is a long-established link between being excluded from school and being involved in crime. Research from the prisons inspector in 2004 found that 83 per cent of young men in custody had previously been excluded from school. There is a clear consensus

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para154"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000227"></a>Exclusion disproportionately affects disabled children and children with special educational needs, further compounding the disadvantages that they face. The Bill's equality impact assessment itself recognises that pupils with SEN account for 72 per cent of all exclusions. Disabled children and children with SEN continue to be over eight times more likely to be permanently excluded from school than the rest of the school population, a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, on behalf of the noble Lord, Lord Rix, when she gave us his speech.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para155"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000228"></a>Children placed in School Action Plus who have significant needs but who are without the statutory support of a statement for special educational needs are over 20 times more likely to be excluded. The Special Educational Consortium, which provided a brief for today, recognises that the Government are seeking to ensure that children with SEN are not disadvantaged by the new system. However, I share its concern that the Government have not gone far enough to mitigate the potentially negative impact that the proposals would have on children with SEN. The consortium tells me that it is often the unmet learning needs, including unmet special educational needs, that are at the root of the persistent behavioural difficulties that these young people become involved in. In Committee in the other place, the Minister for Schools said,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11063072000359"></a>"Incidents which prompt multiple exclusions will often be an indication that a pupil has underlying difficulties that may not have been correctly identified".</p>

<p><a name="11063072000337"></a>This recognition is most welcome; I think that we would all welcome it. The Minister went on to say that the Government,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000383"></a>"will recommend in exclusion guidance that children are assessed through an effective multi-agency assessment for any underlying causal factors. We will suggest that schools trigger this assessment in instances in which a pupil displays poor behaviour that does not improve despite effective behaviour management by the school".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 15/3/11; col. 378.]</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000338"></a>On Report in the other place, the Minister said that it was the Government's intention to ensure that those assessments actually take place.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para156"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000229"></a>The Special Educational Consortium rightly has serious concerns that those assessments will not happen if there is only a recommendation and they are not included in the statutory guidance. All my experience, both in the other place as a Back-Bencher and a Minister and, as I said in the earlier debate, as a councillor for 20 years, shows me that that would be the case. Exclusion guidance is already clear about the need to look at underlying causes of behavioural difficulties, yet this has not reduced the number of children with special educational needs who are routinely and regularly excluded from school.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000230"></a>The current guidance is also explicit that schools should exclude children with statements only in the most exceptional circumstances. However, children with statements-in a point made by the noble Baroness,

Hence, Amendment 35 would require that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11063072000360"></a>"Regulations must make provision that if a pupil has been excluded from school for a fixed period on two or more occasions in a 12 month period or is at risk of permanent exclusion then a head teacher shall ensure that-(a) there is an assessment of whether that child has unidentified learning needs (b) there is a review of the effectiveness of the special educational provision being made if that pupil has identified special educational needs; (c) there is a review of the effectiveness of the reasonable adjustments being made if that pupil has disability".</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para158"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000231"></a>The purpose of this amendment is to make it a requirement in the regulations to assess children at risk of exclusion. That is necessary because the proposals as they stand would make no difference to the number of children with special educational needs who face exclusion from school. The amendment would ensure that the school has a legal duty to undertake an assessment.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para159"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000232"></a>Amendment 48 would make it clear on the face of the Bill that any parent can request an SEN expert, even when the child does not have an identified SEN issue but the parent believes that there may be an underlying factor in the exclusion.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para160"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000233"></a>Amendment 49 would provide that parents must be properly informed of,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000384"></a>"their right to request an SEN expert",</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000339"></a>to assess their child.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para161"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000234"></a>Amendment 50 would ensure that all SEN experts are suitably qualified and there are consistent standards across the country. That has been a big problem with many of these measures in the past.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para162"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000235"></a>Amendment 51 would ensure that the SEN expert is able,</p>
<ul><a name="11063072000385"></a>"to review the needs of the child and whether the school puts the correct support in place",</ul>
<p><a name="11063072000340"></a>and Amendment 52 supports the Special Educational Consortium's belief that the final choice of an SEN expert must be left to the parents if they are to have confidence in the system.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para163"></a>

Some 48 per cent of young offenders suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, commonly known as ADHD.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para165"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000240"></a>I have spoken already about the concentration in this Bill on who should be assessed and the lack of detail on what should be assessed. In the opening amendment, my noble friend Lord Northbourne talked about a child's healthy, social, emotional and cognitive readiness to enter school. The noble Baroness, Lady Perry, questioned the responsibility for preparation being passed to local government. I agreed with that in one particular respect-the word "consistency". If you delegate responsibilities, they will inevitably be given different priorities, which leads to what are known as postcode lotteries. There must be no postcode lottery in ensuring that our children-all our children-are as ready as possible to enter school, which means that possible preventive problems have been identified and amelioration plans made.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para166"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000241"></a>I spoke to Amendment 1 to suggest that every child's communication skills should be assessed, not just to identify learning disabilities and special educational needs, but also difficulties that do not qualify for either definition. The problem with ADHD is that it is another one that does not qualify for definition either as a learning disability, a disability or a special educational need. It is not mentioned in any of the other amendments in this group although it is hinted at in Amendment 42 about which the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, has just spoken.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para167"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000242"></a>ADHD is a common behavioural disorder affecting school-age children. But it is also a clinically distinct neurobiological condition that is caused by an imbalance of chemicals affecting specific parts of the brain responsible for behaviour. If you look at the figures, 3.62 per cent of all boys and 0.85 per cent of all girls aged between five and 15 suffer from ADHD, 90 per cent of whom will underachieve academically at school. Children with ADHD are more than 100 times at greater risk of being excluded than other children and up to two thirds of those who are diagnosed with ADHD will continue to experience symptoms into adulthood.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para168"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000243"></a>It is not always generally understood what these symptoms might be, and in looking for them the clearest I could find was in <I>A</I><I>Parent</I><I>'s</I><I></I><I>G</I><I>uide to ADHD in </I><I>C</I><I>hildren</I> published in 1997, which said that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11063072000361"></a>"Children with ADHD often act without thinking, can be hyperactive, and may have trouble focusing. ADHD can affect all aspects of a person's life, extending far beyond poor behaviour or problems at school. The symptoms can have a significant impact on family life, relationships with friends, school discipline and society as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000246"></a>A specialist consultant using standard criteria and rating scales can diagnose ADHD in school-age children, but the majority of adolescent psychiatrists and paediatricians believe that it is currently underdiagnosed in the United Kingdom. Sadly, once it is diagnosed there is no quick fix. The condition is manageable with a combination of regimes that include behaviour management, cognitive therapies and medication.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para172"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000247"></a>According to NICE, ADHD is associated with significant financial and emotional cost to the healthcare system, education services, families, carers and society as a whole, quite apart from the basic financial cost of £4,000 a year to teach a child in mainstream and £15,000 a year in a pupil referral unit. Carrying on with this problem, two thirds of parents of children with ADHD who had been in contact with teachers found that the perceived competence by teachers in the management of ADHD was at best variable. A very large number of specialists feel that teachers are not aware of ADHD and do not therefore realise what the symptoms are or that people showing those symptoms should be referred to someone as quickly as possible. We come down to the fact that, at present, ADHD is usually identified only after the second exclusion for bad behaviour. The youngest excludee whom I came across in prison was a boy who had been excluded from his playgroup at the age of four and never allowed to attend any form of education thereafter. It was small wonder that I found him Young Offender Institution Dover-and that was down to ADHD.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para173"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000248"></a>What should we do? We have already brought out the fact that a large number of ministries are involved in taking action to ensure that every child is ready for school. I have already quoted a number of Ministers who are involved in different aspects of ADHD. I ask the Minister to agree to undertake not only to consider my amendment, which has a specific recommendation about action following a second exclusion and is what is happening now and should be enshrined-but to start thinking seriously about those who are at risk of exclusion as a result of ADHD by raising its profile on the political and healthcare agendas to ensure better futures for children with this condition.</p>

That is not to say that there are not occasions when pupils have to be excluded. Children have a right to learn and teachers have a right to teach. We must always remember that. However, in my experience-and the noble Lord's point is important here-children with learning difficulties, and with social, emotional and behavioural difficulties, are more likely to be excluded than any other group of children. If we can sort out those issues at school, and more importantly if we have the resources to do that, the likelihood of exclusion is considerably reduced.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000251"></a>I do not think that any pupil wants to be excluded from school. I repeat again that it is a tragedy for that pupil and that family. If we can identify issues early on and sort them out at school, and if we have the resources to do that, the problem of school exclusions becomes considerably reduced. However, when there are exclusions-I am looking at Amendment 43-it is important that the mechanisms of exclusion are properly conducted, that the families can make representations on the proposal to exclude, and that there is an opportunity for them to appeal against that exclusion. There are often certain circumstances, and my experience is that schools and head teachers do not want to exclude. It is the final avenue that they have to go down, and if any reasons come out on appeal, it is not an admission of failure by the school or its leadership. They are more than happy to understand those reasons and to reconsider the situation. Finally, we must make that process transparent. We must make the language we use and the way we carry out the process as simple, clear and concise as possible.</p>

There is no provision in this Bill to show that children also figure. There is no provision to ensure that they are aware of the process, to allow them to make representation themselves to the panel or to appeal against their exclusion.</p>

What has triggered the behavioural deterioration that has resulted in exclusion? These children may already have special educational needs. The behaviour may be down to bullying but sometimes it is due to abuse. Sexual abuse is particularly difficult to uncover in these children. It may also be a grief reaction to loss or bereavement, which can sometimes

One problem is that in the majority of our schools staff do not have adequate training to deal with children who are bereaved and have bereavement and loss reactions. The reactions to grief and loss in this group of children can appear to be disruptive and bad behaviour, and it can exacerbate other behaviours in the children around them. Therefore, the triggers that have set this cascade towards exclusion going are absolutely critical, and if we do not focus on them we will continue to fail children over time.</p>

His comments, which I strongly support, take us back to 1979 and the Warnock report. They take us back to why that report and the 1981 Act moved away from the categorisation of special needs and conditions associated with special needs and towards two things. The first was to look at the severest cases and to make sure that they were properly assessed with a statement of special needs, which then had to be statutorily supported in our schools. I very much supported that at the time.</p>

From that time through to when I entered Parliament, I spent most of my professional career working first in the north-east, opening the first school to look at the inclusion of children with physical impairments; and then latterly in Leeds, working to ensure that children with severe learning difficulties-mostly Down's syndrome, hearing impairment and sight impairment-became part of the mainstream setting.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000263"></a>In all those cases, both in the north-east, where we did some pioneering work with NFER and then HMI, and in Leeds, the crucial factor-I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, is not here at the moment-was training your staff. You can identify until you are blue in the face but, following that identification, you have to ensure that you translate the needs of the child into an appropriate action point, as the noble Lord, Lord Storey, said, with the appropriate resources. This is not a massive resource issue but it is a training issue. It is a question of ensuring that people have the skills to support these children. I am sorry that the noble Baroness whose name I should remember-</p>

The reality is that unless you look at the child in the round you will start to get these narrow categorisations. That is my worry about the noble Lord's amendment; if we go back to looking for a categorisation, we will start looking in silos rather than at the whole child within the whole school and indeed in the broader community. I ask the Minister, when he considers these issues, to do so in the round. The danger of an education programme that looks at giving autonomy to every single school in the country,

It removes the ability to appeal to an independent panel with the power to reinstate a pupil. It does not make any provision for, and does not seem to recognise, the fact that the vast majority of children who are excluded have a special educational need or a disability. As noble Lords have already alluded to, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, this group of amendments focuses on trying to mitigate the even greater impact of these proposals on SEN and disabled children by proposing assessments and reports at various stages in the process that the Government are now putting forward. I support all the amendments in principle. I am speaking to those from my noble friends and me in this group-Amendments 36, 39 and 54-the last of which is slightly different.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para184"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000267"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Storey, was right to alert us to two things. First, there are the traumatic and possibly long-term consequences for a child of a permanent exclusion; it can stay with them for many years and affect their job prospects as well as their academic record. Secondly, there are the difficult decisions that schools have to make, particularly those working with difficult children and in challenging communities.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0001.htm_para185"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000268"></a>I accept that, but I would also say that in taking these decisions it is important that the process demonstrates to parents, to all the pupils and to staff that there is a process of natural justice-the noble Baroness, Lady Jolly, referred to this. Whatever the difficulties that schools are facing, is it right that there should be a process in which there is no opportunity for a decision of an independent tribunal that says, "Actually, we think that this decision was the wrong one" and reinstates the child? I pose that question because it seems to be an important one. What are we saying to children and parents if, after a permanent exclusion, we push them through that process but they do not have the redress that we would all have in any other situation about a decision of such seriousness that affected our future? We talked before about messages, and this seems to be really the wrong message to give to everyone, not just to the children concerned.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000269"></a>We heard a great deal about the evidence that children with special educational needs are grossly disproportionately represented in the figures for permanent exclusions. With respect to the Minister, the issues that he has to address with regard to this group of amendments are as follows. The evidence now is that, even with the power of reinstatement, and even though it is rarely used-it is used in only 10 per cent of the cases that go to appeal; there are only 60 cases a year out of more than 600 that appeal-schools are still disproportionately excluding children with special educational needs and disabilities. Therefore, what will be the effect of removing even that small check and balance, which will be in the back of a governing body's mind when it is making this decision? One can conclude from the evidence before us of what happens next only that the removal of the power to reinstate will, if it does anything,

That is why noble Lords have tabled this group of amendments, including those in my name and that of my noble friend-to mitigate that effect.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000270"></a>Amendment 36 will require a responsible body to consider a report on the pupil from the special educational needs co-ordinator when considering whether to exclude. Amendment 39 will require a special educational needs assessment of every child at the point of permanent exclusion to go before the review panel-that is, the next stage when a child has asked for a review.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000271"></a>A great deal of concern has been expressed by several important bodies, including the Education Select Committee, the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council, which said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11063072000362"></a>"It is not entirely clear from either the White Paper or ... the Bill what the position is regarding exclusion appeals which raise disability discrimination issues".</p>

<p><a name="11063072000272"></a>By removing the appeal panels and replacing them with review panels that lack the power to reinstate, there is a clear risk that children with special educational needs will be even more disproportionately excluded. I am aware that the disability-related permanent exclusion cases, and those of pupils with statements, can be heard by a special educational needs and disability tribunal-a first-tier tribunal. However, I ask the Minister: what about children with special educational needs who are not statemented, or those whose needs have not yet been identified at all? There is a big gap there.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000273"></a>There are concerns-expressed by the Alliance for Inclusive Education, for example-that parents will be required to jump over another legal hurdle of proving that their child is disabled to reach a level of appeal at the tribunal where they might get an impartial view, with the power to reinstate, from a trained solicitor or someone legally trained. The review panels will consist completely of lay people with no legal background, which is another important consideration. I know that the Joint Committee on Human Rights recommends that consideration be given to the suggestion of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council that all appeals should go to the first-tier tribunal. Is that sensible and reasonable? Is that the course that the Government want parents to take? Should we send all appeals to that tribunal, rather than having, at a closer level to the school, a proper independent review panel?</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000274"></a>Amendment 54 relates to the absence of checks and balances. It would require schools to retain financial responsibility for children that they exclude permanently, as well as responsibility for their future educational outcomes. I know the Government are piloting this approach; it was referred to in the White Paper. However, I should like to know from the Minister whether the Government need legislative power to bring in this provision, assuming the pilots make it look feasible. If they do, would it not be a good idea to include it in the legislation that is before us at the moment, at least on an enabling basis? Such a responsibility to the educational future of a child, both financially and for the outcomes  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC296"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC296</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that they achieve, would provide another useful psychological check in the minds of the members of the governing body when they consider permanent exclusion, rather than the school simply being able to pay a fine and get rid of children who are difficult to deal with. In speaking to my amendments, I also support the other amendments tabled by noble Lords in this group.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000275"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="11063072000480"></a>Baroness Warnock:</b> Is it in order for me to ask a question? I agree with much of what the noble Baroness says, but does she not recognise that sometimes sending a pupil back to the same school might not be appropriate and might be very difficult both for the school and for the child? The school's duty is to find proper resources at another school, or indeed at another unit in the same school, so that the education can continue. This is relevant to Amendment 54, because the school could keep the child on the roll and make sure that they had a proper education. Does she agree?</p>

<p><a name="11063072000276"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="11063072000481"></a>Baroness Hughes of Stretford:</b> I agree in principle. The wording in the amendment, "to retain an excluded pupil on the roll", means that the child is still recognised as having a connection with the school and that their education elsewhere needs to be funded and their outcomes included. That is one of the problems with the approach that we are discussing, because it does not allow for that subtlety. A panel might decide that the decision to exclude was wrong and that in principle the child should be reinstated, but there then needs to be a discussion with the child, the parents and the teachers as to the best course of action. For the child to go to another school with their head held high because a positive decision had been taken would be very different from their going to another school because they had been permanently excluded. It would wipe the slate clean, and they might well be better off having another opportunity elsewhere. I wish I had been clever enough to table an amendment that could allow that degree of subtlety, but I agree with the noble Baroness that that is ideally what should happen.</p>

I have heard and seen nothing that would make that case better. I have spent many years going into schools. This is a multiracial society, but racism is still alive and well, and children are hit most when they are young and at school. I just feel that this Bill gives us an opportunity to do something about this. People must unlearn their racism when they teach. I am very happy to talk about this outside, but I waited patiently to hear one person say they realise why young black men and women are in the prison system. If you trace it back, you will find that they were excluded from schools. Second-chance education often helps them. Many people may disagree with me. I have heard people tell me that they are not racist. I have some amazingly subtle ways of asking them questions. They then discover that their conditioning has made them racist. The colour of skin is an important thing for a multiracial society, and I ask noble Lords to give some thought to that.</p>

I have an amendment in this grouping, Amendment 52A, and I would like to speak to it briefly if I may. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11063072000363"></a>"A review panel may, following a review under this section, direct the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills to undertake an inspection of the school concerned".</p>

<p><a name="11063072000342"></a>I hope that the amendment has not been degrouped from this grouping of amendments.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000279"></a>The Minister was kind enough to write to me with some information about the review of Ofsted. I understand that it is looking for new triggers for inspections and I tabled the amendment in order to probe the Minister on whether this might be one way of doing so. It may not be to direct but to encourage Ofsted to inspect a school that has excluded a child. Having spoken recently with a head teacher who sat on a panel dealing with young people who had been excluded, it seems to me that a small number of children are put back into the system and that it is a necessary check. The Minister knows how much sympathy I have for his push to give more autonomy to schools and the professionals working in them.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000280"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="11063072000484"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> My Lords, exclusion should be the last resort, a statement with which everyone here wholeheartedly agrees. There was agreement on that when we discussed it on Tuesday and it was a message that I received clearly from the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Children, which I was lucky enough to meet last week, and it has been reiterated again today.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000281"></a>Therefore, in responding to this group of amendments, I want to start backwards with Amendment 54 moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, and the case for trialling a new approach to exclusions. In our White Paper, published last year, we set out our plans for such a trial. It is worth rehearsing our objectives because this goes so much to the heart of what we have discussed today on exclusions. They are to encourage early intervention; to address behavioural problems and their causes; to keep pupils in their schools wherever possible; and, if it is not possible, to ensure that they receive high-quality education elsewhere. It is worth restating that because it comes down to a point that we debated previously-that the way in which legislation is drafted means that one often starts the discussion back to front. I want to emphasise clearly that our objective, which I know is shared by everyone here, is that exclusions should be absolutely the last resort and the drive of government policy going forward will be to try to find ways of avoiding it.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000282"></a>We know that some areas have already made a lot of progress in this area of the kind referred to by the noble Baroness. Cambridgeshire has devolved responsibility for all its alternative provision to clusters of schools, and they are given a share of the local authority's budget to spend and are allowed to keep the savings. It has seen a reduction of about two-thirds in the number of pupils referred to PRUs by secondary schools. At the All-Party Group meeting last week, we heard also about Devon. There is clearly good practice out there from which we are keen to learn.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000283"></a>In the trial areas, a school that excludes a pupil will then have to find and fund an alternative full-time placement. That relates to the point made by the noble  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC298"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Baroness, Lady Warnock. Knowledge of the pupil's needs and history should assist in finding the most appropriate provision. Some of the funding currently retained by local authorities for alternative provision would be delegated to schools for this purpose. That is the idea of the trials. More than 50 local authorities have expressed an interest in taking part in the trial and we are finalising plans for it to start this autumn, involving between 15 and 18 local authorities. Officials are discussing the final details with those schools, and we hope and believe that this large trial will enable us to identify and work through all the issues, find solutions and modify our approach should that prove necessary.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000284"></a>Amendment 54 seeks to legislate now for that approach. I am sure that its purpose is to provide an opportunity for this debate. However, our view is that we need first to have discussions with head teachers and other people with know-how in this area and that we should not rush into legislation on this matter. We hope that the trials will start in the autumn and run for two or three years. We do not need legislation for the trials, but having learnt from them we will then legislate if we need to. That is something that my honourable friend Sarah Teather is running with.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000285"></a>One more general point: the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes of Stretford, asked some perfectly fair questions about our overall approach to the independent review panels rather than the independent appeal panels. If she will bear with me, we will discuss that whole issue in the next group of amendments moved by my noble friend Lady Walmsley, so perhaps we can pick up on those then.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000286"></a>In this group, I want to deal specifically with the amendments that were discussed and those that concern support for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities. The noble Lord, Lord Rix, is sadly not with us, but I was grateful to him for coming in to talk to me and for a separate meeting that I had with the Special Educational Consortium. The noble Lord, Lord Touhig, set out the figures clearly and compellingly that children and young people with SEN and disabilities have disproportionately, strikingly poor outcomes. The identification of a child's needs is an essential part of meeting those needs, and can enable schools and other services to intervene at an early stage.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000287"></a>I want to say a few words about early assessment. Our Green Paper sets out proposals to improve the early identification of children and young people's needs and secure the right support from the outset. It proposes to replace statements of special educational needs with a single assessment process to try to work towards a combined education, health and care plan so that health and social services are included in the package of support. If the Committee will forgive me, I want to quote briefly from our Green Paper because it sets out clearly our whole approach. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11063072000364"></a>"We know that there is a group of children with SEN who are currently excluded on multiple occasions on a fixed-term basis, and there may be other excluded pupils whose SEN have not yet been identified. Incidents which prompt multiple exclusions will often be an indication that a pupil has underlying difficulties that may not have been correctly identified or met".</p>

<p><a name="11063072000343"></a>The Green Paper continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11063072000365"></a>"In order to offer routinely more effective early support, we will recommend in exclusion guidance that children are assessed through an effective multi-agency assessment for any underlying causal factors. We will suggest that schools trigger this assessment in instances in which a pupil displays poor behaviour that does not improve despite effective behaviour management by the school".</p>

<p><a name="11063072000344"></a>I read at some length from the Green Paper because I hope that it will provide some reassurance to noble Lords. Points were properly raised and noble Lords wanted to be clear that the Government understood the importance of this. I hope that that demonstrates that we do.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000288"></a>We intend to include the importance of multiagency assessment in guidance on behaviour that we hope to issue next month. The noble Lord, Lord Touhig, who I know has been speaking to the Special Educational Consortium, raised the concern that this guidance is non-statutory. I am happy to tell him that we will make this guidance to school governors statutory in the way that he suggested. It will also feature in the additional guidance on exclusions that we will issue after the passage of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000289"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="11063072000485"></a>Baroness Hughes of Stretford:</b> Will the Minister make it clear in the guidance that, if the assessments are done at an early stage as he envisages, they will be made available and the governing body considering a permanent exclusion-and then the review panel at the point of review-will be required to see the assessments that will have recently been done?</p>

<p><a name="11063072000290"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="11063072000486"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> In that case, we would expect the panel to ask for such an assessment if it has been made.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000291"></a>We then turn to the amendments that require an automatic trigger to initiate an assessment when a child has been given a certain number of fixed-period exclusions. Whereas I hope that I have set out our thinking on the importance of good early assessment, we are reluctant to set in legislation such an automatic link, tying assessment to a set number of fixed-period exclusions. The approach that we have set out in the Green Paper can achieve the same objective, and multiagency assessments should take account of all special educational needs, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which was the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, who is no longer in his place. I will follow up with him his specific points.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000292"></a>We then considered amendments that require certain conditions regarding special educational needs to be met before a pupil could be permanently excluded. For example, the governing body would have to consider a report from the special educational needs co-ordinator, the SENCO, before excluding a child; or a school could not exclude a child with special educational needs without showing that it had made attempts to address those needs.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000293"></a>Governing bodies must take account of relevant information pertaining to the child when considering exclusion. They already have a duty to secure as far as they can that special educational provision is made for  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC300"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC300</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>those pupils with special education needs, and I will be happy to ensure that future versions of guidance make it explicit that they should take account of information relating to the child's special educational needs, if any, in this situation. That is currently implicit in the guidance, but in view of the proportion of excluded pupils who have special educational needs, I accept that we should make a more explicit reference in future guidance.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000294"></a>I would hesitate to be so prescriptive as to say that there must be a report from the school's special educational needs co-ordinator. In many cases, I agree that the SENCO may well be the appropriate source of information, but I would rather limit guidance to the principle that the governing body should take account of information that relates to the child's special educational needs but allow it some flexibility on the question of from whom that advice should come.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000295"></a>With regard to whether a school should be able to exclude a pupil without demonstrating the attempts that it had made to meet his or her needs, I hope that what I have said will have demonstrated to noble Lords that we are committed to ensuring that children's needs are assessed early. We would wish governing bodies to consider what their school had done to assist the child, and that should be a factor in their decision.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000296"></a>However, to say that a school could never exclude a child if it had done too little to meet his or her needs would be a step too far. To take an extreme case, if a child whose needs had not been suitably addressed was guilty of a serious assault on another child or a member of staff, exclusion may well be the most appropriate action for the sake of other pupils and staff. We would then want action taken to address that child's needs so that they could better participate in education, but that would be after the exclusion rather than instead of it.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000297"></a>In terms of the part played by the special educational needs expert in the review panel process, noble Lords will know that we made a commitment in the other place to include provision in the regulations to give parents the right to ask for a special educational needs expert to attend the panel. It will be for the parents to determine whether they believe the SEN expert is required, irrespective of whether the school or local authority has identified any special needs. Given that, I am not convinced that there is a pressing need to include a reference to this in the Bill.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000298"></a>We will ensure that parents are made aware of their right to ask for the presence of such an expert. After the passage of the Bill, we will consult on regulations and guidance, and I have asked officials to consult local authorities, schools, parents' representatives and others on how we can best ensure that parents are made aware of their rights.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000299"></a>I move on to Amendment 43, spoken to by my noble friend Lady Walmsley. The principle that the pupil's views should be heard during the exclusions process is very much one that I support. More generally, the Government are committed to ensuring that children and young people's views are listened to and respected. I can confirm that we will work with children's organisations to revise the current statutory guidance to set out clearly the legal obligations that apply to schools in relation to consultation with pupils.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000300"></a>Through guidance, we have encouraged the involvement, where appropriate, of pupils at all stages of the exclusions process-subject to their age and understanding. This begins at the start of the process. The guidance says that before excluding a pupil, the head teacher should inform him of the reasons for the intended exclusion, the length of the exclusion, if for a fixed period, and give the pupil a chance to have his say.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000301"></a>The section of the guidance that covers appeal panels states that pupils under 18 should be encouraged to attend hearings and speak on their own behalf if they wish to do so, subject to them being able to understand the process. We will need to revise the guidance in the light of the changes to panels proposed in this Bill. I can reassure noble Lords that we will keep similar messages in the revised guidance. I hope that the noble Lord will agree that this guidance does not merely pay lip service to young people's participation but actively encourages it. This guidance was prepared under the previous Government, but that principle is one that we support.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000302"></a>It is important that a pupil should have the right to his or her say in this way, and we want schools and review panels to listen to them. However, that is rather different from making more formal representations, and we believe that parents should have that more formal role. However, we do not want to rule out further changes in future. We have taken note of the views of those who want to extend children's rights in this area, and we are willing to consider how such arrangements could work. Noble Lords may have seen in the SEN and disability Green Paper that we are planning to run pilots where children will have a right of appeal to the first-tier tribunal for all tribunal hearings. I ought to make clear the distinction between the trials of the new approach to exclusions and these pilots, which focus not on exclusions but on how young people could appeal directly to the first-tier tribunal on all the issues for which the tribunal is responsible.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000303"></a>The pilots will test in a couple of areas of the country whether this approach can work. They cannot begin until we have modified primary legislation, which would not be until 2012 to 2013 at the earliest. But we will use those trials, assuming that we get the legislative go-ahead, to inform our future policies in these areas.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000304"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, mentioned an important point about Ofsted. I support the principle behind this amendment that a review panel should be ready to highlight concerns and bring them to the attention of Ofsted or other relevant bodies, but I would not go as far as directing Ofsted to inspect the school. But a review panel would be able to write to Ofsted, or to the Secretary of State, expressing its concerns, and suggesting that an inspection might be useful. I believe that an independent appeal panel could do that now, although I do not know if it has ever happened. I think it would be useful for us to refer to that possibility in guidance so that review panels consider the option of making a reference to Ofsted. I am therefore grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, for raising the issue.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000305"></a>Before I finish I would like briefly to speak to government Amendment 60, which is in my name. It replaces the wording of "exclusion appeal panel" with

This is a consequential amendment and should have been included in Schedule 1, but was overlooked when the Bill was drafted, for which I apologise.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000306"></a>We have had a broad set of amendments and debate. I hope that I have been able to provide some reassurance generally about our approach and some specific further reassurance, as well as some more information. In the light of that, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000307"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="11063072000487"></a>Lord Ouseley:</b> I make a small intervention on behalf of the noble Baroness, Lady Howells. The Minister has not responded to the point that she made on the issue of race and ethnicity. If the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, was here now he might be able to confirm the issue to which he referred-the high percentage of 72 per cent of SENs in prison. There is also clear disproportionality associated with that, within the context of colour discrimination, as it affects black young boys in exclusions and in custody, black young boys experiencing stop and search, as well as black young boys' DNA being on data registers. Those are all contributory factors that lead back into issues of behaviour in schools, which we have to address.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000308"></a>We cannot have a debate and a consideration of these provisions and the subsequent ones without recognising the issue of colour discrimination. It would be helpful if the Minister could say before he concludes what efforts he will make to have discussions with the noble Baroness, Lady Howells, and others, about the arrangements to put together guidance and the provisions dealing with assessments before exclusion, which would be helpful to reduce the disproportionality that exists.</p>

I feel very sad that three people of culturally diverse backgrounds have had to bring up this point. I should like the Minister to respond to her and for others to be part of this conversation.</p>

I meant no discourtesy to the noble Baroness, Lady Howells, and I hope she will understand that. I meant no discourtesy to any noble Lord in my reply. I am grateful to noble Lords for having raised the point and for reminding me that I did not do so. I was responding to the specific points relating to SEN. I obviously accept the point that the noble Lord made about exclusions and disproportionality, and the statistics speak very powerfully. That is precisely the sort of issue that the exclusion trials ought to take into account. Regarding where we have got to on the trials, my understanding is that we want to look at a range of issues concerning exclusions in different parts of the country and in different settings. It would be absolutely right to do that. If it would be helpful, clearly I would be more than happy to speak to the noble Baroness and to bring together some officials who can explain where we are with the trials. We could have a conversation to make sure that these important points are picked up.</p>

I forgot to say that the Minister sent me a three-page letter the last time I spoke in the debate. I thank him very much for that and I am sharing it with my colleagues.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000312"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="11063072000491"></a>Lord Lucas:</b> My Lords, perhaps I may ask my noble friend a couple of questions. First, I should be very interested in being included if he is telling people about the trials. The important thing is that they focus on the distillation-on the kids at the end who do not respond at the beginning to whatever is done. They are the ones who are abandoned at the end of the system. They are allotted four hours' tuition at home but that does not happen and people forget about them. I very much hope that, as is the case with prisons, organisations are given money on the basis of the results that they achieve. We may try that at the back end of some of the trials so that innovative ideas are encouraged in rescuing these children who have proved difficult to educate.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000313"></a>Secondly, am I right in understanding that, when a school is concerned that a pupil may have special educational needs which may be causing problems, it has the absolute right to require and obtain the assessment when it is needed, rather than, as in the current system, waiting for the LEA to decide that it is prepared to do it?</p>

<p><a name="11063072000314"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0002.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="11063072000492"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply to my amendment. I am pleased to hear that he is thinking of amending guidance in this way and I thank him.</p>

<p><a name="11063072000315"></a><b><a name="110630-gc0002.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="11063072000493"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> My Lords, I think that once more it falls to me to don the mantle of the noble Lord, Lord Rix, albeit I cannot possibly do it justice. I am most grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part in this debate and I should like to make just a few points.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000316"></a>I was very grateful to the noble Baronesses, Lady Finlay and Lady Howells, in particular, for reminding us that children are not just excluded because they are naughty; there are many underlying factors. The noble Baroness, Lady Howells, reminded us that it could be, at worst, racism or, at best, a misunderstanding of the behaviour of certain cultural groups. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, reminded us that the child might be responding to a terrible trauma in their lives such as bereavement. I remind the Committee that sometimes children behave as though they have been bereaved  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC304"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column GC304</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when their parents split up. A parent has not died but is no longer in the child's life and the child responds in that way. Therefore, we have to look at the underlying factors, whether they are the ones I have just mentioned or the SEN factors that many noble Lords have referred to.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000317"></a>It is particularly important that parents have confidence in the system of exclusion and the system of appeals. In that respect, I certainly support Amendment 52 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Touhig. Parents should be able to choose their own SEN adviser. Only then will they have real confidence in the advice to the appeals tribunal.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000318"></a>I am grateful to the Minister, as I am sure the noble Lords, Lord Touhig and Lord Rix, would be, for saying that the guidance will be made statutory. I am also grateful to him, following something I said at Second Reading, for making it possible for me to meet Charlie Taylor. He is supervising the pilots where schools retain responsibility, in terms of both the financial bottom line and academic achievement, for where they place a child who might otherwise be excluded. It sounds like a very interesting innovation, which I gather will probably go on for two or three years. I am delighted to hear that the Government have undertaken to implement that sort of arrangement more widely if it proves helpful in preventing children being excluded in an unwarranted and inappropriate way.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000319"></a>Finally, on Amendment 43, I am grateful to the Minister for saying that the guidance will be revised. Will he ensure that children themselves can appeal against exclusion in their own right, as they can now do to SENT? That is, will they be able to appeal against an exclusion to the independent appeals panels in the same way that they can to SENT? Perhaps the Minister will write to me about that. I know it is a fairly new situation, but for me and others it is an important "rights of the child" issue.</p>

<a name="110630-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="11063072000320"></a>On behalf of the noble Lord, Lord Rix, I thank the Minister for all his responses to the debate and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="11063066000003"></a><b><a name="110630-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="11063066000163"></a>The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (Lord Strathclyde):</b> My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="11063066000004"></a>I have today laid before both Houses the annual reports of the former Intelligence Services Commissioner, the right honourable Sir Peter Gibson (HC 1240), the Interception of Communications Commissioner, the right honourable Sir Paul Kennedy (HC 1239), and the Chief Surveillance Commissioner, the right honourable Sir Christopher Rose (HC 1111).</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="11063066000005"></a>The responsibility of the commissioners is to provide independent oversight of the use of the investigative powers contained in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, the Intelligence Services Act 1994 and the Police Act 1997. They play a vitally important role in ensuring that public authorities make use of these powers in a way which is necessary, for a legitimate aim and also proportionate to what is sought to be achieved. They are required under the provisions of the legislation to provide an annual report to me with respect to the carrying out of their functions.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="11063066000006"></a>All three commissioners have concluded that these powers are being used properly and appropriately, in accordance with the requirements set out in statute and that respective Secretaries of State and the various members of the intelligence services, police and law enforcement authorities and other public authorities are properly complying with the duties set out in the legislation. They consider that the public authorities concerned are undertaking their work with diligence and in accordance with the law. There have, regrettably, been breaches and errors. However, these have been relatively few in number and in all cases they were caused by procedural or technical problems that have since been addressed.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="11063066000007"></a>I am grateful to Sir Peter, Sir Paul and Sir Christopher and to the inspectors and staff who support them, for their work on these reports-which taken together represent a significant increase in the transparency and oversight of these intrusive powers.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="11063066000010"></a>The amendments to the memorandum focus on the dispute-resolution protocol contained in annexe A.3.

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<a name="11063066000012"></a><b><a name="110630-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="11063066000165"></a>The Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally):</b> My honourable friend the Minister for Political and Constitutional Reform (Mark Harper) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="11063066000013"></a>I am announcing today the publication of draft legislation on individual electoral registration (IER) for pre-legislative scrutiny. The draft legislation is accompanied by a White Paper which sets out the proposals for how this will be implemented.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="11063066000014"></a>An electoral register that is secure and trusted, and as complete and accurate as possible, is a key component for our democracy. It is widely recognised that the current system of electoral registration, which has been in place since the early 20th century, is outdated and requires change. It is also clear that, although proven electoral fraud is relatively rare, there is widespread concern about electoral fraud in this country.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="11063066000015"></a>In the coalition programme for government we said we would reduce electoral fraud by speeding up the implementation of individual electoral registration. I announced on 15 September 2010 our intention to legislate to speed up the move to IER by introducing it into Great Britain fully during this Parliament, in 2014. Individual electoral registration will bring greater protection against electoral fraud and modernise our electoral system. IER will ask each person to register themselves, rather than by household, and provide information which will be cross-checked by registration officers before a person is added to the electoral register.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="11063066000016"></a>Learning from the experience in Northern Ireland we have put in place arrangements to help people manage the transition to the new system. Any electors who do not respond to the initial invitation to register under IER in 2014 will be carried forward unless the registration officer has concerns the registration is ineligible. An individual registration would be required for new registrations and for any elector who wishes to use an absent vote.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="11063066000017"></a>The White Paper also considers how else the system of electoral registration could be modernised, making it easier and more convenient to register to vote. Reforming the system also provides the opportunity to take steps to tackle the problem of underregistration. The UK's registration rate compares well internationally but evidence suggests that a significant number of people are missing from the register. This year data-matching pilots will allow registration officers to compare their electoral register with other public databases to identify people missing from the register or entries on the register that are inaccurate or fraudulent. If data matching proves effective, we will consider rolling it out more widely across the country.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="11063066000018"></a>It should be made absolutely clear that no new national databases will be created and that no additional information will be placed on the electoral register as a result of the changes to the system.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="11063066000019"></a>We are committed to ensuring there is sufficient funding for implementation, with £108 million allocated over the course of the spending review period. We have also sought to reduce costs where possible and have already cut £74 million of the costs of the previous Government's plans by dropping the voluntary phase.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="11063066000020"></a>In developing the proposals in the draft legislation and the White Paper we have worked closely with and listened to the views of stakeholders. I thank those who have already provided valuable input into the development of the proposals, and welcome input during the pre-legislative scrutiny period from those and others who have not yet had the opportunity to engage with us.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="11063066000023"></a>Last year in the annual energy Statement my right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced that we would consider the future of the climate change agreements and review the CRC energy efficiency scheme. We did this because we wanted to ensure that the policies we had inherited from the previous Administration were fit for the future, and that any regulations we retained were less burdensome for business, and more practicable. Today we will set out our initial conclusions following a helpful dialogue with business, the public sector and regulators. As part of this, we have considered radical options, including the possibility of scrapping either or both of the schemes to simplify the landscape. We have concluded that in order to achieve our objectives, while minimising burdens on business, we will retain and simplify both the CRC and CCAs, with a particular emphasis on ensuring  the overlaps are removed and the schemes are each streamlined.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="11063066000024"></a>The first reporting year of the CRC is now over, and many organisations are, for the first time, identifying and recording their entire energy use. Over this period we have seen the importance of the CRC for stimulating the market for new low-carbon goods and service industries-including in energy measurement, in voltage optimisers and in low-energy lighting.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="11063066000025"></a>Today my department, together with the devolved Administrations, publishes a vision for the way ahead in simplifying the CRC scheme. This document sets out the main simplifications that we would like to propose for formal consultation early next year. These proposals will provide greater business certainty by continuing the fixed price sales into the second phase (rather than auctions of allowances in a capped system), as recommended by the Committee on Climate Change and requested by stakeholders. Our proposals will provide business with greater flexibility by allowing organisations to participate as natural business units. They will also reduce the administrative burden; for example, by reducing the number of the fuels which are subject to the scheme from 29 to four. We will also reduce the complexity of the scheme by removing the 90 per cent rule and CCA exemption rules, while achieving broadly the same outcomes, and remove any overlap between schemes at registration. In particular, businesses covered entirely by CCAs will not need to register and we will no longer require EU ETS installations to purchase allowances for electricity supplies.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="11063066000026"></a>Some have suggested that we should replace the CRC with a conventional tax. After considering this, and other policy alternatives suggested by stakeholders, we have decided to retain the CRC, in a simplified form. We believe that the tailored combination of reputational, financial and standardised energy measurement and monitoring drivers remain the most effective way to tackle the barriers to the uptake of energy efficiency. We have ample evidence that price alone does not ensure non-energy intensive organisations implement cost-effective energy efficiency measures which are available to them. Therefore, we consider that the simplified CRC-alongside the Green Deal-is the best way to achieve greater energy efficiency and contribute to meeting our carbon budgets in the relevant sectors.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="11063066000027"></a>These proposed changes provide the basis for a simplified CRC and certainty for the future. We will review CRC and its fit with other policy measures in 2017.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="11063066000028"></a>Following the Budget announcement to increase CCA participants' tax relief and extend the scheme until 2023, and as part of the considerations to streamline and simplify the policy landscape, we have also considered options for the future of CCAs. We will shortly publish a consultation on revisions to the scheme to reduce its administrative burden on participants. We are exploring moving the future administration of the scheme to the Environment Agency, to exploit the synergies with the EU emissions trading system and the CRC energy efficiency scheme, already administered by the agency. This will give industry a one-stop shop for energy efficiency regulation. Target negotiation will remain a matter for Government and the sectors.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="11063066000029"></a>Finally, we have looked at the interplay between the EU emissions trading system and UK regulation; in particular how the UK can best implement the provisions in the directive that allow for small emitters to opt out. My officials are continuing to discuss options with the European Commission and are developing proposals on the equivalent measures as required by the directive. These discussions have not yet concluded. I am grateful for the assistance my department has received from the UK Emissions Trading Group in making the case to Brussels for proportionate implementation of the directive.</p>

My department and the devolved Administrations will welcome comments on our proposed way forward published today. We will then formally consult on legislative proposals early next year.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="11063066000032"></a>On 27 January I announced a review of research and development in forensic science. The Government are today publishing this review and copies will be placed in the House Library. The review is also available on the Home Office website.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="11063066000033"></a>I welcome this review into research and development in forensic science. I would like to encourage all members of the forensic science community to consider it carefully, and consider how they can work together to co-ordinate, deliver and communicate research in this important field.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="11063066000034"></a>Research within commercial providers is one element of a much bigger landscape. I note the recommendation that the Home Office Forensic Transition Board, which I chair, should pay specific attention to the research and development requirement in the framework agreement for forensic science providers. The review shows that research and development is already an integral part of the work of any commercial forensic science provider and that there are natural links between casework and research.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="11063066000035"></a>I fully accept the recommendation and can underline the Home Office's view that forensic science providers do need to undertake appropriate research and development to support their role in the criminal justice system. Providers competing to provide innovative services at the lowest cost will preserve police resources and maximise the positive impact forensic sciences can have on tackling crime.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="11063066000036"></a>Professor Silverman, the Home Office chief scientific adviser, will continue to work with the forensic science research community and research funders to help co-ordinate and support research in forensic science.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="11063066000037"></a><b><a name="110630-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="11063066000168"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> My honourable friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office (Francis Maude) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="11063066000038"></a>I am updating the House on the impact of the strike action by the PCS union on the Civil Service today.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="11063066000039"></a>I can confirm that our latest data gathered from all government departments show that, as of 12 noon today, just fewer than 100,000 civil servants were on strike. This is around a fifth of the total Civil Service workforce.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="11063066000040"></a>The Civil Service has rigorous contingency plans in place to ensure that essential public services are maintained during periods of industrial action. For example, I can confirm to the house that:</p>
nearly all jobcentres are open for business, with only a handful closed to the public;all UK borders are open and operating with only minor delays to the travelling public;150 out of 159 HMRC inquiry centres are open for business as usual; andall HMRC contact centres are open and on-line services to the public are operating as usual.
<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="11063066000041"></a>Very few civil servants wanted this strike at all, and fewer than 10 per cent of them voted for it. Fewer than half of PCS's own members chose to take part today, and far fewer than in previous strikes in 2004 and 2007. The vast majority of hard working public sector employees do not support today's premature and unjustified strike and have come into work today.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="11063066000042"></a>The Government are still in detailed discussions with the trade unions on public sector pension reform. We had a constructive meeting on Monday, which was one of a series of ongoing talks the Government have committed to with the TUC, and further meetings have been scheduled for July.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="11063066000043"></a>The Government are committed to working openly and constructively with the trade unions on public sector pensions and we believe both sides have a responsibility to see the talks through. This is a genuine consultation in order to try to agree a way forward with the unions.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="11063066000044"></a>The reform of public sector pensions is essential, but we will ensure that public sector pensions will still be among the very best, with a guaranteed pension which very few private sector staff now enjoy. But they will be paid later because people live longer. And public sector staff will pay more, for a fairer balance between what they pay and what other taxpayers pay.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="11063066000045"></a>We know that pension reform is an important issue and one that public sector staff care about a great deal. I want to thank the vast majority of hard working public sector employees for coming in to work today, ignoring the pickets and putting the public first.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="11063066000047"></a>On Tuesday I gave a Statement to the House on this Government's response to the planned industrial action by two of the classroom unions. In that response I outlined the action I had taken and I also provided data on likely closures based on early estimates from local authorities and academies.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="11063066000048"></a>We now have a fuller picture, updated this morning based on data from all 152 local authorities and all 707 academies.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="11063066000049"></a>Our data show that 5,679 local authority schools were closed, 4,999 were partially open and 5,860 were fully open, while the situation with a further 4,320 has not been reported to us or the local authority did not know.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="11063066000050"></a>The figures also show that of the 707 academies and city technology colleges, 201 were closed, 235 were partially open and 271 fully open.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="11063066000051"></a>This means that 27 per cent of all local authority schools were closed, 24 per cent were partially open and 28 per cent were open. Data were unavailable for the remaining 21 per cent. Twenty-eight per cent of academies were closed, 33 per cent were partially open, and 38 per cent were open.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="11063066000052"></a>I know that many teachers are concerned about the changes that have been proposed to their pensions. But I believe that we must resolve these differences through discussions and that the action today, while discussions are still going on, was disappointing and unnecessary. I am grateful to head teachers and governors who have worked hard to keep schools open. And I am particularly grateful to all those school staff who-while they may also have concerns about pensions-have decided to go into work today to minimise the impact on pupils and their parents. However, I am also disappointed that there has been disruption to the lives of so many parents across the country. The Government remain committed to discussing pension reforms with all the teacher unions openly, honestly and constructively.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="11063066000054"></a>On 1 March, the European Court of Justice ruled that the use of gender as a risk factor by insurers should not result in individual differences in premiums and benefits for men and women, with effect from 21 December 2012.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="11063066000055"></a>The Government were very disappointed with this result, which they expect to have a negative impact on consumers. The judgment goes against the grain of the common-sense approach to equality which the UK Government want to see. The Government believe that nobody should be treated unfairly because of their gender, but that financial services providers should be allowed to make sensible decisions based on sound analysis of relevant risk factors.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="11063066000056"></a>However, in light of our obligation to implement the judgment, this Statement sets out the Government's understanding of the judgment; its intention to amend   


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS162"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column WS162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Equality Act 2010; and the steps we are taking in Europe to secure legal certainty and to ameliorate the worse effects for consumers.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="11063066000058"></a>The Government's view is that the judgment only applies to new contracts for insurance and related financial services entered into on or after 21 December 2012. In such contracts, the use of gender as a risk factor should not result in individual differences in premiums and benefits for men and women. However, any contracts with gender-sensitive pricing of premiums or benefits concluded ahead of 21 December 2012 can continue unchanged after that date.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="11063066000059"></a>We will therefore proceed with amendments to Schedule 3 to the Equality Act 2010. These amendments would be effected by statutory instrument under Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, which we propose to make early next year. Beforehand, the Government propose to issue a consultation on a draft order, including a full impact assessment, in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="11063066000061"></a>The Government are working with the European Commission and other member states to ensure a unanimous view across the EU of the implications of the judgment, and the factors that need to be considered by member states in their implementation of the judgment.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="11063066000062"></a>While other EU member states and the European Commission are still considering the issues raised by the judgment, early indications are that our interpretation is shared across Europe. In view of the need for legal certainty, our preferred outcome would be an amendment of the gender directive to give effect to the judgment. We are therefore disappointed that the Commission has said it has no plans to propose any amendment, leaving the text of the directive inconsistent with the Court's decision. In view of the 21 December 2012 deadline, we will continue to work with other member states to press the Commission to propose such an amendment at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="11063066000063"></a>The Commission has said that it proposes to issue guidance on the interpretation of the judgment and its implementation by member states. Although guidance will not offer all the advantages of a legislative amendment, we nevertheless welcome this and will work constructively to ensure it is as helpful and clear as possible. In view of industry's need for early clarity about how to implement the judgment, we will press the Commission to bring this forward as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="11063066000069"></a>In March, I announced our intention to take stock of the statutory duties placed on local authorities by central government and at that time, I committed to keeping the House informed of progress.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="11063066000070"></a>At no point in recent history has there been a comprehensive list of the legal duties placed on councils.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="11063066000071"></a>The Government therefore agreed with the Local Government Association that we should compile a list of these duties to give clarity about what these duties are. We recognise that many ensure the provision of vital front-line services but there are others which may be creating unnecessary burdens and bureaucracy for local authorities.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="11063066000072"></a>We published the draft list in March and invited local authorities and the general public to respond, identifying any existing duties that needed to be added to the list to make it more comprehensive and identify any that were redundant. For the avoidance of doubt, inclusion of a particular duty on the overall list was not an indication that the Government were considering that duty for removal.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a><a name="11063066000073"></a>The opportunity to comment closed in April. We received much public interest with over 6,000 respondents. Many respondents focused on protecting vital services, such as support for disabled children and children with special educational needs, allotments and libraries, all of which we have committed to maintaining. There was also significant interest in removing process-based requirements placed on local authorities as an important step in moving towards a decentralised system of governance.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"></a><a name="11063066000091"></a>The Commission's proposals aim to regulate jurisdiction and applicable law as they apply both to the daily management of the property of spouses and registered partners (which would include civil partnerships registered in the UK) and to how disputes relating to the distribution of assets in cross-border situations are handled following the ending of a couple's relationship through divorce or dissolution of the partnership, separation or death.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_78"></a><a name="11063066000092"></a>The broad balance of opinion from the Government's consultation was that it would not be in the UK's interests to participate in these proposals. A number of difficulties were identified. First, the concept of a matrimonial property regime (or equivalent for civil

Currently our courts take a wide view of the capital resources available to the parties on divorce or dissolution (including maintenance). Many of these issues are not included in traditional matrimonial property regimes. If the UK was to opt in, it would be more difficult for our courts to deal with all aspects of the financial provision of international couples on divorce or dissolution in cases which fall within the scope of these proposals.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_79"></a><a name="11063066000093"></a>Concerns were raised about how the use of foreign law could drive up costs and complicate the resolution of disputes in the family courts and create uncertainty for third parties who enter into a legal relationship with the couple. There was also considered to be uncertainty about the interaction with succession law.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"></a><a name="11063066000097"></a>I welcome the consideration given in the report to a number of important issues. The Government share the concerns of the group to ensure both the effectiveness of the database and its ethical operation. The Protection of Freedoms Bill takes account of the advice of and a number of concerns raised by the group. For example, as well as requiring the destruction of all DNA samples within six months of being taken, the Bill places the National DNA Database strategy board on a statutory footing and requires the Home Secretary to lay the board's annual report before Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a><a name="11063066000101"></a>As previously, I was not required to involve independent regulators in assessing the revised undertakings.

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_87"></a><a name="11063066000103"></a>On 3 March I informed the House that based on advice that I had received from the OFT and Ofcom, I was minded to accept undertakings from News Corp in lieu of a reference to the Competition Commission. As the Enterprise Act 2002 requires, I published these undertakings for a public consultation which ended on 21 March.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_88"></a><a name="11063066000104"></a>I received over 40,000 representations to this consultation, including a very large number of near-identical responses as a result of internet campaigns. I have placed summaries of the main responses on the DCMS website. I met representatives from Trinity Mirror, Guardian Media Group, Telegraph Media Group, Associated News and Media, and Slaughter and May on 24 March and met Avaaz on 15 April. Notes of meetings will be published at the end of the process.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_89"></a><a name="11063066000105"></a>The substantive points have been carefully considered by me, advised by the independent regulators.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para90"></a>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_91"></a><a name="11063066000107"></a>The carriage and brand licensing agreements are an important part of this process and I will only accept the undertakings once I have approved these agreements.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_92"></a><a name="11063066000108"></a>These documents have been reviewed in great detail by the OFT, Ofcom and external lawyers. I believe that their independent, expert advice provides confidence that the undertakings and key agreements are robust. They have concluded that the drafts of the carriage agreement and the brand licence agreement are now fully consistent with the proposed undertakings. In addition, the OFT confirms that the terms of the carriage agreement and brand licensing agreement mean that Sky News will be practically and financially viable for the lifetime of the carriage agreement. I can now therefore confirm that I am satisfied with both agreements and am able to approve them in line with the requirement in the undertakings. I will not be publishing these agreements given the nature and the extent of the commercially confidential material they contain.</p>

Both regulators are clear that the points raised in the consultation exercise do not require them to change their previous advice to me. Nevertheless, there have been some constructive suggestions for strengthening the undertakings which I am minded to accept.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_96"></a><a name="11063066000112"></a>A number of changes have now been made to the undertakings to strengthen further the arrangements for editorial independence:</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2011" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS167"></a><b>30 Jun 2011 : Column WS167</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Sky News's articles of association set out the definition of independent directors;meetings of the board of Sky News about editorial or journalistic matters will only be quorate if an independent director with senior editorial and/or journalistic expertise is present. Similar arrangements apply to the corporate governance and editorial committee. This is a response to representations that these arrangements could be undermined if this director was often unavailable for meetings for whatever reason. The change will ensure that Sky News organises its business so as to ensure that there is always appropriate senior editorial and/or journalistic expertise at relevant meetings; andthe appointment of a monitoring trustee whose main role is to ensure that News Corp complies with the undertakings and make sure that News Corp does not do anything "that would prevent Newco (ie the spun off Sky News) being placed in an overall position of editorial, governance, commercial and financial independence in which it will contribute to plurality as Sky News did prior to the Transaction"

<p><a name="wms_stpa_98"></a><a name="11063066000114"></a>Some representations were made about Sky News's continued financially viability. I consider that Sky News's financial viability is adequately secured through the carriage and brand licensing agreements. However, in the light of representations received in response to the consultation exercise, I am proposing to modify the undertakings to ensure that Sky continues to cross-promote Sky News on its channels to a level and in a manner comparable with such cross-promotion for the period of 12 months prior to the date on which the undertakings are accepted. This is important to ensure that Sky News continues to enjoy the same promotional support as the current business.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_99"></a><a name="11063066000115"></a>Also, the monitoring trustee will provide advice to me in my review of the key operational agreements requiring my approval to ensure that they are fair and reasonable.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_101"></a><a name="11063066000117"></a>Because so many of the safeguards are contained in the articles of association, including the requirement that Sky News's services will abide by the principle of editorial independence and integrity in news reporting, the undertakings have been amended so that I have to approve them. Furthermore, News Corp has offered an additional undertaking not to attempt to cause Sky News to act in breach of its articles of association. A copy has been published along with the consultation document and the revised undertakings.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_102"></a><a name="11063066000118"></a>These are the main changes. All the changes are set out in the published revised undertakings, and a more detailed explanation of the reasons for the changes is included in the consultation document and the OFT's report. In my view, they provide a further layer of very important safeguards. As amended, I believe that the undertakings will remedy, mitigate, or prevent the threats to plurality which were identified at the start of this process. I therefore propose to accept the undertakings in lieu of a reference to the Competition Commission.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_104"></a><a name="11063066000120"></a>Once again I will seek the advice of Ofcom and the OFT on any responses to this consultation. As expert regulators they are best placed to thoroughly understand the issues and to offer comprehensive and impartial advice. Once I have considered these representations and the independent regulators' advice, I will reach a decision on whether I still consider that the undertakings should still be accepted in lieu of a reference to the Competition Commission. If, after the consultation, I remain of the view that the undertakings properly address the concerns about media plurality, I will accept them and not refer this merger to the Competition Commission.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_105"></a><a name="11063066000121"></a>I am required to publish the revised undertakings in lieu and an explanation as to why I have made the proposed changes, and I have done so. In the interests of transparency I have also published a number of other documents where there is no legal requirement upon me to do so. These are: the advice I have received from the OFT and Ofcom; the articles of association of Sky News; and a summary of responses to the consultation process. The carriage agreement and the brand licence agreement have not been published given the nature and the extent of the commercially confidential material they contain. I hope that this openness will help strengthen public confidence in the process and decision.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_107"></a><a name="11063066000123"></a>During the consultation period, a number of issues were raised that were not material to the issue of media plurality.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_108"></a><a name="11063066000124"></a>A number of respondents raised competition issues. In addition to the fact that this could not be considered as part of the media plurality public interest test, these issues have already been considered by the European Commission which concluded on 21 December last year that the increased shareholding would not significantly impede effective competition.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_109"></a><a name="11063066000125"></a>Some respondents also argued that News Corp could not be relied upon to abide by the requirements set out in the undertakings, citing previous guarantees and assurances given by News in the past, and the current phone hacking allegations against the <I>News of the World.</I></p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_110"></a><a name="11063066000126"></a>I have taken the view that News has offered serious undertakings and discussed them in good faith. In all the circumstances and given that the implementation of those undertakings will be overseen by the monitoring trustee and thereafter monitored and if necessary enforced by the OFT, I believe that there are sufficient safeguards to ensure compliance with the undertakings. Furthermore, the various agreements entered into pursuant to the undertakings will each be enforceable contracts. Therefore while the phone hacking allegations are very serious they were not material to my consideration.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_111"></a><a name="11063066000127"></a>I would also like to draw attention to a point stressed by Ofcom in its report; namely, that the undertakings must be assessed against the fact that the

The undertakings do not and should not seek to establish Sky News in a position where News Corporation has no relationship with it at all, because today News Corporation controls 37.19 per cent of Sky's voting shares.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_112"></a><a name="11063066000128"></a>I am committed to maintaining the free and independent press for which this country is famous. I have sought and published independent advice throughout this process. I have listened carefully to points made in the consultation and amended the undertakings where appropriate. I have also gone for maximum transparency while taking reasonable account of commercial confidentiality considerations. I continue to believe that, if I allow this deal to proceed, Sky News will be able to continue its high-quality output and in fact will have greater protections for its operational and editorial independence than those that exist today.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_115"></a><a name="11063066000132"></a>Before pets can enter the UK under the Pet Travel Scheme they must meet certain animal health requirements, such as being vaccinated against rabies, which are laid down in European Union (EU) law (EC Regulation 998/2003). The EU regulation applies to all pet dogs, cats and ferrets moving between member states and from non-EU countries into the EU and sets out standard entry conditions. The regulation currently provides two temporary derogations to the UK to apply more stringent controls on rabies, ticks and tapeworm. These derogations expire on 31 December 2011.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_116"></a><a name="11063066000133"></a>Having considered all the options very carefully, I have decided, in agreement with ministerial colleagues in the devolved Administrations, that from 1 January 2012 the UK will harmonise its controls on rabies with the EU-wide pet movement system. This is in line with the positions of Ireland, Sweden and Malta, which will also be harmonising their rabies controls from this date.</p>

They will not be allowed to enter the UK for at least four months after the date of the vaccination;pet owners who need to travel to the UK at short notice will continue to have the option of voluntarily placing their pet in UK quarantine, where it will be required to undergo the necessary health treatments, such as being vaccinated and blood tested if required, before being released; andthe European Commission has given a strong indication that it will shortly come forward with proposals that would enable the UK and other tapeworm-free countries to retain tapeworm controls with a treatment window of one to five days. There will be no mandatory tick treatment before pets enter the UK.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_119"></a><a name="11063066000136"></a>The proposed changes to the controls on rabies are proportionate to the disease risks involved and are scientifically justified. Since the UK Pet Travel Scheme was introduced in 2000, the likelihood of a human case of rabies in Europe has substantially reduced as a result of an effective and ongoing programme to reduce the disease in the domestic and wild animal populations of EU member states, together with improvements in the accessibility to rabies vaccination and post-exposure treatment. There has been not one reported case of rabies in the EU associated with the legal movement of pets under the EU pet movement system since it was introduced in 2004, with many hundreds of thousands of pet movements having taken place during that time.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_120"></a><a name="11063066000137"></a>This reduction in the level of rabies across the EU is reflected in the findings of a quantitative risk assessment undertaken for Defra by the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency. Its report, which has been peer reviewed, concluded that the risk of a rabies case in the UK will remain very low when we harmonise with the EU pet movement rules, with a chance of, on average, one case in 211 years. The risk of an outbreak leading to a human fatality in the UK would be much lower. This report has been published on the Defra website today.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_121"></a><a name="11063066000138"></a>In addition to the robust scientific case for harmonisation, these revised pet movement rules will deliver substantial benefits to UK pet owners, particularly those people with assistance dogs, making it easier and more affordable for the people who presently travel from the UK and back with their pets (on

It will also reduce the time dogs need to spend cooped up in kennels. The annual benefits of reduced controls to pet owners resident in the UK are estimated to be £7 million. These changes will also provide UK citizens the same level of free movement with their pet animals which other EU citizens are allowed.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para122"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_122"></a><a name="11063066000139"></a>We will continue to ensure that the UK maintains a robust level of protection against rabies, given the seriousness of the disease. We have robust plans in place to deal with rabies should it be detected. As part of our ongoing disease preparedness work we keep the rabies control strategy under constant review, and will be consulting with stakeholder organisations later this year to ensure our plans remain appropriate and proportionate. When the rules change on 1 January 2012 we will be looking to ensure that every pet arriving in the UK will continue to be checked to ensure that it meets the EU requirements, regardless of which country it comes from, and we expect the private quarantine sector to retain a vital role in dealing with non-compliant animals. Stringent penalties remain in place for those who breach the law by smuggling animals into the country or by knowingly using false or misleading information/documentation.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_124"></a><a name="11063066000141"></a>The UK is currently free of the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis and there is a strong scientific case for keeping controls in place to prevent its incursion into the UK. The European Commission has given a strong indication that it will shortly come forward with proposals that would enable the UK and other tapeworm-free countries to retain tapeworm controls with a treatment window of one to five days.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_126"></a><a name="11063066000143"></a>Tick controls will no longer apply when the rules change on 1 January 2012. Although ticks which are capable of transmitting the disease Mediterranean spotted fever might enter the UK via pet movements, they could also enter the UK via other routes (for example, on people or vehicles). Even then, the likelihood of ticks establishing in the UK is negligible. Our evidence base for maintaining tick controls is less robust than for tapeworm and we would have difficulty putting forward a case to show tick controls are fully effective, scientifically justified and proportionate to the risk of disease incursion. We will continue to work with vets to encourage pet owners travelling abroad to treat their pets against ticks, as they do at present, as part of good pet ownership practice. Pet owners are advised to talk to their vets about the appropriate course of action for their animals when planning a trip abroad.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_127"></a><a name="11063066000144"></a>There are a number of practical issues that still need to be worked through and Defra will be engaging with key stakeholders, including the quarantine and carrier industries, over the coming months. Members of the public who intend to travel abroad with their pet from 1 January 2012 should consult the Defra website for advice on the procedures to follow in the first instance, contact the pets helpline or speak to their vet.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_131"></a><a name="11063066000150"></a>I am publishing today a consultation paper on proposals to change the charging regime at the Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing. The proposals concern new possible charging rates according to type of vehicle using the crossing.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para132"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_132"></a><a name="11063066000151"></a>The Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing is a key part of the strategic road network. It consists of two two-lane tunnels carrying traffic to the north, and a four-lane cable stayed bridge (the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge) carrying traffic to the south. The crossing spans the River Thames between Dartford and Thurrock, forming a trunk road link (the A282 trunk road) in the M25 orbital motorway.</p>

Details of the current charging regime are set out in the A282 Trunk Road (Dartford-Thurrock Crossing Charging Scheme) Order 2008 (Statutory Instrument No. 1951).</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_134"></a><a name="11063066000153"></a>In recognition of the strategic importance of the crossing the Government are committed to tackling the current and forecast performance issues affecting the crossing. As part of the spending review, the department announced that, subject to consultation, prices would increase from £1.50 to £2 in 2011 for cars, rising to £2.50 in 2012 and that prices for other vehicles would also increase. The proposal to increase the charges at the crossing is both a measure to manage demand and to help to fund transport investment. For this reason I am today launching a consultation on proposals to change the charges.</p>

<a name="110630-wms0001.htm_para135"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_135"></a><a name="11063066000154"></a>The consultation makes reference to, but does not include detailed proposals for, other short, medium and long-term measures to be taken forward in this spending review period in relation to the crossing. In the short term we are announcing an initial six-month trial of a protocol for suspension of the charges during periods when the severity of congestion is such as to constitute an emergency, and charge suspension would help to ease that congestion.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_136"></a><a name="11063066000155"></a>In the medium term our objectives are the introduction of a free-flow charging scheme and a review of options for additional crossing capacity.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_139"></a><a name="11063066000159"></a>The Public Accounts Committee hearing on the Community Care Grant scheme was held on 3 November 2010. One of the recommendations was that more could be done to prevent abuse of the scheme. I am therefore amending social fund direction 7 to prevent repeat applications being awarded, unless there has been a relevant change of circumstances. The current direction, which applies to both community care grants and crisis loans, prevents repeat applications being awarded if an application is made within 28 days of a previous application for the same expenses. This period will be extended to 12 months.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_140"></a><a name="11063066000160"></a>The 12-month time limit has been chosen because this is broadly in line with manufacturers' guarantee periods. In addition the period is well within the scope of the Sale of Goods Act and is a reasonable period during which customers are able, if goods are faulty, to take the matter up with the retailer.</p>

<a name="11063050000003"></a><b><a name="110630w0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="11063050000282"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl Howe):</b> The Food Standards Agency (FSA) consulted across the United Kingdom on proposals for full cost recovery for meat official controls by removal of current discounts, with options for a phased introduction and a reduction in charges for low throughput businesses, and is committed to further reducing its costs.</p>

<a name="110630w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="11063050000004"></a>In response to comments received during the consultation, the FSA revised its proposals, deciding that full cost recovery should be introduced over a three-year period, beginning in April 2012, and that increased support should be provided for a greater number of low throughput meat establishments on a sliding scale. This will provide increased support for approximately 570 establishments, as opposed to about 420 establishments as originally proposed.</p>

<a name="110630w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="11063050000005"></a>In addition following discussions between the FSA and HM Treasury, it has been agreed that industry in Great Britain will not bear the cost relating to the deficit in the Local Government Pension Scheme from 2011-12, which would have totalled £4.7 million. Therefore the pension element within FSA costs will be reduced by this amount.</p>

<a name="110630w0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="11063050000006"></a>In February the cost structure of the proposed full cost recovery fees for 2011-12 was presented to stakeholders including the pensions element above. The following table shows the costs presented with the LGPS pension deficit element removed. This represents the actual costs of meat official controls and the hourly fees that would be required to recover these costs, no more, no less. Discounts are applied to these rates to calculate charges to be made. It is estimated that for 2011-12 industry will be charged £26.9 million.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_64"></a><a name="11063050000069"></a>In response to comments received during the consultation, the FSA revised its proposals, deciding that full cost recovery should be introduced over a three-year period, beginning in April 2012, and that increased support should be provided for a greater number of low throughput meat establishments.

With the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence, the FCO also oversees the Government's contributions to the UN peacekeeping budget. To do this, the UK uses its position on the UN Security Council to ensure that mandates for the UN's peacekeeping missions and special political missions are realistic and focused. At the same time, the UK participates fully on the UN's administrative and budgetary committees to ensure that value for money is being improved or maintained across both UN budgets. Finally, a UK member has recently been elected to the UN's Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ), which makes recommendations to UN member states on effective use of UN funds.</p>
