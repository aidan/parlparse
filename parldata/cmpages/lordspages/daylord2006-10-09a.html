wish to join me in offering our deepest condolences to the families and
friends of all those killed and injured on operations in Iraq and
Afghanistan over the Summer Recess, and in paying tribute to the hard,
dangerous but vital work that is carried out on behalf of us
all.</p><p><a name="06100910000050"></a>Since 25 July we have sent
two additional Chinooks to Afghanistan, making a total of eight, and
increased the number of flying hours. This capability meets the
operational commander's requirement at present but is kept under
constant review. In addition, we continue to have regular discussions
with the NATO Secretary-General, NATO allies and other ISAF
troop-contributing nations on force generation for ISAF, including,
where appropriate, assets such as
helicopters.</p><p><a name="06100910000051"></a><b><a name="06100910001344"></a>Lord

thoughts are with the troops who have been very seriously wounded in
both Iraq and
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06100910000052"></a>Brigadier Ed Butler
has publicly asked for more helicopter lift. In the light of the Prime
Minister's promise that commanders will get whatever they need to
defeat the Taliban, and in light of the fact that we apparently have no
helicopters to send and that many of those there are on their last
legs, will the Government consider, as the Americans do, contracting
independent companies with helicopters in the region to provide
logistical support for the RAF and to help with reconstruction? Might
the cost be part-funded by those NATO allies unable to make good their
promises of men and
material?</p><p><a name="06100910000053"></a><b><a name="06100910001345"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, we are considering such an
avenue. I returned from Afghanistan yesterday after spending time there
talking to our troops on the ground and gaining an understanding of
what they saw as the key lessons that we should learn relating to
equipment such as helicopters and to their needs. The whole area of
helicopters is complex. None the less, there are a number of important
avenues which we can take and are taking. We have a very active
programme at the moment which is looking to address our helicopter
capability. It includes the use of commercial assets but also looks at
areas such as crews, spares and airframes to ensure that our
requirements are met in going forward in
theatre.</p><p><a name="06100910000054"></a><b><a name="06100910001346"></a>Lord

injured since we last talked about those
theatres.</p><p><a name="06100910000055"></a>On 3 July, the
Minister told me that, with regard to the eight grounded HC3
Chinooks:</p><ul><a name="06100910000634"></a>&#147;We are
working very hard to find a fix-to-field solution for those Chinooks

Drayson:</b> My Lords, I have spent a considerable
time talking to both the company involved&#151;Boeing, from which we
procured those helicopters originally&#151;and the team in the
Ministry of Defence which has responsibility for fixing the problem. It
gets absolutely the highest priority. I had a meeting today on the
whole picture of helicopters, which included the grounded Mk3 Chinooks.
I am expecting today an answer from the company concerned. We are doing
absolutely everything we can to improve the position relating to
helicopter assets. There is no doubt, as I have said in this House,
that we have a shortage of helicopter assets overall. We need to
address that. We are learning in Afghanistan that helicopters are a
real force multiplier and we need to provide additional resources. It
is complex. It is not just about the airframes, as I have said, but I
am confident that everything that can be done is being done, and I have
responsibility to make sure that that follows through to have effect on
the ground in response to what I have been told in the past few days by
the troops in
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06100910000057"></a><b><a name="06100910001348"></a>Lord
Soley:</b> My Lords, will my noble friend take this
opportunity to remind everyone&#151;not least the media in this
country at times&#151;that this is not just a British and American
operation? It is NATO plus many other countries under the auspices of
the United Nations, and it is profoundly important that we achieve what
we set out to achieve in Afghanistan because the ability otherwise to
destabilise the whole of an already unstable region is very high. All
power to the Minister&#146;s elbow in terms of getting more
helicopters in, but there are 30-odd nations involved in this, so it is
much wider than just Britain and the United
States.</p><p><a name="06100910000058"></a><b><a name="06100910001349"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble
friend. He is absolutely right&#151;this is a NATO
operation&#151;but we must be realistic. We have a responsibility to
our troops to make sure that they have the resources to do the job. We
are putting considerable pressure on our NATO allies, which includes
talking to them about the provision to us of assets such as
helicopters. Notwithstanding what is agreed within NATO, we must push
NATO to deliver, to make sure that our forces have what they need to do
the job. They have done an outstanding job in Afghanistan this summer.
We underestimated what we were up against in Afghanistan but, despite
that, because of their courage and dedication, they have inflicted a
tactical defeat on the enemy. We now need to build on that over the
next six months. I am committed to making sure that they have the
resources to do
so.</p><p><a name="06100910000059"></a><b><a name="06100910001350"></a>Lord
Craig of Radley:</b> My Lords, the implication of
what the Minister says is that there is inadequate helicopter effort
elsewhere, other than in Afghanistan. He is suggesting that there is a
need for considerably more helicopter airframes than ours. Where is the
lack of helicopters impinging on the services at
present?</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_4"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 4</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06100910000060"></a><b><a name="06100910001351"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, a decision was taken two years
ago on the forward investment in the helicopter programme, which did
not take into account what are, with the benefit of hindsight, the
enduring operations that we are now undertaking. That has put pressure
on our helicopter capability, which I have been very open about with
this House. The question is not how we got here but what we are going
to do about it now. We are making robust efforts to improve our
helicopter capability. The shortages relate to the pressure of going
back into training back in the UK. Assets are being sent forward to
support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which then puts pressure
back in the home base in terms of the opportunities for crews to train
and practise. We need to address that and we are doing
so.</p><p><a name="06100910000061"></a><b><a name="06100910001352"></a>Lord
Trefgarne:</b> My Lords, has not the shortage of
helicopters, to which the noble Lord again referred this afternoon,
been a problem for as many years as some of us can remember&#151;at
least for as long as he and several of his predecessors have presided
over these matters? Is not the real problem that the Chancellor of the
Exchequer simply failed to provide enough money for these purposes, and
that is why there is a continuing shortage?</p><p><a name="06100910000062"></a><b><a name="06100910001353"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, absolutely not. The noble Lord
is wrong. All resources required to carry out operations in either Iraq
or Afghanistan have been funded. Nothing asked for has been refused on
the basis of a decision from the Treasury or
Ministers.</p><p><a name="06100910000063"></a>The nature of our
operations has significantly changed from what we faced some years ago.
My challenge as the Procurement Minister is to ensure that we are more
rapid and adaptable in the development of the procurement of equipment
to meet today&#146;s challenges. We are making real progress; for
example, on the protected patrol vehicles this summer. Identifying and
delivering a requirement in under a year is pretty fast
work.</p><p><a name="06100910000064"></a><b><a name="06100910001354"></a>Lord

carers. The regulations provide some flexibility. However, the general
obligation that children should use a child seat or booster is
important for their
safety.</p><p><a name="06100910000068"></a><b><a name="06100910001358"></a>Baroness
Gardner of Parkes:</b> My Lords, I thank the
Minister. I do not question the need to protect children in car
accidents. However, what assessments have been made of the other risks
to child safety, when a child cannot be given a lift home, even by a
reliable person, because they do not have a child seat, therefore the
child must walk alone&#151;perhaps on a street which one would not
wish them to walk along?</p><p><a name="06100910000069"></a>The
Minister will be aware that child seats cost quite a lot of money, and
are meant to be professionally fitted. Most parents, as he says, will
have them. However, grandparents and others not regularly transporting
a child could not be expected to have them: they are bulky and
expensive. Is not the answer to design the rear seats of cars to have
sections which drop down to form a child&#146;s seat, and can the
Minister press car manufacturers to do that? I saw one in a taxi on the
way back from the airport. Even more cheaply, they could develop a new
type of seat belt. Whether there is a danger is a question of the level
at which the seat belt hits the child.</p><p><a name="06100910000070"></a><b><a name="06100910001359"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness is
always constructive in her supplementary questions. That we may be able
to significantly address car seat design is an important point. For the
time being, however, we all recognise that car seats are designed to
provide considerable safety to adults and people of a reasonable size
through the fitting of seat belts but there is a problem regarding
children.</p><p><a name="06100910000071"></a>We have introduced
elements of flexibility and recognised that where there is an unplanned
necessity&#151;where someone is taking an additional child in a car
as an act of helpfulness&#151;there would be no question of
prosecution. We emphasise, however, that parents, friends and
grandparents ought not to think of taking children home if there is not
adequate provision for their safety in the
car.</p><p><a name="06100910000072"></a><b><a name="06100910001360"></a>Lord
Foulkes of Cumnock:</b> My Lords, perhaps I may, as a
grandfather, give the House and the noble Baroness some advice. Is the
House aware that booster seats have been available at a well known
store in Ayr and throughout the United Kingdom for just under
&#163;5? Surely that is a small price to pay for the safety of
children?</p><p><a name="06100910000073"></a><b><a name="06100910001361"></a>Lord

Bradshaw:</b> My Lords, I acknowledge that booster
seats are available and education is the best way of causing people to
do things, rather than laws that will be very difficult to enforce, but
will the Minister also remember that 30 per cent of driver deaths are
caused by not wearing a seat belt, and two thirds of these are judged
by the police to be avoidable? Would he take the opportunity now, while
the Road Safety Bill is in another place, to produce an amendment to
make wearing seat belts more
usual?</p><p><a name="06100910000076"></a><b><a name="06100910001363"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, compliance with the
law is a well known feature of the British nation, including with
regard to seat belts. Drivers have a high rate of compliance, although
the noble Lord is right that those who do not wear seat belts are
taking risks. The problem with compliance in cars seems related more to
seat belt use by back-seat passengers, on which we do need to educate
more effectively. But it is easier for the police to regulate and
control drivers&#146; use of seat belts; it is more difficult with
passengers in the rear seats. The noble Lord is right: it is an issue
of education and
safety.</p><p><a name="06100910000077"></a><b><a name="06100910001364"></a>Baroness
Gardner of Parkes:</b> My Lords, do booster seats
have to comply with a certain standard, or can anyone just put any old
thing in a car and describe it as a booster
seat?</p><p><a name="06100910000078"></a><b><a name="06100910001365"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, there are standards.
The provision that has come on stream meets the standards of reputable
suppliers. There is always a danger that people will cut corners, but
obviously any parent or responsible adult who decides to provide a
booster seat will seek to ensure that it does the
job.</p><p><a name="06100910000079"></a><b><a name="06100910001366"></a>Lord
Hanningfield:</b> My Lords, we strongly support any
measure that will save the lives of children, but we still have doubts
about how these measures can be effectively enforced. Is the Minister
aware that the police in Cornwall have said that at the moment they
will not prosecute people for committing this offence? Has he discussed
with police forces around the country the practicability of enforcing
these
measures?</p><p><a name="06100910000080"></a><b><a name="06100910001367"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, we would not expect
the police to move swiftly into action on a requirement that has been
in operation only since 18 September. There may be difficulty
in obtaining these seats in a small number of cases. But in due course,
two things happen: first, from time to time the police prosecute and
people become aware of that; and, secondly, the public see the good
sense of the
legislation.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_7"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h3 align="center"><a name="06100910000007"></a>Energy:

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and
Industry (Lord Sainsbury of Turville):</b> My Lords,
the supply of gas is likely to be tight this winter and we remain
concerned about high prices. National Grid&#146;s <I>Winter 2006/07
Consultation Report</I>, published by Ofgem on 21 September, indicates,
however, that under all reasonable weather-related scenarios supply
should be able to meet daily demand. There is now greater certainty
about new import infrastructure being on line for winter. The Langeled
pipeline from Norway is already flowing gas; other major projects are
on schedule; and the Rough storage facility is
full.</p><p><a name="06100910000083"></a><b><a name="06100910001370"></a>Lord
Ezra:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his
comprehensive and generally encouraging response. While it is
satisfactory to note that we shall have extra pipeline capacity this
winter, I am sure the noble Lord will agree that the essential issue is
the amount of gas that will actually flow through those pipelines,
bearing in mind our experience last winter and also bearing in mind
that we shall have to import about 30 per cent of our
requirements this winter, according to estimates published by Ofgem.
Does he further agree that, pending long-term measures to reduce our
growing dependence on imported gas from increasingly uncertain sources,
it is essential in the short term to increase our storage capacity
which, even after the repair of the Rough facility, is still way below
continental levels? Will he agree that the recent experience with the
over-supply of gas during tests on the new Langeled pipeline emphasises
the need for the UK urgently to increase its gas storage
capacity?</p><p><a name="06100910000084"></a><b><a name="06100910001371"></a>Lord
Sainsbury of Turville:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord
is quite right in two respects. First, of course the position will
depend critically on how much gas flows through the new
interconnectors. We have been working on that issue for some time with
the EU Commission to make certain that as much flows through as we
want.</p><p><a name="06100910000085"></a>The second issue is the
amount of storage. Because the Rough storage will be fully available
this year, we hope&#151;unlike last year, when it went out of action
in February&#151;and we will also have Humberley Grove available for
the whole year, compared to only half of last year, we will have better
storage. However, long term, we need to increase the amount of
storage.</p><p><a name="06100910000086"></a><b><a name="06100910001372"></a>Lord
Taylor of Blackburn:</b> My Lords, can my noble

Sainsbury of Turville:</b> My Lords, I cannot give
the exact figure. Such comparisons tend not to be very helpful because
there is a wide difference between countries which have their own gas
supply, 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_8"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 8</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which tend to have virtually no storage, and countries which have no gas
supply, which have substantial storage. In the UK, we are going from
one situation, where we have had virtually no gas storage because we
have had our own North Sea gas supply, to another, where by 2020 we
will be importing 80 per cent. So, at the moment, such comparisons are
not very
useful.</p><p><a name="06100910000088"></a><b><a name="06100910001374"></a>Lord
Jenkin of Roding:</b> My Lords, does the Minister
know that at a recent conference convened by Ofgem, its chairman was
asked how long it is likely to take before continental supplies are as
liberalised as they are in this country? Is it not clear that what
happened last year was due to all sorts of restrictions by continental
suppliers, so that gas did not reflect differential prices? Is the
Minister aware that the answer we were given was that it would take at
least 10 years before the continental systems were liberalised? Is that
not rather
disturbing?</p><p><a name="06100910000089"></a><b><a name="06100910001375"></a>Lord
Sainsbury of Turville:</b> My Lords, if it were to
take 10 years, that would indeed be disappointing, but the Commission
has taken very strong action on this. It is also important not to
confuse forward buying plans of particular countries with monopolistic
practices. Those are two different things and the current situation is
a combination of
them.</p><p><a name="06100910000090"></a><b><a name="06100910001376"></a>Lord
O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> My Lords, does my noble
friend agree that the short-term position is very encouraging, given
last year's difficulties, but that, in the medium term, we will become
increasingly dependent on Russia? At present, Gazprom has about 95 per
cent of the gas export capability in Russia and we in Europe are
currently dependent on Russia for 25 per cent of our supplies. Given
the stickiness and lack of investment on the scale that our increasing
demands will require&#151;that is, in the European Union&#151;we
need to be keeping a close watch on what is happening in
Russia.</p><p><a name="06100910000091"></a><b><a name="06100910001377"></a>Lord
Sainsbury of Turville:</b> My Lords, I agree that,
although the short-term situation is much better, we need constantly to
monitor the extent to which we get our supplies of gas from one
particular country. The strategy is to make certain that they are well
spread across the world, so that we have secure supplies from different
parts of it. That must also be reflected in the overall policy, which
is to spread the risk widely across different energy
sources.</p><p><a name="06100910000092"></a><b><a name="06100910001378"></a>Lord
Redesdale:</b> My Lords, last winter, gas was
available to flow through the interconnectors, but it was not pumped to
this country because of the cost forced on us by the unliberalised
market within Europe. Has the DTI worked out the figure for what that
unliberalised market cost British gas suppliers and, ultimately,
consumers?</p><p><a name="06100910000093"></a><b><a name="06100910001379"></a>Lord

to be very careful. People are supplying gas. The question is the basis
on which they are doing so. If other countries have long-term gas
contracts and we

monopolistic practice that we do not get our gas. This is a question
both of the forward buy-in practices of the companies involved and of
unliberalised markets. We need to keep that in
mind.</p>

have to test immigrants for
tuberculosis.</ul><p><a name="06100910000095"></a><b><a name="06100910001381"></a>The
Minister of State, Home Office (Baroness Scotland of
Asthal):</b>
urrently, we
screen for TB those arriving from countries with a high rate of TB who
want to remain for longer than six months. We also screen abroad
applicants for entry clearance in six countries that are high-risk for
TB. We will shortly be making an announcement on the next phase of this
overseas screening programme, which will extend the scheme to other
high-risk
countries.</p><p><a name="06100910000096"></a><b><a name="06100910001382"></a>Baroness
Sharples:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that
reply. I declare an interest in that I had TB in my teens, so I know
how infectious this disease is. Now that we are threatened with the
spread of this new TB strain, which apparently is drug-resistant, what
are we going to do about
that?</p><p><a name="06100910000097"></a><b><a name="06100910001383"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I can assure the
noble Baroness that we are taking every step to ensure that we have a
robust response. The first step is to screen those who are coming into
this country and, if they are identified as carriers of tuberculosis,
to deal with it before they come here. The second step is to ensure
that those who come to this country are progressively screened so that
we can identify the disease early and deal with it more
robustly.</p><p><a name="06100910000098"></a><b><a name="06100910001384"></a>Baroness
Masham of Ilton:</b> My Lords, how effective is the
BCG vaccination, who is having it, and should we not be protecting our
children, who may be mixing with children with
tuberculosis?</p><p><a name="06100910000099"></a><b><a name="06100910001385"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, the BCG vaccination
has been causing concern. There is an issue about whether children
should be given it at 12. The new procedure has meant that we are now
looking more at the neonatal stage and giving the vaccination to
children much earlier. We know that there is an anxiety about older
children, but it is very much part of the Department of Health&#146;s
agenda to deal aggressively with this matter and ensure that people are
reassured that the changes are safely being
made.</p><p><a name="06100910000100"></a><b><a name="06100910001386"></a>Lord
Dholakia:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that
reassuring answer. I ask her to note that the incidence of TB is not
restricted simply to immigrants either from abroad or in this country.
Will she explain

to have information in their own language so that they know where to go
for treatment as and when they suffer such a
crisis?</p><p><a name="06100910000101"></a><b><a name="06100910001387"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I do not have a
specific answer, but the noble Lord will know that, in the general way
in which we are now trying to give information, we are providing
information in as many languages as possible so that those who may be
affected by it are better able to understand it. All government
departments have been carrying out that process with a great deal of
energy for some time. I assure noble Lords that I know of nothing that
indicates that we are not doing exactly the same in this regard. But if
that is the case, I will certainly undertake to write to the noble Lord
about
that.</p><p><a name="06100910000102"></a><b><a name="06100910001388"></a>The
Countess of Mar:</b> My Lords, does the Minister have
any figures for the occurrence of bovine TB either in the immigrant
community or in the indigenous community, particularly the farming
community if we drink unpasteurised milk on
farms?</p><p><a name="06100910000103"></a><b><a name="06100910001389"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I regret to tell
the noble Countess that I do not have the figures for bovine TB. That
is a great tragedy for me because I saw the noble Countess earlier in
the House and I should have anticipated this
question.</p><p><a name="06100910000104"></a><b><a name="06100910001390"></a>Lord
Brooke of Sutton Mandeville:</b> My Lords, in
formulating government policy on this important question of public
health, have the Government sought advice from the London School of
Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine?</p><p><a name="06100910000105"></a><b><a name="06100910001391"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I cannot answer
that question specifically, but I know, as will the noble Lord, that in
developing these procedures we try ordinarily to collate as much
information as possible from those who may have specialist knowledge. I
therefore assume that that has been done, but I regret again that I am
deficient and do know the answer. I shall certainly undertake to ensure
that the noble Lord has a reply. I should say that, although I answer
for the Government, I would have thought that this was perhaps more of
a Home Office-type
question.</p><p><a name="06100910000106"></a><b><a name="06100910001392"></a>Earl
Howe:</b> My Lords, is the Minister aware that,
according to the Health Protection Agency, only 27 per cent
of those entering this country from places with a high prevalence of TB
are X-rayed at the port of entry, and that a third of all high-risk
entrants are not being referred for medical examination at all? Do the
Government consider that to be adequate, and what plans do they have to
ensure a more rigorous testing
programme?</p><p><a name="06100910000107"></a><b><a name="06100910001393"></a>Baroness

seriously and launched the TB action plan in 2004. The key strands were

well organised and co-ordinated patient services, first-class
laboratory services and effective disease control in the population
level. The expert workforce was a real issue. We are asking for a
greater degree of acuity and understanding on what would work in the
most effective way. The action plan is being energetically pursued. In
a short while, we hope to say what further steps can be
taken.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06100910000004"></a>North

Howell of Guildford:</b> My Lords, I beg leave to ask
a Question of which I have given private notice,
namely:</p><ul><a name="06100910000872"></a>What action Her
Majesty&#146;s Government have taken or propose urgently to take in
response to the nuclear test conducted by North
Korea.</ul><p><a name="06100910000109"></a><b><a name="06100910001395"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office
(Lord Triesman):</b> My Lords, in response to the
nuclear test, the Prime Minister issued the following Statement at 8.15
this morning:</p><ul><a name="06100910000635"></a>&#147;I condemn
this completely irresponsible act by the government of the DPRK
(Democratic People&#146;s Republic of Korea). The international
community has repeatedly urged them to refrain from both missile
testing and nuclear testing. This further act of defiance shows North
Korea&#146;s disregard for the concerns of its neighbours and the
wider international community and contravenes DPRK&#146;s commitments
under the Non-Proliferation Treaty and UN Security Council Resolution
1695&#148;.</ul><a name="06100910000622"></a>The UN Security
Council will meet later today in New York to discuss the international
response to the nuclear test, further to the council&#146;s
presidential statement of 6 October. We will work closely with our
partners in the Security Council to ensure a swift and robust
response.<p><a name="06100910000110"></a><b><a name="06100910001396"></a>Lord
Howell of Guildford:</b> My Lords, I am very grateful
to the Minister for repeating that Statement and commenting on the
words of his right honourable friend. Does he agree that it is
extremely important for the United Nations Security Council to decide
on firm and definite action? Is it not the case that there have been
endless deadlines and a great many carrots&#151;all kinds of
sweeteners&#151;offered to North Korea, all of which have been simply
ignored or turned down, and that all attempts to go along that route
seem to have come to a dead end? Should these new measures include not
only additional sanctions, which are clearly called for on top of
existing sanctions, but also the tightening up of the Proliferation
Security Initiative? That would help to limit North Korea&#146;s
weapons exports more effectively, which have been all too profligate in
the direction of Iran and other countries.</p><p><a name="06100910000111"></a>Finally, is it not immensely helpful that
Shinzo Abe, the new Japanese Prime Minister, who is this
country&#146;s very good friend, was in Beijing this weekend and
gained full Chinese support against

turning that Chinese support into positive proposals&#151;more than
rhetoric, but firm action&#151;to bring North Korea to its
senses?</p><p><a name="06100910000112"></a><b><a name="06100910001397"></a>Lord
Triesman:</b> My Lords, I also welcome the new
Japanese Prime Minister&#146;s visit to Peking. It was helpful in
ensuring that regional security issues rose to the top of the agenda,
as in the circumstances they should. The Security Council faces a
severe task. In my view, it has the following component parts: it must
try to get the same unanimity as it got on the presidential statement
on 6 October, because unanimity with China&#146;s involvement is
essential; it must try to get the unanimity that Security Council
Resolution 1695 achieved; and it must deal with the issues robustly.
That will probably require a very detailed discussion. However, I do
not think that anybody could doubt the anger expressed over the past 24
hours&#151;even more so in the past 12&#151;by the
Chinese Government, along with everyone else in the international
community. That leaves me feeling that the chances of unanimity on a
robust position are good.</p><p><a name="06100910000113"></a><b><a name="06100910001398"></a>Lord
Anderson of Swansea:</b> My Lords, is it not clear
that North Korea is prepared to defy international opinion and, for its
own reasons, to pay a very heavy political price? In the
Government&#146;s view, are there any sanctions or pressure points
that are likely to be effective, and what are the prospects of
achieving an international consensus to prevent the seepage of nuclear
materials to North Korea?</p><p><a name="06100910000114"></a><b><a name="06100910001399"></a>Lord
Triesman:</b> My Lords, as I have just said, a very
stringent approach will need to be taken in the new Security Council
discussion this afternoon and it is hard to prejudge all the elements
in the programme on which the council will find unanimity. However, the
economic sanctions introduced under Security Council Resolution 1695
had in themselves a stinging effect on the regime, not least because
they affected some people personally. I expect a fuller array of
sanctions on this occasion. I hope the House will forgive me if I do
not try to guess what all the parties to the discussion today will
bring to the table. I suspect that over the next few days we will have
an opportunity to consider it specifically.</p><p><a name="06100910000115"></a><b><a name="06100910001400"></a>The
Lord Bishop of Southwark:</b> My Lords, I noted the
Prime Minister&#146;s reference to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, although I believe that North Korea is no longer a signatory to
it. Will the Minister give an assurance that the British Government
will be equally scrupulous in attending to the terms of the treaty when
we come to consider the upgrading of
Trident?</p><p><a name="06100910000116"></a><b><a name="06100910001401"></a>Lord
Triesman:</b> My Lords, today I shall try to focus on
the affront caused by North Korea in the international community. As
the House knows, a thorough review on the United Kingdom&#146;s
position on Trident is to be published later.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_13"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 13</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06100910000117"></a>Article 10 of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty sets out specifically how states can withdraw
from it, because it is always within a state&#146;s power to do so.
We do not believe that North Korea has gone through the process at all.
I know that others in the international community believe that it may
have, but having looked at the papers this morning, I am clear that
nothing approximating full adherence to Article 10 has taken
place.</p><p><a name="06100910000118"></a><b><a name="06100910001402"></a>Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</b> My Lords, we should all
recognise that Britain cannot be a key player in any response to North
Korea and that our influence must be exerted through multilateral
channels, in what we hope may be a more coherent European approach to
China as the key external influence, and of course through the United
Nations. How satisfied is the Minister that the European relationship
with China, as a key player in the region, is becoming more coherent
and constructive, and is there full awareness of the political
importance of that
dialogue?</p><p><a name="06100910000119"></a><b><a name="06100910001403"></a>Lord
Triesman:</b> My Lords, I have absolutely no doubt of
the political importance of that dialogue. Obviously this could become
a kitchen with far too many cooks in it, and the bargaining strategy
has been to try to concentrate it around six parties. However, we do a
great deal of work with the European Union, which is an appropriate
channel for us. There is no doubt that the Union is working seriously
not only with China but also with other neighbours in the Korean
peninsula to ensure that there is a regional understanding of the need
for security. It is partly through those channels that I am so
confident in saying today to the House that the anger of all those
partners with whom both we and the European Union have been dealing is
acute.</p><p><a name="06100910000120"></a><b><a name="06100910001404"></a>Lord
Alton of Liverpool:</b> My Lords, I remind the House
of my non-financial interest as chairman of the All-Party British-North
Korea Group. In the 1990s some 2 million people died in North Korea as
a result of the violations which took place in that excessively
Stalinist regime. That should have concentrated the minds of the
country&#146;s leaders on tackling their domestic problems rather
than using nuclear weapons. Does the Minister not agree that to add to
the woes of the North Korean people by imposing through China, which
provides 80 per cent of the country&#146;s aid, anything that might
affect the food aid programme is not the way to proceed, and that what
is needed is a naval blockade around North Korea to prevent the seepage
of nuclear materials to other states which might use
them?</p><p><a name="06100910000121"></a><b><a name="06100910001405"></a>Lord
Triesman:</b> My Lords, perhaps I may take the
questions in reverse order. Of course we need to take every step to
ensure that nuclear materials do not get to other states or, indeed, to
none-state actors&#151;terrorist groups and others who might very
well exploit them. I do not believe that Her Majesty&#146;s
Government have any intention of trying to persuade people to inflict
further starvation on the people of North Korea. They are as much
victims of this as 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_14"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>anyone. We must use all our endeavours to ensure that we make progress
not only on the nuclear issue, and those of missile firing and testing,
but also on human rights. My right honourable friend Ian McCartney has
been telling the North Korean Government, day by day, week by week,
that these attacks on their own citizens are
intolerable.</p><p><a name="06100910000122"></a><b><a name="06100910001406"></a>Lord
Hamilton of Epsom:</b> My Lords, does the Minister
not agree that, historically, sanctions have not influenced the leaders
of recalcitrant countries such as North Korea but they have had a
massive impact on poor people, who then starve, as they have been doing
in North
Korea?</p><p><a name="06100910000123"></a><b><a name="06100910001407"></a>Lord
Triesman:</b> My Lords, that is a very fair point.
Let me emphasise one of the sanctions which I believe has caused acute
irritation to the ruling clique of what I regard as a regime bent on
what amount to lunatic methods of dealing with its international
neighbours: severe financial sanctions. I mention that because those
sanctions have had a personal impact on a group of people who
apparently live in great modesty but appear very concerned about
whether their cash is found in banks
overseas.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06100910000003"></a>Business</h3><p><a name="06100910000124"></a>3.16

noble Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of both the government amendment
and the amendment on the Marshalled List in the name of the noble
Baroness, Lady Anelay, is to reinforce the tripartite framework which
governs policing. We attach considerable importance to the tripartite
framework and have sought to reinforce it through the recent creation
of the National Policing Board, a development which has been welcomed
both by the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of
Police Authorities. The board underpins the position of the Home
Secretary, the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association
of Police Authorities, as well as the collective leadership of the
police service.</p><p><a name="06100910000134"></a>The noble
Baroness tabled an amendment in Committee which would have named the
Association of Chief Police Officers in the Bill in relation to a duty
to consult in respect of the National Policing Improvement Agency. In
responding, I indicated that we were sympathetic in principle but that
a number of questions needed to be resolved in relation to that
amendment. We undertook to explore the options of putting both the ACPO
and the APA on a statutory footing, together with relevant
stakeholders. ACPO has put to us that the Police Act 1996 does not
properly recognise the position of the association within the
tripartite framework. There are many references to the Secretary of
State but where the legislation refers to ACPO officers as the
professional leaders of the service it does so only indirectly. At
present, the 1996 Act and other legislation place a number of duties on
the Home Secretary to consult 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_16"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 16</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>persons whom he considers to represent the interests of chief officers
of police and persons whom he considers to represent the interests of
police authorities.</p><p><a name="06100910000135"></a>The
amendments will make it plain that such consultation should be with the
Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police
Authorities. As such, they will accord appropriate recognition to the
two associations and their place in the tripartite framework. While
both the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of
Police Authorities are long-established organisations, we need to guard
against the possibility that they might at some stage consider changing
their title. To accommodate such a possibility, Amendment No. 55
includes an order-making power which will enable the Government to
change the statutory references to either association to reflect any
new nomenclature.</p><p><a name="06100910000136"></a>For the
record, I emphasise that on any matters which affect the terms and
conditions of employment of chief officers, we will continue to consult
the Chief Police Officers&#146; Staff Association rather than the
Association of Chief Police Officers, which represents chief officers
on such matters.</p><p><a name="06100910000137"></a>I am grateful
to the noble Baroness for her part in drawing our attention to this
issue. I beg to move.</p><p><a name="06100910000138"></a><b><a name="06100910001412"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> My Lords, my Amendment No. 2
is grouped with Amendment No. 1. I thank the noble Baroness,
Lady Scotland, for having a meeting with me on 21 September, at which
it was possible to make significant progress on a number of matters.
There are two issues of principle on which our views continue to
diverge, and we will debate those later today and tomorrow. However, on
this issue we were at one.</p><p><a name="06100910000139"></a>I am
grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, for not only picking up my
point about consultation with ACPO but very properly approaching the
Association of Police Authorities to ensure that they also are
consultees named in the Bill. I support the Government&#146;s
amendment, particularly their order-making power in Amendment No. 55.
The Minister will know that I am not normally persuaded by order-making
powers, but this one is highly sensible to adapt to future
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06100910000140"></a>I shall not be
moving my Amendment No. 2 when it is called by the Lord Speaker. I
realise that we are under a significant amount of pressure regarding
time; I have therefore agreed that I will not move Amendments Nos. 4,
10 and 50. Amendment No. 10 is an odd one out: I tabled it so that the
House may hear first in that group of amendments from the Minister. I
am aware that on Report, if the Government are forced to speak last
when they hold the major hand of cards, it is not possible for the
House to cross-examine the Minister&#146;s position. This will enable
the Minister to open and then respond to any points.</p><p><a name="06100910000141"></a>On Amendment No. 4, I understand that the
Government are, in effect, on my side with regard to keeping the size

2.</ul><p><a name="06100910000153"></a>The noble Lord
said: My Lords, this amendment removes from the Bill the provision
which would place basic command units on a statutory footing. In
explaining why we are withdrawing this provision, it is perhaps worth
reminding the House why we included it in the first instance. There is
widespread agreement that agencies involved in tackling crime and
disorder can work best together if their boundaries are aligned. This
is particularly true in the case of basic command units and local
authorities, which are the two key pillars of crime and disorder
reduction partnerships and strategies. Most, if not all, chief
constables already recognise this, but it is open to any new chief
constable to alter BCU
boundaries.</p><p><a name="06100910000154"></a>Paragraphs 1 and 2
of Schedule 2, therefore, simply sought to enshrine in statute the
requirement for BCU and local authority boundaries to be aligned and
coterminous, and to place a duty on chief constables

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_18"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to consult key partners before altering BCU boundaries. It is
undoubtedly the case that other motives have been read into this
provision. In Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond,
talked of preparing BCUs for &#147;future developments&#148;,
including direct funding from central government. The noble Baroness,
Lady Anelay, expressed similar concerns, as has the Association of
Chief Police Officers and the APA, as they are entitled to
do.</p><p><a name="06100910000155"></a>I repeat that, in bringing
forward this provision, we are concerned solely with ensuring that BCUs
are coterminous with local authority boundaries to aid partnership
working on community safety issues. Happily, it is the case that the
police service shares that objective. A number of chief constables have
moved during the past year or so to review their BCU boundaries. I am
now aware of only six BCUs out of some 225 which are not coterminous
with local authorities, and in four of these cases, the discrepancy is
very minor.</p><p><a name="06100910000156"></a>As the situation on
the ground now largely reflects the outcome we were seeking, the
Government are ready to withdraw this provision from the Bill. My
ministerial colleague, the Minister for Policing, Security and
Community Safety, has, however, written to the Association of Chief
Police Officers to reinforce our expectation that the principle of
coterminosity will be observed, save where there are compelling reasons
for departing from this general rule.</p><p><a name="06100910000157"></a>We have a happy situation here where a
policy objective is shared; there is commitment to it; and, in large
measure, it is in place without the more rigorous hand of statute
imposing its print on the way in which policing operates. That happy
outcome enables me to move the amendment. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06100910000158"></a><b><a name="06100910001417"></a>Baroness

Courts Act
2003.&#148;&#148;</ul><p><a name="06100910000165"></a>The
noble Baroness said: My Lords, I hope that I can continue in the happy
frame in which we have started. I assure the House that we listened
very carefully to debates in Committee on the provisions of the Bill
that relate to membership of police authorities, and to the discussions
that we have had in the mean time, before Report. I appreciate the
concerns that have been so elegantly articulated about the need to
retain the core principles governing the composition of the police
authorities in primary legislation. The government amendments in this
group will restore much of the detail of these provisions on to the
face of the Police Act
1996.</p><p><a name="06100910000166"></a>The Bill
currently leaves the procedure for appointing the members of the police
authority entirely to regulations and, in particular, does not specify
who is responsible for appointing the councillor and independent
members. Having heard the arguments in this House and those put to us
by the Association of Police Authorities, in these amendments we seek
to strike a better balance between primary and secondary legislation.
It became clear in our debates that there was no difference between us
on this; it was simply a matter of how we were going to express our
comity in relation to this
area.</p><p><a name="06100910000167"></a>The amendments put into
primary legislation a provision to stipulate that councillor members
should be appointed by the councils from which they are drawn and that
independent members should be appointed by the existing membership of
the police authority from among the shortlist of candidates recommended
as suitable for appointment by a selection
panel.</p><p><a name="06100910000168"></a>I also understand the
concerns that several noble Lords have raised about the appointment of
the chair and vice-chairs to the police authority. Accordingly, the
amendments will now stipulate in the Police Act who should make these
appointments. The chair and vice-chair would, as now, be appointed by
the authority from among its members. Amendment No. 14, tabled by the
noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, is in similar vein. Other provisions
relating to these appointments, including eligibility for appointment
and the duration of such appointments, remuneration and allowances,
should rightly be left to
regulations.</p><p><a name="06100910000169"></a>I have also
listened closely to the heartfelt views expressed by many noble Lords
on retaining the separate category of magistrate members on police
authorities. I feel some confidence that that will give particular
pleasure to the noble Baroness opposite. As 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_22"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 22</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I said in Committee, I recognise the valuable skills and knowledge that
magistrates bring to authorities. We certainly did not want to lose
that entirely, so Amendment No. 11 provides that at least one of the
independent members of the police authority should be a magistrate. I
hope that Members on the Benches opposite will accept that as a
sensible compromise.</p><p><a name="06100910000170"></a>Finally,
the government amendments restore the existing Section 4 of the Police
Act, which provides for police authorities to have a standard
membership of 17. I recognise that the Bill could, hypothetically,
empower some future Home Secretary to create police authorities with a
membership of as few as three. That was never our intention. We will
retain, as now, a power to increase the size of individual police
authorities by regulations.</p><p><a name="06100910000171"></a>I
trust that the amendments I have tabled will give the House the
reassurance that many noble Lords have asked for. I am sorry that we
have not been able to make all the amendments that noble Lords have
sought, but I hope that the major amendments about which people were
most anxious have all been satisfied, and this wonderful atmosphere
that we are developing in debating this Bill can continue for a while
longer. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06100910000172"></a><b><a name="06100910001420"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> My Lords, we look forward
later on today to the Minister conceding on other matters and accepting
our principles with regard to issues on tripartite balance. The comity
could continue&#151;let us
see.</p><p><a name="06100910000173"></a>I shall speak to my
Amendments Nos. 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17 and the government amendments. As
the Minister said, we return to the concerns that we expressed in
Committee regarding the Government&#146;s intentions in shaping the
membership of police authorities. The Minister says that the new
amendments achieve a better balance between what goes into primary and
secondary legislation. We are prepared to accept the government
amendments, although not on the basis that we think that they are 100
per cent correct, because we would have preferred to retain the matters
in primary
legislation.</p><p><a name="06100910000174"></a>We
noted the report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee, which states at paragraph 20 that it considered it
inappropriate for the Bill to leave so much to subordinate legislation.
The committee drew attention to the fact that a police authority has a
key role to play in the delicate constitutional balance between the
Secretary of State, the police authority and the chief constable. The
composition of the authority is therefore more significant than that of
many other statutory
bodies.</p><p><a name="06100910000175"></a>However, we accept that
the Government have tabled amendments which meet most of our concerns.
As the noble Baroness anticipated, I am grateful to her that the
position of lay magistrates on the authority will be protected and that
at least one member should be a lay justice. I recognise the ability
and expertise that is brought to police authorities by lay magistrates.
I hope that in areas where it is appropriate more than one will be
appointed. The police authority should make that decision. In
particular, it is important that chairs and vice-chairs 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_23"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 23</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should not be appointed by the Secretary of State, or that he should
influence the matter. I welcome that
change.</p><p><a name="06100910000176"></a>I
certainly welcome the progress that has been made. I shall listen with
interest to what the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, says. His
proposals have the full support of the Association of Police
Authorities. I record my thanks to that association for coming to the
House during the Recess to brief me further on progress that might be
made on the Bill. I support the government amendments and will not
press
mine.</p><p><a name="06100910000177"></a><b><a name="06100910001421"></a>Baroness
Harris of Richmond:</b> My Lords, I, too, support
Amendment No. 10, which puts magistrates back in a separate category of
member, and Amendments Nos. 14 and 15, which concern electing chairs
and vice-chairs&#151;which has been dealt with by the
Government&#146;s amendment&#151;although, frankly, I prefer the
Conservative&#146;s amendment which deletes all regulation-making
powers.</p><p><a name="06100910000178"></a>I wish to speak briefly
to Amendments Nos. 11, 13, 19 and 20 in this large grouping. The
Government have conceded some of the provisions that we requested, such
as 17 members for most police authorities, but political balance is the
key to the way in which police authorities operate. It has kept them
free from party political control for many years, not to mention free
from control by extremist groups, single issue groups and so forth.
This means that the police, and particularly the chief officer, are not
controlled in a partisan way, whether political or otherwise, and
leaves him or her free to use best professional judgment. An approach
that did not guarantee political balance would mean that police
authorities were not properly representative of the communities they
serve. The measure must be written into primary legislation as an
underlying principle of the councillor membership of police authorities
or this balanced approach risks being
lost.</p><p><a name="06100910000179"></a>Amendment No. 20 addresses
the deputy chairs of the NPIA. The Bill proposes that in addition to
nominating the chair&#151;which I understand the NPIA somewhat
reluctantly accepts&#151;the Mayor of London can also nominate the
two vice-chairs of the body. The NPIA should be able to elect its own
vice-chairs, as do all other police authorities. If that were not the
case, it would be undemocratic. It is necessary to underpin local
accountability for policing with the police authority, as distinct from
the local authority. The two have different responsibilities and we
should not blur
them.</p><p><a name="06100910000180"></a><b><a name="06100910001422"></a>Viscount
Tenby:</b> My Lords, I hope that I shall contribute
to the wonderful atmosphere to which the Minister has referred by
thanking her for agreeing not to throw out the baby with the bath water
in getting rid of the magistrates&#146; representation on the new
authorities. They are a vital part of the mix. I am trying to choose my
words with care. To do away with them would be absolute folly.
Therefore, I am very grateful to the Minister, as I am sure are others.
I dare say that in some cases you could have more than one of the
relevant people, as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said. I again
thank the Minister.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_24"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06100910000181"></a><b><a name="06100910001423"></a>Lord
Harris of Haringey:</b> My Lords, I hesitate to
change the tone of some of the discussion that has taken place, but I
will do so in the nicest possible way. First, I apologise to my noble
friend for having missed the first few seconds of her remarks in
introducing her very welcome group of amendments. They are welcome as
regards what they say; my concern is about one or two things that they
leave out and where they have gone beyond what makes sense or beyond a
consensus that is emerging around those issues. I will speak to
Amendments Nos. 13, 19 and
20.</p><p><a name="06100910000182"></a>Amendments Nos. 13 and 19
make it a requirement that the local authority members of police
authorities and the GLA members of the Metropolitan Police authorities
should be selected so as to deliver a proportion of members broadly in
line with the political balance in the areas concerned. That is
important because it makes it an obligation on councils in nominating
members to police authorities. Currently, local government law requires
that an individual local authority making nominations to an external
body should do so in line with political balance, but it is not at all
clear that there is such a requirement where this is being done jointly
by a number of local authorities, particularly where there are
authorities with different levels of responsibility in that mix. That
is extremely important in the context of the operation of police
authorities.</p><p><a name="06100910000183"></a>Clearly, a great
deal of effort has been put in over the years to achieve a balanced
membership of police authorities, so that up until now elected members
have been in a majority of one over independent and magistrate members.
That provides a democratic legitimacy to what is being done but with
room for a range of other experience and backgrounds to be represented
as well. The principle that councillor members should reflect the
political balance of the area that the police authority covers is
important because it emphasises that democratic link, but it also
ensure that the full range of political views in an area is
represented.</p><p><a name="06100910000184"></a>I put it to your
Lordships that if there were an area where most of the local councils
were led by one political party rather than another, a committee of
those authorities would automatically send to the police authority
representation solely of that political party. There might be a
circumstance in which a political party led by one seat in each of the
councils, but the nature of bringing them together in a joint committee
and inviting them to nominate could, without this amendment, lead to a
single party dominating the situation. The removal of the provision for
a majority of one&#151;we talk simply about a majority, for reasons
that we all understand&#151;could lead to the domination of a police
authority by one political party.</p>

<p><a name="06100910000185"></a>I suppose that, like the political
Members of your Lordships&#146; House, if it was our political party
in that dominant position we might think that that would be absolutely
fine and dandy, but I rather suspect that the reality would be much
more complicated. It seems to me that ensuring such a balance is a way
of ensuring that decisions about policing are achieved by cross-party
consensus in the areas concerned. It has 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_25"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 25</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been the reality that police authorities around the country have
operated in a consensual fashion on most of the issues with which they
have had to contend. That does not mean that there have not been
political arguments or arguments about matters affecting policing, but
those arguments have tended not to be along party political lines,
except on very specific matters. We are in danger of creating a
situation where police authorities as a whole would be attacked on
political grounds by people from other political parties who had been
unfairly excluded from the process or had had reduced representation
because there would not be the requirement for political
balance.</p><p><a name="06100910000186"></a>If
we want, as I am sure all your Lordships do, a fair and impartial
service that is seen to be fair and impartial and one that is not
influenced by the political concerns of one political party or another,
it is important that that principle is written into primary
legislation. I would have thought that my amendments would enable that
to happen and would ensure that the political membership of police
authorities was balanced across the area concerned. Those are my
reasons for tabling Amendments Nos. 13 and
19.</p><h5><a name="06100910000843"></a>3.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06100910000187"></a>Amendment No. 20 looks at the
unique position of the Metropolitan Police Authority. I declare a
current interest in that I remain a member of that authority. Indeed, I
am grateful to my noble friend for reinforcing the position under which
I hold a mandate to sit on that authority by ensuring that that mandate
is contained within the Bill and that I am the Home Office nominee to
the police authority in
London.</p><p><a name="06100910000188"></a>In London, following
consultations conducted by the government office over the past year, it
has been decided that the chair of the police authority should be
appointed by the Mayor of London. A broad consensus has emerged and the
formulation contained in the Bill on that matter is probably the best
statement that one can have: that the Mayor can chose to appoint
himself, or herself, to the police authority, in which case he should
chair the authority. That is a sensible arrangement should the Mayor,
whoever that might be, want to be seen to be taking the lead role on
policing. But if the Mayor chose not to appoint himself to that office,
he would choose from among the members of the police authority. The
inclusion of that provision is welcome and there has been some
discussion about that.</p><p><a name="06100910000189"></a>But
nowhere previously has there been any discussion about the Mayor of
London appointing the vice-chairs of the police authority&#151;and I
am not sure where that suggestion has come from. It does not seem to
have emanated from the Mayor&#146;s office or from New Scotland Yard;
and I can assure noble Lords, given my discussions in the past week,
that it has not emanated from the Metropolitan Police Authority. It may
be that some over-worked civil servant, desperate to prepare the
amendments in time for consideration by your Lordships&#146; House,
has simply read across from one bit of legislation to another. After
all, these things do not happen in such a slapdash and inconsequential
way, but there seems 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_26"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to be some strange read-across regarding this. We want to avoid a
situation in which the other members of the police authority feel
alienated from the Mayor of London. There may be an acceptance that the
Mayor should chair the police authority, or should appoint the chair,
but it would seem a step too far to state that the main officers of the
police authority should be mayoral appointments, even if they are
members of the police authority.</p><p><a name="06100910000190"></a>Perhaps my noble
friend might take this away. There are several days before we need to
consider this Bill at Third Reading and there will be ample opportunity
to put this matter right. I am not sure that such a proposal was the
original intention and it was certainly not discussed during the
earlier phases of consultation.</p><p><a name="06100910000191"></a><b><a name="06100910001424"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I hope that I will
be able to reassure my noble friend Lord Harris that comity can
prevail. I thank the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, for his thanks,
because I know how anxious he has been on behalf of magistrates. It has
given me considerable pleasure to give him a little pleasure in
relation to this matter.</p><p><a name="06100910000192"></a>My
noble friend Lord Harris&#146; amendment to place the principle of
political proportionality in the Bill is important. In deciding what to
place in the Bill and what to leave to secondary legislation, we have
had carefully to balance the need to protect the constitutional
position of police authorities against the need to increase the
flexibility of the legislation. We feel that we have struck the right
balance with these amendments. However, I accept that the principle of
political proportionality is important and my noble friend&#146;s
comments graphically illustrated why. That principle was also conceded
by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris. I make no comment about their two
names, but they always appear to act in unison in relation to these
matters. I am happy to give an undertaking that it will form part of
the regulations that the Government intend to table under this
provision because I understand the anxiety about them.</p><p><a name="06100910000193"></a>I shall also respond to my noble
friend&#146;s amendment in relation to the appointment of the
vice-chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority and explain how this
came about. As my noble friend identified, Amendment No. 18 enables the
Mayor of London to appoint the chairman and the vice-chairman of the
authority. My noble friend&#146;s amendment gives the power in
relation to the vice-chairman to the authority itself. It is our view
that, as a vice-chairman is empowered to act as chair in the absence of
the chairman, it is logical for that position to be appointed in the
same way. That will bring the authority into line with other Greater
London Authority functional
bodies.</p><p><a name="06100910000194"></a>I hope that, in the
light of the movement that the Government have made on the other
issues, my noble

hesitate to suggest that my noble friend would not appreciate the

view, and I hope my noble friend will be able to accept it as an
appropriate accommodation. I understand if he wishes to talk further,

Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 24 tackles another aspect of the
Secretary of State&#146;s powers to supervise police authorities. Yet
again, the Government are trying to move matters from primary
legislation to secondary legislation. This amendment removes two
paragraphs from Schedule 2. Paragraph 9 adds to the general functions
of a police authority that are set out in Section 6 of the Police Act
1996. The primary duty under existing legislation is to secure an
efficient and effective police force for the police authority&#146;s
area. The change introduced in paragraph 9 makes clear that it is the
job of police authorities to hold the chief officer of police to
account in the exercise of his functions and those of persons under his
control and direction. The change has been welcomed by the Association
of Police Authorities, but ACPO is concerned about it. Its view is that
this new provision, when taken together with other changes currently
taking place to the way in which the personal performance of chief 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_30"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 30</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>officers is assessed, will create a linear relationship between police
authorities and chief officers. They are also concerned about moving to
secondary legislation the provisions relating to policy
plans.</p><p><a name="06100910000208"></a>When
the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, responded to the debate in Committee, at
col. 703 of <I>Hansard</I>, he said that the Government were prepared
to look at this issue in particular in time for Report. I tabled the
amendment to ask the Government whether they have used the past three
months since Committee to consult ACPO further on these matters, and,
if so, what the response has been. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06100910000209"></a><b><a name="06100910001431"></a>The

Harris of Haringey:</b> My Lords, I shall speak to
Amendment No. 25 in my name and, in doing so, shall comment on the
points that have just been made by the noble Baroness in respect of
Amendment No. 24.</p><p><a name="06100910000211"></a>If
you believe in the principle that police authorities should be able to
set the strategic direction of police forces, part of that should be
about being able to hold the chief officer of police to account for the
exercise of those functions. If you do not have that provision,
essentially you are saying that chief officers of police are not
accountable and that there is no transparency in the way in which they
choose to exercise their functions. That is very different from saying
that the police authority &#147;shall instruct&#148; or
&#147;will require&#148; a police chief to operate in a particular
way. It is saying that chief officers of police will be accountable for
the decisions that they have made. Most of the chief officers of police
that I have accounted for have usually been more than capable of giving
an account of themselves and explaining the reasons for the actions
that they took, but it is important that under the legislation they are
required to do so and that they do so publicly and transparently. That
is why I believe that Amendment No. 24 is not entirely
helpful.</p><p><a name="06100910000212"></a>Perhaps unlike the
amendments that I put forward earlier, Amendment No. 25 is intended to
be entirely helpful towards the Government, as ever. Here, I am seeking
to place in the Bill a requirement&#151;meaning that it is something
that police authorities will have to take very seriously&#151;for
police forces and authorities to work together wherever necessary or
expedient. It is important that police authorities ensure that their
forces co-operate with other forces and their partners; that should be
something that police authorities do. But I believe that, by stating it
explicitly in the Bill, one gives it particular force and it will
ensure that we see authorities working together better than has been
the experience in the past.</p><p><a name="06100910000213"></a>I
note that when my right honourable friend the Home Secretary withdrew
from some of the proposals to create strategic police forces and put
them into the long grass&#151;I am sure that he used a more elegant
phrase than that&#151;he said very clearly that there was an
expectation that there would be better collaboration and working
together between

level 2 crime and the sorts of strategic issues that have been of
concern but on other matters&#151;for example, in trying to reduce
back-office and joint procurement costs and so on. My amendment would
provide a framework essentially requiring police authorities and police
forces to work together. I believe that that is in the spirit of what
the Government have been seeking to do, perhaps by going slower on the
question of police service mergers, and it would be helpful to the
objectives that my right honourable friend has set out. Therefore, I
hope that my noble friend will feel able to support the amendment in my
name.</p><h5><a name="06100910000844"></a>4
pm</h5><p><a name="06100910000214"></a><b><a name="06100910001433"></a>Baroness
Harris of Richmond:</b> My Lords, I very much regret
that these Benches cannot support Amendment No. 24 as it would remove
the part of the Bill that refers to a key police authority
function&#151;that of holding the chief officer to account for the
exercise of his or her functions, as the noble Lord, Lord Harris of
Haringey, said. I simply do not know what a police authority does if it
does not do that. What is a police authority for? It should therefore
be in primary legislation.</p><p><a name="06100910000215"></a>I am
aware, of course, that ACPO is concerned about this and refers to the
creation of the linear relationship, but in some senses it has that
already, in that the police authority appoints those of ACPO rank.
However, I assume that it is concerned about its operational
independence, but we do not believe that the amendment interferes with
that at all. Holding a chief officer to account for the delivery of his
or her functions is about asking for an account after those functions
have been carried out. It is not a mechanism that would allow anyone to
direct a chief officer before something happened on how, where, why, or
against whom he or she should take action. That is a misunderstanding
of the meaning of holding to account.</p><p><a name="06100910000216"></a>I regret that we could not support
Amendment No. 24. However, we support entirely Amendment No.
25, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Harris. It places a duty on police
authorities in primary legislation to ensure that their forces
co-operate with other forces and partners. This is very important in
the post-merger landscape, where the focus is now going to be on
increased collaboration between forces to deal with protective
services&#151;the area that we are all very concerned about. Section
23 of the 1996 Act allows chief constables to act jointly in more
effectively carrying out force functions, but it seems to allow police
authorities to act jointly only in terms of back-office functions. In
addition, the over-arching function of a police authority is to secure
an effective and efficient police service for its area, which seems to
place a limitation on considering the wider good to policing to be had
from co-operation.</p><p><a name="06100910000217"></a>For those
reasons it is extremely important to put something in primary
legislation that places a duty on police authorities to consider the
wider landscape and enables police authorities to ensure that wider

specific governance powers to exercise oversight of force activity for
those protective services. If not, it is easy for chief officers to
circumvent authorities and come to their own arrangements with other
forces. This means that they cannot be held properly to account for
those functions by the police authority. That makes it sufficiently
important to be in primary
legislation.</p><p><a name="06100910000218"></a><b><a name="06100910001434"></a>Lord

your Lordships&#146; notice that we have tabled amendments to
paragraph 11 of Schedule 2, which deals with the policing plans. That
set of amendments return some of the detail on the functions of police
authorities into primary legislation, which we shall come to in due
course. I recognise the importance of preserving key principles in
primary legislation, and we have made that plain previously. The
primary police authority functions of maintaining an efficient and
effective police force and holding the chief officer to account for the
way in which he or she discharges his or her functions will remain in
the Police Act 1996.</p><p><a name="06100910000220"></a>In
amendments to come we are also restoring to the 1996 legislation the
functions relating to the issuing of policing plans. It is entirely
appropriate therefore that, having set out in primary legislation the
core functions of police authorities, there should be some flexibility
to add other functions by secondary legislation.</p><p><a name="06100910000221"></a>Amendment No. 24, tabled by the noble
Baroness, Lady Anelay, would remove the new order-making power inserted
by paragraph 10 of Schedule 2. It would also remove paragraph 9 of
Schedule 2, which includes the new function of holding the chief
officer to account. These new functions, as we have heard this
afternoon from the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, have been welcomed by
the Association of Police Authorities&#151;rightly and understandably
so. Indeed, the association offered them up as propositions. I cannot
believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, really wishes to deny
police authorities that enhanced role, which would be the effect of her
amendment. I have listened carefully to the important rhetoric of new
localism from all parts of your Lordships&#146; House. If we were to
go down the route of the noble Baroness, we would fundamentally
undermine that.</p><p><a name="06100910000222"></a>The noble Lord,
Lord Harris of Haringey, described his Amendment No. 25 as helpful, and
I see the measure of help therein. I understand his argument to include
a duty in the Police Act on police authorities to secure arrangements
for their police forces to co-operate with other forces whenever
necessary or expedient. We are certainly in the same policy ballpark,
and operating with a similar intent. It would be hard for me to
disagree with the sentiments behind this amendment, given that he has
lifted the wording from new Section 6ZA(2)(b) of the 1996 Act.

of mergers&#151;the noble Lord said they had been kicked into the
long grass; one might say that they have been placed in deep
freeze&#151;that forces co-operate more effectively to narrow the
protective services gap and secure greater efficiencies in the
provision of back-office functions. While I wholly endorse what my
noble friend seeks to achieve&#151;we have a similar view&#151;our
intention is to use the new order-making power in new Section 6ZA to
confer such functions on police authorities. It is perhaps worth
reiterating that the Delegated Powers Committee had no difficulty with
that order-making power.</p><p><a name="06100910000224"></a>I ask
my noble friend not to press his amendment on the basis that we seek
the same end&#151;a shared policy objective&#151;albeit that the
Bill takes a slightly different path to the one he proposes. I hope
that noble Lords will take some encouragement from those
comments.</p><p><a name="06100910000225"></a><b><a name="06100910001435"></a>Lord
Harris of Haringey:</b> My Lords, is the Minister
therefore saying that he will introduce this power explicitly under

question of the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey. We might consider
that further.</p><p><a name="06100910000228"></a>I shall deal
first with the Minister&#146;s response to my Amendment No. 24. I
have always made it clear that it was tabled so that ACPO might have an
opportunity for a response. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Harris of
Haringey, and the noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond, that it is
vital that we have local accountability&#151;the thrust of the
Bill&#151;whereas we all agree that there should be no interference
with operational matters. We will return to that in a later
debate.</p><p><a name="06100910000229"></a>I am interested in the
amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey. It was tabled in
exactly the right spirit: post the Government&#146;s haste in seeking
to force mergers, we must look at the new policing landscape which will
obtain. It is important to see how to improve collaboration,
particularly on protective services and strategic services overall. I
should perhaps now declare an interest, or my thanks, to my own police
in Surrey. This summer, they asked if I would like to see one of the
strategic services in operation, and I went along to Fairoaks where the
Surrey police helicopter is based. Of course, one never knows if the
helicopter is going to be called into service; whether it was fortunate
for the people of Surrey or not, it was fortunate for me that it was. I
was therefore able to observe the remarkable service they provide to
Surrey at close quarters, and how they co-operate with other police
forces. We shall need to consider how that is best delivered in the
months and, I hope, years to come&#151;if the Government do not press
ahead with forced mergers until the next Prime Minister calls an
election.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_34"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 34</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06100910000230"></a>It was never my intent to press this

and Young People: Care</h3><h5><a name="06100910000845"></a>4.10
pm</h5><p><a name="06100910000234"></a><b><a name="06100910001439"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and
Skills (Lord Adonis):</b> My Lords, with the leave of
the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my
right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and
Skills. The Statement is as follows:</p>
&#147;With permission, I would like to
make a Statement on the children in care Green Paper that I have
published today, copies of which have been placed in the House of
Commons Library.&#147;Mr
Speaker, at the heart of this Green Paper is one simple presumption:
that the aspirations of the state for children in care should match
those which each individual parent has for their own
children.&#147;Members of
this House recognise this moral imperative, and I would like to pay
tribute to the associate parliamentary group for children in and
leaving care and to my honourable friend the Member for Stafford for
highlighting many of the issues which this Green Paper seeks to
resolve.&#147;They have
pointed out vociferously that this area has received too little
attention for too long. We know the depressing statistics: children in
care are five times less likely to achieve five good GCSEs and nine
times more likely to get expelled from school. Indeed, one quarter of
people in prison today have spent some time in our care
system. &#147;The
Government have introduced a number of measures to address the complex
problems of children in care. Since 1997, we have invested almost a
billion pounds into the quality protects initiative to improve outcomes
for children in care. We have taken steps to encourage adoption instead
of care. And we have put a duty on local authorities to improve
educational outcomes for this specific group of children. But this has
clearly not been
enough.&#147;Today&#146;s
Green Paper builds on these efforts and the implementation of <I>Every
Child Matters</I>, which for the first time provides the infrastructure
to deal with this issue in a co-ordinated way.
&#147;The first priority must be to
prevent children from slipping into care where there are family
alternatives. We must take effective pre-emptive and preventive action
so that no child is sucked into the system by default. If there is a
chance that a child could be restored to a healing family environment,
we must seize it. We will trial a new 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_35"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 35</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>kind of intensive family therapy which will address the parents&#146;
problems, making sure that children are more than just helpless
bystanders. It will seek to get to the heart of the domestic problem,
tackling the most difficult situations of abuse, neglect or violence
with a mix of conciliation and targeted care. To raise our knowledge of
what works in this new area, we will create a national centre of
excellence to share experience and
knowledge.&#147;Secondly,
the care system must act more like a traditional loving family, with
all the extra responsibility this implies. Just because a child is in
care does not mean that he should be deprived of the emotional support
and development which most children can rely on. The state must ensure
that children are always in the best hands, constantly supported, with
continuous guidance and motivation investing in their futures and
shaping their
decisions.&#147;The care
profession already comprises many dedicated, experienced professionals,
but we need to ensure that all carers reach the standard of the best.
We will begin a round of specially tailored recruitment campaigns. We
will also take steps to match foster carers with children more
intelligently, fitting the complex needs of the child with the
specialised skills of the carer.
&#147;A new tiered framework of
qualifications, payments and standards will be used to steer these
difficult decisions. By taking more trouble to get it right first time,
we will avoid children being bounced from placement to placement, which
is so damaging to them personally and disruptive to their
studies.&#147;Thirdly, we
must ensure that children in care receive an excellent education.
Results have steadily improved for children in care, but, still today,
nine out of 10 do not achieve five good GCSEs. In order to ensure that
they benefit from access to sport, music and drama, which instil
cultural values and equip them with social capital, we will encourage
local authorities to open their sports centres and leisure clubs to
children in care free of charge. Social workers will receive individual
budgets to spend on the personal needs of the child, so that they have
flexibility to find money quickly when a child needs extra support,
such as speech or language
therapy.&#147;We will
appoint a new virtual head-teacher in every area with over-arching
responsibility for driving up results among local children in care. We
will guarantee catch-up lessons. With the passage of the Education and
Inspections Bill, we will also require schools to take in children in
care even if the school is full, so that children are elevated to the
best schools, not dumped in the worst.
&#147;We will do more to prevent
children in care being excluded. Nothing is more damaging to a
child&#146;s chances of success than moving school after they have
made their GCSE choices. Children who change school after year 10 drop
around one and a half grades per subject: so eight C grades become 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_36"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>four Ds and four Es. We will therefore create a presumption that
children in care will not move schools in years 10 and
11.&#147;When children have
to move home, we will do all that we can to avoid them moving school as
well. We have proposed that in such circumstances, children in care
will get free transport to their existing school, rather than move to a
new one. &#147;Fourthly, we
need to ensure that children who leave care do so in a measured way.
Too often, children in care feel that the system spits them out on
their 16th birthday, and only 6 per cent make it to university,
compared with 38 per cent of their peer group. We must ensure that
children get a soft landing when they leave the system, particularly
during those crucial years when decisions are made about their
future. &#147;We will give
every child in care a right to decide when they leave the system and
the chance to stay with their foster families up to the age of
21&#151;or longer still, if they are continuing in education. We will
establish a new &#163;2,000 bursary to encourage them to attend
university. We will also put an extra &#163;100 into their child
trust funds for every year they are in
care.&#147;Parenting is a
weighty responsibility and institutions need to be held accountable,
just as individuals would be. Every local authority will be subject to
regular inspections by Ofsted. They will also be encouraged to set up
children in care councils, so that the voices of these children are
properly heard. My department will make it a specific priority to
improve the academic performance of children in care, and Ministers
will hold an annual stock-take.
&#147;Too often, decisions about
children in care are taken without listening to those with most at
stake: the children themselves. For this Green Paper, we will ensure
that our consultation stretches right into children&#146;s homes to
connect with people who have been through the
system.&#147;This is a
Green Paper with as many ideas as prescriptions. We recognise that
during open consultation, many further ideas will emerge, particularly
from those who have been in care and the dedicated professionals who
work in this area day in and day out. They are not to blame for the
collective failure that this report highlights: we are. We need to
provide a more co-ordinated approach to these entrenched issues,
ensuring that our care system is focused less on systems and more on
care. These children are our responsibility. We cannot continue to fail
them.&#148;<p><a name="06100910000235"></a>My Lords, that
concludes the Statement.</p><h5><a name="06100910000846"></a>4.18
pm</h5><p><a name="06100910000236"></a><b><a name="06100910001440"></a>Baroness
Morris of Bolton:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister
for repeating the Statement made earlier by the Secretary of State in
the other place and for giving us the opportunity to comment on an
issue that is much discussed and is such a priority in your Lordships'
House.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_37"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06100910000237"></a>The care of children in the guardianship
of the state has been a shameful side of the welfare system for far too
long. As the Minister said, we have the depressing shopping list of
familiar statistics. Half of all children in care are failing to
achieve a single qualification in school, with only six in 100 making
it to university. They are far more likely&#151;indeed, five times
more likely&#151;to have a diagnosable mental illness and almost one
third will not have received their basic inoculations. The tale of woe
of far too many children in care ending up in prison or turning to
drugs and prostitution is a depressing indictment of the role of the
state as a parent in the world&#146;s fifth largest economy. It has
taken 10 years of deteriorating outcomes for these vulnerable children
for this Green Paper to be produced, so we very much welcome
it.</p><p><a name="06100910000238"></a>The Government say that
their first priority is preventing children slipping into care,
especially where there are family alternatives. We have long been an
advocate of the state supporting parents and families to stay together.
Intervention at an early stage to support and guide is welcome, but not
in the way envisaged by the Prime Minister in his speech on 5
September, which would see more children condemned to a life in care.
We are told that the Government will trial a new kind of intensive
family treatment. May I suggest that there are already excellent models
of such practice right here, right
now?</p><p><a name="06100910000239"></a>In earlier debates, I
mentioned the pioneering work of Kent County Council, which has
invested enormously in helping families stay together by placing
children with members of their extended family if possible. Only when
all that fails does it consider taking the child into care. When it
does so, there is a strong presumption towards adoption. As a
consequence, it saves money on its care budget and has money to put
back into early support and prevention, so creating a virtuous circle.
None of this will work, however, unless we support, value and empower
social workers and so get away from the view of them as child-snatchers
and re-energise their profession to work proactively in support of
families. </p><p><a name="06100910000240"></a>However well early
support and intervention works, there will always be children for whom
the state is a refuge, and the state must be the very best parent that
it can be. When your world falls apart, the last thing you want is to
be removed from all that is loved and familiar. Too many children are
moved too often, and too many are moved too far away from all they have
known. This is potentially damaging, not least to the healthy
attachment of babies and very young children. And how can their key or
responsible social worker keep a proper watching brief if they are
living hundreds of miles away? The role that the responsible social
worker plays is vital. They should assume the role of the pushy parent:
standing up for the best interests of that child, challenging
mediocrity and refusing to accept inappropriate decisions. We welcome
the commitment to extend care provision from 16 to 18, and we also
welcome the additional financial and educational support for people
leaving 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_38"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 38</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>care. We should never again have to witness a child leaving care with
all their worldly belongings in a black bin
liner.</p><p><a name="06100910000241"></a>It is good that children
in care will no longer simply be dumped in the worst schools, but going
to the best schools will not be the answer if children are moved from
area to area. What will be done to keep children closer to home? As
part of this, will the Government be looking at an enhanced package of
support for foster carers? Will the Minister also tell us what is being
done to strengthen the social-worker workforce, which, as I said
earlier, is currently undervalued, demoralised and under-resourced?
Will the Government be looking at what happens in other countries, such
as the highly trained social-worker pedagogue workforce in Finland and
Denmark? In all this, there is the voice of the child. But it is not
enough simply to listen: the most important part of listening is
demonstrating that you have heard. The Secretary of State is right when
he says that we should expect no less for children in the care of the
state than we would for our own children, and when the Government
advance proposals to achieve this, we will support
them.</p><h5><a name="06100910000847"></a>4.24
pm</h5><p><a name="06100910000242"></a><b><a name="06100910001441"></a>Baroness
Walmsley:</b> I, too, thank the Minister for
repeating the Statement. I am not going to bash the Government: that
has just been done extremely effectively. The Government quite rightly
are bashing themselves, and I am very pleased to hear that they have
taken on board the fact that nowhere near enough has been done and that
they have shown the commitment that we have heard this afternoon to do
something about it. I very much welcome
that.</p><p><a name="06100910000243"></a>The most disadvantaged
children of all are those in care. To be deprived of living with your
family is the most catastrophic thing that can happen to any child,
whatever the reason. I therefore very much welcome the
Government&#146;s first priority to prevent children slipping into
care where there are family alternatives. However, will that mean
increased funding for kinship care, which can be one of the most
effective and cost-effective alternatives to children living with their
parents?</p><p><a name="06100910000244"></a>I welcome the
commitment to intensive family therapy, but will there be adequate
resources? Will attention be given to early intervention in order to
avoid some of the misery that families go through when they are not
coping with their children? Will health visitors be involved? They
provide a trusted and universal service, have no stigma attached to
them and are very capable of delivering some of this intensive family
therapy. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether they are involved. I
also welcome the specially tailored recruitment campaign and the
greater efforts to match foster carers to children so that they will
not be bounced around. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton,
I am concerned that improved training packages should be offered to
foster carers. They can deal with very difficult children. There is a
great turnover of social workers: their recruitment and retention is
also very important. In addition, is the Minister able to reassure us
that in 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_39"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 39</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>future no happy and thriving child in a good foster home will be moved
against his will for financial reasons? Today, I heard of a situation
in Lincolnshire where that apparently is about to happen. It seems that
no one has asked the child.</p><p><a name="06100910000245"></a>A
good education can be the lever for a child to lift himself above his
disadvantage in losing his family. Again, I welcome some of the noble
Lord&#146;s proposals; for example, encouraging local authorities to
open sports centres and so on to these young people. But from where
will these children get the money? How will local authorities ensure
that no stigma is attached to children who use these services for free?
I also welcome the individual budgets to be given to social workers,
which could be very flexible. Will that money be owned by individual
children or will it be one big pot? If so, how will social workers be
accountable for funding
decisions?</p><p><a name="06100910000246"></a>The Minister
mentioned proposals that will require funding: for example, catch-up
lessons, the prevention of children in care being excluded and full
schools being forced to take another child will need resources. Will
adequate resources be supplied? The money should follow the child. On
these Benches we call that the &#147;pupil premium&#148;, which
should go to all children with special needs, and this is the most
special need of all. Such an arrangement would encourage schools to
take such children, rather than seeking not to take them. Free
transport to enable children to stay at a school, even when
unfortunately they have to change their placement, is a good idea.
However, the biggest lack of access for many of these children is
access to the internet. I was very disappointed that the Minister was
not able to announce that every child in public care will have a
computer and access to a broadband connection. That would be one of the
best things that the Government could do to improve educational
opportunities for these children.</p><p><a name="06100910000247"></a>Like the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of
Bolton, I was delighted to hear that the Government will listen to
children more. The Minister mentioned children&#146;s homes. Will
there be consultation with individual children in individual foster
home placements? And what about children in prison; will they be
consulted? Unfortunately, many of them land up in prison because they
were originally in care and no one really looked after them. Like my
noble friends and others speaking on the Front Benches today, I too
think that children should not be in prison at all, but if they are, at
the very least we should listen to them to find out whether it had
anything to do with the fact that they were in care and what went
wrong.</p><p><a name="06100910000248"></a>The Minister has said
much that is positive and we will certainly support the Government. But
what is very crucial is the amount of money put behind the various
promises, so we need some reassurance on
that.</p><h5><a name="06100910000848"></a>4.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06100910000249"></a><b><a name="06100910001442"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, I welcome the extremely
constructive responses of the noble Baronesses, Lady Morris and Lady
Walmsley, to the Statement. As it made clear, we accept that there is a
huge amount 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_40"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 40</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more to do; the Government&#146;s response is in no way complacent.
Indeed, no one who looks at the shocking statistics that I relayed,
which are set out in the Green Paper, could afford to take pride in the
current situation.</p><p><a name="06100910000250"></a>The noble
Baroness, Lady Morris, said that the position is deteriorating, but I
am glad to say that it is actually moving in the right direction,
although it is not moving fast enough. Outcomes for the 60,000 children
in care at any one time have improved in recent years. The proportion
gaining five or more GCSEs rose from 7 per cent in 2000 to 11 per cent
in 2005. That is still a pitiful figure, but it represents a greater
than 50 per cent increase over only six years in the proportion of
children in care getting five or more good GCSEs. Moreover, the
proportion known to be participating in education, employment or
training at the age of 19 has increased by 8 per cent since 2002 when
the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 came into effect. So while
policies are making some impact, we need to see a dramatically improved
rate of progress.</p><p><a name="06100910000251"></a>Many schools
have an outstanding record in dealing with children in care, including
schools with boarding accommodation. One of the possibilities raised in
the Green Paper is that of extending the use of boarding accommodation
for children in care where that would be appropriate to their
circumstances and schools are prepared to take it on. There are also
areas of excellent practice which we want to examine more closely and
learn from. For example, the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, referred to
the much higher level of social worker pedagogy and the more highly
trained workforces in Finland and Denmark. My right honourable friend
the Minister for Children has been studying that closely. The Green
Paper makes a proposal to set up social care practices, enabling social
workers to group together in much the same way as GPs so that they can
operate quasi-independently of the local authority. We believe that
that has the potential to raise quality and stability and to reduce the
level of bureaucracy which at present can be so stifling to the role of
social workers. So there is plenty of good practice both nationally and
internationally, but the issue is to learn from it and then to apply it
systematically. That is what we seek to do in all the ways set out in
the Green Paper, and I am sure that there are other examples of good
practice that we should take into account. That is why we have produced
a Green Paper and we welcome all responses to it, including those from
noble Lords.</p><p><a name="06100910000252"></a>The noble Baroness,
Lady Walmsley, is always on my case when it comes to resources, and she
is right to be so. As we were told by the Bard,</p><ul><a name="06100910000690"></a>&#147;Nothing will come of
nothing&#148;,</ul><a name="06100910000623"></a>and many of
these policies are expensive. However, I have noted the words of Martin
Narey, the chief executive of Barnardo&#146;s and one of the most
respected figures in this field. It has been announced in the Green
Paper that he will conduct a review of the future of the concept of
care and how we see it developing over the next generation. On the
&#147;Today&#148; programme this morning, he said: 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_41"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 41</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="06100910000691"></a>&#147;This is one of those rare things
that I&#146;ve come across in public life where we don&#146;t think
that what is needed here is more money. We spend nearly &#163;2
billion on children in care&#151;that&#146;s about a quarter of a
million for each child&#151;and we do a pretty bad
job&#148;.</ul><a name="06100910000624"></a>Martin
Narey speaks with the experience of being the chief executive of
Barnardo&#146;s and before that the director general of the Prison
Service, so he knows what he is talking about. Indeed, the amount of
money spent specifically on children in care has risen very
substantially in recent years. It is now &#163;1.9 billion, which is
a 50 per cent increase in barely six years. So the proportion of
funding available for children in care has risen
substantially. <p><a name="06100910000625"></a>A
comprehensive spending review will take place next year and the
particular impact of the proposals set out in the Green Paper will be
carefully examined in the call for additional resources over and above
what we spend at the moment. But, as those of us who have looked at
what takes place in children&#146;s homes, with social workers and in
schools recognise, if we get the policies right and are particularly
successful at early identification&#151;an issue that both noble
Baronesses highlighted in their remarks&#151;the expenditure over
time is likely to be less and not more, and massively less if we avoid
the terribly poor outcomes for children in care that lead them into the
custody system, which has the highest level of expense of
all.</p><p><a name="06100910000253"></a>So the more successful we
are at early intervention, early placements, the intensive therapy
referred to in the Green Paper and the initiatives that the noble
Baroness, Lady Morris, rightly raised in respect of the more innovative
and successful local authorities in this area, such as Kent&#151;for
example, the placing of children with extended families&#151;the less
call on public resources there is likely to be over time.</p><p><a name="06100910000254"></a>Stability in schooling is a vital part of
that because the more stable a child&#146;s schooling the more
successfully they are likely to perform in school. The statistics on
this are particularly stark: children in care are five times more
likely to move school in years 10 and 11&#151;that is in the two
years leading up to their major public examinations&#151;and yet
pupils who move school after the start of year 10 on average score
about 1.5 grades per subject lower than those who are not moving
school. This has one of the biggest effects in our model of school
performance of any change in circumstance among pupils&#151;bigger
even, I am informed, than the effect of having special educational
needs, free school meals or being looked after.</p><p><a name="06100910000255"></a>Getting stability in school placements is
vital. That is why, for example, we propose in the Green Paper that
there should be free transport to school, so that if there are
movements in placements but it is still possible for children to attend
the same school, albeit with a longer journey to the school, the
expense of travel to school is not a factor in requiring pupils to
change schools.</p><p><a name="06100910000256"></a>I have been
asked a large number of questions and I have dealt with many of them.
There were others and I may write to the noble Baronesses to deal with
them. But let me deal with one vital aspect: the availability and
training of foster carers. This is a 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_42"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>crucial issue, which the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, particularly
highlighted. One of the most radical proposals in the Green Paper,
which is set out on page 49, is to move to a tiered set of arrangements
for foster carers. There will be three tiers: tier 1 will be foster
carers for children with few additional needs relative to those outside
care; tier 2 will be carers for children with some additional needs;
and tier 3&#151;which is the really substantial
innovation&#151;will be carers for children with severe or complex
needs requiring specialist care, who, of course, are the most difficult
children to look after. The proposal in the Green Paper is not only
that these foster carers should have a much more intensive level of
support, including immediate access to multi-disciplinary teams, as set
out on page 49, but also that this category of foster carers should be
salaried for the first time in this country. We believe that taking
forward the availability of salaries for foster carers dealing with the
most difficult and challenging group of children could radically
address both the issue of recruitment, a matter raised by the noble
Baroness, and the quality of care and stability of
placements.</p><p><a name="06100910000257"></a>There are a whole
host of proposals in the Green Paper which I hope will be constructive.
We look forward to a dialogue with noble Lords as they study the
proposals. I am available, as is my right honourable friend the
Minister for Children, to discuss them with noble Lords as they come
forward with their
responses.</p><h5><a name="06100910000849"></a>4.38
pm</h5><p><a name="06100910000258"></a><b><a name="06100910001443"></a>Lord
Williamson of Horton:</b> My Lords, I would like from
these Benches to support the Green Paper. Many of us believe that it is
overdue, but it is a good paper and I support
it.</p><p><a name="06100910000259"></a>The Minister placed a great
deal of emphasis on improving educational achievements among people in
care, which is very important. I would like the Government to place
stress on two points that are mentioned in the Green Paper. The first
is that no one should end up in care by default, which is what I call
the question asked by those in care, &#147;How did I get
here?&#148; It is an important point because once people are in care
a certain course is open to them and they cannot get away from it. The
other point concerns the end of care&#151;the soft landing&#151;and
the question, &#147;Where am I going next?&#148; That also is an
important point. So an emphasis on education, yes, but the beginning
and the end of care are also extremely important for operating the
system.</p><p><a name="06100910000260"></a>I have one specific
question about exclusion from schools. I understand the point that the
Minister has made, but I am not sure how the policy will operate in
practice. Does it mean that every school has to be told beforehand that
it has to treat some children differently? The practical question of
treating people differently where there is a threat of exclusion seems
quite difficult to arrange. Perhaps the Minister will comment on
that.</p><p><a name="06100910000261"></a><b><a name="06100910001444"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord
Williamson, rightly raises the issue of children not entering or
leaving care by default. It is vital that 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_43"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 43</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>children are placed in care only where there is an imperative need. The
big increase in the number of care placements over the past 10 years
has been a result of care orders, not voluntary placements. The
evidence is that it is only because of imperative need that the number
of children in care has increased from 50,000 to 60,000 over the past
10 years.</p><p><a name="06100910000262"></a>The noble
Lord&#146;s point about not leaving care by default is well taken; it
is a major theme of the Green Paper. About a quarter of children in
care leave care at 16. That is much better than was the case before the
Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 was implemented in 2002, but we
believe that there is scope for significant further improvements. That
is why we have proposed giving children in care the right to determine
when they leave and providing the right for foster placements to
continue up to the age of 21, or further still if the child is in
education.</p><p><a name="06100910000263"></a>There is already very
strong guidance to schools in respect of children with special
educational needs and those in care that full account should be taken
of their circumstances before the decision is made to exclude them.
That must also involve identifying their circumstances beforehand; in
that way, schools and head teachers are aware of a child&#146;s
particular conditions and the ways in which they can help to deal with
those conditions so that issues to do with exclusion do not arise in
the first place.</p><p><a name="06100910000264"></a>One of the
ideas raised in the Green Paper relates to the fact that parents have
the right to avail themselves of the appeals process for exclusions, as
indeed they do. As a Minister, I know that one of the most fraught
areas of educational practice is when schools find it necessary to
exclude pupils, particularly permanently, and deeply aggrieved parents
go through the appeals process. The Green Paper says that the corporate
parent&#151;the social worker&#151;should consider using that
process on behalf of the child in care in much the same way as a parent
would. We believe that by engaging with the system in this way and
taking a much more active role in ensuring that the subsequent
education for the child is taken seriously and the best possible
placement is made, corporate parents will start to replicate the sorts
of conditions that apply to children with parents who are directly
acting on their behalf.</p><p><a name="06100910000265"></a><b><a name="06100910001445"></a>Baroness
Massey of Darwen:</b> My Lords, I welcome the
Statement and the Green Paper. As usual, there is considerable
consensus around the House about matters to do with children, and we
must never be complacent when it comes to children who are often
extremely vulnerable.</p><p><a name="06100910000266"></a>I welcome
the additional funding and the commitment to consult children who have
been through care and are in care. I also welcome the reference to
<I>Every Child Matters</I>, which should be at the heart of everything
to do with
children.</p><p><a name="06100910000267"></a>I
have three specific points. First, I want to reinforce a question asked
by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, about kinship care. We have to
get to grips with this and look in some detail at how it can be funded.
I am thinking in particular of grandparents, an issue that I 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_44"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 44</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have raised before in the House. Secondly, what do we mean by family
therapy? Where will it be trialled and how will it work? Thirdly, there
is the question of staffing, which is mentioned in children&#146;s
legislation. The quality of staffing is key when dealing with
vulnerable children. The recruitment, training and payment of staff
must be considered when we look at dealing with vulnerable
children.</p>

pm</h5><p><a name="06100910000268"></a><b><a name="06100910001446"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, I welcome my noble
friend&#146;s remarks, which, as always, are absolutely to the point.
Much of the funding issue that she raised relates to social work:
seeing to it that support is made available to enable social workers to
be more successful in their jobs, and addressing the acute problems in
respect of recruitment and training that exist in some parts of the
country, particularly London and the
south-east.</p><p><a name="06100910000269"></a>These issues are not
directly addressed in this Green Paper, because a review
process&#151;as my noble friend will know, it is called Options for
Excellence and is led by the Department of Health&#151;is looking
specifically at the training and recruitment of the social work
profession. The final report of the Options for Excellence initiative
is due later this month, and I will see that it is sent to my noble
friend. </p><p><a name="06100910000270"></a>However, our broad
objective in this area is clear: to repeat in respect of social work
our great success during the past 15 years in raising the status of the
teaching procession, improving its training and increasing the number
of good-quality recruits, thereby improving outcomes for children. We
seek to replicate many of the processes which we have put in place. Let
us be clear that there is a pay and conditions element to our
proposals, but they relate also to the quality of recruitment
efforts&#151;the kind of work which the Training and Development
Agency for Schools does in respect of teachers, which has been
radically to professionalise the recruitment exercise and the training
provided for teachers. We want to see that become much more widespread
across the social work
profession.</p><p><a name="06100910000271"></a>Chapter 2 of the
Green Paper has a great deal to say about family therapy, and gives a
whole set of examples of local authorities and other agencies which
have taken forward positive initiatives in this area which we wish to
see replicated more widely.</p><p><a name="06100910000272"></a>I
understand my noble friend&#146;s great concerns about kinship care.
She also knows the Government&#146;s position on paying grandparents.
I fear that we do not have a complete meeting of minds on the issue at
the moment, but we remain open to
persuasion.</p><p><a name="06100910000273"></a><b><a name="06100910001447"></a>Lord
Elton:</b> My Lords, can I direct the
Minister&#146;s attention to a problem which is not often recognised
or referred to and which is associated with the welcome initiative on a
soft landing which, if it is to succeed, will inevitably involve
various voluntary agencies? I can best explain the difficulty by
describing what happened when I was a Minister in the Department of
Health and Social Security and then in the Home Office. When in the
DHSS, I was responsible for the welfare of children in areas other 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_45"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 45</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>than their health, which meant children who were locked up by local
authorities. I was introduced then to an admirable scheme, which
involved intervening with children before they reached the condition in
which they would be taken into care and thereby preventing it, often
quite late in their careers.</p><p><a name="06100910000274"></a>The Department of
Health was responsible for any funding that would be given to that part
of the voluntary sector. The department which benefited from it, by a
reduction in the prison population, was the Home Office, which did not
have to find a penny. Therefore, the economic incentive lay with the
department which had no access, and the moral incentive rested with the
department which got no benefit. This break between funding departments
and benefiting departments crucially affects policy. Will the Minister
ask his colleagues to look at this now, long before they go to the
White Paper which will result from this
discussion?</p><p><a name="06100910000275"></a><b><a name="06100910001448"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, who speaks with
great experience on these issues, raises an absolutely valid point,
which is that the single biggest expense incurred in this whole process
is by the custody system, which is overseen by the department with the
least ability to have an impact on the behaviour which gives rise to
the expenditure in the first place. However, I hope that my department,
which has so much to contribute in this area, has some incentives. We
now have massive incentives to see educational attainment rise, because
all our performance indicators and capacity to justify the great
expenditure of public money in which we are engaged depend on rising
performance. The fact that we now publish annual statistics on the
performance of children in care&#151;and put them up in lights, if
that is the expression&#151;as a national indicator of success, puts
great pressure on my department and therefore on local authorities and
schools to take this issue with wholly greater seriousness than has
been the case.</p><p><a name="06100910000276"></a>There are now
powers to require schools, whether or not they see the benefit, to take
account of children in care. Local authorities now have a power to
require schools to admit children in care, not only at the beginning of
the school year but at any point, because children in care so
frequently move placements during the year. They will have to take
account of that power, even though it may not enhance their success in
GCSEs and other public examinations and tests. I hope that we are
getting the incentives more aligned than was often the case in the
past, but I completely accept that there is by no means a complete
alignment of incentives at the moment, and we should examine that more
during the Green Paper
consultation.</p><p><a name="06100910000277"></a><b><a name="06100910001449"></a>The

the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, made, in
considering the minimum standards for children&#146;s homes, and in

consultation from an expert in mental health? Does he agree with the
noble Lord, Lord Warner, that that would contribute to the development
of the staff and their attention and that it would be beneficial to the
mental health of looked-after children in children&#146;s homes? They
are often the most traumatised children, with the Office for National
Statistics establishing a rate of 72 per cent with mental disorders in
this group. Will the Minister look at that again? In the interim, will
he also look at encouraging children&#146;s homes to consider the
model of introducing a teacher or a social worker, or both, into the
home on a part-time basis, for two and a half days a week, to boost the
professional capacity of the staff and benefit the
children?</p><p><a name="06100910000279"></a><b><a name="06100910001450"></a>Lord

for his remarks. He has made an early contribution to the debate on
many of the issues in the Green Paper, and we will take seriously his
remarks, although some of them have a large price tag attached and we
would have to work out their resource
implications.</p><p><a name="06100910000280"></a>There has been a
significant expansion of the CAMs service in recent years, which goes
some way to meeting the noble Earl&#146;s first point. However, I
accept that there is further to go and that to meet the full
recommendations of my noble friend Lord Warner we need to seek
substantial further progress on the track that we have started
on.</p><p><a name="06100910000281"></a><b><a name="06100910001451"></a>Baroness
Billingham:</b> My Lords, the Green Paper is very
welcome. I speak on this matter with some passion because I spent four
years of my life, between six and 10, in care, which may be somewhat
unusual for a Member of this House. The circumstances were not unusual:
my father had been killed in the war and my mother got TB, as a lot of
people did at that time. She was taken to a sanatorium and was away for
four years before the health service and streptomycin, as I think it is
called, cured her, and she came back home again. But in those
intervening years I was taken into a very loving foster home in my own
village of Wendover, in Buckinghamshire, where I was beautifully cared
for. The teachers in my primary school looked after me and gave me
additional help, and the day that my mother came out of the sanatorium
was the day that I heard that I had passed the 11-plus. So I was the
lucky one, but millions were not. That is why this Green Paper is so
important to ensure that all the good fortune that I had is shared by
others. I hope that the Minister will ensure that this
happens.</p><p><a name="06100910000282"></a><b><a name="06100910001452"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, like my noble friend I spent
part of my childhood in care, and I can only echo all the remarks that
she made. This is a matter of the utmost national importance, not only
for the individuals concerned, but if we are to have a fair and just
society.</p><p><a name="06100910000283"></a><b><a name="06100910001453"></a>Baroness
Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Lords, I add my
congratulations to the Government, who have moved a very long way.
There is still a great deal more to do, but there are some exciting
ideas in this Green Paper. 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_47"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 47</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Can I have a tiny moan, however? It would be nice if Green Papers were
available to us before or at the same time as they are available to
members of the press, who seem to have a better view of everything of
this kind. However, that is a side
issue.</p><p><a name="06100910000284"></a>I
very much support all that is being done with regard to schools and the
extra effort that local authorities will be making, as well as the
requirement on schools themselves. I am sure that will help. The
preventive side is vital and that is clearly in place. I add my support
for kinship care. I gather from what the noble Lord has said that this
is not a matter on which there has been movement but it could save much
money and contribute to a great deal more family
cohesion.</p><p><a name="06100910000285"></a>The local
authority&#146;s responsibility and the need for the child to be
consulted have been re-emphasised. That is crucial. However, I wonder
whether there is not still a place for those children who do not have
any family or friends to have a mentor&#151;an extra person who could
undertake the role of a parent, as it were. The local authority is not
a parent in that sense. Such a person could befriend such children.
Organisations such as Home-Start already have such schemes. Over the
years trained volunteers have done so much in this country to map out
new areas where government help is needed. They are vital partners in
all this. Foster parents are volunteers and all the ideas for
increasing their support and training are very welcome, but I still
feel that there is room for the extra help which a mentor could
give.</p><p><a name="06100910000286"></a><b><a name="06100910001454"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness makes a good
point about the need for enhanced mentoring and for the support which
mentors can give, particularly to children in care who have no
relatives to take an interest and support them. The previous Government
introduced the very welcome concept of the independent visitor, who has
a role in mentoring a child in care who has no relatives. In the Green
Paper we are consulting on whether the offer of an independent visitor
should be extended to other children in care and on how we can
revitalise the role of the independent visitor. This is all set out in
the Green Paper. We welcome the noble Baroness&#146;s views on
it.</p><p><a name="06100910000287"></a><b><a name="06100910001455"></a>Lord
Ramsbotham:</b> My Lords, I too am pleased by much of
the Green Paper, which I look forward to reading in detail. I endorse
the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, about people in
prison. I was concerned to discover that those responsible for young
people in care who were entering prison rather switched off once those
young people went into prison and did not carry on that duty of care
while they were there. That was particularly problematic when those
people came out of prison, in the preparations for their coming out and
in the transition to their being released. That was one of the reasons
for the concern that the Children Act did not apply to those people
when they were in prison. I hope that that will be picked up and added
to all the other good things in the paper because it is badly needed in
the whole context of offender management, particularly young offender
management.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_48"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06100910000288"></a><b><a name="06100910001456"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord makes an
important point about the welfare of children in care who end up in
custody. There is a long section on that at page 82 of the Green Paper.
We will greatly welcome the noble Lord&#146;s comments on that when
he has had a chance to read the Green Paper in full. As he knows, at
the moment those in custody who are subject to a care order should be
supported by their local authority. That includes visiting and the
six-monthly review of care plans, as with other children in care. We
need to ensure that that duty is taken more seriously, particularly
when the children in care are about to be released, as the noble Lord
said. It is so important that proper arrangements are made for them
after their release.</p><p><a name="06100910000289"></a>However,
the Green Paper proposes to go beyond that and to require local
authorities to assess the needs of young people in care who are there
on a voluntary basis, but who enter youth custody, with an expectation
that those children too will continue to be supported as children in
care. In most cases this would entail a social worker, a care plan and
continued support as a child in care on leaving custody. We seek to
enhance the provision for children in care who end up in custody,
including for those in voluntary care. Although their care is
voluntary, by definition they often have inadequate family arrangements
to support them while they are in
custody.</p>

been set for it. The amendment also includes wording that would ensure
that police authorities were responsible for ensuring improvements in
force performance. It is particularly important that this should be in
primary legislation as it is proposed in the Bill that police
authorities are to lose many of their best value powers. I will speak
about best value under later amendments. For now, I commend this as an
alternative to those provisions. It would enable police authorities to
secure improvement&#151;which is what best value does&#151;without
the bureaucracy that best value involves.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_49"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 49</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06100910000293"></a>A police authority is there to ensure that
local police are accountable to local people. A key element of that is
ensuring that the local force is delivering against the priorities that
are important to local communities. The ability to provide a level of
independent monitoring of performance is vital to reassuring
communities about their own safety, and demonstrating that they have a
voice in deciding what their police should focus on and also ensuring
that the police are tackling the issues that are of most concern to
them. It is a function that underpins the relationship between the
police authority and the people that it serves, and it deserves to be
in primary legislation. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06100910000294"></a><b><a name="06100910001458"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, this is an
interesting amendment which, as the noble Baroness set out, seeks to
confer an additional duty on police authorities; that is what it is. In
principle, we would have no objection to the proposition, but our
question is simply this; whether the provision as set out in the
amendment is at all necessary, given that the ground is already covered
elsewhere. Schedule 2(9) amends Section 6 of the Police Act to give
police authorities an express function of holding the chief constable
to account for the exercise of his or her functions. This is no more
than a statement of what happens already, but it is as well to make
such a function explicit.</p><p><a name="06100910000295"></a>The
amendment seeks to place a new two-part duty on police authorities. The
first part requires a police authority to monitor the performance of
the police force in carrying out any policing priorities. No one can
argue with the aims of the amendment, but such monitoring is in effect
a subset of the new function of holding the chief constable to account.
No police authority will be able effectively to discharge this function
without monitoring performance. Such monitoring is a means to an end,
not an end of itself. As such, we are not persuaded that we need to
write such a duty into the
legislation.</p><p><a name="06100910000296"></a>The second part of
the new duty would require police authorities to make arrangements to
secure continuous improvements in the performance of their force.
Again, while I entirely understand and could wholeheartedly endorse the
appropriateness of such a duty, it is our contention that there is no
need to write this into the Police Act 1996. To do so would be no more
than to repeat what we see as the overarching best value duty contained
in Part 1 of the Local Government Act 1999, which I am sure the noble
Baroness will be well aware of. Police authorities are, of course,
already subject to the best value duty. While Clause 5 will be revising
the application of the best value regime to police authorities, the
overarching duty will be retained. In short, we see merit in the
sentiments behind the amendment, but I put it to the noble Baroness
that the ground is already more than adequately covered. I invite her
to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06100910000297"></a><b><a name="06100910001459"></a>Baroness

noble Lord said: My Lords, government Amendments Nos. 28, 30, 31, 32,
49, 147 and 150 respond to the concerns voiced in Committee about the
extent to which established functions of police authorities are moved
from primary to secondary legislation. The Association of Police
Authorities has made representations to us on this issue. In addition,
the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has recommended
that, due to the wide nature of the regulation-making power in relation
to police authority plans and reports, it should be subject to the
affirmative resolution
procedure.</p><p><a name="06100910000303"></a>We accept
the spirit of the committee&#146;s recommendation, but opted for a
slightly different solution. These government amendments go a step
further and restore to the face of the Police Act 1996 core
requirements in respect of the planning process and in relation to
consultation with local communities. We will now provide in primary
legislation for police authorities to issue before the beginning of the
financial year a rolling three-year policing plan. It will set out the
proposed arrangements for policing the authority&#146;s area during
the three years that it covers. It must include a statement of
objectives determined by the authority, following consultation with the
chief constable, for policing the authority&#146;s area for the
period of the first year covered by that
plan.</p><p><a name="06100910000304"></a>As the core provisions
relating to policing plans will now be in primary legislation and the
regulation-making power is much more tightly focused, we do not propose
to make it subject to the affirmative procedure. ACPO and the APA will
of course be consulted on any regulations made under the order. We will
use the regulation-making power to stipulate what other matters should
be included in policing plans. It would be our intention, and we
certainly envisage, that the regulations would require, as now, the
policing plan to include any performance targets set by the authority
and a statement of the resources available.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_52"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06100910000305"></a>Amendment No. 29 in the name of the noble
Lord, Lord Dholakia, seeks to incorporate these requirements in primary
legislation. Undoubtedly, these are important matters that should be
included in the policing plan, but our argument is this: that they are
secondary details that can safely be left to
regulations.</p><p><a name="06100910000306"></a>Amendment No. 49
also restores to the face of the Police Act the duty on police
authorities to obtain the views of their local communities. This will
be supplemented by a power to make regulations covering review
arrangements, persons whom the police authority should consult and
reports to be made by the Home Secretary where arrangements are not
adequate.</p><p><a name="06100910000307"></a>I recognise the
importance of preserving key points of detail in primary legislation
and, as we have made plain previously, the primary functions of
maintaining an efficient and effective police force and of holding the
chief officer to account for the way in which they discharge their
functions will remain on the face of the Police Act 1996&#151;and
now, on the basis of these government amendments, so will the functions
relating to the issuing of plans and consultation with the
community.</p><p><a name="06100910000308"></a>I hope that noble
Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches will be reassured by those
comments and agree not to press Amendment No. 29. I commend the
amendments to the
House.</p><p><a name="06100910000309"></a><b><a name="06100910001462"></a>Baroness
Harris of Richmond:</b> My Lords, I rise to speak to
Amendment No. 29, to which the noble Lord has already responded,
unfortunately.</p><p><a name="06100910000310"></a>First, I welcome
the spirit of the amendments put forward on behalf of the Government.
The ability of police authorities to determine and issue local policing
plans has now been put back into the Bill. That represents real
progress, but it does not go quite far enough. Two key elements of what
is currently in the law have been omitted from the government
amendment. Our amendment aims to put those back into the Bill. I
acknowledge my debt to the Front Benches, as I have borrowed heavily
from their wording in this amendment, except in the elements they have
omitted.</p><p><a name="06100910000311"></a>The first is the
ability of an authority to establish performance targets for its force.
The second is the ability to include in the plan a statement setting
out the resources available and the proposed allocation of those
resources against policing priorities. I am sure the Minister will
agree that these are important functions of police authorities, but
will tell me that it is more satisfactory that they should be placed in
secondary legislation&#151;which he has already intimated&#151;to
keep things simple and to increase flexibility. I shall see whether I
can convince him and the House that these two elements are important
enough to be in primary
legislation.</p><p><a name="06100910000312"></a>First, on setting
targets, the government amendment acknowledges that it is the job of an
authority to set objectives for policing its area. But how does an
authority know whether those objectives are being met unless it sets
targets to measure them? Police authorities have duties under primary 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_53"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 53</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>legislation to report back to local people on how well their local
police force is performing. How can a police authority reassure the
public that issues of concern to them are being addressed if it is not
setting targets to measure that? Given that the duty of authorities to
report on meeting performance targets is in primary legislation, it is
inconsistent that the ability to set those targets is
not.</p><p><a name="06100910000313"></a>Secondly, including a
statement of resources available and the way in which they will be
allocated to priorities is key because it impacts on funding and that
goes to the heart of accountability. Police authorities hold the
budgets for police forces and receive funds from central government
towards those budgets, but some elements of the budgets come from local
taxation. It is the duty of police authorities to raise those funds
through the police element of council tax. Police authorities are
accountable to local communities for how that money is spent, so is it
not right that they should be able to ensure that policing funds are
allocated appropriately in line with priorities? After all, those
priorities are set after consulting the public&#151;who fund police
forces&#151;to find out what most concerns them. This is not a matter
of constraining the operational independence of chief officers but of
accounting to the public for money that is collected from them and
demonstrating that their money is being spent on addressing issues that
concern them. This is a significant and important responsibility that
should be in primary legislation. It has been for many years, and I see
no reason to change
that.</p><p><a name="06100910000314"></a><b><a name="06100910001463"></a>Lord

carefully to what the noble Baroness said on this matter, not for the
first time, and I conclude that, while this is an interesting debate,
it is a debate about means and the ends are shared. We all want to see
standards raised and plans actively pursued and fulfilled. I do not
think it is essential to have this provision on the face of the Bill.
In fact, by putting it there, we may be constraining ourselves and
removing an important and necessary element of flexibility to reflect
and change priorities over time. I heard what the noble Baroness said
on this issue, but I am not persuaded and I have to insist on the
Government&#146;s
amendment.</p>

noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I am simply
seeking to reinstate the existing provisions of the Police Act 1996
after allowing for the possibility that there may be more than one
deputy chief constable and, in particular, that the police authority
appoints the deputy or
deputies.</p><p><a name="06100910000322"></a>Earlier today, your
Lordships listened to an impassioned argument from my noble friend Lady
Scotland in which she said that if the Mayor of London appointed the
chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority, just as the deputy chair or
chairs of the police authority would act in the absence of the chair,
it followed inexorably that the Mayor of London should appoint the
deputy chairs. I think that there are differences in substance between
the police authority in London and other police authorities under the
provisions of the Bill, but the substance of my noble friend&#146;s
argument seemed to be clearly that as the deputy acts in place of the
chair, then the same person who appoints the chair should appoint the
deputy chairs. Given the logic put forward by my noble friend just a
few minutes ago, it follows that if the police authority appoints the
chief officer and deputy or deputy chief officers and decides the order
in which they deputise, then the police authority 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_55"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 55</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should determine which of the assistant chief constables will act on
behalf of the chief constable. That is what is proposed in the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06100910000323"></a>Currently the police
authority and not the chief constable determines which senior officer
should act in place of the chief constable during his or her absence.
The provisions of the Bill would change that arrangement to make it the
responsibility of the chief officer. Frankly, I do not believe that a
satisfactory case has been made for why that should be so. Indeed, your
Lordships will recall that at an earlier stage of the Bill I argued
that the police authority should explicitly be responsible for
appointments right down to operational command unit level. That is
still my view but, given the enormous progress that has been made on
the Bill, I am not proposing to press that today. However, it seems to
me that this very simple change in the provision of the deputy goes to
the heart of the issue. If the police authority appoints the chief
constable, then logically, as my noble friend has already conceded on
related points, the authority should decide who acts in his or her
place.</p><p><a name="06100910000324"></a>I make it clear to your
Lordships that I do not believe that this is an operational decision.
It is a matter of the strategic oversight of the capacity of a force.
As such, it is a responsibility that falls to the authority. This is
where my careful analogy with the Mayor appointing the deputy chairs of
the police authority in London breaks down. The argument here does not
apply so far as concerns the police authority in London because nowhere
is the Mayor of London given a strategic oversight of the operations of
the police authority, whereas under the Police Act the police authority
is given that strategic oversight. Accordingly, while my noble friend's
argument that those who appoint the chief officer or the chair should
automatically appoint the deputies still applies, there is an
additional argument in this case because of the authority's role in
strategic oversight. This is about strategic oversight of a force,
which is why the deputy should be appointed by the
authority.</p><p><a name="06100910000325"></a>Finally and perhaps
most importantly, my proposal would ensure that there was adequate
resilience and flexibility in the arrangement at senior level where the
absence of the chief constable was long-term or even permanent but such
resilience would be owned and supported by the police authority. I beg
to
move.</p><p><a name="06100910000326"></a><b><a name="06100910001467"></a>Baroness
Harris of Richmond:</b> My Lords, it should remain
the responsibility of the police authority, otherwise the force, as the
noble Lord, Lord Harris, said, potentially lacks resilience, depth and
flexibility. It is perfectly conceivable that both the chief and the
deputy might for different reasons be absent&#151;retirement,
illness, secondment elsewhere, and so on. It is much less likely that
all 17 members of the police authority might be similarly
indisposed.</p><p><a name="06100910000327"></a>The police
authority appoints the chief officer, so it is right that they should
also decide who acts up as chief officer. This is a decision about
strategic capacity, not an operational decision. I wonder whether a
couple of examples might be helpful. The first is from the West
Midlands, which prompted a

became the responsibility of the police authority, through the Criminal
Justice and Police Act 2001. The chief retires; the designated deputy
is taken into hospital; and there is no one to decide who should act as
chief. The result is a state of inaction and limbo. Example number two
is from Thames Valley. The chief is seconded effectively permanently to
the NPIA and is absent for more than a year. The deputy is appointed
acting chief. What happens if she is taken ill? That is not a problem
under the current arrangements but it would be under the proposals. Who
is there to decide which of the ACCs will act up? I support Amendment
No. 33 wholeheartedly.</p><p><a name="06100910000328"></a><b><a name="06100910001468"></a>Lord

and 34 make arrangements for the designation deputy chief constables
and assistant chief constables to exercise the functions of chief
constables in their absence. As we made clear when we considered
similar amendments in Committee, we consider such arrangements to be a
direction and control matter, and therefore, properly the primary
responsibility of the chief constable. In providing for the chief
constable to make such designations after consultation with the police
authority, we are simply reverting to the position that existed under
the Police and Magistrates&#146; Courts Act 1994.</p><p><a name="06100910000329"></a>Deputising for the chief constable is but
one of the duties of a deputy chief constable or assistant chief
constable. Given that the chief constable is responsible for allocating
portfolios to his or her senior management team, it is logical that he
or she should also determine which of his or her senior officers should
deputise in their absence. That is how we see it. We see it as being
part of the chief constable's general direction of the senior
management team, and appropriately we feel that it is important to
protect the constitutional position of chief officers in having
operational direction and control of their force, including their
senior management team. I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Harris, said.
He did not see it as being part of an operational matter but we take a
different view, and I invite the noble Lord to consider his view. We
see it operating in that
way.</p><p><a name="06100910000330"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady
Harris, said that she thought that the Bill&#146;s provisions changed
the appointment arrangements for ACPO ranks. We do not see that in the
same way. The police authority will continue to appoint the deputy
chief constable and assistant chief constables, and the Bill does
nothing to interfere with those arrangements. In any event, in the
absence of mergers, it is very unlikely that any force will have more
than one deputy, so it is unlikely to be an issue of concern in the
future, although I take careful note of the noble Baroness&#146;s
examples.</p><p><a name="06100910000331"></a>The Bill would enable
the chief constable to identify which assistant chief constable would
act in the absence of both the chief constable and the deputy chief
constable. The problems that the noble Baroness has identified will not
arise in effect and practice. It is a difference of view; we take one
and the noble Lord and Baroness another. I therefore cannot agree with
these amendments.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_57"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 57</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06100910000332"></a><b><a name="06100910001469"></a>Lord

therefore moving away from the position they held so forcefully only an
hour or so ago, that where somebody appoints the most senior person,
they should also appoint the person who deputises for them? If so, that
would be helpful for our earlier arguments. I hope the Minister is not
trying to have it both ways. Clearly, if it applies to the police
authority in London, the same argument must apply to the appointment of
chief officers of police.</p><p><a name="06100910000333"></a><b><a name="06100910001470"></a>Lord

he seems to be professing something else. Where do we stand on
this?</p><p><a name="06100910000334"></a><b><a name="06100910001471"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord,
Lord Harris of Haringey, was transferring his logic from one argument
to the other. I was impressed by the adept transference of logic, but I
am not drawn to support it. We therefore simply disagree on the
operational importance and stature of the chief constable, and the fact
that they are there to direct, manage and control the police
service&#151;in practice, in consultation with the police authority.
I understand the nature of the noble Lord&#146;s argument; I simply
disagree with him.</p><p><a name="06100910000335"></a><b><a name="06100910001472"></a>Lord
Harris of Haringey:</b> My Lords, I suppose I am
deeply grateful to the Minister for highlighting this possible area of
inconsistency in government thinking. I urge the Government to consider
carefully the responses they have given me on both this amendment and
one an hour or so ago. It seems to me that you cannot apply completely
different sets of logic to the two cases. If the Government are saying
that the person appointing the chairman of a police authority must also
appoint the deputies because they might act as chair in the
chair&#146;s absence, the same logic must surely apply for the
appointments of chief officers of police.</p><p><a name="06100910000336"></a>The Minister says, with a look of regret
and sorrow, that he begs to differ on the fundamental point of
principle: that this is an operational matter, an issue of direction
and control, rather than one of strategy. We surely recognise the
central leadership role of chief officers of police. How they exercise
it is very much about the strategic direction of the force. Parliament
explicitly gave police authorities the right to appoint not only the
chief officer of police but also the deputy chief officer of police in
the 1996 Act because that strategic role is so
fundamental.</p><p><a name="06100910000337"></a>I am not quite sure
what attracts the Minister to the 1994 Act rather than the 1996 Act,
let alone whether it is related to the sad disagreement on the point of
principle he has referred to. However, I urge my noble friends to
consider how they make coherent their logical arguments in the various
answers I have received this afternoon and, while they do so, I beg

the subject, I should like to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Harris of

the title of the &#147;clerk to the authority&#148; to
&#147;chief executive&#148; of the police authority. We made clear
at the time that we supported the amendment but had some concerns about
the proposed wording. I am therefore pleased that we can bring forward
these amendments which implement the changes proposed by the Liberal
Democrat Benches.</p><p><a name="06100910000342"></a>The proposed
change in terminology derives from <I>Review of the Selection and
Appointment Process of Independent Members of Police Authorities</I>
conducted by Kenneth Hamer. The relevant recommendation
was:</p><ul><a name="06100910000737"></a>&#147;I recommend that
the title <I>Clerk to the Police Authority</I> should be replaced with
a more modern business title such as <I>Chief Executive</I>, or
<I>Executive Director</I>, and that section 16 of the Police Act 1996
which requires police authorities to appoint &#145;a Clerk&#146; is
a barrier to
modernisation&#148;.</ul><a name="06100910000626"></a>We
agree with that sentiment. Indeed, I recognise that, in practice, the

adopted the chief executive

preferable for the relevant legislation to be updated in accordance

changes are certain to be both cost effective and accepted by the
communities affected by the merger. The amendment would help to give
the public the confidence that, should mergers once again arise on the
agenda, these matters have been properly considered in an independent,
transparent and accountable
manner.</p><p><a name="06100910000349"></a>We had a detailed debate
in Committee, to which I certainly shall not return because on Report
it would not be appropriate to do so, when we considered the
Government&#146;s assessment of the costs of the proposed mergers, an
assessment that was not recognised by the police authorities and police
forces as being anywhere near the real figure.</p><p><a name="06100910000350"></a>Over the summer it has emerged that
&#163;6.1 million has been spent on preparing for the
Government&#146;s failed merger scheme by just 27 out of 43 forces.
The total financial cost to police forces alone could be well over
&#163;10 million, and many have made claims to the Home Office for
the funds that could have meant 271 extra police employed on the beat.
It is a staggering waste of taxpayers&#146; hard-earned money, all
for a programme of merger that Moira Wallace, the director-general of
crime, policing and counter-terrorism at the Home Office, admitted two
weeks ago when she spoke at the Police Superintendents Association
conference was &#147;not well enough planned&#148;

budget effectively frozen by the Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2008
onwards, we on these Benches remain concerned that forced mergers would
put pressure on other parts of police expenditure. I believe that the
revelations over the summer have only highlighted what a disaster
police regionalisation would be and have shown that the preparation
costs have already dented local policing capability. It is important
for the Minister to bring the House up to date with the
Government&#146;s policy regarding forced mergers.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_60"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 60</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06100910000352"></a>There have been many press reports over
the summer saying that Ministers have scrapped the plans to force
mergers. There have been reports of speeches by Ministers in which they
have allegedly given commitments that they will not require forces to
merge unless they have demonstrated positively that they wish to do so.
Yet the language in Parliament has been less clear, until today
perhaps. It has been couched in terms that imply that Ministers will
return to the fray when they think that attention has been diverted
away from this matter.</p><p><a name="06100910000353"></a>Earlier
this evening we heard of a little progress. The noble Lord, Lord
Bassam, said that it was not just a matter of these plans being kicked
into the long grass but that&#151;he used the words&#151;they are
in the deep freeze. Are the Government going to bring a blow torch to
that deep freeze in the near future and let loose on the enforced
mergers again? I made it clear to the Minister when we met to discuss
these matters about a month ago that I would table this amendment, not
to press it today but to give the Government the opportunity to put on
the record, in as clear terms as any government Minister is able, what
their plans are regarding police mergers. My colleagues in another
place can then properly reflect on the Minister&#146;s answer when
the matter on which we won a Division earlier this year returns shortly
to another place for debate. I beg to

get into the ridiculous state of affairs we were pressed into which
ensure that police officers and police authority members spend
ludicrous amounts of time trying to work through the
Government&#146;s proposals. The cost of all this ill-thought-out
enforced activity has been enormous, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Anelay, has so rightly pointed out. In my own force alone it amounts to
hundreds of thousands of pounds. In future whenever any government feel
the need to be radical it should be imperative that a cost-benefit
analysis is undertaken before proposals are brought before Parliament.

considerable amount of time being spent by noble Lords on all sides of
the House trying to work out what precisely the Government had in mind
when police mergers were being discussed. At one stage there was not
adequate time for consultation. People were crying out for a timescale
within which the decision should be taken. We were told that certain
police forces up north were likely to be merged. A new Minister was
then appointed who has come along and said that the matter has been put
in the long grass or the deep freeze&#151;or whatever expression one
wants to use.</p><p><a name="06100910000356"></a>A considerable
amount of time has been wasted on this matter, not only by Ministers
and others, but there has been pressure on a number of noble Lords with
police authorities making representations and

clearly to indicate whether the merger plans will still be enacted at
some stage. If not, what went wrong and why were the plans
stopped?</p><p><a name="06100910000357"></a><b><a name="06100910001478"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I am very grateful
to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, for giving me this opportunity to
clarify the situation. Her generosity beggars belief on
occasion.</p><p><a name="06100910000358"></a>On 19 June my right
honourable friend the Home Secretary made it clear that he was not
going to force through mergers where they were not wanted. As a
corollary to that clear statement, the notices of intention to merge
which were issued on 3 March and 11 April were withdrawn on 13
July.</p><p><a name="06100910000359"></a>That is not to say that
the issues in Denis O&#146;Connor&#146;s report, <I>Closing the
Gap</I> have gone away; far from it. There is a widespread recognition
that the status quo is not an option. We need to make progress in
enhancing forces&#146; capacity and capability to protect the public
from the threats posed by terrorism, serious and organised crime and
civil emergencies.</p><a name="06100910000628"></a>We now
need to focus more on the outcomes that we want to achieve and less on
structural questions. Earlier today, the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay,
gave us an example of her local force working energetically with other
forces in the locality to address some of those issues. Collaboration
and co-operation are obligatory for all of us.
<p><a name="06100910000360"></a>We want to work with police forces and
police authorities to see how best we can deliver the required
improvements in protective services while preserving neighbourhood
policing. To this end, the Minister for policing and security, my
honourable friend Tony McNulty, has written to all chief constables and
police authorities seeking their views on how best to narrow the
protective services gap in the absence of mergers. He has followed up
that letter with a series of meetings with forces and authorities to
listen to their views at first hand. As part of that dialogue with the
service, we have made it clear that we are open to all possibilities
ranging from collaboration to federation and to the lead force model.
We are ready to do what we can to facilitate any innovative solutions
to the issue.</p><p><a name="06100910000361"></a>What matters is
what works and what delivers real improvement in the quality of level 2
policing while protecting neighbourhood policing, rather than details
of structure. The public want their local force to tackle crime and
anti-social behaviour. They also want and deserve to be properly
protected from threats posed by serious organised crime and terrorism.
We are no longer looking to mergers to deal with that issue, but the
merger option must remain available as a last resort. We cannot say
that we will never have to use it. No responsible Minister and no
responsible Government could ever give such a guarantee, to which the
noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, referred. But I reiterate that enforced
mergers are off the agenda. We shall return to that only if it is clear
that none of the other options being considered could produce
worthwhile results.</p><p><a name="06100910000362"></a>As in all
our debates, there did not seem to be any disagreement between us that
we had to improve; the 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_62"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>question is simply how. How do we deliver the change that everyone has
identified as needed? It is for that reason that we must preserve the
existing provisions in the Police Act 1996 which enable the Home
Secretary of the day to initiate mergers where that would be in the
interests of policing and protecting the public. Such a provision has
been on the statute book for many decades and was retained and, indeed,
updated, by the previous Conservative Administration in 1994. That is
why we shall invite the other place to reject the amendment made by
this House in Committee.</p><p><a name="06100910000363"></a>I turn
briefly to the amendment. Its effect would be to outsource decisions
about whether to alter police areas to an unidentified and
unaccountable independent body. Any merger needs to be supported by a
well-founded business case, but it is ultimately for those who advocate
change to put the case for it. In the case of initiating police
mergers, Section 33 of the Police Act already effectively provides for
that by requiring that the Home Secretary of the day must set out his
or her reasons for the proposed alteration of police
areas.</p><p><a name="06100910000364"></a>I hope that the House
will be satisfied that the Home Secretary's decision to withdraw the
merger notices issued in the spring has settled the issue. What matters
now is how we work with the police service to strengthen the protection
of the public against the threat posed by terrorism and organised
crime. All the conversations that we have had have addressed that issue
with a degree of urgency. That is the debate that we need to have now.
The provisions for amalgamating police force areas in the 1996 Act are
perfectly adequate as they stand and should be left on the statute book
as a back-stop but, as mergers are no longer on the agenda, it is time
for us to move on.</p><p><a name="06100910000365"></a>On that
basis, I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, will be content to
withdraw her amendment, having given me a delightful opportunity better
to explain where we now find ourselves concerning force
mergers.</p><h5><a name="06100910000853"></a>5.45

assist the police better to serve the public&#151;that is what the

was pleased to hear the Minister say that the Government would not seek

Baroness said: My Lords, in moving the amendment, I first welcome the
amendments moved by the Minister. They go some way towards limiting the
powers of the Secretary of State to intervene in police forces, so that
the inspectorate will be involved in deciding whether a force is
failing. Unfortunately, they do not deal with the underlying problem
with this part. I shall explain that. It is the power of the Secretary
of State to give directions to chief officers of police. That is
completely unconstitutional and represents a radical unbalancing of the
tripartite relationship. It is also potentially a very dangerous weapon
in the wrong hands. In fairness, the Minister's amendments suggest that
in most circumstances the Secretary of State's directions should be
made through the police authority, but there is a sting in the tail of
the amendments, which renders them almost meaningless. The Secretary of
State may direct the chief officer where he deems that the authority is
failing. There is no independent judgment built into the process. It is
the Secretary of State who decides what &#147;failing&#148; means.
It is widely drawn, covering any functions of an authority whether
generally or in a particular
respect.</p><p><a name="06100910000374"></a>In theory, that means
that if, say, a police force was not very good at clearing dead dogs

Secretary of State could give directions to the chief officer. I do not
suggest that the current Secretary of State would use such a power
injudiciously or unfairly; I merely observe that it would be easy for a
Secretary of State whose motives may be more questionable to misuse
such a wide power at some point in the
future.</p><p><a name="06100910000375"></a>In addition, the
government amendments do nothing to ameliorate the concerns expressed
in Committee about the Secretary of State being blessed 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_64"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with foreknowledge about when a force or authority will fail. Again,
this could be open to misuse. I accept that a role envisaged for the
inspectorate with regard to forces should provide some comfort in this
respect, but there is silence about any equivalent role with regard to
authorities. This is the key issue in the direction of chief officers.
Amendment No. 38, which would leave out paragraphs 26 to 28 on
&#147;Power to give directions to police authority or chief
officer&#148;, would dispense altogether with what could be a
dangerous part of the Bill. That would be my preference. However, I am
a realist and I recognise that it is always sensible to have a plan B.
The other amendments would provide an alternative that would prevent
the Secretary of State giving directions to chief officers but would
allow him some intervention powers through the authority. Crucially,
however, it would place sensible limitations on what
&#147;failing&#148; means. This is an important matter that goes to
the heart of the balance between central and local powers and between
chief officers, police authorities and the Secretary of
State&#151;the tripartite balance. The other centralising measures in
the Bill are a grave cause for concern, but these proposals must be
where the line is drawn.</p><p><a name="06100910000376"></a>I also
ask the Minister to say how the Government think they will find the
capacity and the expertise to intervene in police authorities. To date,
the Home Office&#146;s policing support unit has used a few civil
servants in its intervention work with forces, but it has relied mostly
on seconded police officers. Given that most police authorities run an
extremely tight ship, it is unlikely that they will be able to find
some spare people to undertake these
duties.</p><p><a name="06100910000377"></a>Finally, I return to the
nub of my concerns: if the Secretary of State can tell chief officers
what to do, all the other arguments about exactly how the balance will
be shared between the tripartite partners are simply whistling in the
wind. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06100910000378"></a><b><a name="06100910001482"></a>The

name to them. We on these Benches believe that the Bill would give
Ministers greater powers to interfere in operational policing matters
than is acceptable. Policing should not be politicised. The police must
be able to investigate crime independently and to apply the laws passed
by Parliament free from party-political pressure. The amendments tabled
by the noble Baroness reflect the deep concern expressed about the
powers to be conferred on the Secretary of State to direct the chief
officers of the police. ACPO put it concisely:</p><ul><a name="06100910000743"></a>&#147;This is an unprecedented and
seismic shift in the balance of roles and responsibilities within the
tri-partite relationship and must be withdrawn&#148;.</ul><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_65"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 65</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06100910000380"></a>We believe that the Home Secretary should
not have the power to intervene in a way that interferes in failing
police forces and police authorities, as it so clearly would under the
Bill. That is where the difficulty lies. It looks as though the
Government are trying to get through the back door the provisions that
they failed to get through the front door in our debates on the Police
Reform Act 2002. What was important at that stage was that the
Government agreed to think again. They stepped back from the position
that they had taken on the intervention powers of the Secretary of
State in policing matters, and they were right to do so. The Home
Secretary is mistaken in seeking to go forward
now.</p><p><a name="06100910000381"></a>In our debate on these
matters on 20 June, the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, tabled amendments
that sought to describe more carefully and narrowly the circumstances
in which the Secretary of State might exercise his extended powers. I
said that if it were possible to find an appropriate way of including
in the Bill a very narrowly defined set of circumstances in which the
Secretary of State&#146;s extended power could be exercised, that
might prove acceptable. I accept that the Minister has used the summer
to try to achieve that. She has tried to make progress in drafting
amendments that more narrowly describe the route by which the Secretary
of State could exercise his powers. The difficulty is that the route to
taking a decision may be slightly more hampered by the odd building
brick in the way, but the result could be the
same.</p><p><a name="06100910000382"></a>I should say in passing
that, when I read the government amendments last week, I noted that
Amendment No. 45 refers to a chief inspector for custody, among other
things. I merely put on record the fact that I have noticed the
reference to that. I do not seek to debate whether it is appropriate
for that reference to be in the amendment, because we will have a
substantive debate on that
tomorrow.</p><p><a name="06100910000383"></a>The
problem remains that, despite the Government&#146;s amendments, a
Secretary of State who is determined to issue directions and extend his
authority over the police could do so in a manner that would distort
the tripartite relationship that we all hold so dear. My colleagues in
another place and I have looked very carefully at the
Government&#146;s proposals, and they believe that we should stick by
our principles on this matter&#151;principles that were tested in
Divisions on the Police Reform Act in 2002 when the Government agreed
to withdraw their plans. I hope that they are prepared to think again
today. I support the noble Baroness, Lady Harris of
Richmond.</p><p><a name="06100910000384"></a><b><a name="06100910001484"></a>Baroness
Henig:</b> My Lords, before my noble friend replies,
I should say that the matter has already been referred to; indeed, I
raised it in Committee. I was extremely concerned about these issues
and I welcome the fact that my noble friend has tried to narrow down
the basis of intervention, in a way that I welcome.</p><p><a name="06100910000385"></a>I hear what the noble Baroness, Lady

police authorities, although probably only one or two, might well have
problems and be in some

the point that she makes: we know that police authorities will be
inspected in the near future, and I take her point that the Secretary
of State should not take his decisions on any grounds other than
established fact and objective assessment. It seems that if police
authorities are to be inspected, as indeed they are under the
legislation, there will be an objective basis on which to categorise
police authorities. Therefore at least that objective could be met,
because there will be ways in which one can determine where the police
authorities are doing their job and where they are not. To that extent,
the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, could be addressed
through police inspections, and the Secretary of State could reasonably
take note of those inspections when coming to a view about police
authorities. As I say, although I recognise the anxieties that have
been expressed, I feel that the Government have made progress on trying
to narrow the basis on which direct intervention would be made, which I
welcome.</p><h5><a name="06100910000854"></a>6
pm</h5><p><a name="06100910000386"></a><b><a name="06100910001485"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble
Baronesses, Lady Harris of Richmond and Lady Anelay of St Johns, and my
noble friend Lady Henig for welcoming the government amendments to the
extent to which they each did. Perhaps I may ask for a little more
generous welcome from the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, for the
following reasons. We understood the import of the concern expressed.
In our previous debates, it was clear that Members of this House wished
these powers to be used as a matter of last resort and that the
direction to the police force or the police authority would be given
when they failed to provide the standard of service that we all expect.
I do not think that there was any dissent on that. I appreciate that
the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, and my noble friend Lady Henig were
particularly concerned that there should be no inappropriate, improper,
heavy-handed, not-thought-through interference, and we
agree.</p><p><a name="06100910000387"></a>As the noble Baroness,
Lady Anelay, has made plain, we have worked very hard to think of how
we could accommodate this concern, which we not only accept but want to
allay because it was not our intention. The noble Baroness, Lady
Anelay, was right to raise the concerns expressed by ACPO and the
Association of Police Authorities. In all fairness, I must tell your
Lordships that the two government amendments in this group provide
those associations with considerable and significant reassurance. They
are now both in a position to welcome the Government&#146;s
amendments.</p><p><a name="06100910000388"></a>Perhaps I may
explore why they have welcomed them. Beyond choosing where to live,
local people have no effective choice about the police service that
they receive. The intervention powers therefore need to be in place to
ensure that the Government have a means of driving performance
improvement in cases where policing has fallen below an acceptable
level. As I said, intervention powers are powers of last resort. I know
that the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_67"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 67</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>gave exciting examples, but I think that even as she said them she did
not suggest that they were really convincing as a basis on which a Home
Secretary was likely to intervene. Her smile gave that away, as
enchanting as it always is.</p><p><a name="06100910000389"></a>Our
experience of last resort is borne out by the first five years or so of
these powers being available to the Home Secretary. He has not needed
to use them, as other non-statutory resolutions to performance issues
have proved sufficient. A situation will require formal intervention
only if results are not forthcoming or police forces or police
authorities are unwilling to engage. The rationale for the
Government&#146;s revisions to existing powers is based on experience
of dealing with performance failings gained since the inception of the
original powers. The revisions are about framing the powers to provide
the most focused and effective response to performance failings in
police forces and police authorities.</p><p><a name="06100910000390"></a>Amendment No. 38, tabled in the name of
the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, seeks to remove all the
changes introduced in the Bill. We believe that the changes are
necessary to better reflect how we work in practice with forces and
authorities, and to ensure that they serve as an effective lever of
continuous performance improvement. The Government have been concerned
about the length of time that forces and authorities can take to put
effective improvement plans into operation. Effective powers need to be
available if performance improvements are not forthcoming. The changes
to be provided by this Bill are merely intended to make the process
more efficient and more in line with how they may be used in
practice.</p><p><a name="06100910000391"></a>Amendments Nos. 39 and
46 propose a definition for the level of performance failing that would
lead to intervention as &#147;serious and permanent&#148; failure.
Furthermore, the intervention will occur exceptionally, only if there
is no alternative. We realise that to clarify or define the type or
level of failing may provide some comfort, although we are not
convinced that it would be helpful to add such wording. Intervention
powers are intended to be used only in the most serious cases, but it
would be illogical to wait for any failing to become permanent before
action was taken. It is worth reminding the House that there is no such
test in the existing intervention powers approved by this House in
2002, which has not inured to our disadvantage.</p><p><a name="06100910000392"></a>There are a number of safeguards to
ensure that the powers of intervention are used in only the most
exceptional cases and when all other methods of achieving the necessary
improvements in performance have been attempted. Most importantly,
intervention will not take place unless the police force or police
authority had previously been made aware of the performance failings
and had been given the opportunity to remedy those failings. There is
also the option of non-statutory engagement with the Police
Standards Unit, which in practice is most likely to occur before any
intervention is considered.</p><p><a name="06100910000393"></a>We
have listened to the previous debate on the definition of a threshold
that must be met before 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_68"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>intervention powers are utilised. Moreover, we are aware that the
removal of the inspectorate as the only trigger for the intervention
powers has also raised concern. That is why government Amendment No. 45
places an obligation on the Secretary of State to consult the new
Inspectorate for Justice, Community Safety and Custody&#151;I hear
what the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, says about that&#151;in all
cases where it is proposed that the powers are used, and to publish the
inspectorate&#146;s opinion on the evidence which has led to that
proposed course of action. That is intended to ensure that the
inspectorate&#146;s professional, independent advice is available to
the Secretary of State on whether the use of the powers is, in its
opinion, the right course of
action.</p><p><a name="06100910000394"></a>I listened carefully to
what the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, said about police authorities. I
agree that the new requirement on the Home Secretary to seek the views
of the Chief Inspector for Justice, Community Safety and Custody before
issuing a direction in relation to the police force should also apply
before any direction is issued in relation to a police authority. That
makes sense, and I can see why the noble Baroness makes that
suggestion. I can therefore assure the noble Baroness that we will
bring forward an appropriate amendment at Third Reading. I endorse what
my noble friend Lady Henig said. Inspecting police authorities and
their function gives us a good avenue through which to ensure that we
respond proportionately and appropriately.</p><p><a name="06100910000395"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Harris, also
said that the Home Office basically has the skills and knowledge to
intervene in this way. I of course accept that this is new territory,
but that should not stop us from doing the right thing. Elsewhere this
Bill provides, for the first time, for police authorities to be
inspected. These amendments go hand in glove with that
change.</p><p><a name="06100910000396"></a>Amendments Nos. 41 and
42 would remove the ability of the Secretary of State to intervene
directly with a chief officer of a failing force rather than via the
police authority. Learning through our non-statutory work with police
forces has demonstrated that the best way to deal with performance
problems is to go straight to those, such as the chief officer, who can
implement the changes necessary to turn around performance. That is
more easily achieved if direct contact is made from the start. The same
is true of initial direct contact with the police authority. The change
we are making in the Bill is not intended to bypass the police
authority or its critical role in holding the force to account for its
performance. It has always been our intention that the usual route for
intervention would be through the police authority, but we recognise
that there might be some occasions when the police authority may not
feel able or be able to take the necessary steps.</p><p><a name="06100910000397"></a>We are, however, sensitive to the
concerns that this direct intervention has raised during the passage of
the Bill. Government Amendment No. 43 makes our intentions clearer and
will hopefully reassure the House. The amendment provides that the
powers are routed directly to the chief officer only in two specific
instances: first, where the police authority has also been shown to be
failing; and, secondly, where the 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_69"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 69</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>police authority has specifically requested intervention by the Home
Secretary as the most effective way to rectify the problems.</p><p><a name="06100910000398"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 44 seeks to remove
the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to intervene without delay when
he is satisfied that the chief officer or the police authority have, in
respect of the police force or police authority, failings, having been
given sufficient information and time to remedy those failings. Again,
these revisions to the Police Act are not about removing safeguards,
but reflect our experience of working with underperforming forces and
what is needed to enable us to get to the heart of the problem quickly.
Where a new performance issue arises, of course the expectation is that
the force and the authority will be given the time and opportunity to
address it, and we would work to help them were such a request for
assistance to be made. However, when the force or authority has failed
to address problems they have been made aware of and on which they have
been given ample time to act, for example via an engagement with the
Police Standards Unit or an earlier inspection report, a different
solution would need to apply. We feel that it would be illogical, where
a longstanding and known performance issue had persisted and gone
unresolved, for our response at that point to be to hand back the
problem to the force or authority without any stronger and more
immediate requirement for its resolution. These provisions will ensure
that the necessary action can be taken to address serious failings
which have gone unattended.</p><p><a name="06100910000399"></a>In
conclusion, we have listened very carefully to the concerns about these
provisions and we believe that the government amendments meet them. We
believe, too, that we have satisfied the concerns raised by the
Association of Police Authorities and the Association of Chief Police
Officers, both of which have welcomed our amendments. In those
circumstances, we invite noble Lords also to welcome them and ask the
noble Baroness not to press her
amendments.</p><p><a name="06100910000400"></a><b><a name="06100910001486"></a>Baroness
Harris of Richmond:</b> My Lords, first I thank the
noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and Members on the Conservative Benches
for their support. I have listened carefully to the Minister and I am
grateful for her long clarification. I acknowledge that she has given
some reassurance about the role of HMIC in determining whether a force
is failing. I also acknowledge that an authority must be failing before
the Secretary of State can intervene in a force, or that the authority
must first request such an intervention. Again, I agree that that is a
significant step forward. However, having considered this carefully,
and given the constitutional importance of this part of the Bill, I
think that more is needed.</p><p><a name="06100910000401"></a>I
have already rehearsed my fundamental objections to these proposals so
I shall not dwell on them again, but these are matters of significant
constitutional importance that, if implemented as they stand, could
unbalance the tripartite relationship through which our policing in
this country is governed. They also go to the core of the balance that
needs to be achieved between central prescription and

communities. In this Bill, and especially in this schedule, we have
seen clause after clause giving additional powers to the Secretary of
State to determine through regulation many aspects which until now have
been set out in primary legislation, particularly in respect of the
role of police authorities. I am delighted that, as a result of our
arguments and debates in this House, at least some of these provisions
will now be put back into primary legislation, but much is left which
represents a charter to micromanage significant elements of policing if
the Secretary of State is so minded. Does he not have enough to do at
the moment?</p><p><a name="06100910000402"></a>We all want to
ensure that the policing of this country is the most effective we can
make it, but driving a cart and horse through key constitutional
safeguards is not the way to go about it. I believe that this is a step
too far in the direction of central prescription and direction. I wish
to test the opinion of the

Power to merge police pension schemes


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61009-0010.htm"/>


<ul><a name="06100910000756"></a>2 (1) Regulations may-</ul>
(a) revoke those provisions of the police pensions
regulations that apply to persons who became members of a police
pension scheme before 6th April 2006, and
(b) make equivalent provision establishing a single
pension scheme for the benefit of those persons.
<ul><a name="06100910000757"></a>(2) In sub-paragraph (1)(b)
&#147;equivalent provision&#148; means, subject to sub-paragraph
(3), provision having the same effect as the provisions
revoked.</ul><ul><a name="06100910000758"></a>(3) The regulations
may make changes to the effect of the provisions revoked if the
changes-</ul> (a) are made as a result of
consolidating the provisions of the different police pensions
regulations into a single pension scheme, and
(b) do not make the scheme less beneficial to any member
of it than the police pension scheme of which he was previously a
member. Exercise of power to establish
merged scheme <ul><a name="06100910000759"></a>3 (1) This
paragraph applies to the first regulations under this
Schedule.</ul><ul><a name="06100910000760"></a>(2) The power to
make the regulations is exercisable by the Secretary of State with the
consent of the Treasury.</ul><ul><a name="06100910000761"></a>(3)
Before exercising the power the Secretary of State shall consult with
the Police Negotiating Board for the United Kingdom.</ul><ul><a name="06100910000762"></a>(4) The regulations may be framed so as
to have effect as from a date before the making of the
regulations.</ul> Exercise of power to amend
merged scheme <ul><a name="06100910000763"></a>4 (1) The
power to make amending regulations is exercisable as if-</ul>
(a) any provision of the 1976 Act applying to regulations
under section 1 of that Act, (b) any
provision of Northern Ireland legislation applying to regulations under
section 25(2)(k) of the 1998 Act, and 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_74"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>(c) any provision of Northern Ireland legislation applying
to regulations under section 26(2)(g) of that Act,
applied also to the amending
regulations. <ul><a name="06100910000764"></a>(2) In
this paragraph &#147;amending regulations&#148; means regulations
amending regulations previously made under this Schedule.</ul>
Application of provisions of other Acts
<ul><a name="06100910000765"></a>5 (1) The provisions of-</ul>
(a) section 8A of the 1976 Act (information in connection
with police pensions etc), (b) section 9
of that Act (assignment etc of pension to be void), and
(c) section 10 of that Act (obtaining pension by
self-inflicted injury etc), apply to
regulations under this Schedule, so far as relating to persons who are
former members of a 1976 Act Scheme, as they apply to regulations under
section 1 of the 1976 Act.
<ul><a name="06100910000766"></a>(2) The Pensions
(Increase) Act 1971 has effect as if a reference in paragraph 15 or 43
of Schedule 2 to a pension payable under the Police Pensions Act 1976
included a reference to a pension payable under regulations under this
Schedule to a person who is a former member of a 1976 Act
Scheme.</ul> Transitional
provision <ul><a name="06100910000767"></a>6 A reference,
however expressed, in any document (including an enactment)
to-</ul> (a) regulations under section 1 of the
1976 Act, (b) regulations under section
25(2)(k) of the 1998 Act, or (c)
regulations under section 26(2)(g) of that Act,
is to be read, where the context allows, as
including a reference to regulations under this
Schedule. Continuity of schemes for
tax purposes <ul><a name="06100910000768"></a>7 A pension
scheme established under this Schedule is to be regarded for the
purposes of Part 4 of the Finance Act 2004 (taxation of pension schemes
etc) as a continuation of each police pension scheme that it replaces,
and not as a different
scheme.&#148;</ul><p><a name="06100910000410"></a>The
noble Lord said: My Lords, the Finance Act 2004 brought in
new rules relating to pension benefits and to formally register pension
schemes. At the same time, new police pension schemes were opened and
the existing police pension scheme for the police in Great Britain and
the almost identical scheme for members of the Police Service of
Northern Ireland were closed to new entrants. These changes do not
affect officers who are members of the old scheme transferring from one
police force to another within Great Britain, but police officers
transferring permanently between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in
either direction would be obliged to join the new pension scheme on
transfer.</p><p><a name="06100910000411"></a>The Government are
keen for officers to join the new scheme and are giving all serving
officers across the United Kingdom the opportunity to do so during a
comprehensive options exercise. It was not our intention to compel
police officers to do so on transferring between home department forces
within the United Kingdom. These amendments would give the Secretary of
State the power to merge the old pension schemes, thus removing this
unintended consequence of the recent changes in pensions policy. The
merging of the schemes will bring no disadvantage to officers and is
essentially an administrative measure designed to facilitate the
transfer of police officers from the Police Service of Northern Ireland
to forces in Great Britain and vice versa. Such transfers are
particularly important for

and experience of senior officers from other Great British forces. This
move is widely supported by the police, including the Police
Federation, the Police Negotiating Board and the Policing Board for
Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name="06100910000412"></a>I understand
that this is a riveting subject for most Members of your
Lordships&#146; House. With that comment and observation, I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06100910000413"></a><b><a name="06100910001489"></a>Baroness
Harris of Richmond:</b> My Lords, the amendment
relates also to Northern Ireland and the pensions of police officers
there. There is nothing we cannot support in it but we must ask the
Government specifically to confirm that no police officer in Northern
Ireland will be worse off under the new
arrangements.</p><p><a name="06100910000414"></a><b><a name="06100910001490"></a>Baroness

another place, and placing it in the Library. It alerted outside
organisations to this issue and made it possible, I hope, for these
amendments to go through very

noble Baroness said: My Lords, we are back to best value once more. I
make no bones about the fact that the amendment would disapply best
value legislation to police authorities.</p><p><a name="06100910000422"></a>It seems to me that the proposals in the
Bill leave police authorities with all the responsibilities to secure
best value but none of the powers to make sure that it happens. This is
an impossible situation. Subsequent letters between the Government and
myself have failed to find a meeting of minds, so I will plod on and
expand once again on why I do not like what the Government are
proposing.</p><p><a name="06100910000423"></a>Best value
effectively does two things: it adds the word &#147;economic&#148;
to police authorities&#146; responsibilities to ensure an efficient
and an effective police service for their area and it gives them a
responsibility for ensuring continuous improvement in their force. But
to make sure that these things happen, the legislation says that an
authority must commission a best value review to assess what is working
and what is not. Where it is not working, an improvement plan must be
put in place to remedy the situation.</p><p><a name="06100910000424"></a>The Bill proposes to remove this power to
commission reviews. If a police authority cannot do reviews, it cannot
do best value because it has lost the ability to assess what is working
and what is not. It is as simple as that. The Government believe that
this can be replaced by the existing power of authorities to 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_78"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>require reports from chief officers. But that is not the same at all. It
lacks the crucial element of assessment, particularly the requirement
to look at what is now called contestability&#151;in other words,
competition.</p><p><a name="06100910000425"></a>I think we all
accept that best value as applied by what was formerly the
ODPM&#151;now the DCLG&#151;became a classic example of red tape
and bureaucracy gone mad. Sometimes it tied up far more resources than
it ever saved, despite its intentions of greater economy and
efficiency. The sensible way to remove this red tape is to remove the
legislation, not tinker with it so that some bits apply and some do
not, particularly when the bits that have been removed carry a
meaningful purpose.</p><p><a name="06100910000426"></a>If the
overarching aim of best value is still required, it would be easy
enough to add &#147;economic&#148; to the requirement on police
authorities to be &#147;efficient&#148; and
&#147;effective&#148; and to include a duty to secure improvements
as a specific function of police authorities. But let us be clear that
keeping the duties without the powers is an iniquitous and impossible
task. It would be better, I suggest, to disapply best value altogether
and be rid of this obsolete requirement. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06100910000427"></a><b><a name="06100910001494"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, I return to this
issue feeling rather perplexed and not a little confused as to what
Liberal Democrat politicians are really about when it comes to best
value. I thought that I would feel rather more enlightened after
listening to the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, but as she went on I
became, if not confused, more concerned about the illogical thread on
which the argument was based.</p><p><a name="06100910000428"></a>It is right that Clause 5 removes the
bureaucracy associated with best value reviews. I thought I heard the
noble Baroness agree that the best value regime needed to be less
bureaucratic. Having heard that statement, I thought that the noble
Baroness would then have agreed with the Government&#146;s
position.</p><p><a name="06100910000429"></a>It may be worth
reminding the House what the overarching duty amounts to. It is a duty
on police authorities to make arrangements to secure continuous
improvement in the way in which police functions are exercised.
Amendment No. 53 would remove that duty from police authorities, at
least in the context of the Local Government Act 1999.</p><p><a name="06100910000430"></a>In the debate on Amendment No. 26, the
noble Baroness sought to re-enact the overarching duty in the Police
Act 1996. She argues that it is unreasonable to leave police
authorities with the best value duty without the tools to discharge it.
That is not an argument I can accept. Police authorities will have the
necessary tools at their disposal&#151;they have them now. They will
still be able to conduct reviews and call on the chief constable to
submit reports. I do not recall hearing the noble Baroness say that
police authorities do not have the wherewithal, knowledge or ability to
discharge their other statutory functions without having express powers
to go with each and every one of them. If we did, we would have a very
cumbersome statutory process
indeed.</p><p><a name="06100910000431"></a>It has also been argued
that the residual best value duty is redundant as it overlaps with the
police 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_79"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 79</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>authorities&#146; duty under the Police Act to maintain an efficient
and effective police force. I can accept that there is some overlap,
but a duty to secure continuous improvement in the delivery of service
goes a step further and, as such, is well worth retaining in its own
terms.</p><p><a name="06100910000432"></a>I genuinely believe that
there is little in practice between what the Government are seeking to
do and what the noble Baroness wishes to achieve. I think that we both
believe in continuous improvement and that police forces should be run
in an effective and efficient manner, but we have tried to lighten the
bureaucratic burden. Having listened to Liberal Democrat politicians, I
thought for a long time that they adhered to that part of the
Government&#146;s
philosophy.</p><p><a name="06100910000433"></a>Perhaps that is no
longer the case. Perhaps over the summer the noble Baroness, Lady
Harris, decided that she would rather have more bureaucracy and more
precision in the way in which a statutory objective is deemed to work.
If that is so, I regret it, because I do not think that that is what
police authorities want or that it is necessarily in the best interests
of the service.</p><p><a name="06100910000434"></a>I hope that
having heard what I have had to say and reflected more on some of the
illogicality of her argument, the noble Baroness will feel able to
withdraw the amendment, which would actually change very
little.</p><p><a name="06100910000435"></a><b><a name="06100910001495"></a>Baroness

whether it is the Home Office that is running this agenda, because it
is not entirely within its remit. If it is the case, could it put its
foot down and explain to whoever is running it how this is going to

noble Baroness said: My Lords, I have received some excellent briefings
on this amendment from the APA, the Metropolitan Police Service and
HMIC. The amendment would limit the minimum powers of police community
support officers to those which are below detention level. The
Government are keen to standardise the powers of police community
support officers so that people across the country know what common set
of duties will be carried out by them and understand what to expect
from them. This is a reasonable aim. The difficulty with the
Government&#146;s approach is that they are leaving themselves
complete flexibility in what they might centrally prescribe by way of
community support duties through secondary legislation. I expect the
Minister will tell me that this flexibility is necessary to
future-proof the legislation, but this is not standardisation, but
centralisation. There are other practical difficulties with this
approach.</p><p><a name="06100910000443"></a>At present, it is the
job of the chief officer of police to decide what range of duties PCSOs
within his force will carry out. This means that their duties can be
tailored to local policing style and that there is some variation
between forces in what tasks they do or do not carry out, but that is
the whole point of having local forces accountable to local
people.</p><p><a name="06100910000444"></a>The key roles that
PCSOs play in all areas are: offering increased visibility to provide
greater reassurance to the public, improving community engagement
through getting to know communities and the issues that concern them,
and gathering intelligence from local people about what is going on in
their neighbourhoods. It is precisely because they are not quite police
that they are more trusted by the sections of the community which react
badly to the more authoritarian image of fully sworn police officers,
yet standardising their powers in the way suggested by the Government
will simply make them more like sworn officers. They risk losing these
advantages and there is no clear distinction.</p><p><a name="06100910000445"></a>If we are to give PCSOs standard powers,
this standard should represent a set of minimum powers, with
flexibility for chief officers to increase them if it 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_81"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 81</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is appropriate to their area. This means drawing a line in the sand
about the limit of standard powers, which should be set below detention
level for a number of reasons. First, if community support officers are
to take on the more confrontational roles which detention powers would
imply, their training will be very much longer and consequently more
expensive. Secondly, if their role is expanded to include additional
tasks, PCSOs could quite reasonably expect to be paid more. Both of
these could add a significant additional burden to police budgets,
which we know will already be under great pressure over the next few
years. Thirdly, the distinction between community support officers and
police officers will become more blurred, potentially leading to a loss
of the trust they currently enjoy among sections of the population
which feel alienated from the mainstream. This would be extremely
unhelpful in the troubled times in which we live. Fourthly, having
detention powers would mean that they would have to start completing
more paperwork, making court appearances and so on. Time spent on this
would be time they would not be on the front line providing a greater
level of reassurance to, and engagement with, the public. Fifthly,
expanding their role is likely to give the impression that forces are
trying to recruit police on the cheap. This could have unwelcome
implications both for public perception generally and for relationships
with sworn officers and the organisations that represent them. Finally,
we must ask what kind of people will be attracted to becoming community
support officers if it is seen not to be a community-based post, but
one that carries rather more authoritarian powers.</p><p><a name="06100910000446"></a>Taken together, these represent a
compelling set of arguments for ensuring that any standard powers are
minimum powers, with the line drawn as I have described. Chief police
officers will still have the ability to increase those powers if and
when they feel it is necessary. For the reasons that I have outlined,
it is unhelpful to prescribe greater powers for all areas. This is
important for the confidence of the public in policing and deserves to
be in primary legislation. I beg to
move.</p><h5><a name="06100910000858"></a>6.45

Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I understand the
anxiety of the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, but I do not accept that it
is merited on this occasion. Perhaps I may explain to her why. The key
question is the intention of the Bill in relation to the powers of the
police community support officers and whether the amendment improves
it.</p><p><a name="06100910000448"></a>The Bill&#146;s intention
is to bring clarity to the policing powers currently designated to
community support officers. I welcomed the noble Baroness&#146;s
acceptance at the beginning of her speech that this was a reasonable
aim, because if we are to have the benefit of using community support
officers, we should know the ambit of what they are likely to do in any
given area.</p><p><a name="06100910000449"></a>There is great
variation among forces, a fact with which the noble Baroness is all too
familiar. Clause 6 allows the Secretary of State to propose to both

be designated as standard for all community support officers. The
amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, would preclude from the
consideration of the Home Secretary, this House and another place one
specific power. We cannot accept that this is how we should frame the
legislation. If the principle that a standard set of powers may be
drawn up is accepted, we would not at this stage interpose our personal
views into primary legislation and prejudge or preclude the
consultation which the Bill requires, or the debate and the vote on the
draft order.</p><p><a name="06100910000450"></a>I reiterate that
this Bill does not prescribe what the standard set of powers should be;
it sets out a statutory process for determining the standard
set&#151;and it is a comprehensive process. If, after debate on a
draft order, this House thinks that we have got it wrong, it may then
reject the draft order, but we do not think that the Bill is the place
to debate the individual existing powers or skewer the Bill&#146;s
intention.</p><p><a name="06100910000451"></a>I am reluctant to
discuss the merit of exercising the power or the reasoning for
including it in a standard set because the key point is to safeguard
the integrity of the existing clause. All policing powers, whoever
exercises them, are coercive&#151;that is their nature. CSOs are
appropriately trained and recruited to a task from a wider and more
diverse background than are police officers. Some 15 per cent come from
minority ethnic groups, for example. Their nature is that they are
local, immediate and known by people. It is quite clear that we want to
retain that distinct and valuable flavour. Not everyone welcomed CSOs
initially, but we all welcome them now as being a thoroughly good
thing. They are not only to engage and to reassure, but they solve
problems about anti-social behaviour that people face, and we should
dispel the myth that they are not up to the job of doing
that&#151;because we know that they
are.</p><p><a name="06100910000452"></a>Noble
Lords will be aware that we did a pilot study on the use of the power
to require someone to remain for 30 minutes. The result was really
favourable. It is an important sanction when a CSO is dissatisfied with
the response given to a request for a name and address. Whether to
exercise that power is at the discretion of the CSO and on the basis of
local operational instructions. It is then for a constable to resolve
the situation, not the CSO. The CSO may not restrain someone; that
requires the designation of a separate
power.</p><p><a name="06100910000453"></a>We are having discussions
with the police service on the shape of a list of standard powers and
debating with it the merits and the composition of such a list. We are
seeking to reach an agreement with the service on this and we will
pursue this aim, if necessary, through formal consultation required by
the Bill. For transparency&#146;s sake, we published the previous
Home Secretary&#146;s proposal for a standard list in the annexe of
the Explanatory Notes to the Bill, but it was never intended to be the
final word. There is a lot of debate about what that core should be,
where the dividing line should be and what should be left for local
determination. That is a debate that we

standard; it does not determine what that standard will be. The
standard will depend on the consultation and on the iterative process
through which we have to try to craft
something.</p><p><a name="06100910000454"></a>I hope that on that
basis I can urge the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment. There
will be scope for us to have this debate in due course after those
consultations have come to

use to develop that standard and the process through which the Houses
will be able to review what the standard should be. We are in agreement
that it would be a good thing to have a standard set of core things
that CSOs can do, but at this stage it would be arbitrary to pick out
one issue and say that it is outwith what CSOs should do. That would be
precipitate. The one pilot that we have had so far indicates that

idea.</p><p><a name="06100910000457"></a><b><a name="06100910001501"></a>Baroness

noble Lord said: My Lords, this was a revised version of the amendment
that we discussed in Committee. It would restrict the maximum duration
of conditions on street bail, specifying that the conditions would
expire either seven days after the person was released or when he or
she attended a police station, whichever was earlier. The amendment
would not remove the power to impose a condition on street bail; that
is not the purpose. It would merely impose generous limits on the
duration of this
condition.</p><p><a name="06100910000468"></a>Street bail can be
beneficial for both police and suspect. We know of an example of street
bail being used in the case of a mother who, while out with her three
young children, was arrested for shoplifting. She was given street bail
to attend a police station at a later date so that she could arrange
care for her children. In such circumstances, unnecessary inconvenience
was avoided. We do not wish to see people being taken to a police
station at times that are inconvenient for them and the police. That is
the purpose behind the amendment and I hope that the Minister can
respond to it. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06100910000469"></a><b><a name="06100910001508"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I should say
straight away that I acknowledge the sentiment behind the amendment,
which is to minimise the potential for a suspected person to be placed
for an 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_85"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 85</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>undue period of time on conditions that are disproportionate to the
offence or the offender. The noble Lord gave a graphic example of where
the provision works incredibly well and is a sensible way forward. That
is a sentiment that we absolutely share, but the effect of the
amendment, for three reasons, would be to achieve the
opposite.</p><p><a name="06100910000470"></a>First, under the Bill,
the person granted street bail has an immediate right to appeal to the
custody officer and then to a magistrate. A person granted bail
pre-charge at the police station can apply to the magistrate for those
conditions to be
changed.</p><p><a name="06100910000471"></a>Secondly, an officer
setting conditions of bail will do so on the basis of a risk
assessment, taking into account the condition of the victim, the
circumstances of the offender, the nature of the offence and the needs
of the investigation. Automatic expiry of conditions after seven days
does not mean automatic expiry of the risk. If the noble Lord&#146;s
amendment was enacted, the almost certain outcome is that suspects
would be required to return to the police station at the end of a
completely arbitrary period of seven days. The officers could consider
whether to issue a further period of bail with conditions attached if
the investigation was still in
progress.</p><p><a name="06100910000472"></a>Let us take the
example that the noble Lord gave of a mother who has real difficulties
with childcare because her mother is away and she has no one else. That
mother can say, &#147;I can come back&#151;there is no
urgency&#151;if you give me 10 days&#148;. If there was an
obligation for that to happen in seven days, there would not be that
flexibility; it would mean prescribing a strict timetable that would be
disadvantageous to the mother, time-consuming and unnecessary, because
it would prescribe an arbitrary time, which might not meet the needs or
the risk assessment done by the police officer, who might think that it
was not necessary. We believe that this would not only be disruptive to
the suspect but create a bureaucratic and time-consuming process for
the police. We cannot see the benefits of that and I do not believe
that it is what the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, wants either. The Bill
currently provides the officer with the ability to determine the period
of bail that best suits the needs of the investigation. That has to be
the driver and not a bureaucratic and arbitrary
process.</p><h5><a name="06100910000859"></a>7
pm</h5><p><a name="06100910000473"></a>Thirdly, one of the aims of
bail is to ensure that people spend as little time as possible in
police detention. We are looking to encourage officers to make
effective use of bail and to do so in an environment that recognises
the needs and concerns of the victim. The application of conditions
proportionate to the offence should both help to protect the victim and
minimise the time that the person needs to spend in a police cell. I
recognise the concern that a person might be subject to almost
indefinite conditions or periods of bail. I am sure that the noble Lord
has that anxiety about the provision. In Committee, I indicated that it
was mentioned in Committee in the other place that we had anticipated 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_86"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 86</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that potential when we introduced the street bail provisions in 2003.
The Home Office guidance that accompanied the provisions made it clear
that a period of more than six weeks to respond to bail should be
considered only in exceptional circumstances. We repeat the same
guidance for both street and pre-charge bail, but we do not envisage
placing such a time limit in the Bill. Instead, we wish to allow
officers to retain the operational flexibility to best meet the needs
of the investigation.</p><p><a name="06100910000474"></a>The 2003
circular requires the monitoring by supervisory management of the use
of street bail, particularly regarding
disproportionality&#151;another issue about which the noble Lord and
I are anxious. We would extend that requirement to the conditions
attached to bail and to the periods to which those conditions are
attached. Police officers are accountable for their actions but are
also answerable to their communities regarding tackling and
investigating crime. We believe that these proposals will help to
achieve both objectives. We want police officers to behave safely but
compassionately and sensitively, if the need arises. We believe that
the measure enables them to do that. I hope that the noble Lord is
reassured. He and I believe that the way in which these matters are
tackled has worked well, and that we need to replicate
that.</p><p><a name="06100910000475"></a>Government Amendment No.
142 corrects the reference in Section 142(3) of the 1988 Act. For some
time&#151;given the date of the legislation&#151;it has incorrectly
referred to conditions as set out in Section 142(1)(b). That provision
does not contain any conditions; the relevant subsection is (1)(c).
Accordingly, the amendment will require a justice of the peace to
consider conditions that must be satisfied to authorise entry and
search of premises for offensive weapons. A justice of the peace would
already take those matters into account. In any event, the conditions
reflect the framework set out in PACE in relation to authorising entry
to the premises. I hope that I shall satisfy the noble Lord, Lord
Dholakia, that he and I, as always, want the same thing, but that we
have found a good way of doing it for
him.</p><p><a name="06100910000476"></a><b><a name="06100910001509"></a>Lord
Dholakia:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that
explanation. On future occasions we shall have plenty of opportunities
to monitor how the provision affects individuals. I have no doubt that
in the coming months we shall have a plethora of criminal justice
legislation that will provide further opportunities to deal with the
matter. I am grateful to the Minister and I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06100910000477"></a>Amendment, by leave,

amendment would provide a clear power to help the police to get guns
off the streets before they are used. The situation on gun crime has
become considerably worse since we previously discussed it, which was
on 4 July. The Library has kindly provided me with cuttings
that cover the period since then. They tell a horrific story. I shall
mention only two figures. In Manchester alone, there is an average of
five firearm offences every two days, committed by boys and men aged 15
to 20. In London, shootings are almost one a day with more than two
fatal shootings a month.</p><p><a name="06100910000480"></a>I
should like briefly to quote Kevin Davis, who, as the head of Scotland
Yard&#146;s Operation Trident, is one of the most senior law
enforcement officers in the United Kingdom. He has pointed out that a
minority of young people think that it
is,</p><ul><a name="06100910000818"></a>&#147;socially and
morally acceptable to carry
guns&#148;.</ul><a name="06100910000631"></a>He
continues:<ul><a name="06100910000807"></a>&#147;Offenders
are using firearms over trivial disputes like arguments over spilt
drinks, bumping into one another or minor road
collisions&#148;.</ul><a name="06100910000632"></a>Two-thirds
of the shootings investigated by Trident officers occurred in just six
of the capital&#146;s poorest boroughs. Three-quarters of the victims
are black. Intimidation is rife and Davis admits that protecting the
entire extended family of a witness is
impossible.<p><a name="06100910000481"></a>After terrorism,
firearms crime is perhaps the most serious challenge to law and order
that we face. Luckily, I believe that we can do something about it.
Unlike searching for drugs or collecting drugs, which is extremely
difficult, finding a firearm with a hand-held metal detector is very
simple. My amendment seeks to give the police powers to use that means
when they wish to do so.</p><p><a name="06100910000482"></a>In
previous debates, the Minister has said that there are already many
powers in relation to firearms. She is absolutely right. I refer to
Section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and Section 60
of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. I shall not go on,
but suffice it to say that the Home Office&#146;s firearms website
emphasises that firearms law is very complicated. Complicated law is
not good law. Simple law is needed, which is understood by both the
public and the police.</p><p><a name="06100910000483"></a>Do the
police want the measure? In July, I said that the part of ACPO
responsible for gun crime was anxious to have it. Since that time, the
Home Office has lent on ACPO and ACPO has suggested that its different
sections&#151;the police section and the section dealing with
community
relations&#151;</p><p><a name="06100910000484"></a><b><a name="06100910001511"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I cannot let it
stand that we have lent on ACPO. We asked for ACPO&#146;s view
because we were worried that it might have concerns about the matter.
We wanted to hear from ACPO whether there was a gap and what the gap
was so that we could assist. Nothing would give me more pleasure than
to come back to the House and say to the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford,
&#147;You&#146;re right and there is something more that we can
do&#148;. I reassure the noble Lord that we asked ACPO about the
matter, but it was certainly not lent on.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_88"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 88</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06100910000485"></a><b><a name="06100910001512"></a>Lord
Marlesford:</b> My Lords, of course I shall withdraw
the words &#147;lent on&#148;. The discussions were useful and
constructive. ACPO decided that it would like to have intra-ACPO
discussions. All I say is, &#147;Well done, Sir
Humphrey&#148;.</p><p><a name="06100910000486"></a>Of
course the police need to consider carefully how they would use a power
such as the one that we are discussing. They need to use their
judgment. They have to consider carefully the range of issues involved,
whether that be removing guns or community relations. But that does not
mean that they should not have an instrument that enables them to
remove guns. It is for Parliament to give that instrument to the police
and it is for the police to use their judgment appropriately and
properly to apply the measure as and where they feel that it would be
helpful.</p><p><a name="06100910000487"></a>I want to send a clear
message to the criminal fraternity that it will become extremely risky
for anyone to carry an illegal gun. That would also send a clear
message to the public that the police now have a clear and simple
statement of legislative power to take guns off the streets before they
are used. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06100910000488"></a><b><a name="06100910001513"></a>Lord
Dholakia:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord
Marlesford, has always been persistent on this issue. I have often
supported him on this during Questions to the Minister, and today will
be no exception.</p><p><a name="06100910000489"></a>An
unacceptable gun culture has obviously developed in this country during
recent times. Shootings in the streets or in fast food restaurants are
often reflected in newspaper headlines. Gun crime has grown at an
alarming rate in this country, with overall gun crime doubling since
1997. Crimes involving imitation firearms have quadrupled. When this
matter was brought forward in Committee, I was somewhat concerned about
the very wide nature of the amendment. Since then, in our discussions
with the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, it has been tightened by the use
of the word &#147;that&#148; in paragraph (a). We are now happy to
support the amendment.</p><p><a name="06100910000490"></a>The vast
majority of people who own guns legally use them responsibly. The aim
of further changes to the law must be to tackle the threat from weapons
that are held or used illegally. Gun crime is a complex problem, and
tackling it requires a holistic approach. We need to use
intelligence-led policing to attack the organised criminal gangs that
are responsible for many shootings. In order to achieve a better rate
of conviction, we need to encourage more people to come forward by
improving the protection offered to vulnerable witnesses. It is also
important that the Government support the community groups working with
those young people who are at risk of becoming involved in drugs and
gun crime. We hope that the amendment will send a signal that more
needs to be done to tackle this problem. I support the intention behind
the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06100910000491"></a><b><a name="06100910001514"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> My Lords, I strongly support
my noble friend, and I have added my name to his amendment. He is right
to bring this matter before the House again, and I hope that it may be
resolved in his favour tonight&#151;I hope by the Minister 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_89"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 89</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>being able to agree with my noble friend. It is also right, as the noble
Lord, Lord Dholakia, said, that the majority of firearms are legally
held and responsibly used. None of us is trying to target legislation
at those who behave responsibly. The fear of gun crime is strong, and
the risk of gun crime is real in some parts of the country. The illegal
use of guns on some of our streets brings injury to some and misery to
many; it is the scourge of a generation in some parts of our society.
The considerable merit of my noble friend&#146;s amendment is in the
simplicity of the description of the powers that he seeks to confer on
the police. I am aware, of course, that powers already exist to enable
the police in certain circumstances to search people, but those powers
are to be extracted from a myriad of legislative instruments.</p><p><a name="06100910000492"></a>Since Committee, my
noble friend has carefully considered the drafting of his amendment,
and he has made one small change which should meet the concerns of
those who felt that the power might appear to go more widely than my
noble friend intended. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia,
for indicating that the change has helped him to support my noble
friend. If the Government wish to give a clear message about their
commitment to reducing the level of gun crime, they have the
opportunity to do so tonight by accepting my noble friend&#146;s
amendment.</p><p><a name="06100910000493"></a><b><a name="06100910001515"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I say straight away
that the Government agree with the sentiment expressed by the noble
Lord, Lord Marlesford, agreed by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, and
supported by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. The recent tragic
shootings have highlighted once again that the fight against gun crime
is far from over. We have already put in place legislation to support
that fight; for example the five year minimum sentence for those adults
convicted of unlawful possession of prohibited firearms.</p><p><a name="06100910000494"></a>The Government take gun crime extremely
seriously. That is why I was grateful for the opportunity to discuss
the issue with the noble Lord in our telephone conversation last week.
There was nothing on which we disagreed about the nature of the crime
and the need to face it with all possible tools. There is legislation
in place that provides a range of enforcement powers to the police
under Section 47 of the Firearms Act 1968. I realise that I am
repeating what has been said on this issue, but the facts remain the
same. For example, in the circumstances specified in the legislation, a
constable can require a firearm or ammunition to be handed over for
examination; the person can be searched and detained for the purpose of
the search; if a vehicle is involved, the vehicle may be searched and
the person driving or in control of it can be required to stop it; and,
furthermore, for the purpose of exercising these powers a constable may
enter any place.</p><h5><a name="06100910000860"></a>7.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06100910000495"></a>The Government have made
clear their commitment to tackling gun crime and to ensuring that the
police have sufficient and proportionate powers to help make
communities safe. The existing 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_90"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 90</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>legislation helps meet those objectives, and no purpose would be served
by duplicating the powers available under existing legislation. The
police agree with that view. The Association of Chief Police
Officers&#146;s lead on stop and search, Deputy Chief Constable Craig
Mackay of Gloucestershire, said that he was not aware from his
portfolio of the service asking for this power or identifying a gap in
current legislation that requires a new power and that, as drafted, the
amendment is a major extension to police powers and raises some real
issues of interpretation that could cause community concerns. The
ACPO&#146;s lead on the criminal use of firearms, Chief Constable
Keith Bristow of Warwickshire, concluded that this might be a step too
far, due to the complexities stated by DCC Mackay. He confirmed that
while appreciating the support of the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, for
the police, ACPO is unable to support his
amendment.</p><p><a name="06100910000496"></a>Further, I cannot
accept that the inclusion of the amendment in the Bill would serve as a
declaratory statement either to the police or to the general public.
The police are well aware of the high priority that we place on the
fight against gun crime and are already fully trained in the use of
their powers under existing legislation. The introduction of powers
that duplicate existing provisions could only serve to confuse them,
and I know that is not something the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, would
wish.</p><p><a name="06100910000497"></a>The House will be aware
that, lamentably, the general public are not in the habit of reading
Bills or <I>Hansard</I>. Indeed, rumour has it that following the
deliberations of this House late at night does not cull from the public
the interest that it might otherwise deserve, which is much to be
lamented. Therefore, I cannot agree that the amendment would raise the
profile of gun crime in the public&#146;s consciousness in the way
that the noble Lord suggests. We have run a number of public
information campaigns about the issue, and we will continue to do so in
the future. I respectfully suggest that those are more likely to have
the effect that the noble Lord is seeking to achieve than a declaratory
amendment to the Bill. The noble Lord does not suggest that the
amendment adds anything to the legislation that we already have; it
simply adds a new complex arrangement that police officers would be
burdened to have to learn in addition to all the others. It adds very
little.</p><p><a name="06100910000498"></a>Given that we now have
a clear view from the Association of Chief Police Officers that the new
power is not needed, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment. He
is to be commended for his persistence on this important issue. He is
right to raise it, but may I suggest that the benefit of so doing has
already been delivered and we should press the matter no further? It
has now had five outings and it is perhaps time to put the amendment to
bed. I ask the noble Lord not to press the amendment this
evening.</p><p><a name="06100910000499"></a><b><a name="06100910001516"></a>Lord
Marlesford:</b> My Lords, the telephone conversation
that I had with the noble Baroness was of course immensely agreeable,
as is any conversation with her either on the telephone or face to
face. Her speech was exactly what I though it would be; it was 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_91"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 91</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>largely what she had said previously. I offer my humble congratulations
to Sir Humphrey in these matters. I am aware that the Home Office is
opposed to ideas that do not come from itself; I have had the long
experience of the requirement for the firearms register being on the
statute book for nine years and nothing being done because the Home
Office did not like it.</p><p><a name="06100910000500"></a>I am not
concerned at all as to whether there would be some duplication. This
clear statement of the law would quickly get through to the public; not
by reading <I>Hansard</I>&#151;of course not&#151;but the media do
a good job sometimes and they are taking a great interest in gun crime
at present, and rightly so. If I had been given the opportunity of
talking to her right honourable friend the Home Secretary, he might
well have been pretty much in favour of this amendment. If I were a
politician in the Government, I would see this as an opportunity to
take action, rather than using words and setting up further
consultations for the long term. The long term is too long because, as
Keynes notably, or rather, lamentably, said&#151;sadly, in this case,
with accuracy&#151;people are dead.</p><p><a name="06100910000501"></a>We need to take guns off the streets now.
It is possible to do so. My amendment would help that to happen, which
is why I would like to test the opinion of the

noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 61 is grouped with
Amendment No. 62, which was tabled in Committee but not debated. These
amendments address the extension of powers granted in the Immigration
and Asylum Act 1999 to reveal passenger lists to the law agencies.
Those powers will be extended under the Bill to domestic
flights&#151;that is, to flights starting from and ending in this
country. Our concern, and the reason for the amendment, is the increase
in surveillance. We want to support the Government in disrupting
terrorism and preventing crime, but, as ever, doing that leads to
tensions over people&#146;s civil liberties and their right to a
private life.</p><p><a name="06100910000509"></a>How effective will
the measures be? There will not be equal surveillance on the roads or
the railways. A terrorist who is creating a pattern for police officers
to observe might well choose different forms of transport, so we are
not sure that such powers are an effective tool for disruption.
However, they could be, so we should consider them seriously. We need
to consider appropriate safeguards to protect the individual&#146;s
right to privacy.</p><p><a name="06100910000510"></a>There is also
the question of whether a circuit judge is at the appropriate level for
this measure. In some ways, a magistrate might be more appropriate
because the Government propose that a superintendent makes the request
for information and a magistrate is at an equivalent level. There is a
belief on these Benches that some judicial oversight is needed because
there is a principle in common law that a decision that has been made
by law should be able to be reviewed later. We understand from the Home
Office that the purpose of these measures is to spot developing
patterns and to track such things so that crimes can be prevented and
terrorism disrupted. </p><p><a name="06100910000511"></a>At the
heart of this amendment is the right to privacy, and that is its
purpose. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06100910000512"></a><b><a name="06100910001518"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, again I understand
the purport of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment. However, requiring a
police officer to obtain a warrant from a circuit judge each time he
wants to submit a request for data would be a huge 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_94"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 94</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>burden on the police and the courts. It would have a significant impact
on police operations by adding a delay into the system for making
requests. That could potentially have serious consequences if the
police receive intelligence that needs to be acted upon immediately. It
would also increase police bureaucracy, as requests would have to be
submitted twice: once to the circuit judge and, if a warrant were
issued, once to the carrier. That would apply equally if the request
were made to a magistrate rather than a circuit judge, although
applying to a circuit judge would be even more cumbersome.</p>

<p><a name="06100910000513"></a>If the purpose of this amendment is to
introduce a safeguard, I assure the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, that a
number of safeguards are already built into the process; I shall
outline them. It will be lawful under Section 32(4) of the Immigration,
Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 for a police constable at the rank of
superintendent or above to request information only if it is necessary
for police purposes. Any request must specify the period during which
it has effect, up to a maximum period of six months. The police and all
public authorities are under a duty pursuant to Section 6 of the Human
Rights Act 1998 to ensure that they comply with convention rights. The
use of personal data will also be compliant with the obligations under
the Data Protection Act 1998. We do not consider that this amendment is
necessary or practicable.</p><p><a name="06100910000514"></a>However, I thank the noble Lord for
giving me an opportunity to outline the safeguards because I know that
people have concerns about how this procedure will operate, how we will
make sure that personal and private data are properly protected and
whether the Data Protection Act applies. I understand that those
concerns have been in circulation and therefore I am pleased to have an
opportunity to state on the record that the safeguards are there and we
do not think that the anxiety that people properly have is founded in
fact. I hope that with that reassurance the noble Lord will feel able
to withdraw his
amendment.</p><p><a name="06100910000515"></a><b><a name="06100910001519"></a>Lord

15.</ul><p><a name="06100910000520"></a>The noble Lord
said: My Lords, this amendment was debated in Committee. We do not
object to Clause 14, which gives trading standards inspectors the power
to impose fixed penalties on people who sell alcohol to children. Our
objection is to Clause 15, which gives the Secretary of State a
delegated power to specify unlimited categories of people who chief
police officers would be able to accredit with the power to give fixed
penalty notices. There would be no restriction on the groups of people
who could be specified. The Government could use this power to give
punitive powers to wholly inappropriate groups 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_95"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 95</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of people: for example, dinner ladies could be allowed to fine children
for fighting in the playground; bouncers could be allowed to fine
pub-goers for being drunk and disorderly or supermarket check-out staff
could be allowed to fine shoplifters. I say these things because
Liberty has given me examples that are quite amusing. In recent years,
we have heard of ridiculous uses of on-the-spot fines: an Oxford
student was given a fixed-penalty notice for a drunken joke about a
policeman&#146;s horse being gay and pro-hunting campaigners were
fined for selling T-shirts bearing uncomplimentary remarks about the
Prime Minister. Most recently, we have heard a proposal to use
fixed-penalty notices against people who drop cigarette butts in the
street or put their rubbish out on the wrong day of the week. It is to
restrict the extent to which further people are given such powers that
I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06100910000521"></a><b><a name="06100910001521"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> My Lords, Clause 15 gives the
Secretary of State an order-making power to specify unlimited
categories of people to whom chief officers of police could give the
power to give fixed penalty notices. That is a clear, straight-forward
and wide-ranging power and it is right that we should look carefully at
the potential it has to change the way in which our courts
work.</p><p><a name="06100910000522"></a>Earlier this summer,
there were stories in the press that the Government intended to extend
dramatically the number of offences that could be dealt with by way of
a fixed penalty notice rather than the person having his case disposed
of in court. The story returned to the headlines on Friday, 29
September. The <I>Times</I> carried a story that serious offences, such
as obstructing or assaulting a police officer in the course of his or
her duty, could be subject to an on-the-spot fine. That would be an
unbelievable extension of on-the-spot fines.</p><p><a name="06100910000523"></a>But then the very next day the
<I>Times</I> carried another story reporting that the Home Secretary
had ruled out on-the-spot fines for violent assaults. What did he mean
by that? A spokesman for the Home Office said that Ministers had not
been consulted about the proposals. How extraordinary that proposals
for changes to legislation can get that far and apparently not be on a
Minister's radar, especially as the Prime Minister appeared to be
trumpeting exactly those changes in his own speech at the party
conference earlier that week. I know that we may not necessarily take
everything that the Prime Minister says in his conference speech as
gospel. For example, he asked the conference to celebrate with him the
fact that the Labour Government had been the first to appoint a female
as Leader of this House, thereby forgetting yet again, as he had
forgotten in a press release a few years ago, the appointment of Lady
Young. I give way to the noble Baroness.</p><p><a name="06100910000524"></a><b><a name="06100910001522"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I think that the
Prime Minister said&#151;and I believe he was right&#151;that this
party was the first to appoint a black woman as Leader of this House.
There is a tonal difference.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_96"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 96</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06100910000525"></a><b><a name="06100910001523"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> My Lords, a tonal difference
I will accept. It was not reported as that, and so perhaps the noble
Baroness will tell me that the rest of the <I>Times</I> reports about
fixed penalties are also incorrect. I should certainly welcome that
because a lot of what the Prime Minister seemed to celebrate in that
speech was in cloud cuckoo land. However, we all like to applaud our
leader&#146;s speeches at whichever party conference we enjoy
ourselves during the
Recess.</p><p><a name="06100910000526"></a>With regard to fixed
penalty notices, what is going on in government circles if they have
not had prior notice of the consultation about whole swathes of
offences being delegated to others to implement as fixed penalty
fines?</p><p><a name="06100910000527"></a>Before we let the clause
remain in the Bill, we need to hear from the Minister what plans the
Government have to extend the range of fixed penalty notices. What
offences could come within their range in the future? If the Home
Secretary is now ruling out violent offences, what will be on the list?
Will it include possession of cannabis, illegal hunting or all types of
theft up to a value of &#163;100? What will we see and when will
Parliament see those plans? Is it to be in primary or secondary
legislation? The <I>Times </I>report implied that it would be
introduced swiftly this autumn in secondary legislation with
implementation early next year. Is that SI winging its way towards us
as we speak? We need to know that before we can proceed to extend the
powers before us today in Clause 15. Who would be given the delegated
powers to issue the fines for any extended range of offences? The noble
Lord, Lord Dholakia, posed some questions on that.</p><p><a name="06100910000528"></a>I was not overly worried about Clause 15
when this matter came up in Committee and therefore I kept silent. But
developments since then have made me concerned. The combination of the
potential impact of this clause, the conditional cautions and extension
to punitive methods in Clause 16, plus the rumours of wholesale
extensions of the use of on-the-spot fines now make me concerned about
allowing Clause 15 to slide into the Bill without more rigorous
attention.</p><p><a name="06100910000529"></a>I am grateful to the
noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, for bringing this matter forward and I
certainly look forward to the Minister&#146;s response. We have come
to the crucial part of the Bill. I realise that we will be concluding
our deliberations on the Bill after this amendment, which I think is
the appropriate place to do so. We shall need to listen very carefully
to the noble Baroness and consider these matters before we reach Third
Reading.</p><p><a name="06100910000530"></a><b><a name="06100910001524"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I understand the
anxieties and I hope that I shall be able to lay them to rest. I should
say in passing that often things are considered by others&#151;for
example, police chiefs&#151;and suggestions are made which the press
may or may not get into the public domain and which may or may not have
come before others. It is very important for us to look at what is
before us.</p><p><a name="06100910000531"></a>Everyone
believes&#151;that is why the noble Baroness was not worried about
it&#151;that the penalty notice for disorder scheme is currently
being used to excellent 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_97"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 97</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>effect by the police and the wider police family, such as community
support officers and persons accredited under the community safety
accreditation schemes. The use of fixed penalty notices to tackle
nuisance and anti-social offending in local communities has proved very
successful. If, like me, the noble Baroness has spoken to a number of
area officers, she will know that they see this as one of the most
effective ways that we have yet been able to devise of changing
anti-social behaviour in an area. Punishment can be administered on the
spot, driving home the Government&#146;s message that such behaviour
is unacceptable. We believe that it is right to deal with simple,
straightforward cases in this prompt and effective way, reserving the
courts for disputed and more complex cases. I know that that is
something about which the noble Baroness and her party have agreed in
the past. Clause 14 specifically extends the range of those who may be
accredited to issue penalty notices for disorder to trading standards
officers. I am very grateful for the noble Lord&#146;s indication
that he is comfortable with any such extension.</p><h5><a name="06100910000863"></a>7.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06100910000532"></a>We believe that there are
other such classes of enforcement officer to whom it may prove
similarly advantageous to give the power to issue notices in this way
and thus widen the scope of the fixed penalty notice scheme. The PND
scheme will help to deliver the aims of the Government&#146;s respect
agenda to tackle anti-social and nuisance behaviour in local
communities. As noble Lords may know, numerous safeguards are attached
to the use of this power.</p><p><a name="06100910000533"></a>First, it will be subject to the
affirmative resolution procedure. Parliament will be able to debate the
issues fully before voting on the extension of accreditation to another
class of people. Secondly, as with trading standards officers,
accreditation is under the control of the chief officers of police.
Thirdly, the only penalty offences that our new class of accredited
person would be able to enforce would be those specified in their
accreditation, so it would be strictly controlled. We believe that this
power will be a helpful tool in enabling penalty notices for disorder
to be used by the wider police family for more cases of minor nuisance
offending. For those reasons, I hope that the noble Lord will be
prepared to withdraw his amendment.</p><p><a name="06100910000534"></a>I shall deal with some of the issues
raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. She said that she was
surprised that Ministers were not consulted. I say to her that the
press account was not entirely accurate. I was given to understand that
most of the proposals alluded to came from police chiefs. My right
honourable friend the Home Secretary will not approve any lessening of
punishment for violent crime. It is not proposed that the list of
offences should be extended to include, for example, robbery, mugging
or other serious offences. I understand the anxiety that has been
raised by such speculation, but I assure the noble Baroness that her
first response to these amendments was correct and any excitement
caused outside this House can be left there. We are looking at the most
proportionate and effective way of dealing with a problem which is
common to all.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_98"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 98</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06100910000535"></a>It is interesting how our joint positions
have developed. I think that both the Liberal Democrats and Her
Majesty&#146;s loyal Opposition now agree with us that anti-social
behaviour is a matter that we can address effectively and that penalty
notices for disorder are an appropriate way forward. I hope that the
noble Lord will feel content with that response and that he will not
press his amendment.</p><p><a name="06100910000536"></a><b><a name="06100910001525"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> My Lords, as I said, we will
read what the noble Baroness said very carefully but I have a question
with regard to her assurances about an affirmative order. I do not go
down the line of pointing out the difficulties that we have in this
House with our rather cautious approach to dealing with affirmative
orders. However, she referred to an affirmative order that the
Government might bring forward. Can she give an assurance that, in
nominating offences or classes of people with the power to impose
on-the-spot fines for particular offences, the order would specify only
one offence or one class of people at a time and that the Government
would not seek to bring forward, as a kind of curate&#146;s egg, a
job lot of offences for consideration by the
House?</p><p><a name="06100910000537"></a><b><a name="06100910001526"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I do not think that
I can properly give that assurance for the following reason. As the
noble Baroness will know, in looking at the extensions that we make, we
look at which individual agencies or entities may advantageously have
this extension. It would be far too burdensome if we had a debate or
consultation. She knows that we tend to go out and consult people, so
we try to get it right before we put anything in. If we were all in
agreement that four or five identified groups could be included in one
audit, it would be too burdensome for me to suggest that we have a
series of orders with only one group in it.</p><p><a name="06100910000538"></a>I cannot give the noble Baroness the
assurance that she seeks in that regard, but I can certainly assure her
that every extension will be well presented and argued so that we have
a proper understanding on why we are extending it, to give everyone an
opportunity. Indeed, I think that this House has become increasingly
vigorous, not only in its scrutiny but almost in its informal
pre-legislative scrutiny, which does not happen in the normal
pre-legislative way, but we have our discussions and debates. It has
been one of the joys of this House that we have often been able to come
to a consensual view on how to move these orders forward, particularly
when talking about an affirmative and not a negative resolution. The
House has indicated on occasions when it is minded not to affirm. The
curate&#146;s egg goes for both of us, not just for one
party.</p><p><a name="06100910000539"></a><b><a name="06100910001527"></a>Lord
Dholakia:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister, but I
stress the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. One of the
difficulties with an affirmative order is that if everybody is bunched
together it will be very difficult to single out individuals from
within that list, other than by a prayer against that order. I do not
think that that

assurance that the matter will come before the House as part of the
affirmative order, and at that stage we will look at the
appropriateness of the people to whom the power has been given. In the
mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the

laid before the House on 13 July be approved [<I>34th Report from the
Joint Committee</I>].</p><p><a name="06100910000544"></a>The noble
Lord said: My Lords, in considering these regulations, the House will
return to issues that were discussed extensively during the passage of
the Mental Capacity Act. The regulations are being made under the
provisions of that Act, which provides a statutory framework to empower
and protect vulnerable people who are not able to make their own
decisions.</p><p><a name="06100910000545"></a>The Act introduces
the Independent Mental Capacity Advocate service, a new statutory
service, which is independent of both the NHS and local authorities.
The aim of the IMCA service is to provide high-quality advocacy to
support and represent vulnerable people who lack capacity to make
important decisions on serious medical treatment and a change of
accommodation.</p><p><a name="06100910000546"></a>Under the Act,
NHS bodies and local authorities have a duty to consult the IMCA before
making certain decisions where there is no one other than a paid carer
whom it would be appropriate to consult in deciding what would be in
the person&#146;s best interests. The regulations specify additional
circumstances where the NHS body or local authority may instruct an
IMCA.</p><p><a name="06100910000547"></a>We consulted fully on how
the regulation-making powers of the Act should be used. We have also
consulted further with stakeholders on the regulations themselves. The
regulations have been laid before Parliament alongside a further set of
regulations&#151;the general regulations, which are subject to the
negative procedure. The general regulations cover operational and
implementation details, the role and functions of the IMCA and a
definition of serious medical treatment. A draft code of practice on
the Act, including a chapter on the IMCA service, will also shortly be
laid before Parliament.</p><p><a name="06100910000548"></a>The
consultation responses showed very clearly that there were other
situations beyond those listed in the Act relating to a change of
accommodation and serious medical treatment, where a person who lacked 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_100"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>capacity to make serious decisions may be particularly vulnerable. These
regulations specify two important new circumstances where NHS bodies
and local authorities have the discretion to instruct IMCAs to
represent people who lack capacity. Those are care reviews and adult
protection, but these regulations do not impose a statutory duty to
instruct IMCAs in these circumstances. They are discretionary
powers.</p><p><a name="06100910000549"></a>Regulation 3 allows for
an NHS body or local authority to instruct an IMCA to support and
represent a person who lacks capacity to participate fully in the
decision where a care review is proposed or is in process, and where
the person has been in the accommodation for 12 weeks or more and it
was not made as a result of an obligation imposed on the person under
the Mental Health Act.</p><p><a name="06100910000550"></a>Of
course the requirements in the Act relating to the appointment of an
IMCA will also apply. That is the person who has no appropriate family
or friends who could be consulted, and the person must be unable to
fully take part in the care review because of impaired
capacity.</p><p><a name="06100910000551"></a>Regulation 3 does not
apply to arrangements made as a result of an obligation imposed on the
person under the Mental Health Act 1983. This is because that Act
contains its own safeguards and rights of appeal.</p><p><a name="06100910000552"></a>Regulation 4 provides that an IMCA may be
instructed to support and represent a person who lacks capacity in
cases of abuse where adult protection proceedings have been instigated,
and it is alleged that the person is or has been abused or neglected by
another person or that he is abusing or has abused another
person.</p><p><a name="06100910000553"></a>The regulations provide
that an IMCA may be appointed in these cases where protective measures
affecting the person have been taken, or are proposed, by an NHS body
or local authority. They must have been made in accordance with adult
protection procedures which have been set up under the &#147;no
secrets&#148; guidance issued in 2000 by the Department of Health
under Section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act
1970.</p><p><a name="06100910000554"></a>Noble Lords will see that
there is a difference in the conditions between Regulations 3 and 4.
Whereas Regulation 3 provides that an IMCA may not be instructed where
there is someone whom it is appropriate to consult in adult protection
cases, under Regulation 4 an IMCA may be appointed even where the
person has family and friends whom it might be appropriate to
consult.</p><p><a name="06100910000555"></a>I know that there is a
great deal of interest in ensuring that the IMCA provides effective
safeguards for people who lack the capacity to make certain serious
decisions. That is why we wanted to be sure that there was time for
proper debate on this expanded role, hence these regulations are
affirmative. We also listened carefully to those who responded to the
consultation on the IMCA service. Many wanted safeguards for adults who
faced abuse, including those cases where it may be the very people who
have care of the person who may be accused of being the abuser.
Regulation 4 addresses these issues.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_101"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 101</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06100910000556"></a>Regulation 5 specifies
that the extension of the IMCA role requires that NHS bodies and local
authorities must consider for each eligible individual whether they
would benefit from this additional safeguard. In some cases, for
example, where a person already has an advocate actively involved, the
local authority may decide that an IMCA may not be necessary. The
extension of the role allows an IMCA to be instructed, but does not
require one in all
cases.</p><p><a name="06100910000557"></a>Secondly, where an IMCA
has been instructed, the NHS body or local authority must take into
account the information provided by the IMCA in making any relevant
decision that results from a review of care arrangements or protection
measures. This is intended to ensure that the views of the IMCA are
properly taken into account when an important decision is being
made.</p><p><a name="06100910000558"></a>These regulations are part
of a package of measures, including the Act itself, the general
regulations, the code and the commissioning guidance, that together
provide the framework for implementing the IMCA service. The service
will, as a result, provide an important new service: a statutory
advocacy service targeted at some of the most vulnerable people in our
society. It will provide a new safeguard for them when facing
particularly important decisions. We aim to implement the IMCA from
April 2007. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06100910000559"></a>Moved, That the draft
regulations laid before the House on 13 July be approved [<I>34th
Report from the Joint Committee</I>].&#151;(<I>Lord
Warner</I>.)</p><h5><a name="06100910000865"></a>8
pm</h5><p><a name="06100910000560"></a><b><a name="06100910001530"></a>Earl
Howe:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
introducing these regulations, which we welcome. Because of his
comprehensive and helpful introductory remarks, he will be pleased to
hear that the points I wish to make about the regulations are
few.</p><p><a name="06100910000561"></a>For someone who lacks
mental capacity, and for whom major welfare decisions must be taken, we
all agree that there must be someone capable of making an independent,
balanced judgment about their best interests. That is so not only
because of ECHR considerations, but also because the principle of
giving maximum empowerment to vulnerable people runs through all recent
legislation on disability in its various forms. The sections of the
Mental Capacity Act covering independent advocacy therefore met with
universal approval. It is to the Government&#146;s credit that they
chose to include them. I also acknowledge the thoroughness of their
consultation.</p><p><a name="06100910000562"></a>We are
nevertheless in somewhat experimental territory, in the sense of
knowing how well these arrangements are likely to work in practice. It
is still early days. I understand that there have been pilot projects,
and imagine that their results have been factored into the
department&#146;s thinking on both the regulations and the associated
code of practice. Perhaps the Minister could confirm if that is right
and, if it is, tell us what lessons have emerged from the pilot
areas.</p><p><a name="06100910000563"></a>I say that because the
workings of these regulations will need to be evaluated after a
reasonable period of 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_102"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>time. We need to be reassured principally of two things: first, that
they are adequate in addressing the advocacy needs of mentally
incapacitated people who have no close relatives or friends and for
whom no deputy has been appointed by the court; secondly, whether there
are any situations or groups of people, other than those specified in
the Act or regulations, to whom the provisions could usefully be
extended. The Making Decisions Alliance&#151;a consortium of 40
charities with a direct interest in the matters covered by the Mental
Capacity Act&#151;has flagged up various possibilities in that
context; for example, situations where there are disputes between
family members or between the family and the local authority, or cases
where there is a clear conflict of interest.</p><p><a name="06100910000564"></a>We must be mindful of resources in all of
this, and I would not ask the Government to make an open-ended
commitment to an unlimited number of IMCAs for all imaginable types of
situation. However, the Government need to say that they are willing to
learn from experience and that they will not close their mind to the
idea that independent advocates should be available in circumstances
wider than those currently envisaged as a matter of
course.</p><p><a name="06100910000565"></a>I am of course aware
that the regulations allow for local authorities and NHS bodies to
exercise their discretion to instruct independent advocates in
situations where that could be of particular benefit to an individual.
That is certainly welcome, but my natural caution tells me that theory
and practice may turn out to be different things. Both local
authorities and the NHS are experiencing tight funding constraints.
When funding is tight, statutory bodies tend to resist the notion of
paying for things other than those for which they have a legal
obligation. In many areas of the country, it is therefore likely that
we shall see independent advocates appointed only where there is a
statutory duty to do so. We may well see uneven practice emerging,
depending on the availability of funding in local areas. I hope that
the code of practice may go some way towards countering both those
tendencies, but there is a limit to the extent that we can rely on it
to do so. It must remain a
concern.</p><p><a name="06100910000566"></a>That is surely one
reason why there is merit in thinking about a national strategy on
advocacy for all client groups, as the Making Decisions Alliance has
been recommending. One way or another, there is a range of policy
initiatives on advocacy emanating from a number of sources within
Government, each of them distinct in their own way. We may be debating
even more initiatives when the Mental Health Bill eventually reaches
us. Who knows? I wonder whether the Minister can say what work, if any,
has been going on to bring these different strands of advocacy practice
together under the same policy microscope, as it were. It is only by
doing so that common themes and objectives, as well as problems, can be
identified. Independent advocacy is an important function in our
national life. It deserves to be dignified with a co-ordinated national
approach.</p><p><a name="06100910000567"></a>Regulation 3 relates
to care reviews following decisions being taken about
medium-to-long-term accommodation for a mentally incapacitated person. 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_103"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 103</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Is it correct that these provisions apply to all care reviews, including
those where the original decision about a person&#146;s accommodation
was made without an advocate being involved? For example, let us
suppose a local authority had placed the person in accommodation at
some time in the past, perhaps with the active agreement of the person
while he had mental capacity but he has since lost capacity to decide
about a move. In other words, does the regulation allow the NHS body or
local authority to instruct an IMCA where that body or authority is
already closely involved in arranging for the person&#146;s
accommodation?</p><p><a name="06100910000568"></a>Finally, I ask
the Minister about the resources that will underpin these regulations.
The Explanatory Notes state that advocates are to be funded by
&#147;new money&#148; from the Department of Health. Can the
Minister confirm that this is not a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul,
and that the budget for advocacy will not erode the mental health
budget more generally? Secondly, can he say something about standards
of competence for advocates, how those standards are to be enforced and
how advocates are to be suitably trained and monitored? Lastly, how
will the Government ensure that there are enough IMCAs to do the job
and that their geographical spread is such as to meet demand as it
arises?</p><p><a name="06100910000569"></a>I emphasise our support
for these regulations, and look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</p><p><a name="06100910000570"></a><b><a name="06100910001531"></a>Baroness
Barker:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for
his introduction to these regulations. Along with the noble Earl, Lord
Howe, I was privileged to be one of the small band of people in this
House who worked in some detail on the Mental Capacity Act. It is a
piece of legislation of which this House should be most proud, an
excellent piece of work.</p><p><a name="06100910000571"></a>That
Bill was founded on principle. Because of the subject matter and the
approach that the Government rightly took to it, the detail of the
secondary legislation&#151;the regulations, guidance and code of
practice&#151;were always going to be of considerable importance. It
was a framework Bill. We must therefore spend time debating these
matters, and I am glad that the Government have recognised that and
afforded the time to do so.</p><p><a name="06100910000572"></a>Another reason why we should give
considerable attention to the matter is that throughout the passage of
the Bill it was apparent that three groups of people each took a
distinctly different view of the matter at hand. First, there were the
people with family members whose capacity is severely limited and who,
perhaps because of their experience, are disinclined towards what they
perceive as the intrusion of advocates. Secondly, there were the people
with limited capacity who equally feel that an advocate can be an
intrusion on their rights and liberty. Then there are the organisations
which work with people who lack capacity and which frequently come into
contact with people who have been subject to abuse or discriminatory
treatment, who on the whole take a much more positive attitude towards
advocates. In trying to meet the needs of those three distinct 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_104"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 104</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>groups, it is extremely difficult in practice to strike the right
balance. That is the context in which we need to look at these
provisions.</p><p><a name="06100910000573"></a>I welcome the
regulations, given that they bear the hallmark of work and views that
have been changed in the light of practice and of consultation. But I
need to make a few points. I should have stated at the beginning that I
declare an interest as an employee of Age Concern England, which is a
member of the Making Decisions Alliance.</p><p><a name="06100910000574"></a>My first point&#151;that there have
been pilots&#151;was referred to by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. I join
him in asking the Minister to tell us what findings have come from the
pilots so far. Will the Government give an undertaking to keep those
pilots under review? It is only by seeing how the legislation works in
practice that we can continue to improve it, even at this stage when it
is being implemented.</p><p><a name="06100910000575"></a>It is
welcome that the regulations recognise that there will be
circumstances, other than those envisaged when the legislation was
passed, in which an independent mental capacity advocate is needed. I
am glad that a discretionary power is given to local authorities and to
health bodies to vary the circumstances in which an IMCA is
appointed.</p><p><a name="06100910000576"></a>I draw the
Minister&#146;s attention to the fact that the regulations
specifically describe the situations in which an IMCA can be appointed.
The guidance is much wider. That may not make a considerable difference
to statutory authorities, but it may to the people who are the
potential users of IMCA services. They may look at the regulations
rather than at the guidance. What will be done to ensure that the
extent to which this power is discretionary and available is made known
to individuals who may use
it?</p><p><a name="06100910000577"></a>My second point is about the
circumstances in which an IMCA could be appointed, particularly when a
deputy has been appointed by the court of protection. We know that
deputies are taking over the functions previously held by appointees,
and that they will have both a financial and a welfare role in the
lives of people who lack capacity. There could be a conflict of
interest for a court-appointed deputy. Therefore, it is possible that
for an individual&#146;s interests to be best served an independent
advocate might be needed, particularly when decisions are being made
about precisely where care should be received. As the noble Earl, Lord
Howe, said, social services departments are under considerable
budgetary pressures, particularly on residential care, and it may be
that the conflict for the person from a local authority acting as a
deputy would be too great.</p><p><a name="06100910000578"></a>The
next area I need to ask the Minister about is clarifying the links
between an independent mental capacity advocate provided under the
Bournewood contacts and the Mental Capacity Act. Will he clarify the
potential overlap between those different initiatives?</p><p><a name="06100910000579"></a>I want to echo the point made by the
noble Earl, Lord Howe, that while the regulations make clear that the
Government see a priority in those who have neither friends nor
relatives to look after their interests, there are occasions&#151;it
was always envisaged that there would be&#151;when people need
assistance; 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_105"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for example, where a person&#146;s relatives are on the other side of
the world in Australia, or where there are disputes within families.
There is a need to make it clear, not just to local authorities but
also to individuals, that they can in those circumstances have access
to independent advice.</p><p><a name="06100910000580"></a>Finally,
I too want to ask the Minister whether the research from the pilots
will give us an indication about the availability of advocacy and the
ease with which it can be accessed. It is the Government&#146;s
intention, I understand, to recruit many of the IMCAs from existing
advocacy schemes. The problem with that is that many advocacy schemes
which exist within the voluntary sector exist on a very perilous basis.
Getting funding for advocacy schemes is extremely difficult. From the
pilots so far, what has been the level of demand? What has been the
level of demand from people with relatives or friends? Is there an
available pool of advocates to meet that need? With those questions, I
too welcome the
regulations.</p><p><a name="06100910000581"></a><b><a name="06100910001532"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Lord
Warner):</b> My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords
for their support for the regulations. Both noble Lords opposite raised
issues about what we have learned from the IMCA pilot schemes. The
pilot schemes have been working since January 2006 with people with
dementia, brain injury, a learning disability or mental health needs
where important decisions about medical treatment and residence are
being made. We will be producing guidance for the national
implementation of the IMCA service, which is based on the experience of
the pilots. Cambridge University is undertaking a cross-site research
project aimed at learning lessons from the seven sites and producing
practical guidance. The short answer is that we will be drawing on the
pilots in that way. The pilots will stop in April when, as I said in my
opening remarks, the new service comes into operation across the
country.</p><p><a name="06100910000582"></a>In answer to another
question, we have given a commitment both to monitor the service and to
commission an evaluation of the new service across the country after
the first year. That has been agreed to; we are committed to that; and
we will take it forward.</p><p><a name="06100910000583"></a>Yes,
there is new money. The IMCA is being funded from that new money by the
Department of Health through local authorities. There is &#163;6.5
million for IMCAs and &#163;12.5 million for the Act
itself.</p><p><a name="06100910000584"></a>The noble Earl, Lord
Howe, asked whether we are pulling together the threads of a national
strategy for advocacy. That is an important issue, but it is also
important that advocacy services are bespoke to the sets of services
that they are trying to provide and the needs that they are
trying to meet. However, the different strands of advocacy will be
brought together with one unified training qualification for all
advocates. So we are moving in that direction, but I emphasise the
importance of &#147;bespokeness&#148;, if I may coin a new word, to
ensure that people's particular needs are
met.</p><p><a name="06100910000585"></a>On care reviews, yes, IMCAs
can work with people who have not been previously involved with an
IMCA. We have given that commitment. Are there 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_106"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 106</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>enough IMCAs? I am reliably advised that there is great interest in the
role and there are lots of applications. On who will make sure that
knowledge is available locally, each local authority is responsible for
advertising the service&#151;making its existence known&#151;and
local authorities have already started work in this area and are
gearing up for those new
responsibilities.</p><p><a name="06100910000586"></a>The noble
Baroness, Lady Barker, asked whether an IMCA should be appointed where
a local authority is appointed as the deputy. The advice that I have
been given is that it will be rare for the Court of Protection to
appoint a director of social services as a deputy because of the
potential conflict of interest. Where it does so, the court must be
satisfied that he or she can perform his or her duties impartially. I
shall look further into that and if there is any more that I can
usefully add, I shall write to the noble Baroness and the noble Earl,
Lord Howe.</p><p><a name="06100910000587"></a>The noble Baroness
also raised the issue of how the IMCA relates to the Bournewood
situation. My understanding is that the Bournewood proposals would
simply add another situation in which an IMCA would be appointed. We
agree that guidance and training will be important and welcome the
continuing involvement by all stakeholders in the Bournewood
implementation advisory network. We are trying to join this
together.</p><p><a name="06100910000588"></a>I hope that I have
answered most of the points made by noble Lords and that, after this
constructive discussion, we can pass the
regulations.</p><p><a name="06100910000589"></a>On Question, Motion
agreed
to.</p>

(Northern Ireland) Order

Rooker</b> rose to move, That the draft order laid
before the House on 4 July be
approved.</p><p><a name="06100910000591"></a>The
noble Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of the Smoking (Northern
Ireland) Order 2006 is to ensure that the public and employees are
protected from exposure to tobacco smoke. The order would introduce
provisions to control smoking in enclosed public places and
workplaces.</p><p><a name="06100910000592"></a>In
summary, it introduces four new offences: failure to display no smoking
signs; smoking in a smoke-free place; failing to prevent smoking in a
smoke-free place; and obstructing an authorised
officer.</p><p><a name="06100910000593"></a>In
addition, the order includes enabling powers so that the department
could by regulation: define the meaning of &#147;enclosed&#148; and
&#147;substantially enclosed&#148;; specify exemptions; set out the
amount of fixed penalties; and amend the age limit for sale of tobacco
products to young
persons.</p><p><a name="06100910000594"></a>I should
make it absolutely clear at this stage that the Government have no
plans to change the age of sale in Northern Ireland at present and
simply propose to take a power to enable a future devolved
Administration to decide how best to proceed&#151;so that the power
is there if they wish to do so.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_107"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 107</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06100910000595"></a>I should also point out
that, unlike the Health Act 2006, the draft order would not permit an
exemption for performers in those theatres which are licensed premises
under the Licensing (Northern Ireland) Order
1996.</p><p><a name="06100910000596"></a>Article 4(iii) of the
draft order provides that regulations may not exempt premises for which
a licence under the 1996 order is in force. My honourable friend the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Paul Goggins, will take the
earliest opportunity to ensure that the position in Northern Ireland
mirrors that in England. This has arisen purely as a result of a human
error in the drafting.</p><p><a name="06100910000597"></a>I am also
pleased to report that in Northern Ireland there has been strong
cross-party political support for comprehensive controls on smoking in
enclosed public places and workplaces, as well as support from a wide
range of interested parties including health professionals, local
councils, the voluntary sector and trade unions. The cost of
introducing these provisions in Northern Ireland is estimated to be
just under &#163;6 million in 2007-08 and &#163;3 million in
2008-09. This is to cover enforcement, which includes a compliance
telephone helpline, and a communications programme, signage and support
for smoking-cessation services. Guidance on the implications of
smoke-free legislation will be widely distributed to enforcement
officers, employers and the public. The Government are confident that,
as a result of this new legislation, lives will be saved and
smoking-related illnesses reduced. I beg to move.</p><p><a name="06100910000598"></a>Moved, That the draft order laid before
the House on 4 July be approved.&#151;(<I>Lord
Rooker.</I>)</p><p><a name="06100910000599"></a><b><a name="06100910001534"></a>Lord
Glentoran:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
presenting the order succinctly, as he always does. I am not very happy
about the order. I support, as does my party, the prohibition of
smoking in various places. However, it appears that the Government have
not reflected in the order the lengthy and constructive debates on the
Health Bill as it went through Parliament. The orders contain many of
the flaws, in particular the lack of definition and the non-appearance
of the detailed regulations in time for industry to comply with them,
which were improved in that Bill. That is a significant
deficiency.</p><p><a name="06100910000600"></a>The debate about the
validity of the smoking ban has gone on for a long time, and I do not
want to go over any of that ground again. However, we need to pay
attention to the question of the premises to which the ban should be
applied, and how it should be applied, and to the certainty of its
effectiveness or lack of effectiveness. These matters, particularly the
definition of &#147;enclosed&#148; and &#147;substantially
enclosed&#148;, were debated at some length in our consideration of
the other Bill.</p><p><a name="06100910000601"></a>If the
Government do not bring out sensible and clear regulations soon, places
of work will have a very difficult time identifying whether they are to
be smoke-free and in making provisions for smokers. Delayed regulations
will lead to difficulty in getting planning permission for alterations
in time, to unnecessary compliance costs, and to increased uncertainty
among the wider public about what is 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_108"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>allowed. There is a total lack of clarity in this order, particularly
compared with the Health Bill for the rest of the United Kingdom. There
are specific exemptions. The Health Bill identified several places that
were definitely exempt, including care homes, tobacconists, research
facilities and theatre stages in certain circumstances. The orders do
not mention any of these places. Why not? The order allows that a
private home may be exempt, leaving the power to ban smoking, even in a
private individual&#146;s home. Some people also note that the
smoking ban will increase smoking in the home. That cannot be
good.</p><p><a name="06100910000602"></a>Under the order, smoking
could be banned in all vehicles at all times. During consideration of
the Health Bill, the Government confirmed that they intended to ban
smoking in all vehicles used as a place of work, unless they were
always used by only one person. Is that not confusing? How will that be
enforced? The tractor man across the hill in the fields usually smokes,
something happens and his boss has to come and get the tractor. Is he
guilty? How ridiculous. This would mean exactly that. A tractor would
be smoke-free if each farmer had one of his own, but the world simply
is not like that. On many days, people do not know what vehicle they
will get into when they get to work, as I am sure noble Lords know for
themselves.</p><p><a name="06100910000603"></a>The order allows
government regulations on signage to be excessive, burdensome and
permanent. We have enough burdensome and permanent graffiti in Northern
Ireland without having uncontrolled no-smoking signs all over the walls
of our lovely buildings. There should be controls and management, and
there should be liability for planning permission and proper
management.</p><p><a name="06100910000604"></a>The order allows
the Government to raise the legal age at which tobacco can be bought to
any age, as the Minister highlighted. The Health Bill for the United
Kingdom states that the age should not be raised above 18 years. Why is
that not included in this Bill? In principle, we support the order, but
I am extremely unhappy at how it has been put
together.</p><h5><a name="06100910000867"></a>8.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06100910000605"></a><b><a name="06100910001535"></a>Baroness
Harris of Richmond:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the
Minister for introducing this order. I assure him that we very much
welcome it. It is a bold legislative step to ban smoking in public
places, but it is necessary. I was pleased to see that almost all those
who responded to the consultation opted for a total ban on smoking in
public places. The BMA&#146;s 2002 report concluded that there are at
least 1,000 preventable deaths every year which are the result of
passive smoking. We have heard that the BMA and the Royal College of
Nursing support a complete ban in enclosed public spaces and we on
these Benches agree.</p><p><a name="06100910000606"></a>As we have
seen from the Republic of Ireland, the issues of compliance and
enforcement will not loom large. If Ireland can enforce the law, and
publicans and others comply in the way that they do to a large extent,
the same should be true in Northern Ireland. This is a basic health and
safety issue. A smoke-free environment should be the norm where
non-smokers 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_109"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 109</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>work. They should have freedom to work in an environment free of
damaging substances. I believe that that is where the freedom issue
lies: it is not in the freedom to smoke in the presence of others, but
in being free of other people&#146;s smoke that can damage
one&#146;s health.</p><p><a name="06100910000607"></a>In addition
to the immediate effect on employees and customers, there are of course
wider benefits to be reaped in banning smoking. Such a ban would
clearly help to reduce smoking in the population as a whole, which can
be only a good thing. No-smoking laws have been shown to support
smokers to quit. In the Republic of Ireland, a survey by the National
Smokers&#146; Quitline service revealed that about 10,000 smokers
reported that they had reduced their consumption since the ban came
into force. According to the Irish Revenue Commissioners, cigarette
sales fell by nearly 16 per cent in the first six months of the
ban.</p><p><a name="06100910000608"></a>Finally, we should note the
words of the BMA&#146;s head of science and ethics. Dr Vivienne
Nathanson said:</p><ul><a name="06100910000814"></a>&#147;The
medical profession is united in its calls for a total ban on smoking in
all enclosed public places and workplaces. Recent research reports that
second-hand smoke kills 30 people each day. The situation in New York,
Ireland and other cities and countries that have gone smoke-free show
that these policies do not harm business, they do not cost jobs. The
policies are popular, they encourage people to quit and they protect
health and save lives. What possible argument is there for not
implementing a total
ban?&#148;</ul><p><a name="06100910000609"></a><b><a name="06100910001536"></a>Lord
Rogan:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for
introducing this draft order. I speak briefly and simply to assure the
Minister that many of us who live and work in Northern Ireland
generally welcome and support this
order.</p><p><a name="06100910000610"></a><b><a name="06100910001537"></a>Lord
Dubs:</b> My Lords, I also welcome with great
enthusiasm what the Minister has said and that the Government are now
bringing this in. When we look back on the debates that have taken
place, we will not wonder why we did it. We will wonder why it took us
so long to introduce these measures, which are self-evidently sensible
and proper. They have the support of the majority of people, even
smokers, as is evidenced from research in Ireland. They have the
support of the medical profession and they accord entirely with common
sense.</p><p><a name="06100910000611"></a>When is the proposed
starting date? In Scotland in August, I asked a man who ran a pub what
he thought. He said, &#147;Well, it&#146;s very straightforward
now. I suppose if there is any tension, it will be in the winter when
people can&#146;t smoke outside&#148;. I am sure that my noble
friend has answers to the following specific points. What will happen
in prisons, in long-stay hospitals, particularly mental illness
hospitals, and in hospices? These questions are not intended to be
hostile. I am totally in favour of the Government&#146;s measure. I
wish them good luck in implementing
it.</p><p><a name="06100910000612"></a><b><a name="06100910001538"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, I am deeply appreciative of the
comments made by my noble friend Lord Dubs, the noble Lord, Lord Rogan,
and the noble 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_110"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond. I am slightly less appreciative of
those made by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. They were a bit churlish
because they showed support in some ways but in others not, and I
genuinely think that some of the issues he raised were misplaced. There
is widespread support for this and from a practical point of view I am
absolutely certain that the introduction of this policy will be as
successful as it has been not just elsewhere in the United Kingdom and
the Republic, but also as far afield as New
York.</p><p><a name="06100910000613"></a>In my brief introduction
to the order&#151;I am not going to take much longer over the
wind-up&#151;I have been reluctant to flood noble Lords with
statistics, but a few are worth repeating. Some 74 per cent of adults
in Northern Ireland do not smoke, leaving an estimated 330,000 smokers.
It is reckoned that 14,000 people will give up as a result of the
change. Currently there are around 2,300 deaths per year from
smoking-related diseases, which is nearly 50 people a week. Expenditure
by the NHS is running at around &#163;44 million. Based on other
evidence, it is estimated that around 60 deaths will be avoided as a
direct result of the ban, both by people giving up and by not starting
to smoke. So there are some clear benefits. As my noble friend Lord
Dubs said, the question that will be asked in the future is why we took
so long to do this.</p><p><a name="06100910000614"></a>My noble
friend asked about the date the regulations will come into force. It is
envisaged to be in April next year, although the exact date has not yet
been decided. However, I am sure that the Minister will give us a date
fairly soon. There is a choice of 30 days so I am not sure
which one it will be.</p><p><a name="06100910000615"></a>Draft
regulations are currently out for consultation. They will put meat on
the bones of many of these issues. The consultation will close
on 3 November and I do not want to pre-empt it. However, on
prisons and hospitals, we have to take a pragmatic view. The
director-general of the Prison Service is committed to following the
spirit of the regulations in prisons, but one has to remember that
people sometimes live and work in the same place and therefore one has
to look at the issue from more than one perspective. I do accept the
point made about hospitals and hospices. I think I mentioned before
that at one time I spent a lot of time in the cancer ward of a
hospital. Hidden away in that hospital was a room with a sign saying,
&#147;Smoking: cancer patients only&#148;. There comes a time when
you have got to be fairly pragmatic about some of these aspects of the
issue.</p><p><a name="06100910000616"></a>The responses to the
public consultation exercise show that an overwhelming majority are in
favour of doing something within a ban, but there is not always a
consensus about its particular aspects. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran,
made a point about the minimum age for smoking. I do not want to start
another debate, but I did mention that we want to leave it to locally
elected politicians to decide this. I do not care what age is chosen,
but if elected politicians in Northern Ireland decide on a minimum age
at which tobacco can be purchased, that is their decision for which
they will be accountable. I cannot think of a 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_111"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>better way of doing it. We have therefore put a power in the regulations
for the assembly to choose whatever age it considers appropriate for
Northern Ireland. That kind of thing should not be set down by us
here.</p><p><a name="06100910000617"></a>We are keen to see the
results of the present consultation, and that is why we have not
specified everything in the order. On the assertion that a smoking ban
will mean that smokers will smoke more at home, I believe that in the
end the message will get across that smoking is not a healthy thing
either for smokers themselves or other people. It is difficult to
legislate for that. Nevertheless, international experience provides no
evidence to support the view that there will be more smoking at home.
Information relating to New York, where the Smoke-Free Air Act was
passed in March 2003, shows that between 2002 and 2004 exposure to
second-hand smoke in New York homes dropped by more than one-third. I
cannot believe that smokers here would operate any
differently.</p><p><a name="06100910000618"></a>Another point in
relation to what happens was contained in a report in <I>Environmental
Health News</I><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_112"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in July 2005, which suggested that the number of smoke-free homes in the
Republic of Ireland had increased by 5 per cent in the year following
the introduction of smoke-free legislation. So it may seem like an old
wives&#146; tale but I say to the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, that
the evidence is on my side.</p><p><a name="06100910000619"></a>The
definitions of &#147;enclosed&#148; and &#147;partially
enclosed&#148; set out in the regulations are currently subject to
consultation and we will get them in due course. As I say, this is a
two-stage process. The Government&#146;s aim is not to penalise
smokers but to protect the public and employees from exposure to
second-hand smoke. It is clear from our point of view that there is
widespread support across Northern Ireland and I am grateful for the
overwhelming support that has been given to the order. I am fairly
certain that the details&#151;I shall not call them
nitpicking&#151;that were raised will be fully answered in the
consultation on the current draft regulations.</p><p><a name="06100910000620"></a>On Question, Motion agreed
to.</p><ul><ul><ul>House adjourned at
eighteen minutes before nine

Drugs</h3><p><a name="0610055000057"></a><b><a name="0610055000427"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office
(Lord Triesman):</b> My honourable friend the
Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Dr Kim Howells)
has made the following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="0610055000058"></a>Further to my Written
Ministerial Statement of 13 July, the United Nations Office on
Drugs and Crime (UNODC) announced on 2 September its estimate that
opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan had risen to a record high of
165,000 hectares, up 59 per cent from 104,000 hectares in
2005. On 12 September in Brussels, UNODC released a summary
report with a breakdown of cultivation levels by province. UNODC will
publish its full annual opium survey for Afghanistan at the end of
October. Although anticipated, the scale of the increase in opium poppy
cultivation in Afghanistan is very disappointing. Ninety-two per cent
of the 61,000 hectare increase is due to a substantial rise in
cultivation in Helmand and three other southern provinces; 70% of the
increase is in Helmand alone. This reflects the very difficult security
situation and limited law enforcement capability
there.</p><p><a name="0610055000059"></a>Cultivation varies
considerably across the country&#151;both between and within
provinces. Three of the four highest poppy cultivating provinces in
2005 are down this year. In Nangarhar cultivation remains at negligible
levels across most of the province, which in 2004 was second only
to Helmand. Where access to governance, security and
development have improved, reductions achieved last year have been
sustained, and in some cases, cultivation has fallen
further.</p><p><a name="0610055000060"></a>Having just returned
from Afghanistan, I am convinced that the Afghan Government's national
drug control strategy is the right one. Only by tackling the
traffickers who profit from the trade, building strong and effective
institutions, strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihoods
and dealing with the drug addiction that is taking hold within
Afghanistan itself, can we hope to address the problem. President
Karzai and his Government are committed to tackling the trade and will
take action against the corruption that threatens to undermine these
efforts. At the second<sup></sup>National Counter-Narcotics Conference
on 22 August, President Karzai noted that poppy cultivation and the
drugs trade was Afghanistan's greatest enemy and that Afghanistan had
no option but to eliminate poppy. As partner nation for
counter-narcotics, the UK remains determined to work with President
Karzai's Government to bring about a sustained reduction in the
production of opium and heroin and rid Afghanistan of the scourge of
the drugs trade.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS2"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column WS2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h3 align="center"><a name="0610055000003"></a>Afghanistan:

Deployment</h3><p><a name="0610055000061"></a><b><a name="0610055000428"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord
Drayson):</b> My right honourable friend the
Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Des Browne) has made the following
Written Ministerial
Statement:</p><p><a name="0610055000062"></a>Both the International
Security Assistance Force, and coalition forces in Afghanistan, are
experiencing a surge in their requirement for Air Support. To help meet
that need, I have decided temporarily to deploy a seventh Harrier GR7a
aircraft and a small number of additional personnel to Kandahar
airfield. As with any operational commitment, the duration of this
deployment will be kept under constant
review.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0610055000004"></a>Africa:
Humanitarian Update for East Africa and the
Horn</h3><p><a name="0610055000063"></a><b><a name="0610055000429"></a>The
Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos):</b> My
right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International
Development has made the following
Statement.</p><p><a name="0610055000064"></a>At the beginning of
this year the UN judged that 8.2 million people in East Africa and the
Horn were in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, mainly food aid,
following the worst drought for a decade. Since then approximately
490,000 million tonnes of food aid has been delivered to respond to
these needs. Additional assistance has been provided in the form of
emergency medical, nutritional, water and sanitation, shelter and other
forms of relief. The UK has provided approximately &#163;55
million or $103.9 million towards this. Overall the
international donor community has provided over $660 million towards
the relief
effort.</p><p><a name="0610055000065"></a>The
long rains in the early and mid part of 2006 have led to improvements
in most areas. Unfortunately, most notably in Ethiopia, flooding has
brought its own tragedy as over 600 people have died and more than
150,000 have lost their homes or been affected in one way or another.
Most recently DfID has made available a further &#163;6 million for
humanitarian assistance in Kenya, where malnutrition rates remain high
and current season harvest assessments present a very mixed picture. In
Ethiopia we have provided &#163;l million for urgent relief to
flood-affected
people.</p><p><a name="0610055000066"></a>Humanitarian
assistance is still needed to address the urgent medical and
nutritional needs of the most seriously sick and malnourished, and to
meet other basic needs, including clean water, to reduce the risks of
death and disease. Basic humanitarian indicators remain worrying, but
we expect that the steps taken by relief agencies have mitigated what
might have been more serious consequences, such as widespread mortality
and displacement. We are closely monitoring the
situation.</p><p><a name="0610055000067"></a>Assistance
is also being provided in an effort to improve productive capacity by
investing in livestock or other farming inputs such as seeds, tools and
livestock vaccinations. However, it remains a challenge to achieve
sustained benefits for the poorest and most vulnerable 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS3"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column WS3</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>communities. In Ethiopia we are leading supporters of a productive
safety nets programme to tackle chronic hunger. We are working on the
development of a similar programme in Kenya. It is also important to
note that substantial risks remain from conflict in the region, and we
are working closely with the international community to promote peace
and stability as a prerequisite to finding long-term solutions
to persistent humanitarian
crises.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0610055000005"></a>Civil
Service: Sickness
Absence</h3><p><a name="0610055000068"></a><b><a name="0610055000430"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> The report <I>Analysis of
Sickness Absence in the Home Civil Service 2005 </I>prepared for the
Cabinet Office by RED Scientific Limited shows that the headline figure
for the average level of sickness absence was 9.8 days per staff year.
The report contains a comprehensive analysis of the 2005 figures by
department/agency.</p><p><a name="0610055000069"></a>The Cabinet
Office is continuing to work with other departments and agencies as
they work to reduce sickness absence and progress with their
implementation of the recommendations of the <I>Managing Attendance in
the Public Sector</I> report published by the Ministerial Task Force on
Health, Safety and
Productivity.</p><p><a name="0610055000070"></a>The increase in the
number of working days lost was primarily due to a change in the
methodology used for analysing data. If the 2004 methodology had been
used for the 2005 report, the adjusted average working days lost figure
would have been 8.8 days per staff year, a drop of 0.3
days.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0610055000006"></a>Department
for Work and Pensions: Office Support
Services</h3><p><a name="0610055000071"></a><b><a name="0610055000431"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and
Pensions (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> My
honourable friend the Minister of State for Pensions Reform (James
Purnell) has made the following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="0610055000072"></a>After completing a
detailed commercial and tendering exercise, I wish to announce that
Haden Building Management are to be awarded a seven-year contract for
the delivery of a suite of office services to the Department for Work
and Pensions.</p><p><a name="0610055000073"></a>In January 2005,
following a wide-ranging review of support services, senior officials
in my department, with the support of Ministers, concluded that bids
for the future provision of all our office support services should be
invited from specialist external suppliers in the private sector.
Inviting bids for a single national contract for the supply of office
services from the private sector would allow us to harness the benefits
afforded by new technology, organisational efficiencies and the agility
to respond to our changing needs as the department is modernised and
reformed.</p><p><a name="0610055000074"></a>These
office support services, which include post opening and despatch,
messengerial work, switchboard operations, typing and secretarial
services, are currently delivered through a range of external suppliers
and in-house teams as well as forming part of the tasks of 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS4"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column WS4</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>staff who serve the public directly. These arrangements have served us
well in the past but the review concluded that these methods of
delivery no longer provided best value for money and that, in their
current state, would not provide the best service in the
future.</p><p><a name="0610055000075"></a>Since the review,
officials have been undertaking a competitive tendering exercise, in
accordance with EU procurement rules, to select a supplier who can
provide the services we require and offer best value for money.
Following a rigorous evaluation of bids, the contract has been awarded
to Haden Building Management with the new supply arrangements expected
to commence on 1 March 2007.</p><p><a name="0610055000076"></a>This
decision will mean that some jobs currently undertaken by DWP staff and
our existing external providers will transfer to the new supplier. In
total around 700 DWP staff nationally may transfer. Greatest numbers of
DWP staff affected are based in Scotland, Wales and north-west England
with other smaller groups in London and the north-east. We recognise
that some staff may not wish to transfer and for these we will, where
possible, offer the opportunity to redeploy within DWP or other
government departments although we cannot guarantee this. Given the
general unavailability of suitable alternative posts, however, the
likelihood is that many staff engaged in support services will transfer
to the new contractor under the protection of
TUPE.</p><p><a name="0610055000077"></a>Proposals put forward by
Haden provide more efficient ways of working and take account of the
departmental modernisation programme. This is likely to result in a
reduction of staff required to deliver office service contract
arrangements over a period of
time.</p><p><a name="0610055000078"></a>Officials have been meeting
with trade unions and keeping staff affected by these changes informed
of progress on an ongoing basis. Over the coming months they will
continue to consult with trade unions and work with managers and HR
advisors on all matters relating to the transfer of
staff.</p><p><a name="0610055000079"></a>I will keep Members with
significant numbers of affected constituents updated on our progress
over the next few months. I am confident that these plans, for the
future delivery of office services, will help support our overall goal
of moving to a leaner and fitter organisation delivering world-class
services to our
customers.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0610055000007"></a>Disability:

Regulation</h3><p><a name="0610055000134"></a><b><a name="0610055000434"></a>Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</b> My honourable Friend the
Economic Secretary (Mr Ed Balls) has made the following Written
Ministerial Statement.</p><p><a name="0610055000135"></a>Concerns
have been expressed to the Government about the effects of a possible
takeover of the LSE by a company based outside the UK on the
LSE&#146;s rules, in particular the rules applying to those companies
whose securities are traded on the LSE&#146;s markets. This is a
concern that the Government share. In this statement I set out our
approach.</p><p><a name="0610055000136"></a>The Government are
neutral as to the nationality of the owners of Recognised Bodies
(RBs)<sup>1</sup>. Of the current RBs, five are subsidiaries of
overseas-based companies. Openness to overseas investment has been an
important part of the success of the City in recent years and will
continue to be in the future.</p><p><a name="0610055000137"></a>The
Government would also not seek to intervene in the independent
judgments of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and the competition
authorities in respect of any changes of ownership of RBs. The FSA and
the competition authorities have specific tasks to perform on an
independent basis within clear legislative frameworks set out by
Parliament. Independence and indifference to nationality are key
elements of the UK&#146;s regulatory
regime.</p><p><a name="0610055000138"></a>Investors, issuers of
securities, and members of RBs all have an interest in RBs having rules
which strike a balance appropriate to that body between the benefits of
the restrictions, particularly in terms of investor protection and the
impacts on issuers, members and other stakeholders. Such a balance is
vital to ensuring exchanges play their role in creating deep and liquid
capital markets which promote economic growth. In this respect, the
Government believe it is essential that changes of ownership of RBs
should not put at risk the achievement of such a balance by
RBs.</p><p><a name="0610055000139"></a>Our current regulatory
regime for RBs is based on high-level legislative principles
supplemented by FSA guidance. Within this framework, RBs have the
freedom to develop their own rule books in consultation with their
members.</p><p><a name="0610055000140"></a>I have
discussed these issues widely in recent months and made clear that I
would expect any potential new owners of the LSE to want to provide
certainty and reassurance to the exchange&#146;s stakeholders. I
welcome the statement which the US Securities and Exchange Commission
issued on 16 June. This provided a helpful clarification of how the SEC
sees the current position in respect of the scope of US securities
laws.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS8"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column WS8</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="0610055000141"></a>However, as the FSA pointed out in its
statement of 12 June, there is a degree of uncertainty about how
overseas ownership of the LSE would affect its regulatory regime. It
depends on exactly how any owner would attempt to integrate the LSE
with its existing business and the legal framework in other countries,
both of which can be subject to
change.</p><p><a name="0610055000142"></a>It is important that
there is certainty that the rules of RBs in the UK will continue to be
proportionate, balancing the benefits of restrictions with the impacts
on stakeholders.</p><p><a name="0610055000143"></a>The Government
will now legislate to enhance the FSA&#146;s powers in this area.
This will confer power on the FSA to veto changes to the rules of an RB
in defined circumstances. The aim would be to enable the FSA to stop
RBs making rule changes whose effects on issuers and others were likely
to be disproportionate to the public benefits. The Government will
provide further details in due
course.</p><p><a name="0610055000144"></a>The purpose of such a
change to legislation is not to involve the FSA in the day-to-day
commercial judgments of the RBs. The power will be a right of veto and
not a right of approval of rule changes. It will provide a back stop to
ensure that the RB&#146;s stakeholders can be certain about the
proportionality of the rules of the RB going
forward.</p><p><a name="0610055000145"></a>This new provision will
ensure that UK RBsremain open to overseas ownership. It makes
the permissible outer limits of the RB&#146;s rules blind to the
nationality of their ownership by entrenching better regulation
principles in respect of those
rules.</p><p><a name="0610055000146"></a>It should also be clear
that we will not allow this legislation to be evaded through abuse of
our Recognised Overseas Investment Exchange and Clearing House
regimes.</p><ul><a name="0610055000426"></a><sup>1</sup> Under
Section 18 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 there are
seven recognized investment exchanges (the London Stock Exchange,
London International Financial Futures Exchange, EDX London, Virt-X,
ICE Futures, the London Metal Exchange and NYMEX Europe) and two
recognized clearing houses (CREST and LCH.Clearnet

software was delivered by the contractor in final form more than a year
behind schedule; and independent final testing which replicated SSPL's
own test criteria discovered an unacceptable level of faults.
Departmental officials worked with the company throughout the contract
to address shortcomings, but came to the conclusion that this strong
course of action wasthe only one available. This decision was
communicated to SSPL on 20 July 2006. The department will be seeking to
recoup the &#163;1.06 million spent on the development of the new
software as well as the associated
costs.</p><p><a name="0610055000151"></a>Scout Solutions Projects
Limited has also been providing existing mobility services alongside
the development of the new services. They will continue to be paid to
provide these services under the terms of the contract for a
transitional period. The funding for these existing services which were
delivered has been &#163;9.7 million. Mobility services are important
to tenants, and the department will be seeking to put alternative
provision in place building on the success of choice-based letting
schemes.</p><p><a name="0610055000152"></a>Throughout this period,
social housing applicants and tenants have continued to use direct
methods to move within social housing. For example, in 2004/05 alone,
over 15,500 LA tenants completed mutual
exchanges.</p><p><a name="0610055000153"></a>The matter is now the
subject of discussions between DCLG and the
contractor.</p>

Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos):</b> My
right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International
Development has made the following
statement.</p><p><a name="0610055000159"></a>I have approved
support of &#163;252 million over five years for the second phase of
the Government of India&#146;s nationwide Reproductive and Child
Health Programme. DfID will disburse &#163;10 million in financial
assistance plus a further &#163;700,000 in technical assistance in
2006-07. Thereafter, annual disbursements will be subject to
satisfactory reports on
progress.</p><p><a name="0610055000160"></a>This programme will
support the Government of India in tackling India&#146;s huge burden
of maternal and infant mortality. One-fifth (136,000) of all maternal
deaths in the world, and one-quarter (1.8 million) of all infant deaths
occur in India. Globally we will not reach the millennium development
goals to reduce these deaths unless we succeed in India. The
Reproductive and Child Health Programme is the Indian
Government&#146;s single biggest response to meet this challenge. The
programme aims to reduce the maternal mortality ratio from 407/100,000
live births in 1998 to 100/100,000 in 2015, and the infant mortality
rate from 70/1,000 live births in 1998 to 30/1,000 in 2015. If the
programme achieves all its targets, over 1 million lives will be saved
each year.</p><p><a name="0610055000161"></a>The programme will
introduce new measures to tackle concerns about procurement
irregularities in the first phase of the Reproductive and Child Health
Programme, which was not funded by DfID. An action plan will help to
strengthen competitive tendering procedures and increase transparency
for the purchasing of drugs and equipment, and new standards will be
introduced to improve the quality of products. Until these measures
take effect, all procurement contracts over $200,000 will be handled by
international agents.</p><p><a name="0610055000162"></a>The total
cost of this second phase of the Reproductive and Child Health
Programme is around &#163;5 billion, which the Indian central and
state Governments will meet the bulk of. External aid will be around 15
per cent of the overall budget, with the single largest contribution
coming from DfID. Our aid is being fully co-ordinated with other
development partners, including the World
Bank.</p><p><a name="0610055000163"></a>The Reproductive and Child
Health Programme is universal in coverage, and it will provide care
through pregnancy, childbirth and childhood. But resources will be
targeted on India&#146;s poorest states, including Uttar Pradesh,
Bihar, Orissa, and Madhya Pradesh and will especially target women and
children among the poorest and most marginalised families, in scheduled
castes and scheduled
tribes.</p><p><a name="0610055000164"></a>DfID&#146;s financial
support will be used for upgrading maternity facilities; increasing
skilled attendance at birth; the purchase of essential drugs,
equipment, supplies and contraceptives; staff training; communications;
the piloting of new ideas; and assessing the impact of the programme.

to the programme at central and state level, and strengthen health
sector
procurement.</p><p><a name="0610055000165"></a>This
second phase of the programme is ambitious and will require a huge
expansion in the delivery of public sector health services to tackle
some of the country&#146;s biggest health problems. It also includes
a number of additional accountability and financial management
safeguards to strengthen the Government&#146;s anti-corruption
systems. The programme will be monitored closely by the Indian
Government and development partners, through reviews every six months.

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord
Drayson):</b> My right honourable friend the
Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Des Browne) has made the following
Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p><a name="0610055000167"></a>On
18 July in a Written Ministerial Statement I confirmed the details of
the force package for the next routine roulement of UK forces in Iraq
in November when the lead UK formation, currently 20 Armoured Brigade,
will be replaced by 19 Light Brigade. I would now like to confirm some
of the details of preparations for this roulement. As for previous
roulements, elements of the theatre reserve battalion, currently the
2nd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, will be deployed to
provide additional security during what is always a period of intense
activity for UK forces. There will also be some additional support
aimed at contributing to improving security in Basra
city.</p><p><a name="0610055000168"></a>In total this involves
approximately 360 additional personnel. They will begin deploying
shortly and complete their work not later than January
2007.</p><p><a name="0610055000169"></a>This is a critical period
for the Iraqi people and their Government. There is an opportunity to
improve significantly the security situation in Basra
city&#151;building on, and reinforcing, recent progress in Baghdad.
Improved security in Basra will create the conditions for the important
civil development work being led by the UK&#146;s provincial
reconstruction team. Therefore I have agreed that the deployment of
troops from the theatre reserve battalion, while strictly time limited,
should on this occasion be brought forward and extended by a short
period. In addition, I have also authorised the deployment of Royal
Engineers to assist with reconstruction and countering the threat from
improvised explosive devices, a Royal Marine boat troop to assist in
tightening security on the Shatt Al Arab waterway, and a troop of Royal
Military Police to augment our training of the Iraqi
police.</p><p><a name="0610055000170"></a>We ask our service men

Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos):</b> My
right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International
Development has made the following
statement.</p><p><a name="0610055000172"></a>The recent conflict in
Lebanon caused great harm to the civilian populations in both Israel
and Lebanon. A million people, a quarter of Lebanon&#146;s
population, were displaced by the fighting and in Israel 300,000 people
were reported to have fled their homes or taken to shelters. Israel had
every right to defend itself against Hezbollah, but from the beginning
we expressed the need for a proportionate response. I believe that this
requires all sides to respect international humanitarian
law.</p><p><a name="0610055000173"></a>The ceasefire, reached after
much diplomatic activity, including strenuous efforts by the British
Government, is holding and has aided the relief effort but the
humanitarian situation in Lebanon remains
serious.</p><p><a name="0610055000174"></a>On 15 August, the day
after the ceasefire came into effect, I visited Beirut to assess the
situation for myself. The priorities for the humanitarian aid effort
were to secure sustained access for humanitarian convoys to reach the
most vulnerable; to ensure safe return for displaced citizens; to
minimise the risk of injury and death from unexploded munitions for
those returning and for aid workers; and to repair basic
infrastructure, such as water and power supplies and
bridges.</p><p><a name="0610055000175"></a>From early in the
conflict, the UK responded to Lebanon&#146;s call for help. Our total
funding commitment now stands at &#163;22.3 million, including our
share of multilateral spending, making us one of the biggest bilateral
contributors to the humanitarian effort. In line with our assessment of
current priorities, this money is helping to provide shelter,
healthcare, water and sanitation, and to clear unexploded munitions. We
have agreed to provide urgently needed prefabricated bridges to open
critical humanitarian supply routes. The first three bridges arrived in
Lebanon on 1 September.</p><p><a name="0610055000176"></a>The
Government have also urged Israel to lift all restrictions on normal
shipping entering Lebanese ports, as set out in Resolution 1701. This
is essential in order to help restore the economy. The partial lifting
of the economic blockade last week has further enhanced the chances of
avoiding a much bigger humanitarian crisis and will help Lebanon begin
the path to recovery. We continue to push for further progress on the
issue.</p><p><a name="0610055000177"></a>The international
community has responded generously to Prime Minister Siniora&#146;s
appeal for assistance at the Stockhom conference on

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS13"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column WS13</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>recovery held on 31 August. Collectively we have pledged over $900
million to aid recovery. It will be important that these pledges are
acted on as soon as
possible.</p><p><a name="0610055000178"></a>Lebanon needed our aid,
and we are ready to do more as needed, but more than anything else what
Lebanon and the region need is peace. The conflict of this summer was a
symptom of a wider collective failure to resolve the conflict that has
affected the Middle East for decades. UNSCR 1701 was a step in the
right direction, and must be implemented by all parties, but we need to
encourage negotiation, compromise and above all political leadership to
end the long-term suffering of people on both sides of the
border.</p><p><a name="0610055000179"></a>Unfortunately, what has
happened in Lebanon is not the only humanitarian crisis in the region.
We cannot forget the plight of the Palestinians, especially in Gaza,
where violence continues and people die. Since the start of the current
conflict on 28 June, over 200 Palestinians have been killed and over
700 injured. The cost of damage to agriculture and industry is now
estimated at around $46 million. Many households continue to receive
only six to eight hours of electricity per day. However, there are
plans to rebuild the Gaza power station and to supply electricity from
Egypt, which should improve the situation. Intermittent electricity
supply is affecting all key services. Water supply and sanitation
services remain limited, with severe health implications. The UN now
estimates a 65 per cent increase in the number of children with
diarrhoea compared with this time last year. Hospitals are struggling
to operate vital equipment and to store drugs and vaccines
safely.</p><p><a name="0610055000180"></a>Food prices are rising
and 70 per cent of Gazans are now considered to be food insecure. The
World Food Programme reports a 72 per cent increase in numbers using
their feeding programme. Gaza crossing points are open intermittently,
primarily for humanitarian food supplies. Action is needed to ensure
unrestricted humanitarian access, including the supply of medical
equipment, fuel, food and
electricity.</p><p><a name="0610055000181"></a>At
the Stockholm donor conference on 1 September, donors pledged $500
million for the occupied Palestinian territories, of which $200 million
was for humanitarian aid. The UK pledged &#163;3 million to the
temporary international mechanism (TIM) for operation, maintenance and
repair work to keep water, sanitation and electricity services running.
This follows an earlier contribution to the TIM of &#163;3 million to
fund essential health supplies. In addition, the UK made a contribution
of &#163;15 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency
(UNRWA) in April. UNRWA provides healthcare and other basic services
for Palestinian refugees, who comprise 70 per cent of Gaza&#146;s
population. The UK has also deployed two experts to the United Nations
Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs to improve its
capacity to monitor the humanitarian situation in Gaza. These two
experts will assist donors and others to make sure help gets to those
who need it the most.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS14"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column WS14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h3 align="center"><a name="0610055000016"></a>Middle

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office
(Lord Triesman):</b> My right honourable friend the
Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mrs Margaret
Beckett) has made the following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="0610055000183"></a>I
welcome this chance to update the House on the situation in the Middle
East since I wrote to Members of Parliament on 14
August.</p><p><a name="0610055000184"></a>Since the
adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 on 11 August, the
Government have been focused on turning the cessation of hostilities
between Israel and Hezbollah into a durable ceasefire and a long-term
solution. And we have been working hard with key partners and the
parties to re-energise the Middle East peace process, an issue of vital
importance to the region and wider world. My right honourable friend
the Prime Minister visited Lebanon&#151;the first ever visit by a
British Prime Minister&#151;Israel and the Occupied Territories
from 9 to 11 September and I visited Egypt from 7 to
9
September.</p><p><a name="0610055000185"></a><I>Lebanon</I></p><p><a name="0610055000186"></a>As
the Prime Minister said during his visit to Lebanon, we must ensure the
full implementation of UNSCR 1701 to support the Lebanese
people&#146;s desire for a stable, prosperous and democratic future
for
Lebanon.</p><p><a name="0610055000187"></a>Following
the ceasefire, one of our immediate priorities has been to address the
humanitarian and reconstruction situation in Lebanon. We have seen an
easing of the humanitarian situation. Most of the Lebanese displaced
population have now been able to return home or are on their way home.
Food and other essentials are now available. A worsened humanitarian
crisis has been averted. After intensive efforts by the UK and other
international partners, Israel announced the lifting of its blockade on
Lebanon on 7 September. But life in Lebanon remains difficult for
many.</p><p><a name="0610055000188"></a>The
UK continues to play its part in the humanitarian and recovery efforts.
The UK will contribute a total of over &#163;40 million to Lebanon,
including &#163;22.3 million for humanitarian assistance and early
recovery projects. UK funding has so far helped to provide and deliver
shelter, healthcare, food, water and sanitation. We have
provided over &#163;1.5 million to clear spent and
unexploded munitions. Our funds will also contribute towards emergency
bridges to help open critical humanitarian supply routes to those
isolated in southern Lebanon. The first three prefabricated bridges
provided by the UK arrived in Beirut on 1
September.</p><p><a name="0610055000189"></a>The
other immediate priority has been to stabilise the peace. Urgent work
has been undertaken to strengthen the UN Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL),
in 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS15"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column WS15</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>order to carry out the range of important new tasks set out in UNSCR
1701. The force will be led by France until February 2007, and then by
Italy. On25 August, EU Foreign Ministers in Brussels pledged
up to 7,000 troops and a range of sea, air and specialist
assets.</p><p><a name="0610055000190"></a>Due to our current
operational commitments elsewhere, we will not be able to provide
ground troops. But the UK has sent HMS &#147;York&#148; to
participate in the Interim Maritime Force and we would consider
providing, in addition, two E3 AWACS and six Jaguar aircraft if needed.
We are willing to respond positively to requests to use our sovereign
case areas on Cyprus. We are also paying our share of the costs of the
UN operation, on which we pay a premium as a permanent member of the UN
Security Council.</p><p><a name="0610055000191"></a>During his
visit to Beirut, the Prime Minister made it clear that the UK intends
to play a major role in security sector reform (SSR). The Lebanese
armed forces have a crucial role in the country and the UK has set
aside &#163;2.5 million to support efforts to ensure that the
Lebanese armed forces take in control of all parts of the Lebanon. We
will work with the Lebanese Government in terms of training and
equipment and any other help that we can
give.</p><p><a name="0610055000192"></a>We must also work to
address the underlying root causes of this conflict. This means
strengthening the ability of the democratically elected Lebanese
Government to be in sole charge of Lebanon, and ensuring that militias,
supported and supplied from outside Lebanon, can never again plunge the
region into crisis.</p><p><a name="0610055000193"></a><I>Middle
East Peace Process (MEPP)</I></p><p><a name="0610055000194"></a>We
must not lose sight of the fact that the conflict in Lebanon arose out
of the continuing impasse in Palestine. This issue is of fundamental
importance not just to Israelis and Palestinians but to the whole of
the region and the wider world. As the Prime Minister made clear in Los
Angeles on 1 August, there is an urgent need to re-energise the Middle
East peace process. We have been working hard to bring the parties back
to the road map.</p><p><a name="0610055000195"></a>To achieve this
goal it is imperative that the violence on the ground stops. As a
result of the current situation in Gaza, more than 220 Palestinians
have died, including more than 60 children. Three Israeli soldiers have
been killed and one abducted. We continue to call for the immediate and
unconditional release of Corporal Shalit. We also condemn the continued
rocket attacks on Israeli civilians. We call on Israel to exercise
restraint and to do everything possible to avoid civilian casualties.
As the European Council said on 18 July, those elected members of the
Palestinian Government and legislature detained by Israel should be
released.</p><p><a name="0610055000196"></a>We remain seriously
concerned about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. The Temporary
International Mechanism (TIM) is now operational. The TIM is paying
allowances to 10,000 officials in the health sector. It is also paying
for fuel to reach 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS16"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column WS16</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>hospitals across the Occupied Territories. It has supported the
continuation of health services in the current difficult environment.
The International Development Secretary has announced &#163;6 million
so far for the TIM, for essential health supplies and to support water,
sanitation and electricity services. The UK will contribute up to
&#163;12 million. The EC has already paid allowance to 43,000 of the
poorest Palestinians.</p><p><a name="0610055000197"></a>The Prime
Minister used his visit to exchange ideas and identify a way for the
parties to re-engage. Both Prime Minster Olmert and President Abbas
agreed to meet each other without conditions and made clear their
commitment to a political process. The Prime Minister also discussed
the formation of a national unity Government with President Abbas.
President Abbas subsequently announced on 11 September that agreement
had been reached to form a national unity Government. We await details
on the programme to which this Government are committed. But, as the
Prime Minister said when he was with President Abbas, such a
Government, if based on the quartet requirements, offers the
possibility of re-engagement by the international
community.</p><p><a name="0610055000198"></a>As I made clear to
President Mubarak and the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Aboul Gheit, we
fully support Egyptian efforts to mediate between Israel, the
Palestinian Authority and the militants currently holding Corporal
Shalit. I also discussed with them and the Secretary General of the
Arab League, Amr Moussa, the need to re-energise the MEPP. Egypt and
the Arab League share this
goal.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0610055000017"></a>National

the NHS. An analysis of the responses has been undertaken and we have
reached the following decisions:</p>the
administration of the early stages of the topic selection process will
be the responsibility of NICE. Responsibility for the administration
of the later stages of the process will remain with the
department;the criteria used in the
selection of topics will be revised, with a single set of criteria used
for the selection of both clinical and public health
topics;

and public health throughout the process, to help ensure that the
topics being proposed represent the needs of professionals and their
patients. This representation will be secured via the new panels which
will replace the Advisory Committee on Topic Selection (ACTS);
andfinally the timelines for the selection
of topics will be reduced. This will mean that clinical topics which
are a priority issue for the NHS will be referred to NICE
sooner.<p><a name="0610055000202"></a>Full
details of the consultation responses and the analysis of the comments
has been placed in the Library and is available on the

new programme of work is being established by NICE to help the NHS
identify and stop ineffective interventions. This will potentially
allow the NHS to reinvest millions of pounds on drugs and other
treatments that improve patient
care.</p><p><a name="0610055000204"></a>The three products that
NICE will be developing are:</p>commissioning
guides: these will help NHS commissioners to make the case for moving
to concordance with NICE guidance and shift resources away from
ineffective care;recommendation reminders:
these will highlight recommendations from published NICE guidance which
reduce ineffective practice; andspecific
guidance aimed at reducing ineffective practice: this guidance will use
existing methodologies to give advice on the use of technologies or
approaches to care currently employed by the NHS where evidence of
effectiveness that exists suggests that it is a poor use of
resources.<p><a name="0610055000205"></a>NICE expects to
issue the first commissioning guides and recommendation reminders in
autumn 2006 and the first guidance on ineffective treatments in
2007.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0610055000018"></a>NHS:

there were clear indications that neither the NHS nor the taxpayer were

for the NHS;ensure equitable payment for
equivalent services and transparent reimbursement
pricing;work in partnership to deliver fair
prices for the NHS and reasonable returns for suppliers and
contractors;facilitate the introduction of
innovative solutions;maintain local choice
in the provision of services; andkeep
administration arrangements to the necessary
minimum.<p><a name="0610055000210"></a>We have consulted
extensively with industry on these issues. Following consultation on
dressings and chemical reagents, we have decided to implement a staged
price reduction of up to 15 per cent to the April 2006 drug tariff
reimbursement prices for some blood glucose detection strips.
Initially, reimbursement prices will be reduced by 12 per cent on all
affected products from 1 October 2006. This may be followed by a
further reimbursement price reduction of 3 per cent from 1 November
2006. We hope that the 3 per cent variant will allow the market to
maintain the free provision of related services, including the supply
of educational material, helplines and metres. Responses to the
consultation indicated that a price reduction of 15 per cent may mean
that it would be difficult to maintain these services. We have written
to companies to inform them of the price
changes.</p><p><a name="0610055000211"></a>A consultation on stoma

Authority (NHSBSA) and part of the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency
(PASA).</p><p><a name="0610055000358"></a>The effective date of the
contract will be 1 October 2006 and the new service will be known as
NHS Supply Chain. DHL will operate NHS Supply Chain as agent of the
NHSBSA, which will be responsible for managing the contract on behalf
of the department and of the
NHS.</p><p><a name="0610055000359"></a>DHL will manage the
procurement and supply chain services of approximately &#163;3.7
billion of NHS non-pay spend and forecasts savings greater
than&#163;l billion for the NHS front
line.</p><p><a name="0610055000360"></a>In addition, the
partnership with DHL will:</p>secure continuity of
the services for at least 10 years;ensure
all trusts will benefit from lower
prices;secure the vast majority of the 1,650
jobs that are being transferred;protect
staffs terms and conditions under the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) Regulations
(TUPE);create up to 1,000 new jobs to
support expansion over the 10
years;guarantee that all the logistics
distribution centres will remain open for five years at the very least;
andrequire the construction of a new
distribution centre in the Midlands within 18
months.<p><a name="0610055000361"></a>We recognise that NHS
trusts value the NHS logistics service and we have ensured that DHL
will, at a minimum, maintain the current service. As is the case now,
NHS trusts will not be mandated to use the outsourced service. For DHL
to be successful they will have to demonstrate value for money to NHS
trusts. They will also work very closely with clinicians to source the
right products at the best prices from
suppliers.</p><p><a name="0610055000362"></a>This is also an
opportunity for suppliers with innovative products to gain better
access to the NHS. DHL will purchase products on behalf of the NHSBSA
in accordance with EU procurement regulations thus ensuring open and
fair
competition.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0610055000023"></a>Opium
Derivatives: Macfarlan Smith
Report</h3><p><a name="0610055000363"></a><b><a name="0610055000448"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and
Industry (Lord Sainsbury of Turville):</b> We
welcomed this Office of Fair Trading report, which was published on 7
March 2006. As part of its statutory role, the OFT regularly reviews
undertakings given by organisations following earlier competition
investigations. In this case, the OFT reviewed the undertakings by MSL
following a report from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC),
and concluded that competition was being impeded by the impact of
government policy in the licensing of imports for opium derivatives. It
made

licensing policy for the import of opium
derivatives.</p><p><a name="0610055000364"></a>The OFT
recommendation is in line with the Government's commitment to encourage
and enhance the competitive process to bring the wider benefits to the
UK economy. Preventing abuse of market power is a key element of this,
and it is important to ensure that regulation which affects such market
power is operated in a transparent manner. It is therefore clear that
the Government should regularly review policy decisions such as this to
ensure that the detrimental impact to competition is prevented, or,
where other objectives intervene, limited. The OFT report has provided
an excellent catalyst for such a review, and the Government will commit
to repeating the process of review every five
years.</p><p><a name="0610055000365"></a>During discussion with MSL
and other parties while developing the response, a consistent complaint
was the lack of a level playing field between the UK and other European
countries (something recognised in the original MMC report). Currently,
the UK is the only major European producer to allow
imports.</p><p><a name="0610055000366"></a>There has been limited
discussion of this at European level, and the Government are committed
to raising this issue again with the European Commission to develop
options for the creation of a single market for these
products.</p><p><a name="0610055000367"></a>The full government
action plan is attached and copies of OFT's report will be placed in
the Members&#146; Library. In preparing this response, we have worked
closely with the relevant government departments, in particular the
Home Office, which is responsible for licensing policy, and the
Department of
Health.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0610055000024"></a>Public

Navy: Review of
Bases</h3><p><a name="0610055000373"></a><b><a name="0610055000450"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord
Drayson):</b> My right honourable friend the
Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Des Browne) has made the following
Written Ministerial
Statement:</p><p><a name="0610055000374"></a>The defence industrial
strategy published in December 2005 set out a challenge to the UK
maritime industry to reduce its overheads and invest in the facilities
and skills needed to meet the demands of the Royal Navy's future
warship programme. The same challenges apply to the naval bases as we
look to the future. The naval bases exist to support the Royal Navy's
front line. They are complex and expensive organisations. We need to
ensure that their capacity is no more and no less than we need to
support the needs of the fleet now and in the years to come. I wish to
announce therefore our intention to conduct an in-depth review of naval
base infrastructure requirements. The aim of the review is to ensure
that we have the right naval base infrastructure to meet the needs of
the future fleet. The review will assess future requirements and
examine a range of options, including some that could lead to radical
reductions in overheads and naval base capacity. The recommendations
from the review, which will be undertaken by the Defence Logistics
Organisation, are expected to be finalised in spring
2007.</p><p><a name="0610055000375"></a>The trade unions have been
consulted on the terms of reference for the review and, while it is too
early to predict the impact on jobs, the department will continue to
engage with them and other stakeholders as the review is taken forward.
Final decisions on the recommendations from the review will be subject
to full trade union consultation.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS24"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column WS24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h3 align="center"><a name="0610055000026"></a>Social
Exclusion: Action
Plan</h3><p><a name="0610055000376"></a><b><a name="0610055000451"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> My right honourable friend
the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is today publishing the
<I>Social Exclusion Action
Plan</I>.</p><p><a name="0610055000377"></a>We have much to be
proud of in our efforts to tackle poverty, promote social justice and
create the right environment for sustained economic
growth.</p><p><a name="0610055000378"></a>However, a consequence of
this success is that the more modest progress of some specific groups
within our society has become more
apparent.</p><p><a name="0610055000379"></a>This action plan is the
first step towards changing that. It aims to create the conditions to
allow everybody to accept opportunity, reach their full potential and
play their full part in
society.</p><p><a name="0610055000380"></a>This action plan marks a
new direction for the Government&#146;s social exclusion policy. It
commits us to:</p><p><a name="0610055000381"></a>Better
identification and early intervention: We will identify early who is at
risk of persistent exclusion and use this information to more
effectively intervene and support those most in need, and before
disadvantage becomes
entrenched.</p><p><a name="0610055000382"></a>Identifying what
works: We will systematically identify and promote interventions that
work. To ensure effective adoption of best practice, we will build the
capability of providers and
commissioners.</p><p><a name="0610055000383"></a>Multi-agency
working: We will break down barriers and enhance flexibility so local
providers and agencies can work together to meet the needs of excluded
groups, especially those facing multiple
problems.</p><p><a name="0610055000384"></a>Personalisation, rights
and responsibilities: We will tailor services to the needs of the
individual. We will empower, where it is appropriate, excluded groups
to make choices on their own behalf or ensure there is an independent,
trusted third party to work on their behalf. Our approach will be
framed by a clear understanding of the rights and responsibilities of
citizens, services and the
community.</p><p><a name="0610055000385"></a>Supporting achievement
and managing underperformance: Where local authorities and services are
delivering, Government will leave them alone, but where there is
underperformance, Government will
intervene.</p><p><a name="0610055000386"></a>The action plan
outlines how these principles will be applied or piloted for excluded
groups throughout the lifetime&#151;during the early years, the
childhood years and the adult years. Implementing more focused and
immediate interventions will supplement and inform deeper systemic
reform.</p><p><a name="0610055000387"></a>Copies of the action plan
have been placed in the Library for the reference of noble
Lords.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0610055000027"></a>Sudan</h3><p><a name="0610055000388"></a><b><a name="0610055000452"></a>The

May, and to promote development in Sudan. The UK played a leading role
in securing UN Security Council Resolution 1706, which was passed on 31
August. This resolution expands the mandate of the UN Mission in Sudan
(UNMIS) to Darfur in support of the early and effective implementation
of the Darfur peace agreement and the N&#146;djamena agreement, and
strengthens the military personnel and civilian component of UNMIS to
do this.</p><p><a name="0610055000389"></a>The passage of
resolution 1706 demonstrates the international community&#146;s
continued commitment to peace in Darfur. In the interests of the safety
and welfare of its civilians, we continue to press the Sudanese
Government, at the highest level, to give consent to its
implementation. We are concerting with others in the international
community, including the UN, US and key Arab states, to achieve this. I
raised this with Egyptian President Mubarak and the Secretary-General
of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, in Cairo last week. And both my right
honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development
and my noble friend the Minister for Africa, Lord Triesman, have been
engaging key interlocutors in the Government of Sudan and
beyond.</p><p><a name="0610055000390"></a>In the mean time we will
continue to support the African Union&#146;s efforts while a
transition is under way. The African Union is doing an important job in
the most difficult of circumstances and it is most important that they
stay until a UN force is able to deploy. On 18 July, the international
community in Brussels promised further support of
around $200 million, including the &#163;20 million that the
UK is providing this year.</p><p><a name="0610055000391"></a>The
continuing violence in Darfur is having devastating effects. It must
stop immediately. We condemn the continuing violations of the ceasefire
by all parties, particularly the violence directed at civilians and
attacks on humanitarian agencies. Because of this insecurity the UN and
NGOs are unable to reach 470,000 people whom they believe to be in need
of their assistance.</p><p><a name="0610055000392"></a>We are also
gravely concerned by the recent military build-up in Darfur and reports
of Sudanese Government military attacks as part of their
&#147;stabilisation plan for Darfur&#148;. As the UN
Secretary-General has said, this plan is inconsistent with the DPA. Any
attempt to take renewed military action and any continued rebel
activity would further undermine the prospects of achieving peace and
could lead to a further humanitarian
catastrophe.</p><p><a name="0610055000393"></a>A broad based and
inclusive implementation of the DPA, signed in Abuja on 5 May 2006,
remains the basis for stability, peace and reconciliation in Darfur.
The UK played a leading role in negotiations in Abuja: the Secretary of
State for International Development attended the final days of
negotiations in support of the AU mediation to help secure a deal. All
parties should work to put its provisions into effect. More rapid
progress by the Government of 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS26"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column WS26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Sudan in disarming the Janjaweed is key. It is also important for the
signatories to the DPA to work to bring the non-signatories on board.
To this end, the efforts of the SPLM are most
welcome.</p><p><a name="0610055000394"></a>In the mean time, the
non-signatories need to be fully involved in the effective monitoring
of the ceasefire and investigation of violations through existing
ceasefire mechanisms. In this way, they should be fully held to account
for fulfilling their obligations as set out in the 2004
N&#146;djamena Agreement on Humanitarian Ceasefire on the Conflict in
Darfur.</p><p><a name="0610055000395"></a>The UK remains committed
to peace in Darfur and the wider Sudan. We will continue to seek a
solution to the conflict there. As part of this, we have appointed a
new special representative for Darfur, William Patey, a former
ambassador in Khartoum, to replace Rod Pullen, who has retired from the
Diplomatic
Service.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0610055000028"></a>Teenage

the Director General of the WTO announced that he was recommending the
suspension of the negotiations across all subjects, after talks between
the US, EU, Brazil, India, Australia and Japan broke down on the key
issues of agricultural domestic support, agricultural market access and
non-agricultural market access. He said the suspension would give all
WTO members time to reflect, to examine available options and to review
their positions. His recommendation was accepted at a WTO General
Council meeting on 27
July.</p><p><a name="0610055000411"></a>The
UK Government are very disappointed that insufficient progress has been
made in the negotiations to allow the conclusion of the Doha round this
year. While it is very disappointing that no agreement has yet been
reached, it is premature to say that the Doha round has collapsed and
cannot be revived. We believe

negotiations to reflect on their positions with a view to showing
flexibility in future that will allow an agreement to be reached.
Developing countries, including the poorest countries, are the biggest
losers from the failure to reach
agreement.</p><p><a name="0610055000412"></a>The UK remains
committed to achieving an ambitious, pro-development outcome to these
negotiations. Our priority now is to encourage all WTO members to
re-engage in the negotiations as soon as possible. The UK Government
have taken and will continue to take every opportunity to press for
this&#151;within the EU and with other WTO members. The UK Government
will also continue to press for progress on Aid for Trade for
developing countries. Building developing countries&#146; capacity to
trade is important in helping them to integrate into the global economy
and for providing a route out of poverty and we do not believe that Aid
for Trade should be conditional on the successful conclusion of the
DDA.</p><p><a name="0610055000413"></a>The UK will continue to
support a multilateral, rules-based, international trading system. We
believe multilateralism is the best way of tackling unfair trade
practices.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0610055000032"></a>World
War I:
Pardons</h3><p><a name="0610055000414"></a><b><a name="0610055000457"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord
Drayson):</b> My right honourable friend the
Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Des Browne) has made the following
Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p><a name="0610055000415"></a>On
16 August I announced that the Government planned to seek parliamentary
approval for a statutory pardon for service personnel executed for a
range of disciplinary offences during the First World War. I am now
taking this opportunity to confirm these plans to the House and to
provide some further information on our
intentions.</p><p><a name="0610055000416"></a>I have reviewed
carefully the case for granting pardons and concluded that although
this is a difficult issue it is right to recognise the exceptional
circumstances that gave rise to these executions and to show compassion
to the families who have had to live with the associated stigma over
the years.</p><p><a name="0610055000417"></a>Given the paucity of
records for the courts martial of those executed, I have taken the view
that it would not be appropriate or fair to consider individual pardons
under the Royal Prerogative but that a statutory pardon for all members
of the group should be introduced. This approach removes the risk of
individual cases failing to meet the criteria for a pardon under the
prerogative simply because of lack of
evidence.</p><p><a name="0610055000418"></a>It is the Government's
intention to introduce an amendment to the current Armed Forces Bill
during the Lords Committee stage to give effect to this. Rather than
naming individuals, the amendment will pardon all those executed
following conviction by court martial for a range of offences likely to
have been strongly influenced by the stresses associated with this
terrible war; this will include desertion, 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS29"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column WS29</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cowardice, mutiny and comparable offences committed during the period of
hostilities from 4 August 1914 to 11 November 1918. Over 300
individuals from the UK, her dominions and colonies were executed under
the Army Act 1881. We will also seek pardons for those similarly
executed under the provisions of the Indian Army Act 1911, records of
whose identities we have not been able to locate. We consider that it
would not be appropriate to include in the pardon all capital offences
and specifically the offences of murder and treason will be
excluded.</p><p><a name="0610055000419"></a>In each case, the
effect of the pardon will be to recognise that execution was not a fate
that the individual deserved but resulted from the particular
discipline and penalties considered to be necessary at the time for the
successful prosecution of the war. We intend that the amendment should
so far as possible remove the particular dishonour that execution
brought to the individuals and their families. However, the pardon
should not be seen as casting doubt on either the procedures and
processes of the time or the judgment of those who took these very
difficult decisions.</p><p><a name="0610055000420"></a>The pardon
would apply to those sentences of execution confirmed and carried out
but convictions would not be quashed. The amendment will not create any
right to compensation and the Royal Prerogative of Mercy will remain
unaffected.</p><p><a name="0610055000421"></a>As the amendment
would affect the cases of personnel who were serving in the Armed
Forces of a number of dominions and colonies, we are consulting with
the Governments of those states or their successors on our plans. We
are expecting to receive their responses shortly but I can confirm that
our decision has already been welcomed by one of those principally
affected. I anticipate the Government's proposal will also be warmly
welcomed by the public at large and particularly by the families
concerned.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0610055000033"></a>Young

honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work
and Pensions (Anne McGuire) has made the following
Statement.</p><p><a name="0610103000016"></a>On 3 May 2006 in a
Written Ministerial Statement, I announced details of a strategic
review of the independent living funds which, it was then planned, was
to be concluded by the end of December
2006.</p><p><a name="0610103000017"></a>The review is currently
under way. The joint independent consultants, Melanie Henwood and Bob
Hudson, have developed a consultation strategy to gather evidence to
inform the review's recommendations. As part of the consultation
strategy, consultants have requested concise, written submissions from
key stakeholders by the end of August 2006. Following several requests
from stakeholders, my department has decided to extend this deadline to
the end of September 2006. This extension will result in the review
being completed later than originally
planned.</p><p><a name="0610103000018"></a>The strategic review of
the independent living funds will, accordingly, conclude by the end of
January 2007, with its report being published in February
2007.</p><p><a name="0610103000019"></a>The independent living
funds enable thousands of severely disabled people to live
independently and the Government need to consider the future direction
of the funds in the light of both our goal of equality for disabled
people and the wider context of proposed changes in social care. It is
therefore important that we provide sufficient time for our
stakeholders&#146; input to this
review.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0610103000002"></a>EU:

Rooker:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary
of State for Northern Ireland (Peter Hain) has made the following
Ministerial Statement.</p><p><a name="0610103000057"></a>I have
received the 11th and 12th reports of the Independent Monitoring
Commission (IMC). These reports have been made under Article 5 and
Articles 4 and 7 of the international agreement that established the
commission and reports on security normalisation and levels of
paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland respectively. I have
considered the content of the reports and I am today bringing them
before Parliament. I have placed copies in the Library of the
House.</p><p><a name="0610103000058"></a>I thank the members of the
Independent Monitoring Commission for their 11th report, their second
report on security normalisation in Northern Ireland. I am pleased to
note that they consider that the Government continue to fulfil their
obligations to the people of Northern Ireland by ensuring that their
safety and security are
protected.</p><p><a name="0610103000059"></a>I also thank the
members of the Independent Monitoring Commission for their 12th report
and acknowledge the painstaking, methodical and objective way in which
they have conducted their assessments of paramilitary activity in
Northern Ireland during the past three
years.</p><p><a name="0610103000060"></a>The best commentary on it
is the words of the IMC itself and I believe that they should be
studied with care. As the IMC notes, the situation in Northern Ireland
has been transformed from whatit was three years
ago&#151;particularly in regard tothe IRA. As the report
concludes, the IRA is not the same organisation as it was three years
ago. The IMC&#146;s clear conclusion is that the leadership of the
IRA does not consider a return to terrorism in any way a viable option,
and that it continues to direct its members not to engage in criminal
activity. Importantly, the IMC assesses that the IRA has disbanded its
structures that were responsible for procurement, engineering and
training and has stood down
volunteers.</p><p><a name="0610103000061"></a>The IMC also
concludes that the leadership has maintained a firm stance against the
involvement of members in criminality and taken action against members
who have continued such activity. We also note that the report says
that, where individuals have been involved, as individuals, in
criminality, that has not been sanctioned and it should not call into
question the leadership&#146;s
position.</p><p><a name="0610103000062"></a>The IMC concludes that
there is convincing evidence of the IRA&#146;s continuing commitment
to the political path and believes that it is no longer credible to
suggest otherwise. The significance of these statements cannot, and
should not, be underestimated.</p><p><a name="0610103000063"></a>I
also acknowledge and welcome the report&#146;s finding that the work
of IRA members, along with that of loyalist paramilitaries, contributed
significantly to the most peaceful marching season since the
1960s.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS35"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column WS35</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="0610103000064"></a>Like the IMC, the Government, however,
believe that further progress needs to be made on the issue of
policing, though welcoming the report&#146;s conclusion that the IRA
leadership has accepted the need for
engagement.</p><p><a name="0610103000065"></a>It is also important
to note the report&#146;s conclusion that some members of the UDA and
UVF continue to try to move their organisations away from violence and
criminality&#151;though I agree with the IMC that there is much more
to do if the loyalist organisations are to match the profound change
brought about by the IRA.</p><p><a name="0610103000066"></a>The
Government believe that the necessary progress can be made at the
upcoming talks in Scotland. But, while we accept that individual
parties will, quite rightly, make their own assessment, we believe that
this report lays the basis for the final settlement of the conflict in
Northern Ireland and, as such, presents a unique opportunity for this
generation to reach that final resolution, an opportunity that the
Government hope that the parties will now
seize.</p>

Water supply and sanitation services remain limited, with severe
implications for health. The Department for International Development
will therefore provide &#163;3 million through the temporary
international mechanism for operation, maintenance and repair work to
keep water, sanitation and electricity services
running.</p><p><a name="0610103000074"></a>DfID will also provide a
further &#163;3 million, again through the temporary international
mechanism, to contribute towards providing allowances to teachers and
others among the poorest Palestinian Authority workers. Many of these
people, including many front-line services providers, have not been
paid salaries for six months.</p><p><a name="0610103000075"></a>The
temporary international mechanism was launched on 16 June, following an
original proposal by the UK. To date, it has provided over 1.8 million
litres of fuel for water, sanitation, hospitals and primary healthcare
centres in Gaza. Using funding from the European Community, the
temporary international mechanism has made payments to 11,900 health
workers. Payments have also been paid to 51,500 of the poorest
government workers and 33,000 social hardship
cases.</p><p><a name="0610103000076"></a>DfID has made up to
&#163;12 million available for assistance through the temporary
international mechanism. This new commitment means
that&#163;9 million of these funds have been allocated and
will shortly be fully spent meeting Palestinian basic needs. The
remaining &#163;3 million will be apportioned as needs
arise.</p><p><a name="0610103000077"></a>The European Commission
has established a team in Jerusalem to manage the implementation of the
TIM. Along with several EU member states, we have seconded expertise to
this

Rooker:</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary
Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Paul Goggins) has made
the following Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="0610103000079"></a>The publication of the
UK steering group&#146;s fifth report marks another milestone in the
work carried out by the group, currently chaired by the Northern
Ireland Office, formed as a result of Patten to examine alternative
policing approaches to the management of
conflict.</p><p><a name="0610103000080"></a>After consultation with
ministerial colleagues in the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence,
I placed in the Library a copy of the fifth report on20

acceptable, effective and less potentially lethal alternative to the
baton round is available and to review the public order equipment that
is presently available or could be developed in 
<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS37"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column WS37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>order to expand the range of tactical options available to operational
commanders.</p><p><a name="0610103000081"></a>Since then, the work
has continued apace. I am grateful to the steering group and to the
many contributors to the programme, including those in government
service, the police, academics and other experts, for their sustained
commitment.</p><p><a name="0610103000082"></a>While initially
established to address a specific Northern Ireland issue, the work of
the steering group has intentionally been developed within the context
of policing across the United Kingdom and has provided a vehicle for
identifying and selecting less lethal technologies for police use in
the wider UK context.</p><p><a name="0610103000083"></a>There has
been considerable progress from the situation on which the Patten
commission reported, when it stated that the police &#147;had
essentially, three options&#151;the baton, the PBR or live
fire&#148;. In June 2005, the UK steering group introduced the new
attenuating energy projectile (AEP), a safer replacement for the L21A1
baton round. The introduction of the AEP does not represent the end of
the group&#146;s work, as it continues to progress towards the
assessment of the suitability of the new discriminating irritant
projectile (DIP).</p><p><a name="0610103000084"></a>The work of the
steering group has necessarily had a strong focus on the science and
technology required to produce an effective and less potentially lethal
alternative, but has also had a particular emphasis on its systematic
approach, where the potential to reduce the lethal nature of weapons is
enhanced not only through technological developments but through the
development of stringent training and operational guidance and the
accountability measures that are in place, designed to maximise the
safety of all concerned. Overall this approach is now internationally
recognised as a world-leading model of best
practice.</p><p><a name="0610103000085"></a>The Government will
continue to keep all commercial products and technological research
under review. It will ensure that those appearing to have real
potential are tested and medically evaluated if
appropriate.</p><p><a name="0610103000086"></a>However, I have not
lost sight of the concerns shared by a number of interested groups on
the issue of less lethal weapons. For our part, it is the Government's
intention to continue to engage with these groups. As before, I have
invited their comments on this
report.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0610103000012"></a>Railways:

to enter into an agreement with ORR to make level crossing orders on
behalf of the Secretary of State, replacing a similar agreement
originally entered into in 1990 when HMRI became part of the Health and
Safety Executive (HSE). The Railways Act 2005 (for ORR) and the Health
and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (for HSE), however, permit only
functions of an administrative nature to be delegated to ORR and HSE,
and we have concluded that the making of level crossing orders fails
this test because it is a function of a legislative nature.
Consequently, I have tabled an amendment to the Road Safety Bill
providing for the making of level crossing orders to be delegated to
ORR and validating those orders made by HSE since 1990. This will
restore the position to what we thought it was and which has worked
well over the
years.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0610103000013"></a>Senior

of trustees receiving them to be charged at the special trust rates.
There is, however, an omission in the wording of the new Section 686A,

thatthe whole of the payment by the company to the trustees
including the original subscription price is taxable and not just the
element representing the
distribution.</p><p><a name="0610103000105"></a>This result was not

amending legislation will be backdated to 6 April 2006, so that the
position will be as it should have been from the start. The amending
legislation is being drafted and will be put out to
consultation.</p>

of its programme (&#163;50 million in 2006-07) in a
contribution to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). These
resources allow the Afghan Government to establish their own priorities
for reconstruction activities and build capacity by ensuring that the
Government take the lead in implementation. Around 80 per cent of these
resources are used for wages and salaries of government officials. In
principle the Government could use DfID&#146;s resources to fund any
expenditure that meets the eligibility criteria of the ARTF. These
criteria ensure that all expenditures: are contained in the government
budget and consistent with Afghan law; do not include military
spending; and follow financial management standards set by the World
Bank. Aid has proven to be more effective where the Government have
control of their own budget and resources, and given
Afghanistan&#146;s dependence on foreign donors, this can only be
done through instruments such as the
ARTF.</p><p><a name="0610054000260"></a>However, DfID&#146;s
overall support to Afghanistan is governed by the 10-year development

we to believe that the Afghan Government were breaching this agreement

from 104,000 hectares in 2005 to 165,000 hectares in 2006. The report
also provides a full breakdown of cultivation by province. This shows
that the increase is due to a substantial increase in planting in
Helmand and other southern provinces. This is worrying but reflects the
very difficult security situation and limited law enforcement
capability in the south. Elsewhere in areas where access to governance,
security and development has improved, reductions achieved last year
have been sustained and in some cases fallen. It is too early to
speculate on cultivation levels for 2007. We will know more following
the release of UNODC's rapid assessment survey in the spring. The noble

are the most effective means of protection. However, we continue to

replying in her absence.</p><p><a name="0610054000556"></a>Information in the form requested is not
readily available. Calculation of weights for households with incomes
in the lowest quintile for the retail prices index (RPI) would require
special calculations using data from the Office for National
Statistics' expenditure and food survey, from which the RPI weights are
derived. Specifically, the process would involve returning to each
year's survey at the household level and removing all observations from
respondents above the lowest quintile. The remaining responses would
then need to be aggregated to national levels before embarking on the
detailed process of producing RPI expenditure weights. The removal of
such a large amount of the responses means that it is likely that a
number of years would need to be averaged to provide an acceptable
sample size. Special calculations would also be required to derive the
weights for certain housing components whose weights are modelled (that
is, mortgage interest payments and depreciation costs). Taken together,
this means that the Question can be answered only at disproportionate
cost.</p><p><a name="0610054000557"></a>Consumer prices index (CPI)

(Lord Rooker):</b> The primary market for wheat and
other crops is still the food market despite the recent increases in
their use for biofuels. The availability and price of the feedstocks
have played an important role in the development of the biofuel sector.
The most rapid development of the bioethanol market has been in
countries with large surplus production in crops that can be used to
produce bioethanol. In the UK, biofuel production offers new markets
for the UK cereals and oilseeds surpluses. However, in practice, it is
likely that the UK sector will use a mixture of home-grown and imported
crops, recycled waste vegetable oils and tallow, and imported
biofuels.</p><p><a name="0610054000576"></a>In the short term,
bioethanol production will mainly use cereals and other food crops as
feedstock. The market, through the price mechanism, will guide the
allocation of the crops to the different
sectors.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WA30"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column WA30</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="0610054000577"></a>Over the medium to long term, it is likely
that second generation biofuels derived from cheaper and more abundant
feedstocks, such as straw or waste products, will play an important
role in meeting the increased ethanol demand. Rising prices for food
crops would give additional impetus to the development of technologies
for the production of biofuels based on alternative
feedstocks.</p><p><a name="0610054000578"></a><b><a name="0610054002077"></a>Lord

Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos):</b>
DfID is in the early stages of weighing up the arguments and evidence
on how production of biofuels, including ethanol and biodiesel, could
impact on food production and food aid. Overall, more evidence,
including on the right balance between food and fuel production in
different regions, is needed. We will continue to monitor the situation
carefully.</p><p><a name="0610054000580"></a>In 2005 production of
fuel ethanol rose by 19 per cent, driven largely by rising oil prices.
There is no evidence that this has so far affected the supply of food
aid. Food shortage and famine are more related to poor distribution and
a shortage of disposable income to buy food rather than agricultural
production or provision of food
aid.</p><p><a name="0610054000581"></a>Expansion of the area under
biofuel crops is likely to happen in countries with the right growing
conditions and sufficient land. This could reduce the area of land
devoted to food production. However some energy crops can be grown on
degraded land too marginal for food crops; others can promote land
restoration.</p><p><a name="0610054000582"></a>There are ways that
the trade-offs between food and biofuel production can be managed.
Increasing the productivity of both food and energy crops can promote
economic growth and poverty reduction. Crops can be developed that
yield much higher quantities of energy per unit of land or water, or
that generate by-products that can be used for
bioenergy.</p><p><a name="0610054000583"></a>DfID plans to support
the Global Bioenergy Partnership (GBEP), announced at the G8 in
Gleneagles in 2005 and launched this year. This will promote
collaboration between developed and developing countries. We will
continue to support international efforts to increase food production,

to monitor the effects on the health of persons living in their areas.
Section 90A(3) requires an SHA to publish a report on their findings
within the period of four years from the commencement of this section
of the Act. We will be issuing guidance during 2007, which we intend
should involve the monitoring of appropriate health indices in relation
to water
fluoridation.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0610054000060"></a>Food:

expenditure and food survey, from which the RPI weights are derived.
Specifically, the process would involve returning to the original
survey data at household level (that is, each individual response). For
each household, actual spending on every commodity would need to be
converted into a proportion of the total expenditure incurred by that
particular household. These proportions would need to be averaged
across all households before using the resultant averages to produce
RPI expenditure weights

Lancashire Strategic Health Authority board reached the conclusion that
the commissioning of healthcare would be more effective if the
administrative boundaries of PCTs were coterminus with those of local
authorities and, therefore, that Longridge should be included in East
Lancashire PCT for those purposes. However it accepted that management
of the Longridge Community Hospital should rest with the new Central
Lancashire PCT and that the referral of patients by general
practitioners in Longridge to Lancashire Teaching Hospitals should not
change. The SHA's proposals on this issue relating to East Lancashire

McKenzie of Luton:</b> Prior to 6 April 2006
(&#147;A day&#148;) tax limits applied to the pensions that could
be paid by occupational pension schemes that were approved by Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and from annuity contracts
purchased by such pension schemes. Many pension schemes incorporated
these tax limits into their rules and similarly many annuity contracts
reflected the limits in their contract terms, but others simply relied
upon the fact that such tax limits were imposed upon them by the tax
rules.</p><p><a name="0610054001137"></a>From A day these tax
limits on pensions have been removed. This meant that some occupational
pension schemes that did not have the previous tax limits specifically
written into their rules potentially no longer had an upper ceiling on
their pensions and faced unexpected increases in pension liabilities.
The Registered Pension Schemes (Modification of Rules of Existing
Schemes) Regulations 2006 (the &#147;modification
regulations&#148;) continue to apply the previous pension limits to
such schemes and to annuity contracts which were not in payment
on 5 April 2006, from A day until 6 April 2011 or such later
time as HMRC may prescribe through regulations. The effect of this is
to ensure that members continue to receive the same level of pension.
During this period the scheme trustees or the annuity provider may, at
any time, amend the rules of the pension scheme or the terms of the
annuity contract so that the regulations cease to
apply.</p><p><a name="0610054001138"></a>The modification
regulations ensure that the A day changes do not unexpectedly increase
some pension payments and ensure that some occupational schemes and
annuity contracts continue to pay members the same level of pensions.
Therefore it is not necessary to monitor the level of the restrictions
set out in those regulations. The consequences for the revenue received
by the Exchequer arising from the modification regulations will depend
upon the extent to which pension schemes and annuity contracts choose
to retain the old benefit limits rather than adopt the more generous
limits available under the post-A day tax
rules.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0610054000131"></a>Pensions:

shorter sentences than men. However, the women&#146;s prison
population has more than doubled over the past 10 years, with one study
suggesting that this is because the sentencing of women has become more
severe (Hedderman, <I>Why are women being sentenced to custody?</I>,

vulnerabilities who are dealt with by the criminal justice system.

Regimes Interventions), the Prison Service is required to review all
programmes to ensure that they are of the appropriate quality and
effectiveness and offer value for money. A multidisciplinary panel,
which included the National Offender Management Service Chaplaincy,
reviewed the programme and identified a range of concerns. The most
significant were the poor quality of the manuals, which did not
demonstrate a structured and coherent programme, a lack of consistency
and clarity about the primary aims of the programme, a lack of
understanding and appropriate sensitivity to the diversity agenda of
the Prison Service, and an absence of protocols for the management of
the mentor system, making it unsafe. The area manager considered the
recommendation from the panel and decided to discontinue the programme.
Forty-two prisoners have undertaken the course. No formal evaluation on
the impact on behaviour has been possible given the small numbers

such licence conditions are breached, the offender is liable to be
recalled to prison on the recommendation of the probation officer, to
protect the public and prevent any further reoffending. In April 2005,
revised national standards were issued, setting out the minimum
requirements for offender managers supervising offenders released on
licence from prison. The requirements cover the timing of the initial
contact with offenders and of the production of sentence plans,
together with the frequency of contact with offenders and the time
limit for enforcement action for any breach of licence conditions,
according to offenders' assessed risk of harm. Offenders assessed as

generated by the production of goods and services by the whole economy,
only some of which is distributed to households. As such, it is not
possible to allocate national income to household quintile groups.
However, it is possible to do this for income received by households
and estimates have been provided in the table
below.</p><p><a name="0610054001586"></a>These estimates are based
on the ONS analyses <I>The effects of taxes and benefits on household
income</I>. The latest analysis for 2004-05 was published on the
National Statistics website on 12 May 2006 at

analysis is based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey, which
is a sample survey covering approximately 7,000 households in the

be restricted in any way by the introduction of the revised management

(Lord Triesman):</b> We welcomed the UN
Secretary-General's engagement on the Zimbabwe issue. He sought to help
the Government of Zimbabwe in the reforms that the country desperately
needs to arrest its deepening decline. However, President Mugabe
blocked the initiative, and with it an opportunity to build bridges
within Zimbabwe and with the international community. If Mr Mkapa can
persuade President Mugabe to undertake the policy changes that
Zimbabweans urgently need for a more stable and prosperous future, we
will support his efforts in any way we can, as we would any
international efforts aimed at achieving real progress in
Zimbabwe.</p><p><a name="0610054001633"></a>Zimbabwe is in a
profound crisis. Inflation, even by official estimates, runs at over
1,000 per cent. The economy has shrunk by 40 per cent since 1999,
exports by 50 per cent, and Zimbabwe now qualifies as a least developed
country according to the UN's classification system. Formal
unemployment has reached 80 per cent, and a quarter of the population
is dependent on food aid, when once Zimbabwe was a major food exporter.
An estimated 3,200 people die a week of AIDS-related causes. There are
regular demonstrations in Harare and other cities, and daily
infringements of the basic rights of Zimbabweans. Zimbabwe has been
censured by the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#146; Rights,
suspended from the councils of the Commonwealth and from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), and subjected to critical scrutiny
by UN envoys. I set out my concerns to the Zimbabwean ambassador when
he called on me on July 24, and urged his Government to address these
problems.</p><p><a name="0610054001634"></a>It is clear that this
is not, as the Government of Zimbabwe contend, a bilateral problem with
the UK. It is, as the EU, US and many others in the international
community have made clear, a problem between the Government of Zimbabwe
and Zimbabwe&#146;s people, concerning governance. We support the
specific policy recommendations made to Zimbabwe by the UN, IMF, World
Bank, African Commission on Human and Peoples&#146; Rights, and other
international organisations. The UK only wishes to see a better future
for Zimbabweans. It is for Zimbabweans to freely determine who should
govern Zimbabwe&#151;it is they who will then hold that Government to
the governance standards that much of the rest of Africa is now working
towards.</p><notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WA129"></a><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column WA129</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="0610054001635"></a>The Government of Zimbabwe have also blamed
their economic woes on economic sanctions imposed by the EU. However,
the EU has no economic sanctions against Zimbabwe. It has an arms sales

economy.</p><p><a name="0610054001636"></a>The international

the wide-scale destruction of housing and livelihoods during Operation
Murambatsvina; the abandonment of the rule of law so vital to maintain
investor confidence; the destruction of Zimbabwe&#146;s agricultural

country; they have left because of their Government&#146;s
policies.</p><p><a name="0610054001637"></a>The problem of Zimbabwe
is between its Government and its people. The solution is a Government
working for, not against, the people, pursuing policies that realise
Zimbabwe&#146;s enormous economic and human potential, and giving
Zimbabweans the rights that much of the rest of the world insists on.
If Zimbabwe pursues this path, the UK will be at the forefront of
international efforts to support it, in addition to the significant
humanitarian assistance that we are already providing Zimbabweans. It
is in that way that Zimbabwe can build real bridges between our
countries.</p>
