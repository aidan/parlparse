My honourable friend the UK fisheries Minister continues to encourage his European counterparts to support radical reform, and will be pressing our case for reform as negotiations develop, with further talks at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council next Tuesday.</p>

<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="11071356000003"></a><b><a name="110713-0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="11071356000302"></a>Baroness Parminter:</b> The common fisheries policy has one of the most dismal reputations of any European Union policy and is responsible for the fact that yields in our fisheries have diminished. Does the Minister agree that its reform must include the total elimination of discards, and maximum sustainable yields delivered by long-term management plans agreed at regional fisheries level?</p>

<p><a name="st_3"></a>

Obviously we want to deal with the problem of discards. We have done a great deal within the United Kingdom about that matter. She is also right to talk about the need for regionalisation of the common fisheries policy and about rights-based management. However, we will discuss all that and continue to negotiate in Europe on these matters-and I think that we need support from all sides of the House, and throughout the entire country and Europe, to get a proper reform of the CFP.</p>

That has been the trouble with the common fisheries policy from the very beginning. Surely the important thing is that we accept that fishermen themselves have to accept responsibility for the health of the industry. As the noble Baroness said, the best way to do that is to build on the regional management organisations that already exist.</p>

I think that we ought to continue to travel in that direction. We will continue to fight for a ban on discards and deal with that very serious problem. We will also continue to negotiate with other colleagues in Europe on the other matters that my noble friend and the noble Lord mentioned.</p>

That is why I stressed in my earlier responses the need for regionalisation on these matters. As my noble friend and as others have put it, discards are something that we all find abhorrent. The whole idea that such things should still be happening is wrong, and we will fight to end discards. We are already doing a considerable amount to reduce the amount of discards within the UK fleet.</p>

As I understand it, following this report from the Commission, this will be a matter for the Council of Ministers and for the European Parliament. It will be a matter for co-decision, so it will take some time. As a result, it is very important that we build up the appropriate alliances in Europe and within the European Parliament to make sure that we can negotiate the best deal possible for a proper, radical reform of the common fisheries policy.</p>

We think that the wasteful practice of discarding fish should be brought to an end. We are doing a great deal already within the United Kingdom to make sure that it is being reduced by various practical measures relating to net sizes and other matters. We will also continue, in the negotiations for reform of the common fisheries policy, to make sure that we do all we can to bring it completely and utterly to an end.</p>

What happens to the undersize fish caught by fishermen at sea? Will they count against national quotas or regional quotas? Are we going to rely solely on changing net sizes? That is very important, but you cannot avoid discards if you fish in the sea.</p>

We want to get rid of them as much as is possible. That is why we are seeking a reform of the CFP, and that is what we are negotiating to do. However, there are also practical measures relating to net sizes, to which the noble Lord referred, and practical measures relating to CCTV on the boats themselves that can help deal with the problem. It is going to take time and a lot of negotiation with other member states and with Members of the European Parliament, but we are committed to working towards that.</p>

In doing so, we pay tribute to the campaign, led by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall among others, to gather a petition of over half a million signatories to press for this change. Clearly it is in the long-term interests of the industry for fish stocks to be rebuilt and taken sustainably. With 75 per cent overfishing, a cut in the fleet looks inevitable if this new policy is to work. Can I ask the Minister how this will be managed, particularly in the coastal towns hardest hit? Will the decommissioning payments continue, and will there be extra investment in regenerating those communities?</p>

I cannot give the noble Lord specific answers to these questions at this stage, as he well knows, because we are still negotiating on these matters. We have had the proposals from the Commission only today, so I have not read them in detail, nor has my honourable friend Mr Benyon. We will look at those proposals, he will be negotiating on them next Wednesday, and we will come forward with proposals that will be good for the United Kingdom's fisheries industry, for fish in general and for the sustainability of our fish stocks.</p>

Why do we need a common fisheries policy at all?</p>

We have a common fisheries policy and we are committed to renegotiating that along with the Commission, which has accepted that that policy does not work, and we are going to get that right. With the Commission and a vast number of other member states being on side, and with this country being totally and utterly committed to doing so, we can get that right. We will start that process next Tuesday and continue it as long as is necessary.</p>

He has been asked to consider fuel poverty from first principles-what causes it, its effects and how best to measure it-with interim findings expected in the autumn and a final report in early 2012. The review is independent. Its conclusions will be evidence-based and have not been and will not be pre-judged or pre-agreed with the Government.</p>

It is good that Professor Hills will carry out that work. The problem is that energy companies recover their fixed costs from the first few hundred units they charge each customer, and the more energy used the lower the charge per unit. This seems topsy-turvy to me and does nothing to encourage us to use less energy. It is no wonder that there are millions of households in fuel poverty. With energy prices set to surge, surely the first few hundred units consumed should be relatively cheap and then the charging should get progressively more expensive per unit.</p>

This is a subject that we have discussed on many occasions. Indeed, our officials have offered to meet him to discuss it, which I am delighted to say they will in September. I can also inform my noble friend that I have written to Professor Hills and suggested that he might like to talk to noble Lords and hear their views, bearing in mind that his is an independent review so I am not allowed to insist upon that. I am delighted that he has offered a date in August, which is probably not that convenient to noble Lords, so he has agreed to see your Lordships in September. I hope that the input from my noble friend will then be extremely invaluable.</p>

Those amendments were supported by a number of lobbies outside the House and they met precisely the objectives set by the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, in his question.</p>

However, the problem with the rising tariff is that the people who use the most energy are those in the poorest homes, which require the most heating. It is not as simple as waving a magic wand. It is therefore imperative that we progress with things such as the Green Deal and drive in the efficiency measures that we are setting out through it before we revisit this excellent point, which we are very sympathetic and open to, later on when that Green Deal is in action.</p>

On the theme of fuel poverty and energy conservation, can the Minister report progress under the Energy Bill on the measure to prevent private landlords re-letting properties that fail every test of energy performance after 2016?</p>

We are going to review that in 2016 and we are still open to considering it, but it is very much an imperative, a fundamental step, in getting these people out of fuel poverty-which incidentally is now reaching an horrendous figure. I am looking at my notes, which I do not often do; in 2004, 1.2 million people in the UK were in fuel poverty, and 4.5 million are now in fuel poverty. This is a serious task that the Government have to set about solving. All of us in this room want to see it solved and satisfied, and I am very grateful for the support that I get from all sides of the House to come up with a solution.</p>

In the mean time, are the Government considering making social tariffs for energy compulsory as a way of reducing costs for those in fuel poverty? If they are not, what else are they thinking about in the short term to try to deal with this severe crisis? The Minister has just given us the very bad figures.</p>

That is very quick. It would be wrong for us to start putting up tariffs or making incentives while we are waiting for the eminent professor to come up with his conclusions, having consulted across the piece. Forgive me if I do not agree to the noble Baroness's suggestion; it is obviously a good one, but we need to wait for the professor to deliver.</p>

The Government have to understand that more and more people who have never previously worried about their bills or thought of themselves as being in fuel poverty will do so when they get their winter bills next year. The disgrace of the energy companies is that those who have the least could end up paying the most, with higher prices for pre-paid meters and those who do not pay directly from their bank also having to pay more. I note that the Minister said he cannot instruct Professor Hills, but he could make suggestions. Can he suggest to Professor Hills that he examine this in his review to ensure that this perverse pricing is ended once and for all?</p>

Surely the point being made by the noble Lord is that it is ridiculous that we should have Labour MPs from Scotland voting on English matters which are devolved in Scotland, where English MPs have no such say. This was a fundamental tenet of our manifesto commitment, so when can we expect this commission to be appointed? Before the Recess, I hope.</p>

However, the IAS is one provider in a wider market of immigration and asylum advice. The Legal Services Commission is identifying alternative provision for the areas affected, as well as making the necessary arrangements for case transfers.</p>

That leaves about 10,000 live cases. What assurances can the Government give: first, to clients, especially those whose cases are at a critical time-limited point and who need information in their own languages about what will happen next; and, secondly, on practical matters, including the number of staff retained by the administrators to deal with such things as the transfer of files? My noble friend will know that a year after the closure of Refugee and Migrant Justice many files are still in storage, with the storage company looking for payment before cases can proceed.</p>

That is what has led to this train of events. The LSC is working very hard to transfer cases and is prioritising the most vulnerable first, among them cases of unaccompanied children claiming asylum and cases coming up to tribunal immediately. A large number of people working in this area are prepared to take on this work, which is very encouraging for making a smooth transfer and making sure that clients are well looked after in this situation.</p>

This is not an issue about legal aid reforms but a problem in the IAS: a large debt that it cannot address and which the Legal Services Commission has decided should not be written off. Many other organisations want to take on this work. Carolyn Downs, the chief executive of the Legal Services Commission, said in the other place yesterday:</p>

Can the Minister assure the House that the quality of specialist immigration law that will be available in the future will as good as in the past? Is she aware of the differential success rates of people getting very good legal advice? Does she accept that removing immigration law from the scope and cutting the budget of legal aid for asylum may make it harder? I am sure that most noble Lords would not dream of buying a house without decent legal advice, and certainly no one should be forced to defend their life without it.</p>

I think she has already indicated that she will make sure that that happens. Furthermore, because of the Government's proposals in the Bill, all immigration cases, except those of individuals in detention, will be outside the scope of legal aid, including cases of domestic violence. This means that in every case, however complicated, no legal advice or legal aid will be available.

Does she agree that the number of matter starts given to the IAS is so large that they could not be taken up by other practitioners, especially in regions such as East Anglia and Yorkshire, where the IAS has either 100 per cent or most of the legal aid and asylum cases?</p>

Well informed Peers will be aware that some of the issues contained in the Statement have changed. As a result, and with the agreement of the Opposition, I have made some amendments that I shall make plain during the course of the Statement, which is as follows.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="11071356000064"></a>"In recent days, the whole country has been shocked by the revelations about the phone hacking scandal. What this country and this House have to confront is an episode that is disgraceful: accusations of widespread law-breaking by parts of our press; alleged corruption by some police officers; and, as we have discussed, the failure of our political system over many years to tackle a problem that has been getting worse. We must keep front and centre the real victims: relatives of those who died at the hands of terrorism, war heroes and murder victims-people who have already suffered in a way that we can barely imagine who are being made to suffer all over again.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="11071356000065"></a>We all want the same thing: press, police and politicians who serve the public. Last night, the Deputy Prime Minister and I met the Leader of the Opposition. I also met the chairs of the Culture, Media and Sport, Home Affairs and Justice Select Committees to discuss the best way forward. Following these consultations, I will set out today how we intend to proceed: first, on the public inquiry; secondly, on the issues surrounding News International's proposed takeover of BSkyB; and, thirdly, on ethics in the police service and on its relationship with the press.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="11071356000066"></a>Before I do that, I will update the House on the current criminal investigation into phone hacking. I met Sir Paul Stephenson last night. He assured me that the investigation is fully resourced, one of the largest currently under way in the country, and being carried out by a completely different team from the one that carried out the original investigation. It is being led by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers, who I know impressed the Select Committee yesterday. Her team is looking through 11,000 pages containing 3,870 names, including around 4,000 mobile and 5,000 landline phone numbers. The team has contacted 170 people so far, and will contact every single person named in those documents. The commissioner's office informed me this morning that the team has so far made eight arrests and undertaken numerous interviews.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="11071356000067"></a>Let me now turn to the action that the Government are taking. Last week in the House I set out our intention to establish an independent public inquiry into phone hacking and other illegal practices in the British press. We have looked carefully at what the nature of this inquiry should be. We want it to be one that is as robust as possible-one that can get to the truth fastest and get to work the quickest, and one that commands the full confidence of the public. Clearly, there are two pieces of work to be done. First, we need  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_724"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 724</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a full investigation into wrongdoing in the press and the police, including the failure of the first police investigation. Secondly, we need a review of regulation of the press. We would like to get on with both these elements as quickly as possible, while being mindful of the ongoing criminal investigations. So, after listening carefully, we have decided that the best way to proceed is with one inquiry in two parts.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="11071356000068"></a>I can tell the House that the inquiry will be led by one of the most senior judges in the country, Lord Justice Leveson. He will report to both the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. The inquiry will be established under the Inquiries Act 2005, which means it will have the power to summon witnesses, including newspaper reporters, management, proprietors, policemen and politicians of all parties, to give evidence under oath and in public.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="11071356000069"></a>Starting as soon as possible, Lord Justice Leveson, assisted by a panel of senior independent figures with relevant expertise in media, broadcasting, regulation and government, will inquire into: the culture, practices and ethics of the press; its relationship with the police; the failure of the current system of regulation; the contacts made, and discussions had, between national newspapers and politicians; why previous warnings about press misconduct were not heeded; and the issue of cross-media ownership. He will make recommendations for a new, more effective way of regulating the press-one that supports its freedom, plurality and independence from government, but which also demands the highest ethical and professional standards. He will also make recommendations about the future conduct of relations between politicians and the press. This part of the inquiry we hope will report within 12 months.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="11071356000070"></a>The second part of the inquiry will examine the extent of unlawful or improper conduct at the <I>News of the World</I> and other newspapers, and the way in which management failures may have allowed this to happen. This part of the inquiry will also look into the original police investigation and the issue of corrupt payments to police officers, and will consider the implications for the relationships between newspapers and the police. Lord Justice Leveson has agreed our draft terms of reference. I am placing them today in the Library and we will send them to the devolved Administrations. No one should be in any doubt that we will get to the bottom of the truth and learn the lessons for the future.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="11071356000071"></a>Next is the issue of News International's bid to take over BSkyB. By the day we are hearing shocking allegations: allegations that royal protection officers were in the pay of the <I>News of the World</I><I></I>and handed over the contact details of the Royal Family for profit; and allegations that the former Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, had his personal details blagged by another News International title. As both the alleged nature of the malpractice and the scope of the newspapers involved widen, serious questions must be asked about News Corporation's proposed takeover of BSkyB".</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="11071356000072"></a>I would now like to depart from the original Statement given in another place as very recent developments mean that it is no longer accurate. Since the Prime Minister's Statement, News Corporation has announced

This means that the Culture Secretary's decision to refer the matter to the Competition Commission now falls.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="11071356000073"></a>I would now like to revert to the rest of the earlier Statement.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="11071356000074"></a>"And let me also say this. The people involved, whether they were directly responsible for the wrongdoing, sanctioned it or covered it up, however high or low they go, must not only be brought to justice; they must also have no future role in the running of a media company in our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="11071356000075"></a>Let me now turn to the issue of ethics in the police, and in particular their relationship with the press. Of course it is important that there is a good relationship between the media and the police. The police often use newspapers to hunt down wanted criminals and to appeal for information. However, allegations have been made that some corrupt police officers may have taken payments from newspapers, and there are wider concerns that the relationship between the police and the press can be too close. When I spoke to Sir Paul Stephenson yesterday, he made clear that he is as determined as I am that all aspects of the police relationship with the media should be beyond reproach.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="11071356000076"></a>On the allegation concerning improper payments to police officers, I can assure the House that the Metropolitan Police immediately referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Since then, the IPCC's most senior commissioner has been supervising the Met's work to identify the officers who may have taken these payments. As soon as any officers are identified, the commission has publicly made clear that it will move to a fully independent investigation drawing on all the available expertise necessary to reassure the public. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has been assured by the commission that it has both the powers and the resources it needs to see this through. It will go wherever the evidence leads it and will have full powers to investigate fully any police wrongdoing that it might uncover. The Home Secretary has also today commissioned a report from the IPCC on the IPCC's experience of investigating corruption in the police service and on any lessons that can be learnt for the police service. The initial findings of this will be delivered to her by the end of the summer.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="11071356000077"></a>I can also tell the House that, in addition to the work of the judicial inquiry on the wider relationship between the police and the press, Sir Paul Stephenson is looking to invite a senior public figure to advise him on the ethics that should underpin that relationship for his own force, the Metropolitan Police. In particular, this figure will advise him on how to ensure maximum transparency and public confidence in how the arrangements are working.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="11071356000078"></a>If we are calling for greater transparency from the police, I think it is only right that we provide it in government too. After all, as I have said, one of the reasons we got into this situation is because over the decades politicians and the press have spent time courting support, not confronting the problems. So I will be consulting the Cabinet Secretary on an amendment to the <I>Ministerial Code</I> to require Ministers to record

Permanent Secretaries and special advisers will also be required to record such meetings, and this information should be published quarterly. It is a first for our country and, alongside the other steps we are taking, will help to make the UK Government one of the most transparent in the world. The Opposition might also want to adopt this practice to ensure a cross-party approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="11071356000079"></a>After this Statement, I will be meeting the family of Milly Dowler. None of us can imagine what they have gone through, but I do know that they, like everyone else in this country, want their politicians-all of us-to bring this ugly chapter to a close, and ensure that nothing like it can ever happen again. It is in that spirit that I commend this Statement to the House".</p>

The revelations of the past week have shocked the whole country. The public now rightly expect those of us in Parliament, especially those in the other place who directly represent them, to provide not just an echo for that shock but the leadership necessary to start putting things right. We on these Benches very much welcome the fact that the usual channels have now reached agreement that, as we have been urging, this House will on Friday consider these issues in depth in a full-scale debate in your Lordships' House. The fact that the other place is debating a Motion this afternoon pressing Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation to withdraw their bid for BSkyB has clearly been a clinching factor in ensuring that News Corporation has done precisely that this afternoon. We welcome the fact that News Corporation has withdrawn its bid. It is the right thing to do and what the country wanted to see.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="11071356000082"></a>The intention was that your Lordships' House should debate these issues on a Motion in exactly the same terms in what would have been a powerful double message from both Houses of Parliament. My party proposed the Motion in the other place and secured support from the other parties so that the House of Commons is speaking with a single voice this afternoon. I pay tribute to the leader of my party, the right honourable Member for Doncaster North, for his leadership in this matter and his remarkable personal achievement in securing the extraordinary changes that the country has seen over the past week.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="11071356000083"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, was to have put the same Motion to your Lordships' House but, rightly, he has now changed the words of his resolution. I pay tribute as well to the way in which the noble Lord has pursued these issues so doggedly. In the light of the announcement by News Corporation, the usual channels have been looking at the wording of the Motion on the Order Paper and, as I say, it is right that those terms should now be adjusted. We on these Benches want to see all parties and both Houses of Parliament move forward swiftly, comprehensively and, wherever possible, on an agreed basis.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="11071356000084"></a>Let me ask about the timing, nature and scope of the inquiry as set out in the Government's Statement. The scale and seriousness of what we have all heard about practices in our newspaper industry, about the way in which that industry was regulated and about the failure of the police to investigate developments should make it clear to us all that now is not the time to delay. The truth is that for far too long, as the Statement recognises, politicians have been lagging behind the public's rising sense of anger and indignation about the methods and culture of sections of the press. The task in front of us all, as politicians, is to play our part in starting to put that right.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="11071356000085"></a>We welcome the inquiry detailed in the Statement. Will the Leader of the House confirm that it will be staffed and up and running before the Recess, and, in addition to the fact that the interfering with or the damaging of evidence in any way while a criminal investigation is under way is already an offence, will the Leader also confirm that from the moment the judge is appointed today it will be an offence for anyone to destroy documents related to the issues of the inquiry?</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="11071356000086"></a>Turning to how the inquiry will operate, we welcome a number of aspects of the announcement today that build clearly on the way forward for which we in this party have been calling. It is right that this is a single inquiry. We have been clear that it must be judge-led if it is to get to the bottom of what has happened and when. So we on these Benches strongly welcome the announcement of Lord Justice Leveson as the chair of the inquiry. He is extremely well suited to what will unquestionably be a difficult but very important task. Putting together the different elements of this single inquiry will be itself a difficult task. Will the Leader explain how the Government envisage the judge and the inquiry panel operating together?</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="11071356000087"></a>In opting for a far broader inquiry, it is right that the Government have now decided to follow the argument that we have been making on the inquiry's scope and the clear views of the Hacked Off campaign and the family of Milly Dowler, whose phone was so despicably hacked into by the <I>News of the World</I>-defunct now, but the impact of that is still reverberating so revoltingly.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="11071356000088"></a>It is clear that there are a number of important areas which the inquiry must cover. They include the first police investigation alongside what happened at the <I>News of the World</I> and other newspapers. Does the Leader of the House agree that yesterday's session of the Home Affairs Select Committee in the other place made clear that the questions about the relationship between the media and the police run wider than simply the first investigation? We must take the steps necessary to restore the public's faith in the ability of the police to hold all those who have broken the law to account. Similarly, it can only be right that the inquiry has been broadened to the relationship between politicians and the press.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="11071356000089"></a>On the specifics, will the noble Lord the Leader of the House assure the House that these aspects too of the inquiry will be very much judge-led? It is important that the terms of reference of the inquiry are not taken to narrow the remit of the judge excessively. We on  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_728"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 728</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>these Benches are glad that the Government have agreed to make changes to the terms of reference to avoid doing so. Alongside important questions of behaviour in Britain's newsrooms, the police and the relationship between politicians and the press, two additional issues need consideration. On the issue of media regulation, does the Leader of the House agree that our instinct should continue to be for self-regulation? Does he further agree that it needs to be proved that self-regulation can be made to work? On a point of detail, does he think it is for the judge to make final decisions about recommendations on media regulation? I welcome the decision to make cross-media ownership part of the inquiry. Does the Leader agree that abuses of power are more likely to happen when there are excessive concentrations of power? Will he confirm that the recommendations can be legislated for in the Government's forthcoming communications Bill?</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="11071356000090"></a>Finally, on BSkyB, we thank the Leader of the House and through him the Prime Minister for what the Prime Minister said today. News Corporation does indeed need to concentrate more on cleaning up the mess and less on trying to secure a merger. In dropping its bid for BSkyB, we are glad that Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation are finally showing signs that they are, indeed, getting it. Following News Corporation's decision, we are grateful for the statement of clarification given by the Leader of the House that the decision by the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport to refer the matter to the Competition Commission now falls.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="11071356000091"></a>As well as discussing this Statement today, we look forward on these Benches to debating these matters fully later this week. But in all our considerations, we all need to keep foremost in our minds the victims of this scandal, such as the family of Milly Dowler and the other members of the public who were the innocent victims of phone hacking. It is they who deserve a full and comprehensive inquiry. They need us to get on with this inquiry, to make it fully comprehensive, and to get to the truth. The leader of my party has given his personal commitment, and the commitment of my party, to make sure we will do everything to ensure that that happens. On these Benches, in this House, we echo that commitment. We look forward to seeing this scandal cleaned up, to seeing the press, the police and politicians root out wrongdoing where it has happened, and to raise their game. We look forward as well to the victims of these crimes-not the perpetrators of them-securing outcomes which are both satisfactory and just.</p>

Each of the owners of those numbers will be notified by the police. Our thoughts should be with them-not only public figures or so-called celebrities, but very often ordinary people going about their business who have been highlighted by the press and very often dealt with extremely badly.  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_729"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 729</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I am also pleased that this House will have an opportunity to debate these matters. I readily join the noble Baroness in paying tribute to all those who made that possible, in particular my noble friend Lord Fowler-truly a veteran on this subject. I expect it will be the first of many opportunities we will have to debate these issues over the course of the next few years. There is certainly knowledge and expertise on all Benches in the House that we ought to be able to draw upon.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="11071356000093"></a>I also agree that, across the parties, we need to move swiftly. The tone of the noble Baroness reflected the need for cross-party unity to try to deal with so many of these different situations. She was right that, in addition to the huge failure on the part of newspapers, there have been failures on the part of politicians and the police, and that we all need to play our part in correcting them.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="11071356000094"></a>The inquiry will be set up at once and be firmly up and running by the Recess. I can confirm that it would be a criminal offence to destroy evidence. It would be a criminal offence in any case, because of the police investigation which is ongoing, to destroy evidence that could materially affect that investigation.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="11071356000095"></a>The judge will be in overall control; it is his inquiry; he will be supported by what the noble Baroness called an operating panel of experts drawn from the areas that I mentioned in the Statement. How they work together and develop their working practices will depend very much on how the judge decides to operate. We are very much looking forward to them getting going and to the report.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="11071356000096"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether the instinct was for continued self-regulation. It will be up to the judge and his inquiry to decide that and to come forward with recommendations, having looked at all the effects of self-regulation and its possible failure. There is increasingly a view-I do not wish to second-guess the inquiry in any sense-that, whether or not self-regulation has failed, we need to defend the relationship between a free press and strong regulation. Some independent form of regulation should almost certainly be the outcome.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="11071356000097"></a>I agree also with what the noble Baroness said about the position of News International now. It is important for it to get its own house in order. This is a fast-moving situation; no doubt, it will have moved further by the time we get to our debate on Friday. That is something we should all look forward to.</p>

There will be, I think, a welcome around the House for the decision by News Corp to withdraw its bid. However, does he agree that this is not remotely the end of the story and that the inquiries that have just been announced remain essential, not least because of the position of companies such as News Corp? Will he confirm that the inquiry will be able to consider the law relating to American companies taking full control of British media companies when, by the law of the United States, we are prevented doing the same and taking full control of American media companies? That seems a very unsatisfactory position which has not always

It is important that through Parliament and across the parties we should agree on the best way forward, but particularly that we should do so when we have seen what the recommendations of the inquiry are. I also agree with my noble friend's point about the inquiry. I am sure that it will want to look at all aspects of media ownership, including foreign ownership, and come up with recommendations on that.</p>

We do not yet know the exact terms of reference of this inquiry. Can he confirm that it will not be confined just to News International?

There could not, in my view, have been a better choice. I am also very glad that there is to be one inquiry instead of two and that it is to be a judicial inquiry under Lord Justice Leveson. I am a little concerned about the nature of the inquiry and the order of events. The Statement gives the impression that the two parts of the inquiry are to be considered, in a sense, the wrong way around. Surely the urgent matter for inquiry is the conduct of the <I>News of the World</I>-a purely factual inquiry. Would it not be better for the inquiry to complete that aspect of the task before turning to the much more general question of press regulation in the future?</p>

The first part will look at media ethics and practice. The panel will be drawn from experts in the media, in the police, in government, and so on. We hope that the inquiry will report within 12 months. The second part of the inquiry, as the noble and learned Lord pointed out, will look at the unlawful activity and improper behaviour that has come to our attention, but it will be a post-criminal investigation inquiry held once all the court processes have been completed. The noble and learned Lord will be more aware than I am of the need to avoid interference by the judge-led inquiry with the criminal process and very possible court processes.</p>

Does my noble friend accept that, in respect of the element of corruption, not just of an individual, or a few individuals, as was suggested, but a whole culture of corruption that has developed, any organisation that has presided over such a culture of corruption is not a fit and proper licensee to be conducting the business of press and broadcasting in this country and that it is no longer a question of plurality in the press but of morality in the press? Does he further accept that the committee in another place yesterday demonstrated that there are senior figures in the Metropolitan Police who do not seem yet to have realised the seriousness of the damage that has been done to public confidence in the Metropolitan Police by their failure to address these shocking activities over a period of time and that much will have to be done, and has not yet even started to be done, to repair that public confidence?</p>

On the question of a fit and proper person, that was never going to be triggered by the proposed merger because Ofcom has an ongoing statutory duty to ensure that holders of broadcasting licences are and remain fit and proper persons.

My belief is that it did not. It has done as much as it could with the very limited powers it has.

That is the purpose of the inquiry, part of which will look at the current system of self-regulation under the PCC. In the same way that not every journalist was hacking, not all aspects of the PCC have been badly done. Many people have received help and support from the PCC. However, the issues that we are dealing with are of the highest seriousness. It is therefore right that we should set up this judicial inquiry.</p>

It is important to remember that none of them solved the problems. They were around at the time and are still around now, even though the press was warned then that it was, rather famously, drinking in the last-chance saloon. One of the most important things, whether we have statutory or non-statutory regulation, is that the body that is set up should have very strong investigatory powers. Without them it will end up being largely a conciliation service, not a regulatory body.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="11071356000138"></a>"Mr Speaker, I wish to announce the publication today of the Mull of Kintyre review, the report of the independent review of the evidence relating to the findings of the board of inquiry into the fatal accident of a Royal Air Force Chinook helicopter at the Mull of Kintyre on 2 June 1994.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="11071356000139"></a>It is right that I should begin this Statement by paying tribute to the 29 people who died in this accident, one of the worst in the history of the Royal Air Force. As is well known, the passengers were members of the Northern Ireland security and intelligence community who were travelling to a meeting in Inverness, and their deaths were a huge blow to the security of this country. They were also a human tragedy for each of the 29 families who were devastated by the loss of their loved ones.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="11071356000140"></a>I pledged while in opposition that I would set up a review because I had worries that an injustice might have been done. The official conclusion that the accident was caused by the negligence to a gross degree of the two pilots on duty that day, Flight Lieutenants Jonathan Tapper and Richard Cook, had been criticised almost since the day it was reached. Doubt had been cast on the findings in different ways by the fatal accident review held in 1995, by the Defence Committee and the Public Accounts Committee of this House in 1998 and 2000, and by the Select Committee appointed in another place in 2002.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="11071356000141"></a>A number of Members of this House have continued to voice their doubts over the findings of gross negligence, and I would wish to acknowledge the unflagging interest in the case shown by my honourable and right honourable friends the Members for North East Fife, Kensington, North East Hampshire, and North West Norfolk, and also by Sir John Major. I know that the Ministry of Defence considered those reports carefully, taking independent and specialist advice, but given the weight and breadth of the comments I thought it only right to ask an independent figure to check whether justice had been done.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="11071356000142"></a>I announced the establishment of the review-the first independent review of the evidence relating to the accident set up by the Government themselves-to the House on 16 September last year. It was my intention that its report, whatever its findings might be, should draw a line under this matter. It has been carried out by the distinguished former Scottish judge, Lord Philip, with the advice and support of a panel of three fellow Privy Counsellors, Lord Forsyth, Baroness Liddell, and my right honourable friend the Member for Gordon. I am extremely grateful to all four for their thorough and painstaking approach to the task and for the clarity with which they have presented their recommendations, which are unanimous.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_736"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 736</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110713-0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="11071356000143"></a>Lord Philip and his colleagues have concluded that the finding that the pilots were negligent to a gross degree should be set aside and that the Ministry of Defence should consider offering an apology to the families of Flight Lieutenant Tapper and Flight Lieutenant Cook. I can tell the House today that I have accepted these recommendations. At a specially convened meeting of the Defence Council on Monday, it was decided that, to quote our decision,</p>
<ul><a name="11071356000269"></a>'the Reviewing Officers' conclusions that Flight Lieutenants Tapper and Cook were negligent to a gross degree are no longer sustainable and must therefore be set aside. We therefore order that those findings shall be set aside'.</ul>
<a name="110713-0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="11071356000144"></a>I am writing to the widows of the two pilots, to the father of Jonathan Tapper and the brother of Richard Cook to express the Ministry of Defence's apology for the distress that was caused to them by the findings of negligence. I wish also to express that apology publicly in this House today.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="11071356000145"></a>Lord Philip's analysis is very clear. To put it as briefly as I can, he identifies the central point as being that, according to the regulations in force at the time, a finding of negligence should have been made against air crew who had been killed in an accident only if there was "absolutely no doubt whatsoever" about the matter. Although the two air chief marshals who acted as the reviewing officers for the board of inquiry and made the findings themselves had no doubts on the matter, Lord Philip is clear that that is not enough. The question that needed to be asked was whether there was any scope for doubt in anyone's mind. In this case, other, competent, persons did have doubts. That is sufficient to warrant the conclusion that the findings should not stand.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="11071356000146"></a>I would like to make four further points. First, this report does not purport to tell us exactly why Chinook ZD576 crashed. It is central to Lord Philip's report that the exact cause will never be established, and I am convinced that pursuing the matter further would serve only to increase the distress of the family and friends of those who died in the accident. But those who allege a long-running conspiracy to cover up technical shortcomings in this aircraft will find no support here. The Chinook has had an excellent safety record since the disaster at the Mull. It has been a mainstay of our operations in successive theatres of war and it has the full confidence of those who fly it. On this occasion, however, the report reveals that the pilot expressed concerns that he felt unprepared to fly the aircraft.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="11071356000147"></a>Secondly, I want to emphasise that Air Chief Marshals Sir John Day and Sir William Wratten, now retired, who made the decision were and are highly respected and experienced airmen who acted at all times with full conviction as to the right and proper course and in good faith. They did not reach their decision lightly and they did ask for legal advice. Regrettably that legal advice, although subsequently endorsed by independent Queen's Counsel, has now proved to be incorrect. I attach no personal blame to these distinguished officers and their advisers.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="11071356000148"></a>Thirdly, the procedures for investigation of air and other military accidents were changed some years ago, with the result that it is no longer the practice for boards of inquiry-now service inquiries-to ascribe blame to those involved, whether or not they survived  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_737"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 737</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the accident. This was because sometimes the business of ascribing blame can get in the way of finding out what actually happened and, most importantly, preventing any recurrence.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="11071356000149"></a>Fourthly, the report makes one further recommendation: that the Ministry of Defence should reconsider its policy and procedures for the transport of personnel whose responsibilities are vital to national security. I accept that recommendation too. It has implications for land and sea as well as air transport. I have directed my officials to ensure that the policy and procedures in place across all three services ensure that we do not unnecessarily risk so many individuals who are vital to national security on one vehicle. It is worth noting that Flight Lieutenant Tapper had asked for the passengers on the Chinook that crashed to be split between more than one helicopter.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="11071356000150"></a>This has been an unhappy affair that has caused much reflection within the Royal Air Force and anguish for the families of those who died, and particularly for those who were wrongly officially found to have been negligent to a gross degree. I hope that this report and the action that I have taken in response to it will bring an end to this chapter by removing this stain on the reputation of the two pilots".</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="11071356000167"></a>We pay tribute to the 29 people who died in the accident, and to the dignity and bravery of their families. We add our thanks to Lord Philip for his review of and report on the tragic accident in June 1994, when a Chinook mark 2 helicopter crashed on the Mull of Kintyre, and also to the panel of three Privy Counsellors who assisted Lord Philip in his work, two of whom are Members of your Lordships' House.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="11071356000168"></a>The review was mainly of the written record of the board of inquiry and of other related evidence that, it was felt, might throw light on the findings of the board. The original board of inquiry made no finding of culpability, but the two reviewing officers made a finding of gross negligence in respect of the two pilots. It is unfortunate that some of Lord Philip's conclusions were apparently leaked, as they were fairly extensively reported over last weekend. Perhaps the Minister might like to comment on this in his response and tell us what action, if any, is being taken.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="11071356000169"></a>The principal recommendation that the board of inquiry finding of negligence to a gross degree should be set aside has been accepted and implemented by the Defence Council. Lord Philip felt that the Ministry of Defence should consider offering an apology to the families of Flight Lieutenant Tapper and Flight Lieutenant Cook. The Secretary of State for Defence has just given that apology and we agree with that.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="11071356000170"></a>There is also an issue of the large number of key personnel who were travelling together on the Chinook that crashed. The matter was reviewed after the board

Lord Philip has also commented on the board of inquiry procedures at the time of the accident but indicated that his concerns have been met by subsequent changes to those procedures.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="11071356000171"></a>The terms of reference of the review were:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="11071356000255"></a>"To examine all available evidence relating to the findings of the board of inquiry into the fatal accident at the Mull of Kintyre on 2 June 1994; and to report conclusions to the Secretary of State for Defence as soon as possible".</p>

<p><a name="11071356000244"></a>The review was not asked to make conclusions as to the cause of the accident but it did not find new evidence to suggest mechanical failure, and no safety issue with the Chinook mark 2 has been raised in the report. Lord Philip's conclusion is very specific. He states that according to the regulations in force at the time, a finding of negligence should only have been made against air crew who had been killed in an accident if there was "absolutely no doubt whatsoever" about the matter. Lord Philip indicates that competent persons did have doubts, albeit not the reviewing officers, and that accordingly the findings should not stand.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="11071356000172"></a>It would appear that successive Secretaries of State, initially from the Conservatives and then from Labour, serving from the time of the incident until the last election, felt they should follow the view of the reviewing officers, which was backed up by legal advice, even though it now seems from Lord Philip's report that the RAF's own regulations were not followed since there was not the necessary level of proof-namely, "absolutely no doubt whatsoever"-which there should have been for a finding of gross negligence. Indeed, investigations by the Public Accounts Committee in 2000 and a Select Committee of your Lordships' House in 2001 both found that the findings of the board of inquiry did not satisfy the burden of proof required.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="11071356000173"></a>The Secretary of State and the Ministry of Defence accept Lord Philip's finding that there was room for doubt on the matter and that therefore the finding of negligence to a gross degree was unjustified. We believe that, in the light of Lord Philip's report, the Secretary of State and the Ministry of Defence have made the correct decision. It is only right that if a finding of negligence to a gross degree is to stand, the evidence must be such as to leave no doubt whatsoever. Lord Philip has quite clearly found that not to be the case.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="11071356000174"></a>I have three questions to put to the Minister. In the Statement, it was said that the report reveals that the pilot expressed concerns that he felt unprepared to fly the aircraft. Could the Minister tell the House how this matter was dealt with at the time, and what lessons have been learned and implemented? Secondly, can the Minister say what issues surrounding compensation for the families of the deceased arise from the report? I hope that this now brings this matter to a conclusion-one that all will feel able to accept. With that sentiment in mind, I have only one further question to ask the Minister: will he confirm that there will now be no further reviews or enquiries seeking to establish the cause of the accident?</p>

I am also grateful to the noble Lord for his support for what my department is trying to do to establish what happened and what lessons can be learnt. Like the noble Lord I, too, pay tribute to the 29 people who died in this accident and to their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="11071356000176"></a>The noble Lord asked me several questions, the first of which was about the leaks. It was disappointing that Lord Philip's main recommendation was widely reported over the weekend. We commenced enquiries immediately to establish who was responsible and those enquiries continue. There has been a lot of wild, inaccurate and unhelpful speculation in the press, which must have been very distressing and concerning to the families. I deeply deplore that.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="11071356000177"></a>The noble Lord asked me about key personnel travelling together. As Lord Philip's report acknowledges, we reviewed our process for transportation of personnel vital to national security after the board of inquiry, and we did produce guidance at that point. However, the Secretary of State has said that he wants to take another look to reassure himself that our procedures in this area are adequate.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="11071356000178"></a>The noble Lord also asked about the safety issues relating to the Chinook. Lord Philip's report raises no safety issue with the Chinook mark 2. Indeed, Lord Philip writes in his report that,</p>
<ul><a name="11071356000271"></a>"it is now regarded as a highly successful aircraft".</ul>
<p><a name="11071356000179"></a>The Chief of the Air Staff endorsed this position and wrote to the <I>Guardian</I> in January last year. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="11071356000256"></a>"The Chinook helicopter has a remarkable safety record and has proved a mainstay of recent operations".</p>

<p><a name="11071356000180"></a>The noble Lord pointed out that the pilot had expressed concern. I quote from Lord Philip's review:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="11071356000257"></a>"We were told that Flt Lt Tapper telephoned his Deputy Flight Commander on the evening before the delivery of ZD576 to Northern Ireland expressing concern that some time had passed since his conversion training. He felt unprepared to fly the aircraft. He had attempted to persuade the tasking authority to spread the load between more than one aircraft, but his request had been refused".</p>

<p><a name="11071356000245"></a>My Lords, I am sure lots of lessons have been learnt from that, and certainly we put safety as an absolutely pre-eminent issue as far as the Royal Air Force is concerned.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="11071356000181"></a>The noble Lord asked me about compensation for families. This is a confidential matter, but I can assure him that this will be taken forward in the normal way. Finally, I can reassure him that I very much hope that this is the end of the matter. For the families of all those who were killed, I very much hope this is the end.</p>

I, as the MP for that area, followed it very carefully and in fact raised it in another place. The years have gone by. Today, the fingers no longer point at the two men at whom they were pointed. I am relieved that this matter has come to this conclusion. Of course, there will be soreness; death is cruel, and so are the circumstances that bring about such deaths. I thank the two brilliant men who served their Queen and country well. They have now passed to the other side without any blemish upon them. I am sure that on the great day when all secrets are revealed, there will be full justice for all. There will be a degree of joy and gladness that this matter has come to this end.

They acted in the best possible way and felt that they were carrying out their duties. The fact that this matter has now been resolved, and that the two pilots who were killed while serving their country have had this stain removed from them, is a great tribute to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State who initiated the inquiry and to Lord Philip who led it. He has achieved something that I have not achieved in 30 years of my political career-unanimity between me and the noble Baroness.</p>

I assure him that I will pass on what he says to the Secretary of State. He referred to the reviewing officers-the two air chief marshals. It is very important that I say this to the House: the integrity and diligence of both senior officers whose duty it was to review the board's finding-Air Chief Marshal Day and Air Chief Marshal Wratten-are beyond question. They had all the available evidence before them and reached their verdict with scrupulous care and total honesty. They took appropriate legal advice before reaching their decision. They clearly did everything they could to secure advice in order to make a comprehensive assessment of the evidence before coming to their findings.</p>

This is a day from which we derive considerable satisfaction. Speaking from the opposition Benches, I give full praise to Liam Fox and his colleagues for the manner in which they set up the inquiry and accepted its findings. I also pay tribute to my two colleagues in this House, and Malcolm Bruce in the other place, for the work that they did with Lord Philip in coming to what we regard as a satisfactory ending to a sorry tale. It is a satisfactory ending that should not only enable the two families of the men who have been wronged for so long but afford an opportunity for the book to be closed for the other 27 families whose support in this has been a great consolation to us.</p>

However, there has been a gross injustice based on legal advice that appears now to have been fundamentally flawed. I would like to think that the MoD will be more careful in the manner in which it seeks and ultimately accepts legal advice of this gravity in the future. I should like to think that the counsel from whom the MoD sought advice will never be employed in that capacity again.</p>

I remember well, as do many noble Lords, the events of that day and the shock felt throughout these islands, but particularly in Northern Ireland. While it was a huge tragedy that those 29 people were killed, in my part of the world, because of the extraordinary degree of intelligence that was held in the minds of those people, there was a great fear that many other lives were about to be lost to the terrorist cause because of the death of these extremely skilled and high-serving officers.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="11071356000194"></a>Does my noble friend understand that in my part of the world there remains anxiety and concern that the request of the young officer that the 29 should not fly together was set aside? It seems that that approach has not been fully resolved until now, and the Minister is indicating that there will be a further review on procedures. These are not complicated questions. There is a notion that it requires a review of procedures to ascertain whether it was wise to take 29 of the most senior security service officers together, but this is a matter of common sense, not policies and procedures. Can my noble friend understand the anxiety that the Statement creates: that it takes policies and procedures in the Ministry of Defence rather than common sense to deal with the security of our people?</p>

Of course I understand the anxiety. I clearly remember that terrible, terrible day and I quite understand how it must have felt in Northern Ireland.

What we have heard today is a lawyer telling us that he disagrees with a decision of another lawyer. This is not a criticism, as I fully understand the deeply held emotions of people on this subject, but we have not heard a thing today about how the crash occurred. I refer noble Lords to col. 559 on 22 May 1997. The pilots elected to fly under visual flight rules, which state that one must at all times be in visual contact with the ground. We know that the highest point of the Mull of Kintyre is 1,463 feet above sea level. About 40 seconds from impact, the aircraft was flying at a height estimated at between 200 and 400 feet. It flew from visual meteorological conditions into instrument meteorological conditions. It was approaching the Mull of Kintyre at least 2,000 feet below the height at which it should have been under instrument flight rules in order to clear the Mull.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="11071356000197"></a>I am afraid that I will upset a lot of my friends when I say that there is no doubt whatever in my mind that the crash was down to pilot error. We have not heard a thing today about the plane being unsafe-not a word. That is because it was not: it is a brilliant piece of kit. I am a sorry that I have to disagree totally with this decision. I support the air marshals in the decision that they came to.</p>

As my noble friend said, there had to be a conclusion that there was no reasonable doubt. This point was pressed very hard during the first debate and in all subsequent exchanges. Were it not for the persistence of honourable Members and members of the pilots' families, this matter might still have been subject to the wrong conclusion. Therefore, as others have done, I thank my noble friend and, through him, the Secretary of State for Defence for having ordered this further inquiry. I emphasise the point with which he concluded his Statement; it is to be hoped that this will draw a line under this very sad event.</p>

I particularly commend the clarity of this report to noble Lords; it is in the clarity that the decision is supported, as we have already heard in this House this afternoon. At the heart of this report is the decision that the legal advice that informed the original decision-repeatedly tested, I have to say, including independently-was wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="11071356000204"></a>For my part, when I was Secretary of State for Defence, my noble friend Lord O'Neill and others of his group made representations to me and presented me with quite a substantial body of information arguing for just this outcome. I challenged the legal advice, in the sense that I sought independent legal advice. Indeed, I went further because I challenged another point of law-it has not become part of this report-which I think should also have instructed the conclusion that we have today. I regret that I was no longer in post when that process came to a conclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="11071356000205"></a>I do not know this, but I am certain that the original legal advice was reinforced by the advice that came to my successor, my noble friend Lord Hutton, when he was Secretary of State for Defence. I have no way of knowing that that was the case, but I suspect it was. While I understand that this appears to be an argument between lawyers, there is a pretty straightforward argument at the heart of this, which Lord Philip and his review team exposed in a simple and uncomplicated fashion. For those reasons I welcome this decision.</p>

However, other families were involved in this dreadful tragedy, the anguish of which has been protracted over a long period. I know from my own information that many of those families and individuals in them were disturbed because of the controversy that continued in relation to this. Every time the issue was raised, there was trauma for individuals and families of the other 27 deceased. I seek reassurance from the Minister that the department with responsibility for this will ensure that those families are supported through this process, because some of them are now left in a situation where they do not know what was responsible for the death of their loved ones.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="11071356000209"></a><b>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Howell of Guildford):</b> My Lords, we now come to the consideration of the other place's response to your Lordships' amendments to this important legislation. Your Lordships will recall that we examined this Bill in great depth over eight sittings in Committee and three days on Report, so I hope we can deal with these matters thoroughly but also reasonably briefly. Your Lordships' House rightly took a good look at the detailed provisions of the Bill. We did our duty in scrutinising it, and we saw fit to make a number of amendments to the Bill-15 in all.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="11071356000210"></a>I shall make a brief comment to set the scene before coming to the Motion. There were four sets of issues which led us to focus on these matters today. The Government listened to the well and strongly put arguments on, first, the construction of Clause 18 and proposed amendments in the other place, which we will come to later. We also listened carefully to the arguments put forward on three other sets of issues: the turnout threshold, which is the Motion immediately before us; the proposed changes to the shape of Clause 6; and on the introduction of a sunset-maybe it should be renamed "suspension"-clause. The other place also looked at these things very carefully. On Monday last, the other place disagreed, as do the Government, with your Lordships' amendments on those three latter issues, and it is now for this House to consider and decide whether to insist on your Lordships' amendments or to accept the message from the other House.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="11071356000211"></a>The first of these issues is the subject of this Motion, which relates to Amendments 3 and 5 that were moved with great eloquence by the noble Lord, Lord Williamson of Horton. We had two debates on them, one in Committee and one on Report, and on Report your Lordships voted in favour of these amendments by 221 votes to 216. In contrast, the other place considered these amendments and disagreed to the Lords amendments without division, by consensus.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="11071356000212"></a>As my right honourable friend the Minister for Europe summing up the core issue said during the debate in the other place,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="11071356000259"></a>"The outcome of a referendum should, in our view, be determined by the will of those who vote and not by how many turn up to vote".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 11/7/11; col. 65.]</p>

<p><a name="11071356000246"></a>It remains our view that it is vital that in any referendum held in accordance with this Bill people are able to go out and vote in the knowledge that their active engagement in the process will count and that their vote will count. A threshold for any referendum held in accordance with this Bill would stymie the entire intent of the Bill.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="11071356000213"></a>In short, without going over again all the arguments that we have so carefully examined in your Lordships' House, installing a mechanism whereby the will of the electorate is automatically declared unimportant and the power to decide is passed back to Parliament is not the answer, nor is it the answer in the view of the House of Lords Constitution Committee. I shall not delay the House with a quotation from that Committee about the undesirability of thresholds. We saw that on the single occasion where a threshold was used, in 1979, the clearly expressed will of the people was

<ul><a name="11071356000272"></a>"Labour Members have reservations about the use of the 40% threshold".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 11/7/11; col. 75.]</ul>
<p><a name="11071356000247"></a>In November last year, Chris Bryant MP, who was Minister for Europe under the Labour Government, said that referendums were not a good idea. What interests me-I think that your Lordships also would like to know-is whether noble Lords opposite share those reservations, which they appeared not to share on Report. Please can we know whether they have changed their view?</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="11071356000214"></a>It now falls to your Lordships to consider whether to insist on these amendments, given the opposition, once again, to the threshold from the other place and given the clear and well informed doubts on all sides about the wisdom, sense and advisability of having thresholds injected into referenda for either these or wider matters. I hope that your Lordships will decide that we need not pursue this issue further. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="11071356000215"></a><b><a name="110713-0001.htm_spnew115"></a><a name="11071356000420"></a>Lord Williamson of Horton:</b> My Lords, we have not proposed any amendment to Motion A, which has been moved by the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford. Accordingly, we accept the decision of the House of Commons to refuse any role for Parliament in the event-a perhaps rather unlikely event-of a referendum with a small or even derisory turnout. It is regrettable that, not just in relation to this Bill but in relation to other issues more widely, we have not established how we might deal with such cases. As we see in the Localism Bill and elsewhere, the referendum is likely to play a much bigger role in government in Britain in the future and on more issues.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="11071356000216"></a>Although in this case the House of Commons has refused the role which this House proposed for Parliament, no doubt the noble Lord the Minister will agree that because Parliament is sovereign it could in the future, if it so wished, amend the Act to insert a role for itself as we proposed in relation to a low or very low turnout in a specific referendum. But that issue does not arise today.</p>

The matter will not be pressed today but I would ask the House to understand the reasons in the briefest sense for why this was argued and why I think, even in the earlier example of devolution decisions in the past, people were keen to see some sort of threshold. The proposal for a 40 per cent threshold is not a benchmark which would be insisted on for every kind of vote in every kind of circumstance, although some people might in many circumstances wish to see that figure exceeded.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="11071356000218"></a>We are talking about changes in quite fundamental constitutional arrangements. It seems quite reasonable to say that there should be some degree of consensus that is visible and substantial when a major constitutional change is to take place. These changes in relationships with Europe would be significant constitutional changes, which is precisely why this legislation is before the House in the first place. It would be wrong to say that  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_747"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 747</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it is not simply a matter of how many turn up to vote because whatever the proportion is you would still have to win the vote as well in order to achieve the result.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="11071356000219"></a>To conclude, a number of constitutional changes are before your Lordships' House in this parliamentary Session. We have had them on constituencies, on AV and in this Bill. We will probably see some in any Bill about reform of your Lordships' House. In introducing piecemeal constitutional change, always with the possibility of it being adopted without there being real and genuine safeguards, we will end up with a set of jig-saw pieces from different jig-saws all shaken into the same box and without prospect of being joined together in any realistic way or without people making realistic decisions about the overall impact of what we are doing. We deny ourselves the safeguard today and, once again, I suspect that we will regret it.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="11071356000260"></a>"Because the outcome of the referendum should be determined by those who vote in it and should not depend on how many do not vote".</p>

<p><a name="11071356000248"></a>One might say that that is almost contemptuous. I support what the noble Lords, Lord Williamson of Horton and Lord Triesman have said, although I do not expect them to press the matter to a vote.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="11071356000221"></a>However, I want to make one other reference, because it shows that the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, is right in saying that this issue cannot simply be put on a shelf and forgotten. Let me give three very quick quotations to the House. The first quotation is:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="11071356000261"></a>"The Government is under pressure from Tory MPs to reform industrial relations laws so unions would have to secure a turnout of more than 50 per cent in ballots before action could go ahead".</p>

<p><a name="11071356000249"></a>The second quotation is:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="11071356000262"></a>"The Confederation of British Industry has suggested a 40 per cent threshold",</p>

<p><a name="11071356000250"></a>before any industrial action can take place. Finally, third quotation is from the Conservative Mayor of London, Mr Boris Johnson, who has argued for a "50 per cent threshold" before London Underground could determine a strike.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="11071356000222"></a>This is an example of the fact that it is not enough to dismiss the proposals as if they were superficial and politically driven. It is clear in one area after another that the issue of thresholds is alive and relevant, and that already, in other spheres of legislation, there are very strong arguments that thresholds must be seriously considered. I advise the House to be a little careful about simply dismissing the argument for some kind of threshold.</p>

<a name="11071356000223"></a><b><a name="110713-0001.htm_spnew118"></a><a name="11071356000423"></a>Lord Howell of Guildford:</b> My Lords, I hesitate to enter again into the whole great debate on referendums, which really moves us away from the issues of the European Union Bill. My noble friend Baroness Williams  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_748"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 748</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has again put forward some strong arguments. These are matters that have been debated over the years. When we come to a Bill of this nature, the issues are similar to when one comes to legislation about local elections or elections to the European Parliament. Indeed, I believe there is even a parliamentary election on record in this country where the vote has been below 40 per cent but no one has suggested they should be invalid.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="11071356000224"></a>I suspect this debate will continue, but it is the view of the Government that in these circumstances such a threshold would create a charter for the abstentionists. It would be extremely attractive to those who were anxious not to vote and to promote the desire not to vote. It would undermine the whole purpose lying behind the structure of the Bill, which is to check the haemorrhaging of confidence and popular support for the European Union's development and to reinforce the case for the European Union's development. That is why I am a little sad to hear those who have dedicated their lives and efforts to promoting an effective and fit for purpose European Union not to be supporting it. However, I understand the alternative views and I leave the matter there.</p>

It did not suggest that a vote with a turnout under 40 per cent would be invalid. It suggested that it would be advisory and not mandatory-that is completely different. Frankly, some of the arguments that were adduced about the level of participation in the European Parliament elections are not transposable whatsoever to the area we are currently discussing, which is a national referendum.</p>

The invalidity I am applying is that the referendum would then become advisory, whereas the whole requirement and central thrust of the Bill is that the referendum is mandatory on Governments, not on Parliaments-you cannot be mandatory on Parliaments. That is what I intended to say, so I am sorry if I did not convey it accurately. We have had the debate, so I beg to press the Motion.</p>

As with the previous amendments, the Government listened carefully to the arguments put forward after the amendments were agreed by a vote of 214 to 209 in this House. The other place considered these issues further two days ago after having examined in detail the make-up of Clause 6 during its consideration at the start of this year. It has disagreed with your Lordships' amendments on the basis of our opposition to these changes and by consensus. In so doing, the shadow Europe Minister, Wayne David, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="11071356000264"></a>"Of course, Members in the other place are entitled to their views, but we have reservations about the proposal that referendums should be confined to these three subject areas, and it is important to put on the record that my comments set out the Labour party's position".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 11/7/11; col. 75.]</p>

<p><a name="11071356000251"></a>It now falls to your Lordships' House to consider whether to insist on its amendments on the basis of the approval of this clause, twice over, by the other place. I would be particularly interested to learn from noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite whether they will reflect the Labour Party's position today or continue to adopt a different approach.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="11071356000229"></a>In moving the amendments on Report, the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, stated that,</p>

<p><a name="11071356000252"></a>While I appreciate that there are strongly held views on this issue, I should like briefly to repeat why the Government do not agree with this view. The coalition's programme for government sets out at the start of the section on Europe that,</p>
<ul><a name="11071356000274"></a>"no further powers should be transferred to Brussels without a referendum".</ul>
<p><a name="11071356000253"></a>All the decisions listed in Clause 6 in its previous form would constitute such a transfer, as recognised by the other place in its reason for disagreement. As we have made clear previously, Clause 6 consists of five self-standing decisions of great sensitivity, such as on whether to join the euro or to give up national border controls, and seven sensitive national vetoes using a passerelle and avoiding formal treaty changes.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="11071356000230"></a>We are debating this Bill in the context of a wide malaise within the European public across most EU member states and a worrying disconnect between the Brussels institutions and the national publics of the member states. Michel Barnier, European Commissioner for the Internal Market, said in a recent speech in Berlin:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="11071356000265"></a>"For 60 years we have been building Europe for its citizens and in their name; but too often we have been doing it without them. A malaise has taken hold and the gap between Europe and its citizens has gradually widened"-</p>

<p><a name="11071356000254"></a>that is to say, not just within the UK but across the EU. The deference on which Europe was built, which was given to managerial élites in Brussels on behalf of its peoples but without their informed understanding and consent, and through which substantial powers were transferred to Brussels, has now disappeared. We have to rebuild public confidence in institutionalised co-operation among European Governments. We have to carry our voters with us, not sweep through complex multilateral commitments over their heads.</p>

Some noble Lords might like to reflect on whether there ever was a Faustian pact with the Murdoch press in its Anglo-Saxon but anti-European stance, whereby it would support British Governments so long as they maintained an opposition to stronger European co-operation and in particular to international regulation of media ownership and competition.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="11071356000232"></a>If I may speak as a Liberal Democrat, I am entirely comfortable with the constructive approach that this coalition is taking to relations with our European neighbours, large and small, and its positive engagement with the institutions of the European Union. However, it will take us time to regenerate public confidence and to rebuild public trust. The provisions of the Bill, including those of Clause 6, are there to reassure our sceptical citizens that the British Government will not attempt to slip past them unexplained further transfers of power or competence to institutions which at present, sadly, inspire limited loyalty and widespread mistrust.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="11071356000233"></a>The other place has now considered the scope of Clause 6 on two occasions. In both cases the other place has approved that the scope of the referendum requirement should incorporate the 12 decisions. On the second occasion it did so by overwhelming consensus. It now, therefore, falls to your Lordships' House to consider whether or not to insist on its amendments, but I beg to move that it accepts the view of the other place.</p>

The original amendment which this House carried reduced the number of referendum locks in the Bill from 56 to three-that is not counting major treaty change. That was the amendment that we carried and that has been considered by the other place. This amendment substitutes for the position we took on that occasion the view that referendums should be mandatory only where, in the view of the Secretary of State, they are of major economic and constitutional significance.

When you look at the questions of moving from consensus, or unanimity, to majority voting listed in Schedule 1 to the Bill, they cannot

For instance, there are matters such as the approximation of national laws affecting the internal market, the guidelines of economic policies and excessive deficit procedures. As we know, on one of these items-the British Government changing the list of military products exempt from internal market provisions-the noble Lord, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, pointed out that we had been arguing for this as a country in our national interest for years in the councils of the Union. So the Bill contains far more referendum locks than those that could be regarded as of major constitutional significance.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="11071356000236"></a>Noble Lords on the government Benches are fond of quoting the Lords Constitution Committee when it suits them. What they fail to quote is the major conclusion of the Lords Constitution Committee on referendums-that they should be used only on matters of major constitutional significance. They cannot conceivably argue that all the items covered here pass that test. If we do not apply this test, as in this revised amendment, we are making a major move from a representative democracy to a plebiscitary democracy and that is something that should be of as much concern to Eurosceptics as it is to pro-Europeans.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="11071356000237"></a>The other problem with this plethora of locks, as we have argued before, is that they will gravely inhibit the ability of any British Minister or Government to represent our national interests in European on a flexible basis as issues come up. No Government will volunteer to hold referendums, not because they fear Euroscepticism but because, as has been shown by all the academic evidence that has studied them, referendums are, in the main, decided by the people on issues other than the question being asked. That is what you get in a plebiscitary democracy. All kinds of issues are decided on questions that are nothing to do with the subject of the referendum. If it is impossible to put issues to referendums, then Britain will be very constrained in its European policy. If this is continued for 10 or 20 years, it is bound to lead to a process of British self-marginalisation in the European Union.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="11071356000238"></a>I do not believe for a second that that is what the noble Lords, Lord Howell and Lord Wallace, and the Benches opposite want. However, the truth is that the Adullamite cave of anti-Europeans in the other place and in the Conservative Party, who have insisted on putting the Bill in the coalition agreement, want to make Britain marginal in Europe because they want the Bill to lead to Britain coming out of the European Union.</p>

Your Lordships are even more out of touch with the British people of your own generation because among the over 60s the percentages are 61 per cent to leave and only 29 per cent to stay in. That is a poll carried out by YouGov@Cambridge for the political news website Dods PoliticsHome, so it is quite respectable.

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="11071378000002"></a>All our political institutions suffer from major distrust. If, again, you consider the polling evidence on trust in Parliament or trust in the Government, you will find that there is as much mistrust in the British Government, the British Parliament and the British political parties as there is in the European Union. Of course, one does not underestimate the degree of scepticism among the public, but it is ironic that we are discussing the question of Europe today when the Murdoch press is in such difficulty in its relations with the British people. I do not know how many noble Lords in this House have received mail and been approached by members of the public because of the amendments that we carried when the Bill went through the House before, but I suspect very few. The real public anger today is directed at the media-particularly at the Murdoch press and at News International, which more than other organisation has used its position to obstruct positive British policy in the European Union. By going along with this Bill we are sacrificing representative democracy and Britain's ability to pursue an effective policy in Europe.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="11071378000003"></a>I do not think, as I say, that is why the proposers are putting this Bill forward. I think that the Liberal Democrats are rather embarrassed by this piece of legislation, despite what the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, has told us.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="11071378000004"></a>It may upset the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, greatly but I have a lot of friends in Brussels. One of them passed on to me a letter that Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, had sent to Andrew Duff MEP about this piece of legislation. Towards the end, it says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="11071378000077"></a>"In addition, any referendum to ratify a Treaty change covered by the EU Bill's referendum lock must first be preceded by an Act of Parliament in order to provide Parliamentary approval and to make provisions for the holding of a referendum".</p>

<p><a name="11071378000073"></a>We all agree about the Act of Parliament. He goes on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="11071378000078"></a>"This would, for example, enable a future Parliament to decide that the provisions in the EU Bill should not apply by amending the Treaty change Bill to that effect".</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="11071378000005"></a>The only way I can read that statement is that the Deputy Prime Minister believes that the provisions of what would become the European Union Act 2011 would not apply if, in future legislation ratifying a European decision or a European treaty, a clause was inserted that the question was not constitutionally significant and therefore did not justify a referendum. I would very much like to know whether the Minister agrees with that interpretation of the Deputy Prime Minister's letter; whether he agrees and accepts that in any future Act ratifying an EU decision a Minister could insert a clause rather along the lines of our amendment; and if so, why the Government refuse so adamantly to accept this sensible amendment? I beg to move.</p>

<a name="11071378000006"></a><b><a name="110713-0001.htm_spnew130"></a><a name="11071378000088"></a>Lord Blackwell:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, called his amendment sensible. We should be clear that it is a wrecking amendment. It requires the Government to assert that a proposal is of major constitutional and economic significance. The noble Lord himself said that no Government voluntarily submit to a referendum. No proposal would come into the scope of this Bill unless the Government had supported it and had voted in favour of it in the European Union, so we can take it that the Minister and the Government would be behind whatever proposal was being put forward. We are then asking the Minister to volunteer to put a referendum through the terms of his amendment. As he said, no Government will voluntarily do that. We have the example of the Government's record on the Lisbon treaty, which by every measure should have been put to a referendum but which the Government solemnly told the House did not require one. It is partly because of that that we have the mistrust to which the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, referred.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="11071378000007"></a>Because of the Lisbon treaty we now have a treaty that allows many changes to the fundamentals of our treaty relationship with Europe, including the removal of vetoes on a whole range of policies covered by Clause 6, and amendments to the scope of the institutions and the powers of the European Union itself through the passerelle clauses. All are to be done through the agreement of Governments without the need for a treaty change, and therefore without the need for a referendum on a treaty change. That is why we need Clause 6: because the Lisbon treaty enabled those changes to be made without a treaty change, and Clause 6 ensures that that is picked up. The noble Lord's amendment would completely destroy that provision and overturn the view of the other place.</p>

Frankly, it is a sad day when the Liberal party recants

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="11071378000009"></a>Leaving that to one side, I took the trouble to listen to the debate in the other place. I think I was the only Member of your Lordships' House who did so. It was rather a sad occasion, much less well attended than this one. I am glad to see a wonderful cross-section of the views held in this House, which will no doubt be vigorously debated in the minutes or hours that follow. There was practically nobody there. When the noble Lord says that the decision was adopted by consensus, it was the consensus of around 15 or 20 people. They were mainly the people who went into the Lobby against the Government on Clause 18 and managed to muster 22 votes. They are therefore people who, by their own admission, would much rather than Britain was not in the European Union. That is a perfectly respectable position to take; it is the position that the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, takes.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="11071378000010"></a>On the matter that we are discussing now, I support the amendment. No one, including me, is persisting with the amendments that we tabled to the Bill and were voted on in this House. They would have reduced the number of referendums substantially, though not to only three. The amendment did not affect the provisions that would have required a referendum if any general constitutional treaty, such as Lisbon, Nice, Maastricht or the Single European Act, had come forward. That was not covered by the amendment that was rejected by the House of Commons. Only the numerous provisions that provide for 56 other referendums were covered.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="11071378000011"></a>I should like briefly to make three points in favour of this amendment. First, on marginalisation, given the problems with holding a referendum at particular moments in our parliamentary cycle, there is a risk that people may be minded to vote for reasons that have nothing to do with the question on the ballot paper. Therefore, a British Government would be compelled to reject a change in Europe that they believed to be in the British interest and wished to support because they did not feel able to go to the country in a referendum. This is exceedingly serious. That is why we should all listen rather carefully to someone I respect enormously, Sir John Major, who said at Ditchley in the annual lecture that he gave last Saturday that Britain was at risk of being a semi-detached member of the European Union. I know that is not the object of the Government. I have heard many government spokesmen flatly deny that and say how active we are. However, they should take this risk seriously.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="11071378000012"></a>The second problem is the one that has been alluded to already by the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, which is that this is a major extension of plebiscitary democracy in a country that has hitherto prided itself in putting its faith in representative parliamentary democracy. This is not a small subject. Frankly, what is odd about this is the huge extension of the plebiscitary approach in one sector of our national and international life, which is not applied to any of the rest of it at all. When it was suggested in our earlier debates in Committee and Report that perhaps the Government were in

They swore mightily that they had no such thought. But this is a very odd way to go about constitutional change. It really is pretty peculiar to introduce this huge raft of potential referendums into this area.</p>

<a name="110713-0001.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="11071378000013"></a>Finally, on my third point, I support this amendment because the lack of flexibility given by the Bill, if it were to pass and become an Act, is a major danger. It imports rigidity into the whole British approach to Europe and, by transposition, it risks importing rigidity into the whole evolution of the European Union. Institutions that do not have the means to reform and adapt themselves become fragile and risk falling out of contact with what they are meant to be doing. This is a really serious problem being caused here, and these rigidities are liable to damage both the European Union and our own national interests. The purpose of the amendment is to provide a little bit of flexibility where none exists in the present Bill, which is why I support it.</p>

I merely wish to tease him a bit for one moment by saying that it is clear that he does not understand the readership of the <I>Daily Mail</I>-and I am sure that that is the case, as it does not appear to be his favourite reading, from what he said on an earlier intervention. But I do not think that he absolutely understands the Liberal Democrats either. Indeed, I am not actually sure that he listens to the Liberal Democrats. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, made it absolutely plain in his statement that he was a Liberal Democrat, and I too, as the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, knows, belong to that party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="11071378000015"></a>None the less, the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, made a very serious and profound point, which was reflected in his signature to the important letter to the <I>Times</I> today, which the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and other immensely eminent noble Lords have signed also. The point, of course, is that the issues reflected in the EU Bill for referendums are of "fundamental constitutional importance", to quote the letter. The statement made in the letter, which he reflected again today in his speech, is that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="11071378000079"></a>"The Parliamentary Constitution Scrutiny Committee recommends that referendums should be confined to changes of fundamental constitutional importance".</p>

<p><a name="11071378000074"></a>Of course, economy of the truth is something that others, maybe even Secretaries to the Cabinet, have used to great effect. While I personally disagree profoundly with him on losing a national veto over key areas outlined in the Bill being regarded as of "fundamental constitutional importance"-I think they should be-none the less, I take issue with the noble Lord for the way in which he has clipped the important statements made by the Constitution Committee in its report on referendums in the UK. The report goes on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="11071378000080"></a>"There are difficulties in defining what constitutes a 'fundamental constitutional issue'. Although some constitutional issues clearly are of fundamental importance, and others not, there is a grey area where the importance of issues is a matter of political judgment".</p>

Yesterday I had the pleasure of a meeting and a long discussion with the president of the Slovenian upper Chamber. We were discussing very openly the current political malaise in Slovenia-it is doing very well economically but there is political malaise there-and the fact that the people of Slovenia were completely turned off by the political class, both the Government and the Parliament. We were told that one of the major reasons for this was that they are fed up with having referendums. They are saying to the Parliament, "We elected you to take decisions and to govern, and a Government is there to govern, so why can you do nothing without first asking the people in referendums? We elected you to take those decisions". I think that they have a point. This is a country that, not so long ago, had no democratic institutions at all. It had no means by which people could express their opinions; they have them now. What is their reaction to the massive referendums to which they are subjected? They say, "That is not the way we want to be governed. We did not give up the yoke of communism to be governed in this way". Perhaps occasionally it is a good idea to listen to small countries.</p>

They have referenda only according to constitutional criteria such as those in this amendment, so the Irish Government are not fettered with the inflexible overreach of the Bill as it otherwise stands. Therefore it seems to me that this amendment has the merit of Parliament authorising the Minister to exercise her or his discretion in the particular case using a criterion that is well understood and doing so under the authority of Parliament.</p>

If they can possibly avoid it, no Government ever have a referendum; that is exactly what the noble Lord said and exactly what I have been saying. That means that the apparent intention to have referenda on any or all of the 56 subjects in the Bill is entirely hypocritical. There is no such intention whatever. We all know that it would be quite absurd to have a referendum on almost all of them-on 50, at least, out of the 56. The British public would think it a ludicrous waste of time and money, and they would be completely right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="11071378000026"></a>The intention is really entirely obstructionist, which is what I am so worried about. It sends the worst possible signal to our partners in the European Union. Indeed, it presages a period of great difficulty for us in our relations with our EU partners and our ability to positively influence the EU. It is so important that we

We need to form an effective, cohesive bloc with our European partners and argue with them in the relevant international fora.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="11071378000027"></a>What does one make of this argument that the Government keep on coming up with-the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, repeated it this afternoon-that this extremely obstructionist concept of having referenda on all those subjects is somehow indispensable in better communicating to the British public the virtues and merits of our membership of the European Union? The noble Lord's argument really does not have any conviction at all; it does not ring genuine or true. Anybody who knows the first thing about marketing knows that if you want to sell something, the one thing you can never do is be negative about it. If you want to sell it at all, you have to sell it with enthusiasm and genuine conviction. Once you start saying, "Well, this is a problem so we need to apply brakes and think of new blockages", and so forth, you have lost it completely. The noble Lord was a very distinguished professor of international relations but if he had chosen a marketing career, he would have been an absolute disaster. He would never have sold a single car or tube of toothpaste on the basis of the approach which he outlined this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="11071378000028"></a>Our enacting this Bill will have two effects. One is that there will be substantive damage done to the interests of this country in specific areas. In an amendment on Report, I raised the issue of a single market in the defence industry. That is quite clearly in our national interests, but we would not now be able to agree to it unless we had a referendum. I went through that and explained that we really would shoot ourselves in the foot-that was the expression I used-if we went ahead with that. The Government did not seriously argue against that case at all. They simply said, "Sorry, we are embarked upon this course and there may be a few things to be thought of". The noble Lord, Lord Howell, was nice enough to say that I may have some arguments there but that they would carry on regardless-that was more or less the response I had.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="11071378000029"></a>Let me give another case, because it is important to look at specific, concrete cases where it may be in the national interest to transfer powers or competences to the institutions of the European Union, particularly the Commission. A few years ago the Commission made a proposal that it should have the right to audit and monitor the accounts of member states. That was opposed by a number of member states, including ourselves and the Germans, and it did not go through. Had it been able to go through on a qualified majority voting basis then we would have had the Commission monitoring the national accounts of Greece. The scandals and mistakes that have occurred with devastating consequences-going into tens of billions of euros, as we all know, and the threat of a banking crisis which undoubtedly will affect us if it arises, and so forth-would have been avoided, because somebody else would have been able to go through those accounts. The European Commission would have been able to do so. Of course all the Eurosceptics in this Chamber and in the other place would have said, Oh, this is a terrible thing

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="11071378000030"></a>Such occasions can easily occur in the future. We all know that we cannot predict the crises and challenges of next year or even six months hence, let alone five or 10 years hence, but we are now denying ourselves definitively an effective possible weapon to deal with such challenges and crises. That is the effect of the Bill. I totally agree with the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell: there ain't going to be no referenda on this Bill. We all know that was complete rubbish. What this Bill is actually doing is enacting a complete blockage so far as we are concerned.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="11071378000031"></a>The second consequence of this, of course, is that it will give a great boost to the enhanced co-operation agenda in the EU. Our partners will know in advance that there is no point in bringing the Brits into the discussion-because they are paralysed; because they have got to say no; because no Minister could possibly even say yes subject to a referendum, because no Government are ever going to want the referendum. Therefore they will not want the Brits in the room from the beginning: that is quite clear. So, they will say we have got to make progress on this, we have got to take a decision on this, we have to do it ourselves, under the enhanced co-operation procedure-which is now of course available under the treaty. We are going to give a tremendous boost to that. This means, of course, that we will not be present at that discussion. We all know that the European Union is a horse-trading organisation, and agreements are often in terms of packages-a perfectly natural thing in human affairs. If we are not part of the discussion in one particular area, it may make it much more difficult for us to do an advantageous bargain or deal in another context which is very important for us. We are going to be steadily and progressively left out of the mechanism of decision-taking in the European Union. That is a very serious prospect and we are bringing it not only closer but so close that it is a damned racing certainty if we enact this Bill in its present form.</p>

First, we have to decide whether we are persuaded by the arguments put forward in the other place that what we have decided here should not stand up.

Up to now, we have had a constitution in which the referendum, until modern times, had no role whatever. We had sufficient confidence in parliamentary government to believe that the representatives of the people should be responsive to the people but not slaves to the momentary wishes of the people, and that that was the right way in which decisions should be

A breach was made, 25 years ago, 35 years ago or more, but one breach and one breach only. This legislation changes the balance dramatically by making referenda, instead of extremely rare, things which could be extremely common.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="11071378000034"></a>The amendments that were passed by this House mitigate what I consider the damage to the British constitution a small degree. The question is, are we persuaded by the arguments put forward in the other place that the mitigation that we introduced is something which we should no longer support? I am not so persuaded, because the amendments that we put forward were quite modest, still leaving a Bill which breached-in my view unnecessarily and undesirably-the principle of parliamentary government, but they were mitigatory amendments and therefore we supported them in this House, and we passed them in this House. Nothing that was said in the other House persuades me that we were wrong to do so, because the balance of the constitution in which a referendum is a rare instrument, applied only in exceptional circumstances, is one which I continue to support. I am not persuaded by the arguments put forward in the other House that the modest amendments that we put forward, which would reduce the plethora of amendments and other referenda from a flood to a trickle, were undesirable. I was persuaded last time we discussed this that they were desirable, and I remain of that view now.</p>

It supplies a criterion which identifies when it is appropriate for a referendum to be held. Since mention has been made of the views of the Constitution Committee of your Lordships' House, of which I am a member, I will remind your Lordships of the three points that the committee made in its report on this Bill.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="11071378000036"></a>First, we noted that in our earlier report on the use of referendums, we concluded that if referendums are to be used they should be confined to fundamental constitutional issues. Secondly, we noted that this Government had expressed agreement with that criterion in the context of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act. Thirdly, we concluded that it could not be said that every treaty change which would, under this Bill, require a referendum, would involve a fundamental constitutional issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="11071378000037"></a>My answer to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, is that I understand this amendment to impose a duty on the Minister in good faith to consider whether the issue is one of economic or constitutional significance, and if so to lay a Statement before Parliament. I do not accept that this leaves matters entirely to political judgment: it imposes a criterion, it is a considered response to the Commons view, and I hope we will support the amendment today.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="11071378000039"></a>First, it is proposed that these referenda be mandatory on the Government. Secondly, it was said by the noble Lord in a previous session that it might be rather inconvenient if there were a whole string of different referendums and so they could be grouped together in some way for the purpose of having them on a certain date. The issue of EU energy taxation being extended or some other legal question on an industrial matter might be put together for the purpose of the referendum day. This taxes the imagination. I have tried to imagine that I am sitting listening to a conversation in a pub in Burton-on-Trent. After all, this is the demotic that we are all being asked to say is so much more important than parliamentary democracy. So, I am sitting in a pub in Burton-on-Trent, and after a discussion on what is running in the 2.30 at Newmarket, Fred says to his mate Alec, "What are you doing on this thing that they want us to vote on tomorrow?". "No idea, Fred, it's all Greek to me", replies Alec.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="11071378000040"></a>How do we know that the people want all these referendums? How much time would elapse in Brussels if we simply, as the awkward squad, sat for several months on a whole string of items until the famous day when they could be brought together? That looks so totally unreasonable that people in Europe-they are friends of ours, presumably; we are in a Community-might say, "If you are a member of a club, you ought to be more co-operative than that. If you carry on as you are, you might as well get out". If we held a referendum on staying in or getting out, I am pretty confident that the staying in vote would win. There might be consensus on that, but it is not the subject of this amendment. This is a vicious circle. If you want to be a member of a club, you have to co-operate. If I carried on like this in my tennis club, it might be suggested that I joined another club more suited to my temperament. The Government do not have the candour to say what they want to do because I do not think that some of their members would agree with that position. However, they want to go as near as they can to implying what they want to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="11071378000041"></a>In practice, this amendment meets the test set by the Constitution Committee. I think that there is consensus in the House on it.</p>

I do not think that it can be disputed that the Bill in its present form makes it infinitely more difficult to stick to the constitutional principle announced by the Scrutiny Committee that referenda should be restricted to matters of fundamental constitutional significance. Why would a spread of more plebiscites be so dangerous? It is because the system of parliamentary government has been far superior in preserving certain rights, particularly minority rights, than would be the case with referenda and plebiscites. For example, one can imagine the populist propaganda that would pour out further to restrict asylum seekers and make this a less civilised country. That would apply also to those suspected of committing terrorist offences. We have heard some examples of that. However, this goes beyond minority rights and individual rights. What about protectionism? "British jobs for British people" was Mr Brown's ill advised slogan. If protectionism had spread throughout Europe or throughout the world after the crash, we

The Government have been arguing that this clause would apply only to matters of constitutional value and that those who have worried about various aspects of it are worrying unnecessarily. We now have an amendment which specifically says that the Minister must say publicly that the referendum concerns a matter of constitutional or economic importance. That seems to me not an unreasonable thing to do when it is precisely what the Government say this clause is meant to do. Although I do not believe in referenda in any circumstances, I am not approaching this from that point of view. Frankly, I am trying to help the Government because it seems to me that they have not convinced all of us that their explanation of this clause is precisely right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="11071378000044"></a>My noble friend Lord Blackwell is entirely wrong: this is not a wrecking amendment-unless the Government's proposal is a wrecking amendment-in fact, it enhances what the Government have asked for. Your Lordships should say to yourselves, "Whether we are Eurosceptics or enthusiasts for Europe"-as I am-"whatever our view may be, it is not unreasonable to say that referenda should be held on matters of considerable importance, not ones which are not of considerable importance". It is not unreasonable to put that in the Bill.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="11071378000045"></a>As regards the way in which we have approached this, I believe that there are real issues for our stance in the European Union. Those who are Eurosceptic ought to be just as concerned as those of us who are of a different opinion, because unless we are able to argue about minor matters with the freedom which a representative Government have, we will do ourselves down on many of the issues that have been raised. If this amendment merely allows for that freedom, it is important and valuable and certainly does not in any way wreck the proposal.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="11071378000046"></a>There is truth in the argument that says that we should watch any constitutional change of this magnitude with great care. I say to the noble Baroness behind me who spoke on the Liberal Democrat position that the more she read what the Constitution Committee of this House said, the more she made the case for the amendment, because the Constitution Committee said that if you are going to have referenda, you should make sure that they are on serious matters. Sometimes it is difficult to decide what are serious matters. We have produced an amendment which says to the Minister, "You have to make up your mind, you have to agree to it and you have to say that publicly". After all, most of our Bills have a statement on the front that the relevant Minister knows that it accords with human rights. It is not unreasonable to ask Ministers to make that choice. I think that is what the Government want. Why, therefore, have they not accepted this amendment, or something like it?</p>

He knows that many of us are not entirely happy with the logic of saying that we have to have all this in order to reconnect with the public. Could he not move towards us just a little and be prepared to put in the Bill what he has told us is actually there? That would make us feel that the Government had listened to us and that there was a two-way discussion on this. If he does not do that, I am afraid that I cannot even begin to reach out to the concept that this Bill enhances our relationships and I shall begin to recede into a position of wondering whether it is not intended to make people like my noble friend happier. I am not sure that that is what we should be debating.</p>

It is clear that the British public are against Governments surrendering any further sovereignty to the EU without the consent of the people. That was very much reflected in the attitude taken to the previous Government's signing up to Lisbon, having promised a referendum and then having ratted on it. The whole point of the Bill, clumsy though it may be, is to provide a deterrent to stop Governments of any political hue giving away yet more sovereignty, and the British people not having a say in that. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, gave the game away. He was arguing that he wanted a situation where Governments could fudge it and give away a bit more sovereignty and was very unhappy that they might be deterred from doing that through fear of losing a referendum. The whole point of the Bill is to provide an effective deterrent to Governments giving away sovereignty. This amendment would weaken that principle.</p>

Indeed, we had long discussions about these provisions, and after hearing all the debates I believe that the Government were right to try to get it through this House.

If it was Labour Party policy, as the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, assured us and as is contained in his amendment, why was it not moved in the House of Commons? That is where it should have been done, but it was not done. What is the gain? If the Labour Party believes in restricting the effect of Clause 6, why did it not try to do that in the elected House? In the circumstances, this House ought to take note of what the other place has done.</p>

He made the reasonable point that if it were a unitary state the Commission would have examined the accounts of the Greek Government. It had the opportunity to do so before Greece was admitted to the eurozone, but it did not do it because it was a politically driven decision. It wanted as many countries in the eurozone as possible, whether they were broke or, like Germany, prosperous. We should be very careful when using the present crisis to undermine the Bill.

I agree in general that referendums should be held largely on

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="11071378000059"></a>We had quotations from the side opposite and from Cross-Benchers in earlier debates from Edmund Burke and the judgment of members of the legislature. One might quote back at them Tom Paine, who argued that constitutions belong to the people: that it is not for politicians to decide the rules by which government is conducted-sovereignty comes from the people. While I think that referendums should be on constitutional issues-important constitutional issues, as has been said-the totality of our relationship with Europe is a huge constitutional issue. It is therefore right that referendums should play a part in that.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="11071378000060"></a>That poses the question: is it right that we should have in this Bill so many different powers and so many different issues all rolled into one that might, as has been said, give rise to a flood of referendums on trivial issues? I do not believe that that will be the consequence of this Bill. That has been said before in our proceedings on the Bill, so I shall not go on about it at any great length. I will say, however, that that will not happen because: first, these measures are likely to come in packages; and, secondly, there are reserve powers-reserved to the nation state and left out of the previous treaties of Lisbon, Nice and Maastricht-because individual countries in the past have wanted to preserve them, and not necessarily Britain. There are other countries in the European Union, and one can look through the minutes of the constitutional convention leading up to the Lisbon treaty to see how some other countries in the past have argued for the veto to be preserved in certain areas. This is not just at the insistence of British politicians.</p>

In those circumstances, how are people who agree with one issue but disagree with another supposed to vote?</p>

The answer is: just as they vote in elections. They have to decide on five or six issues in an election. In the past, there were referendums in other countries on treaties in which they had to decide on a series of questions raised by those treaties. I repeat my point that where a veto exists, it is not necessarily just at Britain's insistence but because other countries, too, wanted it.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="11071378000063"></a>Thirdly, I think we will have referendums only where a British Minister agrees with the proposition that will be put to the people of this country, and where the Government believe that they can win the referendum. For that reason, and with great respect, I do not agree with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, that our flexibility in negotiations will be impeded because a certain area is covered by the possibility of a referendum being held on it. If a Minister wishes to argue in favour of something, presumably he is confident that he can sell it to the public. If he cannot sell it to the public, and they are

Therefore, although I agree with the general proposition that we do not want to go down the road of having a massive extension of plebiscitary democracy, I do not think that that will be the consequence of the Bill. That assertion has been repeated many times, but the argument is not convincing and I urge my noble friend to support the Government on this.</p>

<p><a name="st_158"></a>
<a name="11071378000064"></a><b><a name="110713-0002.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="11071378000112"></a>Lord Howell of Guildford:</b> My Lords, I hope that I will be forgiven if I say that I have a faint feeling of having been here before-and forgiven also for not responding to every strongly held view and argument put forward in this debate that was put forward again and again in the past. The Government and I regard some of these arguments as deeply flawed and consider that they do not understand or come to grips with the realities of political life today, either here or in the rest of the European Union. I will also deal briefly, as is the custom, with the Motion-it is not the custom to make long second speeches on a Motion-and with the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, which goes very much further than anything standing against the Government's Motion that the amendments be resisted.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="11071378000065"></a>On the decisions involved in Clause 6, none is in the grey or insignificant category. They are all there for very strongly established reasons that are largely supported by many other countries. Many vetoes are maintained because the signatories to the Lisbon treaty did not want them to go into the QMV category. They are there because their use could only ever provide for a transfer of competence and power from the UK to the European Union-for reasons that we have explained from this Dispatch Box and that many of my noble friends have explained again and again-and so should be subject to the referendum requirement.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="11071378000066"></a>It is difficult to accept that any of the decisions in Clause 6 would not be significant in constitutional or economic terms. Those who say that it stretches their imagination to understand the significance of the measures listed in Clause 6, or Schedule 1, which springs from it, surprise me. Surely a decision on whether to give up our vetoes on, for instance, the multiannual financial framework, border controls or joining the single currency-I refer now to the amendment of the noble Lords, Lord Liddle and Lord Triesman, not to the main one that accepts them-would all fall, under Amendment 13B, into the bracket of something that had to be judged according to whether or not it was significant. This is a completely unnecessary process. Clearly they are of the most profound significance.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="11071378000067"></a>I know that the shadow Minister for Europe said on Monday that he considered other items in Clause 6 to be not so important. He exempted the important three-border controls, the European currency and one other-but dismissed the others as paperclips and minutiae. We do not accept that analysis. We firmly believe that the other issues are also of great significance and, when understood in terms of their impact on jobs, work and the processes by which our law system operates, certainly could be subjects of conversation in the pub in Burton-on-Trent, where the noble Lord, Lord Lea, has been listening to conversations.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_767"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 767</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="11071378000068"></a>On the European public prosecutor, I know that it is regarded by some of my noble friends, and by some noble Lords opposite, as not being of constitutional or economic significance. However, it is because it involves affording a supranational body the ability to prosecute citizens of this country within the scope of its own criminal justice system in respect of alleged crimes affecting the EU's financial interests. Someone must decide what that financial interest is and whether the crime has been committed. Is that a paperclip or minutiae issue?</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="11071378000069"></a>What about the vetoes listed in Schedule 1? Why are they not significant when they all relate-that is why they are there-to the red lines adopted by successive Governments, fought for very hard by the previous Government and sustained by this Government, covering foreign affairs, security and defence policy, economic and tax policy, including issues of the EU's budget, which all of us admit is a red-hot issue, social security, employment policy, justice and home affairs policy, and citizenship and elections? Are these all minutiae, paperclip decisions and things that are never discussed in any pub? I have to ask where some of my noble friends, and some noble Lords, have been if they think that these matters are of no significance, because they include not only domestic issues, where after all Parliament can make and unmake laws, but transfers of power, sovereignty and competence that would almost certainly be irrevocable-in fact, they would be irrevocable.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="11071378000070"></a>The amendment before us would, for instance, allow the British Government to relinquish their veto over decisions relating to the multiannual financial framework without first getting the consent of the British people. That is a hugely important decision that Members in the other place were particularly concerned with, and rightly so. The Minister for Europe rightly pointed out that the forthcoming decision on that framework will in effect set budgetary decisions and ceilings for the next five to seven years of the EU's life and development. Are these minutiae, paperclip decisions or matters that people will not understand? I ask my noble friends and noble Lords who think that these matters are insignificant to think again. Their significance is obvious.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="11071378000071"></a>It is vital that these matters remain subject to unanimity and that whichever British Government are in office-this matter should be above party-continue to have the right of veto. Similar views are taken in almost every other country in the European Union. We all know what happens when one gets casual about the veto and lets it go. This was the case in the surrender of the veto on Article 122 of the TFEU, which opened the way to fearsome, huge and titanic new financial commitments to the funding of Europe in its present financial difficulties.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="11071378000072"></a>The amendment before us would reduce precisely the clarity that we all seek. It would also risk the possibility of judicial review on a decision by the Minister not to consider one of these clear-cut decisions to be significant. The so-called pragmatic flexibility that the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, keeps reminding us about and seeks could well be impeded by his own amendment. He would end up in a quagmire of pragmatic flexibility of his own making. It was too much of this pragmatic flexibility approach in the past that caused

The ministerial discretion that some of my noble friends and noble Lords call for has become the ministerial indiscretion and undermining of trust and support for the European Union that we are trying to correct.</p>

If the Minister declares, therefore, that he believes something to be-or not to be-a matter of importance, it is not a matter that could then go to the courts. It would be settled by the House itself.</p>

That is not a matter that we discussed much in Committee or one that we would necessarily want to see operate very fully in this or any other area of ministerial decisions on any aspect of policy. However, judicial review is there and ministerial decisions can be challenged.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="1107141000003"></a>The House of Commons has twice approved the scope and operation of Clause 6 following a clear exposition from the shadow Europe minister and his views on party policy on Amendments 6 to 13.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="1107141000004"></a>I do not want to take further time meeting the marginalisation argument. Frankly, it is a chestnut, as there is absolutely no impact on Ministers' discretion and flexibility merely because they have sanctions behind them. Most European member states' Ministers have sanctions of various sorts lying behind them on the decisions that they reach.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="1107141000005"></a>The plebiscitary democracy issue, frankly, belongs to the pre-internet age, before the web and the internet system. We see all around the world the wider public's insistence on having a say where major issues about the transfers of power and competence away from their sovereign control are involved. That is exactly what would happen here. The idea that there would be 56 different referenda coming along is pure fantasy and does not relate to the actual way in which these issues would arise. There would be no great frequency of referenda; this is not the pattern for the future. It will not be the result of this Bill and it certainly would not be the outcome of the way in which the European Union has operated, is operating, or is likely to operate in the future. It is not in the interests of the 27-maybe soon 28-members to proceed in that way.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="1107141000006"></a>I think that the noble Lord would be wise to accept the Motion and the view taken in the other place. He would be wise to reject the amendment and therefore I ask him to withdraw it and accept the Motion so ably moved by my noble friend.</p>

I just want to make one comment on what the Minister has said. As you know, I believe in the noble Lord's integrity in putting this Bill forward. I do not believe he is putting it forward for anti-European reasons. I do not think that that is what he thinks, but the truth is that the list of referendum locks contained in this Bill far exceed any reasonable person's definition of issues of fundamental constitutional significance. On that basis, I would like to test the opinion of the House.</p>

We have heard from those who sought to ensure that the clause was more than declaratory and from those who expressed concern that Clause 18 might somehow affect our obligations as a member state. As my noble friends Lord Howell and Lord Wallace of Saltaire have said, and I have made clear, that is not the case. I hope we have assured your Lordships' House very effectively that this clause is declaratory and is intended to be declaratory. It underlines the existing legal position and confirms how directly effective and directly applicable European Union law takes effect in the United Kingdom, no more and no less. It will certainly not change in any way the constructive activist/pragmatist approach that this Government have and will continue to pursue in our engagement with our European Union partners on the priorities that matter to the people of this country.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="1107141000009"></a>Although the clause is declaratory, we believe it serves an important and valuable purpose. I echo the words of my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern who said on Report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="1107141000157"></a>"It is important that this declaratory measure should be made because of the theory sometimes propounded that Community law in the United Kingdom derives from the treaty alone by virtue of the European Union legal order. I believe that it is right that we should make it plain at this juncture that that is not so".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 15/6/11; col. 790.]</p>

<p><a name="1107141000147"></a>I welcome the acceptance by your Lordships' House and the other place of the principle underlying Clause 18. What we have before us, as we did on Report, is the question as to how we apply that clause and whether the 1972 Act should be the only Act which is to be covered by Clause 18. In this, I fully recognise the reasoning behind the approval which your Lordships gave to the amendment on Report.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_773"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 773</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110713-0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="1107141000010"></a>The aim in doing so was quite rightly to make the clause as specific and clear as possible, an aim which is wholeheartedly one which one could support. But, as I have already said, I recognise the concerns expressed by noble Lords that Clause 18 should make more specific reference to the European Communities Act 1972. When we debated this on Report, I made it clear that the reason we could not accept the amendment was because we were of the firm belief that a number of other Acts of Parliament also give effect to directly effective and directly applicable European Union law independently of the 1972 Act. Therefore, to accept a provision that referenced the 1972 Act alone would be to accept a change in the existing legal position, which could go beyond what we had always intended.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="1107141000011"></a>Although the European Communities Act 1972 is the principal means by which directly effective and directly applicable EU law takes effect in the United Kingdom, the amendment agreed by your Lordships' House could have created a significant risk that the courts might interpret the clause as restricting the ability of the other Acts of Parliament to incorporate directly applicable or directly effective EU law into our United Kingdom law.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="1107141000012"></a>The amendment accepted by your Lordships' House also removed the phrase, "It is only" from the clause. This wording is intended to make it explicit that it is only by virtue of Acts of Parliament that directly effective and directly applicable EU law takes effect in the United Kingdom. Removing this reference leaves open the possibility of arguments to be made that directly effective and directly applicable EU law could enter into United Kingdom law by other means, which undermines the very rationale behind the clause.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="1107141000013"></a>Nevertheless, we have reflected on the amendment and the Government have demonstrated already that we wish to listen to arguments put forward by noble Lords. When there are grounds for a change to be made, we are prepared to make the change. In doing so, I wish to put on record our gratitude to my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern, with whom we have discussed in depth possible alternatives to his amendment to ensure that any amendment in lieu addresses his concerns sufficiently.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="1107141000014"></a>The Government subsequently proposed amendments to your Lordships' amendment in the other place, which we believe achieves these two objectives. These amendments are before us today. It may help your Lordships if I set out how the clause will read if these two amendments are added:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="1107141000158"></a>"Directly applicable or directly effective EU law (that is, the rights, powers, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, remedies and procedures referred to in section 2(1) of the European Communities Act 1972) falls to be recognised and available in law in the United Kingdom only by virtue of that Act or where it is required to be recognised and available in law by virtue of any other Act".</p>

<p><a name="1107141000148"></a>As I have indicated, we are particularly grateful for the engagement of my noble and learned friend and for his advice. My understanding is that he is content with the amendments to his original change.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="1107141000015"></a>I am also pleased to note that the other place voted overwhelmingly in favour of the government amendments by 485 votes to 22. These amendments were supported by the Opposition, with the shadow Minister for Europe calling them,</p>
<ul><a name="1107141000171"></a>"a modest improvement to what was suggested by the Lords".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 11/7/11; col. 98.]</ul>

<p><a name="1107141000149"></a>I therefore beg to move that this House acknowledges the considerable support of the other House for these two amendments to the amendment that was proposed by this House. I ask your Lordships to support these amendments today. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="1107141000016"></a><b><a name="110713-0002.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="1107141001015"></a>Lord Mackay of Clashfern:</b> My Lords, as the one who took the main argument on Clause 18 on Report with an amendment which was carried by quite a reasonable majority in your Lordships' House, I am happy to assure your Lordships that this debate need not be anything like as long as the previous one because I am entirely happy with the proposed amendments and the resulting Clause 18.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="1107141000017"></a>The amendments restrict the matter to directly applicable and directly effective EU law. We are not concerned with other Acts which introduce EU law directly-for example, where it uses a particular provision of EU law to make law in this country. We do not need to concern ourselves with that. Originally, in an attempt to meet with the Government, I drafted an amendment which covered that as well as this. But I understand that it is now agreed that we just need to deal with directly effective and directly applicable EU law.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="1107141000018"></a>I am not 110 per cent convinced that there are other Acts which do this but, using the suggestion of my noble friend Lord Flight of the belt and braces, there is no harm in adding this because the 1972 Act is now specifically referred to. There is no doubt in my mind that it is the key to this aspect of EU law in this country. I hope that your Lordships will accept these amendments and my gratitude to the Government for their acceptance of the principle of the amendment which was accepted here, and for defending me from various allegations that were made in the other place about my motivation.</p>

I just want to say a few of things about it. First, I do not think that Clause 18 was ever necessary, except in a political sense. Secondly, I do not think that the law was ever unclear. Thirdly, it is one of the comical aspects of our unwritten constitution that if you ask a group of lawyers or law students the origin of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, they never know the answer. The answer of course is that it comes from the common law. That answer is most unwelcome to a certain kind of thinker, who thinks, "Oh dear, if it comes from the common law, the courts might take it away again". We do not have to go into that today.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="1107141000020"></a>This amendment states the position as has always been made clear in the case law and therefore does no harm. I only wish that it had not been necessary in the first place. I also wish that the original Explanatory Notes that the Government introduced had not been maintained instead of being withdrawn for political reasons for another set of Explanatory Notes, all of which shows the unfortunate aspects of a Bill which is a politically cosmetic exercise in this respect.</p>

For the avoidance of all misunderstanding, the Printed Paper Office handed to me yesterday a copy of the Explanatory Notes. I shall make two references. My first is:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="1107141000159"></a>"This clause does not alter the existing relationship between EU law and UK domestic law; in particular, the principle of the primacy of EU law. The principle of the primacy of EU law was established in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice before the accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities".</p>

<p><a name="1107141000150"></a>The second reference is:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="1107141000160"></a>"Thus this clause is declaratory of the existing legal position. The rights and obligations assumed by the UK on becoming a member of the EU remain intact. Similarly, it does not alter the competences of the devolved legislatures or the functions of the Ministers in the devolved administrations as conferred by the relevant UK Act of Parliament".</p>

<p><a name="1107141000151"></a>It would be very helpful if the noble and learned Lord could confirm that those Explanatory Notes, only as Explanatory Notes, remain as they were originally applied to a different Clause 18 from the one that this House is about to accept.</p>

With regard to the Explanatory Notes, I can confirm to the noble Lord and the House that, as is customary, the Government will review the Explanatory Notes in their entirety. The notes on this clause will be considered as part of the exercise and we expect that there will have to be some consequential change to reflect the new wording of the clause. But that apart we have reviewed the Explanatory Notes in the light of proposed changes and consider that the notes, as drafted, accurately reflect the purpose and effect of Clause 18. I hope that that gives the reassurance that the noble Lord is seeking. In the belt-and-braces spirit which my noble and learned friend mentioned, I hope that the House will support these amendments.</p>

<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_776"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 776</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>emphasis. We debated this proposition at considerable length throughout your Lordships' consideration of the legislation. We know there are a number of sunset clauses in a number of pieces of legislation, for the most part for specific operational reasons. The Lords has expressed concern over the granting of new extraordinary powers for the Executive, such as in response to the firefighters' dispute eight years ago. In all these sorts of cases, Parliament has sought to ensure that these powers were retained for only as long as was necessary.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="1107141000025"></a>With the Bill there has been a rather different line of argument. There are those who have a general dislike of the Bill, which they are perfectly entitled to have, and there have been arguments put forward in favour of a sunset clause because, it is claimed, this legislation seeks to bind future Parliaments. I repeat what was observed in another place-I perhaps have not comprehended the value of any counterarguments to it-that all legislation by a Government can bind future Governments, and maybe the Government of the day wish it would. All legislation is reversible. The need for additional provisions in the Bill seems weak.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="1107141000026"></a>Instead of repeating my arguments, I will simply quote from the European Scrutiny Committee, which put the matter very clearly:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="1107141000161"></a>"All Parliaments legislate for the future. Laws passed by one Parliament do not contain a sunset clause at the Dissolution. The real point is whether a government can, in law, make it difficult for a future Parliament to amend or repeal the legislation it has passed; in our view it cannot. Our conclusion therefore is straightforward-that an Act of Parliament applies until it is repealed".</p>

<p><a name="1107141000152"></a>Again and again there has been the proposition that somehow this type of legislation weakens Parliament, but Parliament remains central to the whole pattern of agreeing by Act of Parliament whether there should be referenda. The argument for the sunset clause is that each Parliament should be given the chance to decide whether its sovereignty has been curtailed by the Bill. We do not accept that case. As the Minister for Europe said in another place:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="1107141000162"></a>"The Bill does not substitute the British people for Parliament, for Parliament will continue to have a central and strengthened role". -[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 11/7/11; col. 74.]</p>

<p><a name="1107141000153"></a>Parliament would have the opportunity on each occasion to approve a transfer of competence or power and to approve the holding of a referendum. In contrast this provision would actually reduce the control that Parliament would have on treaty changes and passerelles until the Government of the day decided whether to revive Part 1 of and Schedule 1 to the Bill. It would actually have the counter-effect of that, which I believe is the intention of those who put it forward. In any case, we have a system that is designed precisely to review how all Acts of Parliament are used once they are enacted. The previous Government introduced a system of post-legislative scrutiny. Well done them, because under that the Government of the day are required to publish a memorandum to Parliament on the operation of each Act of Parliament up to five years after the commencement of the Act. This is considered by relevant parliamentary committees, which can decide whether to conduct a detailed examination of that legislation. I ask again: what is the point of this additional proposed provision?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="1107141000027"></a>I am happy to repeat the commitment of my friend the Minister for Europe and say that this Government agree that this system is a useful tool that should be exploited and that a future Government must publish a full report on how the Bill has been used within five years of this legislation becoming law. This will result in the clarity and the reflection that colleagues in the other place rightly seek, but without arbitrarily depriving the British people of their say at the end of this Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="1107141000028"></a>This has now been considered by the other place, which has disagreed with your Lordships' amendment by a very substantial majority of 89 votes. Therefore, it falls to your Lordships' House to consider whether to insist on the amendment or accept the clear and considered view of the other place; and whether to accept, in the light of what I have said, that this is a necessary amendment or challenge to the Government's Motion that needs go forward. I personally doubt that it need go forward and I urge your Lordships to let the Motion stand.</p>

Amendment 15B replaces Amendment 15 with more limited powers. In the first place Amendment 15B applies only to Clause 6 and Schedule 1 and not to the rest of Part 1. Secondly, the original Amendment 15 cancels the operation of Part 1 and Schedule 1 at the end of the duration of the present Parliament and leaves incoming Governments to revive those provisions of the Bill. Amendment 15B leaves Clause 6 and Schedule 1 in force unless and until a new Government wish to suspend them, and suspension cannot go beyond the duration of the Parliament which suspended them.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="1107141000030"></a>Thirdly, the original Amendment 15 is all or nothing. Part 1 and Schedule 1 either are entirely out of action or are entirely in force. Amendment 15B provides for the suspension of any one or more of provisions contained in Clause 6 or Schedule 1. Amendment 15B is therefore much more flexible than Amendment 15, and that is a very important difference. It is surely plain that some of the decisions that may lead to a referendum under the Bill will not be appropriate for such a referendum because of the limited importance for ordinary citizens of that particular decision or because of the uncontroversial nature of that decision.  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_778"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 778</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>In such cases Amendment 15B allows the Government to proceed by order, which requires the support of both Houses but without a referendum.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="1107141000031"></a>We need flexibility. Without it we may waste money because a decision which is not controversial has nevertheless to go through the process of the referendum. Without flexibility we may lose the benefit of useful decisions because a referendum is of little concern to the majority of citizens who have no objection to it and therefore a small minority are able to defeat the Government. Without flexibility the Government may decide not to go ahead with a decision which is useful and non-controversial but not important enough to justify the cost and effort of a referendum.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="1107141000032"></a>Nothing in Amendment 15B would affect the referendum lock in the present Parliament, but future Parliaments should have some control over it. I recognise that the amendment would give the Government and Parliament power in theory to avoid referendums on matters where a referendum would have wide support-especially, for example, in the case of adopting the euro-but there is no likelihood whatever that any Government would refuse a referendum in cases of that kind. In any event, if your Lordships' House accepts the principle of Amendment 15B, I can see no objection to amending it so that it does not apply to those categories where there is likely to be a strong demand for a referendum.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="1107141000033"></a>This Government propose to rely on favourable referendums in specified circumstances. So be it, but we should not enforce the same restriction on future Parliaments-that is for each Parliament to decide. Does the Minister recognise that it is impossible for the Government to prevent a future Government exercising their power without a referendum to bring in legislation? If that is so, it makes the situation somewhat different, but it seems nevertheless desirable for Amendment 15B to be included, because it makes simpler provision for varying the Bill now being enacted.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="1107141000034"></a>It is desirable to take Amendment 15B on board. I hope that the Government will consider doing just that.</p>

It goes to the very heart of the Bill and would neuter it completely if it produced a sort of son of a sunset clause. People outside this Chamber and outside Parliament will simply not understand what the House of Lords is doing if it votes for it. The Bill is intended to give British people a voice and protect them from further laws and further integration produced by Europe. They will not understand if the House of Lords supports this amendment, which goes against the whole tenor of the Bill.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="1107141000036"></a>On the earlier amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, made some great play about the lack of trust in politicians and Parliament in general. Although he would not interpret his remarks that way, I take them to support the use of referendums, precisely because of the lack of trust in Parliament and government in general in this country. The noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, prayed in aid the people of Slovenia, who apparently trust their Parliament and say that they do not want referendums. But that simply is not the case in this  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_779"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 779</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>country. The voters in this country do not have the same faith in their Government and Parliament as the people of Slovenia apparently do. If the amendment is carried, it will drag Parliament even further into the contempt that British people already have for it. It is extremely dangerous, and I hope that it will be voted down by this House.</p>

However, the House of Commons has not accepted our amendments, except in the case of the definition of parliamentary sovereignty-I congratulate the noble Lord who so ably pioneered the provision that we have now just passed. We have just rejected the idea of confining referendums to major issues. Therefore, there is a case for a sunset clause.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="1107141000038"></a>This Bill is an attempt, as the people who introduced it in the House of Commons have made quite clear, to bind successor Governments, and it involves a major extension of referendums. In a sense, it is a major constitutional innovation. Noble Lords who have so ably supported Governments of the past in Europe have said to us that we should take seriously the danger of marginalisation that might arise from the Bill. Therefore, there should be a reassessment mechanism in it. I consider that we have a new, mild and flexible version of that in this amendment, which it would be very useful to Parliament to have. We should go beyond what the Labour Government introduced, which has been mentioned already; that is, a committee report on whether a Bill has been effective. Perhaps that should be part of the process, but we should then go on, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, to have a mild version of a sunset clause.</p>

<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="1107141000039"></a><b><a name="110713-0002.htm_spnew31"></a><a name="1107141001025"></a>Lord Lamont of Lerwick:</b> My Lords, sunset clauses are appropriate in some legislation: for example, when one has emergency legislation and Governments take exceptional powers. Those powers may have an effect on civil liberties for instance. Counterterrorism Bills sometimes have such an effect. However, this is not emergency legislation; it is legislation that seeks a long-term and permanent change in our relationship with Europe.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="1107141000040"></a>There is another reason why a sunset clause would be inappropriate. It is in effect, as proposed, a reversal of primary legislation via a resolution. It is a fast-track procedure for removing legislation. In a way, it is a bit like the Article 48(6) provision in the European Union treaty which this Bill is designed to act as a safeguard against.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="1107141000041"></a>One is either for or against this legislation, and many noble Lords have given reasons, powerfully and eloquently, why they are deeply opposed to it. However, they cannot have it both ways. To suspend the legislation, either in whole or in part, is to fudge the decision. If noble Lords do not agree with the legislation, they cannot hide behind amendments that would allow the referendum requirement to be taken out while maintaining the appearance and the structure of the legislation giving effect to consultation and decision by the people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="1107141000042"></a>As the noble Lord who speaks for UKIP said, this will arouse suspicions among some members of the public that Parliament is taking away the right to be consulted while giving the appearance that that right still remains. I can think of nothing that would be more likely to undermine trust than to maintain the legislation on the statute book but incorporate into it a provision that would take the guts out of it.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="1107141000043"></a>Two versions of the sunset clause have been put forward: Amendments 15 and 15B. Amendment 15, of course, goes very wide, because in effect it allows the disapplication of the whole of Part 1 and of Schedule 1. I do not agree with the clause for the general reasons I have given, but in addition to the general reasons, Amendment 15 has some unintended consequences. It removes not just the referendum lock but the Act of Parliament lock as well, in some instances. Passerelles and parliamentary control under Clauses 7 and 10 are to be removed.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="1107141000044"></a>Many noble Lords who have been against the Bill have said, "Oh, but we approve of the parliamentary control; we approve of the need to have an Act of Parliament if there is a transfer of power", but under this wider version of the sunset clause, that, in many instances, will go. Not only the referendum lock will go, but the parliamentary lock as well. That might be why the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goodhart, has put forward a narrower version of it that concentrates on Clause 6 and Schedule 1. Of course, that is even more pick and choose, because it says that any provision-not the whole of Clause 6 or the whole of Schedule 1, but any provision within Clause 6 or Schedule 1-could be suspended. Again, I put it to the House that this will give the appearance that the referendum lock remains, but it will in effect be removed when the Government decide that it would be convenient to remove it. It also, in some instances, does away with the parliamentary lock where that falls under Clause 6. For example, there would be no requirement for parliamentary approval if there was a decision to join the European public prosecutor, or no parliamentary lock as regards the passerelles under Clause 6.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="1107141000045"></a>The noble Lord pointed out that this was just for the duration of the Parliament; it would have to be renewed in future Parliaments and would be suspended only temporarily, but if you suspend a particular provision temporarily and give away the power under the temporary suspension of that provision, you have given it away permanently. There is not much use in having the power back after you have given away the power that you originally wanted to protect. This is very dangerous. It is far-reaching and would give rise to a very cynical reaction among the public if carried.</p>

He invariably falls back on logic and argument rather than on attempts to raise emotional feelings of one kind or another that are inappropriate, but I want to put to him a rather different point. He said, which was fair enough, that this kind of sunset clause often applies to emergency legislation, in particular to emergency legislation that  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_781"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 781</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>leads, for example, to exceptional powers being taken by a Government that need to be looked at later in a rather less heightened atmosphere in order to decide whether they should remain on the statute book. Many of us will know that emergency legislation passed back in the 1940s still sits on the constitutional pattern of far too many countries that use it to suppress human rights, so one has to be very cautious about that kind of thing.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="1107141000047"></a>There is another very different factor about this legislation. It is highly speculative legislation. It makes assumptions about the kinds of issues that are likely to come up over the next few years. We know enough from what we are reading even today that major issues are likely to come up. These go all the way, as John Major said at the Ditchley Foundation only a few days ago, to the question of how one changes eurozone practices-whether one will look again, for example, at the tendency towards an increased or enhanced stability pact. These issues will have the greatest impact on the UK, even though we are not, of course, a member of the eurozone. In this respect the noble Lord, Lord Radice, was absolutely right to say that we cannot know what might arise. The whole point of the sunset clause as we are presenting it is that it gives the British public, in the broadest sense of the word, an opportunity to see what the impact has been of this speculative legislation, which some say will make it very difficult for our representatives in Brussels to represent our own national interests. That is an untested statement. The other untested statement is how far they will feel heavily dissuaded from expressing British national interests for fear that it might set off a referendum.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="1107141000048"></a>The great beauty of the sunset clause is that it will unquestionably turn the Bill into a general election phenomenon-an issue that will have to be considered at the next general election-which is, in the mind of many of us, exactly what it ought to be. The British public will be able to consider in the round whether it is wise or unhelpful legislation and to do so in what will undoubtedly be a very substantial turnout, and because this will be an issue about whether this legislation will continue, it will come at the right moment and in the right way before the British people so that they can decide.</p>

I believed that to be true then, and I believe it to be true now. While I was not present for the debate in the other place, I did read it today and unfortunately a lot of unkind things were said about this House, which is unusual. A consistent theme throughout the discussion on the amendments was that a number of them were wrecking amendments. That is how this amendment was seen by a number of Members in the other place. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said that only a small number were there, and that was undoubtedly true, but to some extent that makes the point, because if Members in the other place were actively supportive of the decisions of your Lordships' House some weeks ago, why did they vote with their feet and not turn up to debate some of these amendments? They obviously did not see merit in them. That is the only reason I can think of why they would abstain in such a way.</p>

The noble and learned Lord is right to say that this particular amendment was not before the other place, but at the end of the day the purpose is the same. The noble Lord, Lord Radice, described is as a "soft sunset". Well, whether you have a hard sunset or a soft sunset, it is still a sunset, and at the end of the day I just wonder, in view of our discussions in this House about our own future, whether it is wise for Members of this House to send anything back to the other place that contains the word "sunset". It is probably not the best thing for us to do. There is no constitutional imperative to send this back to the other place. If we believed that there was, it would be the duty of this House to do so. I just do not see that in front of us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="1107141000052"></a>On the continuous use of the word "flexibility", we all like flexibility in government, but it is a euphemism for something else. It means that Ministers can go on to take decisions, and it is precisely that flexibility that has existed for the past 35 years that leads to the Bill being in front of your Lordships' House tonight. It is unfortunate that we have to go through these procedures, but I see no alternative but to go ahead with the Bill, and I believe that the amendment as currently drafted, or in its original form, casts a dagger at the very heart of what the Bill stands for. I hope that noble Lords will reject this proposal.</p>

The Minister for Europe was questioned by one of the not terribly friendly members of his own party who would rather see us outside the European Union. He was asked whether it would be possible for this Parliament or a future Parliament to insert a referendum requirement in the primary legislation that approved the matters in this Bill that are not subject to a referendum but are subject merely to primary legislation. He replied, "Yes, absolutely. No problem. If that is what Parliament decides, you can add another referendum-just like  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_783"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 783</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that-in the primary legislation". That startled me and led me to think that the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, when he talked about it having both ways, might not have heard of that development in constitutional practice.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="1107141000056"></a>When the Minister replies to the debate, can he say whether the converse is also true? In the primary legislation that would have to be introduced in the House of Commons on the back of a decision by the government in Brussels to go ahead with one of these matters, could Parliament simply waive in that legislation the requirement that is in this legislation? It will be interesting to hear what he has to say about that. I do not see that the proposition that the Minister for Europe agreed to-that a referendum requirement could be added where one was not required under this legislation-could be valid if the contrary proposition, which I have also put, was not valid. Perhaps the Minister will reply to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="1107141000057"></a>Frankly, with some of the arguments that have been introduced about how flexibility is a dirty word, my heart fails me when I think of people strapping themselves to masts, waiting for the ship to go down and saying, "Thank God I am tied to the mast and I cannot swim". It is not a very good argument. The circumstances in which flexibility could be exercised are extremely limited and will be difficult to invoke; this amendment simply suggests a way of doing it. We would be very wise if we were to once again ask the Commons to think again about this matter. This is not a wrecking amendment and, for the reasons I have given, I do not think it takes the matter much further than it is already, with the possibility of the House of Commons varying the provisions at the moment that it enacts the primary legislation. I hope that some further thought will be given to this and that we will not all turn ourselves to the belief that this is a wrecking amendment, which it is not intended to be.</p>

The reasons for doing so are quite straightforward. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, commented on flexibility and how important it is that in going forward in unpredictable circumstances we should have flexibility. While I agree with him there, I am not clear that Amendment 15B provides that flexibility because, in order to have a suspension of Section 6 or Schedule 1, it would require us to have the approval of both Houses. Does the noble Lord believe that the approval of both Houses could be arrived at in a manner which did not revisit all of the contentious issues in Section 6 or Schedule 1? If they could have been debated without extensive deliberation or scrutiny-call it what you will-we would not have spent as much time as we have on the Bill.

I did not intervene in the debates on the earlier amendments but this debate has been about trust in the people and the constitution, and much has been made about the move to plebiscitary democracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="1107141000060"></a>The theme of the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, throughout the course of the Bill has been his anxiety for the Liberal Democrats and whether they feel awkward and embarrassed by it. The presumption underlying those comments-and the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, has been a member of my party, the Liberal Democrats -is that we are reluctantly going along with these measures and that there is no philosophical underpinning whatever. During the passage of the Bill we have had commentary about Burke and parliamentary democracy, and about an hour ago the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, referred to Tom Paine. The philosophical underpinning for why the people should be trusted comes from no less a person than John Stuart Mill. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="1107141000164"></a>"A state which dwarfs its men, in order that they may be more docile instruments in its hands, even for beneficial purposes, will find that with small men no great thing can really be accomplished".</p>

<p><a name="1107141000154"></a>That is why we have supported the Bill and why we trust the people; they are ultimately sovereign.</p>

I fear that the provisions of the Bill will ultimately prevent us from being so. I am sorry that some Liberal Democrats appear to think that this was not a matter of high principle: it is a matter of high principle to which I have committed my political life.</p>

If we wait here for another hour or two, as seems quite likely, we shall find that the sun sets and there is nothing we can do about it. That was the effect of Amendment 15-the sun was going to set when there was a general election and there was nothing we could do about it. Amendment D1 is quite different. It is not a sunset at all: if it is, it is a voluntary sunset-something I have never heard of before.</p>

That seems to be eminently sensible. It leaves the discretion after the election entirely in the hands of the new Minister, the new Government if there is one, and a new Parliament. It does not force anybody to do anything-it gives them the opportunity to do it. It is a much easier way of doing it than having to go through the process of repeal or partial repeal. It seems to me to be eminently sensible and flexible and I hope the House will give effect to Amendment D1 this evening.</p>

However, the provisions proposed in this amendment are reviewable by a Government and are by no means gestures alone. They are bound to have a significant effect on the ability of our Ministers negotiating in the Council to decide issues of massive importance to the people. We have been told that none of those issues will be considered by the people in the lifetime of this Parliament so the Government appear to be putting on ice any questions about improving the efficacy of the working of the European Union until the end of this Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="1107141000066"></a>My noble friend who opened this debate said that a subsequent Parliament could amend this Bill or throw it out. He is right, but he also said in an earlier debate that the Government have no intention of using this Bill in this Parliament. If that is the case, why are we having to legislate at all? It seems to me that the appropriate time to do that would be in the next Parliament if that is when these measures are supposed to bite. The notion that we are legislating for the future in this way is bound to have almost no effect on public opinion beyond putting up scaremongering notices about the possibility that after the next election we will all collapse in a heap and be walked over by our fellow members of the European Union. That is guaranteed to make the issue of Europe a very divisive one at the next election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="1107141000067"></a>The amendment of my noble friend Lord Goodhart seems to be eminently sensible. It has not been rejected by another place. It is new and it is not merely differently phrased but differently conceived. I supported the sunset amendment as it was drafted but I am happy to support my noble friend's revision. It would allow Ministers to decide, in the light of the circumstances at the time, whether the issue before Europe and before this country was of such massive importance that it would be inappropriate to prepare a referendum. My experience of dealing with European matters in Parliament suggests that debates are long and thorough about European issues. The public are made completely aware, by debate and deliberation, what the issues are. Surely some of those who are supporting this Bill must remember the debates on the Maastricht treaty-the hours after hours in which Members of Parliament considered these matters. To suggest that the public were not aware of it is simply to deny the facts of history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="1107141000068"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, suggested that this was a wrecking amendment. It is not-it is an amendment that enables the Government of the day to decide whether the national interest is better served by legislative process-by debate, as we had over Maastricht-than by having a prolonged debate in public leading to a referendum.</p>

The notion that by not having referenda we are somehow denying the fundament of our parliamentary democracy seems to be a complete and utter nonsense. It is not only the Maastricht treaty that was carried through by Parliament in that way. Mrs Thatcher, when she was Prime Minister, also introduced the Single European Act which introduced majority voting and there was no question of a referendum about that. If you look at the opinion polls of those years, and indeed of the years around Maastricht, the public were far more supportive of our membership of the European Union than they are now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="1107141000071"></a>I heard the remark of the Minister for Europe, Mr Lidington, that it is only people of my generation who are supportive of the European Union. When we were active young Members, supporting the European Union, the public listened and believed what we were saying-that it was in the interests of the people of Britain. Now we have a new generation, a whole generation younger than me, who claim that it is our fault that the public are not with them. The nonsense of that is that they have never seriously tried to explain what the purposes of the European Union are; what its achievements are and what its goals are. That is why we are wasting our time with this ridiculous piece of legislation, which is a waste of parliamentary time in scrutiny and is deceiving the public. We have been told it will not be voted on. There will be no referendum on this side of the next election and after that the picture will all change.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Empey, made the point that the other place may have been indifferent because relatively few Members were there. I ask him not to make that judgment in general about things that happen at the other end. When most debates are conducted, you see the camera sweep around without many people being there. It is entirely possible that you could regard this as indifference to almost everything, or you could say that it is the nature of the life of this place. I certainly do not think that the House could accept what he commended to us-that we should send no messages that are in any sense disagreeable to people in the other place. Such a supine response from this House to matters on which we feel amendments are needed would surely be exactly the opposite of the role that this House should play, and ample argument for its having no role at all.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="1107141000085"></a>What is fundamental at this stage is that this legislation takes us, in several constitutional areas, into waters that are-I candidly submit to the House-unknown. We are being invited to change from a system that is fundamentally parliamentary in the main thrust of its work to a system that is plebiscitary. It will on one reading lead to a significant number of plebiscites-that is entirely possible-or on another to very few, as the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, suggested. That is also entirely possible; I do not know which it will be. What I do know is that it will be fundamentally different from the way in which we have conducted parliamentary debate on key issues over many generations.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="1107141000086"></a>There is a fundamental constitutional change in that Parliament will offer the public votes-either frequently or infrequently, depending on which reading one takes-on whether to overturn the decisions that it has taken as a result of major debates and major opportunities to review changes in Europe in both Houses. Inevitably, there will be a fundamental change in how we conduct our relationship with Europe as a whole. That is what is intended. Some people advocate that, while others of us believe that this is a disproportionate way of trying to do that. None the less, these are all fundamental changes.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="1107141000087"></a>I suggest to the House that, in sailing into these waters, the reality is that we do not know how it will play out. Least of all do we know in what circumstances it will play out. We do not know which things will provide the most significant changes, although we  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_788"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 788</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have reason to believe that the present difficulties in European nation state economies give us ample evidence that they will be the tapestry against which all of this will play out. We do not know how the constitutional matters will play out. I doubt anybody here has the temerity to suggest that they know in which circumstances all these matters will play out either.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="1107141000088"></a>I entirely understand the argument that there are some things, even against the background that I have described, that are so important to the people of the United Kingdom that they will insist on having a say on them. It is also true that the Government of the day will be bound, in those circumstances, to try to make judgments of their own about what the interests of the country are at any time. There is no point to a parliamentary democracy where the Government of the day say, on some quite critical issues, "We will not be finally responsible for taking judgments about what the interests of our country are". That would be a peculiar country to live in and one in which the notion of fundamental democracy had been considerably eroded. Variations by subsequent Governments in subsequent Parliaments, of the kind that are suggested in this amendment, seem just to be prudent as a means of allowing the possibility of dealing with circumstances as they arise in a way that is more flexible-I am not afraid of that word-in all of those circumstances.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="1107141000089"></a>I am wholly in agreement with the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, when she says that a significant number of these issues will be judged in general elections. When people look at the questions that must be resolved, they will look at them in general elections. For those who say "Trust in the people", my trust is at its highest point when they decide which Government they want in a general election. That is a fundamental form of trust. I accept that there will be circumstances in which a referendum would be absolutely right. I hope I have been clear from this side of the House that these include such matters as defence policy, Schengen and the euro. There is a raft of policies where I can see that that would be entirely true. However, I do not believe that, in comparison with a general election and the decisions that are taken, the people of the country-in whom, inevitably, trust must be placed in all such circumstances-believe it is somehow better to replicate "The X Factor" than to deal with real politics in real circumstances. "The X Factor" may be fine as a form of entertainment, but it is hardly a way of dealing with the national interest when it must be dealt with under stress or duress.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="1107141000090"></a>I also agreed with the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, when she responded to the noble Lord, Lord Lamont. This is an important point; I hope the House will not mind my repeating it. The noble Lord, Lord Lamont, is right when he says that the case for clauses that limit the life of legislation is far clearer in dealing with emergency legislation. You do not know whether you will need it in the future, and you are not 100 per sure that it will meet the intentions for which it was introduced. However, there is also a completely reasonable case for saying that, when we are taking such significant steps into the dark in constitutional terms, there needs to be a way to say, "How do we make sure that we've got the balance right in the interests of the country? How can we make sure that we are taking the right decisions

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="1107141000091"></a>I cannot stand at this Dispatch Box and claim that I know with certainty where those new balances will lie. It is precisely my point that none of us knows where they will lie. However, this generation of politicians or the next will have to make those judgments. They will come around and they will have to be made. Politicians should be in a position to make them with the greatest confidence and authority that they can. It is critical to our country that they are successful in doing so.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="1107141000092"></a>I hope we will accept Amendment 15B. It is a much more limited suggestion than Amendment 15. It seems, in every respect, to grant flexibility without overriding the key provisions of the Bill in any significant way. It commends itself strongly to me on that basis. Most of all, it commends itself on the basis that, if it is true that the cause for dissatisfaction is the belief that Parliament has let too many of its roles and responsibilities go toward Europe and for those reasons fundamental constitutional change is needed-because that is the argument for this kind of fundamental constitutional change-let us be certain as time goes by that we have got it right, that the balances are right and that whatever the causes were we have not backed ourselves into a cul-de-sac or something worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="1107141000101"></a>In answer to the insistent question of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, my reading of this amendment, which I am sure is that of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is that it is intended to be a permissive power and not an obligatory power for the Secretary of State, which is why it says "may" and not "shall".</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="1107141000102"></a>In its favour, the amendment rejects the passive approach proposed by Amendment 15; that is to say, the amendment in lieu requires the Government to take a positive decision to seek to suspend some of the provisions of the Bill. It is permissive in that respect. A Government taking such a decision would undoubtedly be mindful of the possible reaction of the British people to such a move. It would therefore be open to a greater degree of transparency in terms of the motivation of the Government of the day that the original sunset clause would not, to the same degree. As the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, noted, it allows for the suspension of the requirement for an Act of Parliament before any of the decisions in Clause 6 are taken, depending on the terms in the order. So it risks diluting the increased engagement for Parliament, which is an important part of this Bill. The level to which Parliament and the people would be involved in these important decisions would then be in the hands of Ministers, a principle that runs against the spirit of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="1107141000103"></a>A number of noble Lords suggested that the Bill was intended only to apply to future Governments. I remind noble Lords that in the next Session of this House, we will consider legislation under the terms of this Bill on Croatian accession and the European stability mechanism, and that the conditions of the Bill will apply to those.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="1107141000104"></a>Let me offer some reassurance to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and his supporters on the context in which the Bill will operate once translated into law under future Governments and Parliaments. I remind your Lordships of the principles of parliamentary sovereignty-that no Parliament can bind its successors. If for any reason a future Parliament wished to suspend, disapply or repeal any of the provisions of this Bill, it could do so, unconstrained by the wishes of this Parliament. Most likely, it would decide to do so at a time when it was considering an Act of Parliament required under the terms of this Bill. At such a time, the particulars of that draft decision would be clear and so might the question of whether to disapply this Bill, or not. If I may say so, that is a Clause 18 statement, which is declaratory and in no sense changes the basis of how we operate. No future Government would venture to do so unless they had made real progress in regaining the trust of the British public in the processes of European co-operation that have been so seriously weakened in the past 15 to 20 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="1107141000105"></a>I set out earlier the Government's support for the previous Government's new system of post-legislative scrutiny, which would allow a detailed, proper and timely examination of this legislation after five years. I repeat again the commitment of my friend, the Minister for Europe in the other place, that this Government are committed under the now accepted procedures of post-legislative scrutiny to the principle that a future Government must publish a full report on how this Bill has been used within five years of this legislation becoming law. I hope that that offers reassurances to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and his supporters. We believe that this is the most effective approach, rather than installing an instrument that would not re-engage the people of this country and would remove the transparency and certainty that this Government have adopted from the start as watchwords for the Bill.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="1107141000106"></a>Having given those assurances, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="1107141000107"></a><b><a name="110713-0002.htm_spnew64"></a><a name="1107141001058"></a>Lord Goodhart:</b> My Lords, let me start by making a small and not very serious comment. From time to time my noble friend Lord Lamont and others have referred to me as being learned. Unfortunately, I am not. If I was in the House of Commons, I would be, but in your Lordships' House I am not.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="1107141000108"></a>On more serious matters, I start by thanking my noble friends Lord Howell and Lord Wallace of Saltaire for their balanced and serious response to the debates that have taken place on this matter. So far as an incoming Government are concerned after the next general election, they will, whether or not Amendment 15B is present, have the power to repeal all or part of the EU Act, as it will then be, without a referendum. If Amendment 15B is adopted, the incoming Government can use that amendment as an alternative to repeal and replacement of the complete Act. Members of Parliament will be involved either way, either in supporting a new Bill or in approving the making of the order that will need to be passed under this Bill. This is not a big step.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="1107141000109"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, made a very good point on this and explained very clearly the distinction. Amendment 15B just gives a simple way of dealing with an action that could be done without it. I see no reason why Amendment 15B should not be included in the Bill. While I seriously considered the question of whether we would pass this amendment without going to a vote, I think this falls short of that. It is therefore my intention to ask for the decision of your Lordships' House.</p>

During that debate, I was persuaded by Members of this House that your Lordships could not only carry out their functions in this House but hold down a very demanding full-time job as PCC as well.

The Opposition have been very co-operative on this Bill. We agreed to do Committee in six days and Report in four days. We did not agree that the clock should start at 8.35 of the evening. On average, we have taken about half an hour per group. At that rate, we would be meeting for another nine hours. I regard that as wholly unacceptable, as I am sure that other noble Lords will do. I suggest to the noble Baroness that a discussion should take place in the usual channels on an appropriate way forward. It is not acceptable to say to the House that, at this time of the night, we should start a full day's debate on Report.</p>

We have just spent several hours on what many people in this House considered to be a completely useless and totally unnecessary Bill. We are now faced with a Bill in which, from my point of view, the most important issue that we are yet to discuss-universal jurisdiction-is right at the end. That will probably come at something like 2 am or 3 am. That is an insult to all the people who have died by the actions of international war criminals and I am absolutely furious that the House has organised the business in this way.</p>

This House has a justified reputation for considering legislation with great care and revising it on the basis of knowledge and a solid evidence base.

I am trying to assist the House by pointing out that the Government have tried to schedule business for the benefit of the Opposition and for the whole House. Clearly, we are always prepared to have discussions. We have done little else over the past week. Those discussions can continue but it is a matter of this House that they do not continue on the Floor. Of course, the Motion may be now put that we do resume Report stage. I invite noble Lords to agree to that, pending that there can then be discussions elsewhere. I understand, by the look of it, that the noble Lord the Opposition Chief Whip will be happy to reply to that.</p>

I am more than happy to have some discussion off the Floor of the Chamber because it is pushing it to start a day as late as this. The noble Baroness is quite right to remind the House that we certainly signed up to try and complete Report in four days. I do not think that anybody expected the European considerations to go on for as long as they did. We tried to play our part in keeping them as short as we possibly could, but it is unreasonable to expect the House to debate serious issues such as universal jurisdiction, or issues that are a passionate concern for some, such as licensing, and the rest. As it happens, we have tabled only four or five groups of amendments for this stage of the Bill. We have tried to keep our opposition to the Bill within reasonable bounds and have done so. We have kept to our side of the bargain but, particularly on a Wednesday-and with a Thursday sitting starting at 11 am and a Friday sitting at 10 am-it is not right to keep the House beyond reasonable hours.</p>

Whatever our views on this Bill, one thing is clear: the police and crime commissioners will have considerable power and authority over policing matters in their local police force area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="1107141000128"></a>A second point is that, with the numbers so elected, inevitably there may be circumstances in which a police and crime commissioner may become incapacitated: they may be suspended, they may decide to leave office voluntarily, or they may die in office. Quite rightly, the Bill contains provisions for the appointment of an acting commissioner. That is well and good. However, the problem with Clause 63(2) is that an acting commissioner, appointed by the police and crime panel, can only be appointed if they are a member of the police and crime commissioner's staff at the time of the appointment. The acting commissioner can exercise all the functions of a police and crime commissioner, other than issuing or varying a police and crime plan under Section 6, so the acting police and crime commissioner can dismiss the chief constable. They can set the precept and, as my noble friend Lord Beecham has reminded us, that can be around 9 to 11 per cent, depending on whether you are in England or Wales, of the total council tax bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="1107141000129"></a>I find it quite extraordinary that a staff member-perhaps the chief executive, the director of finance, or the chief of staff-can be appointed to exercise the powers of an elected police and crime commissioner. The reason that this Bill is so constructed is because the Government have decided on this extraordinary concept of a corporate sole. Instead of having sensible governance where it would be clear who might be well placed to be appointed as an acting police and crime commissioner, the Government are flailing around and have come up with this wonderful idea that if the police and crime commissioner in some way cannot carry out their office, a member of their staff should be appointed to do so. That is unacceptable, and I can think of circumstances in which in fact it would be wholly unacceptable. What if the commissioner was suspended because they were charged with an offence which carried a potential imprisonment of more than two years? What if the commissioner were charged with corruption? What if that corruption involved members of their staff? We must remember that there are no corporate governance safeguards over who the police and crime commissioner appoints as a member of their staff: it is wide open for corruption in any case, and corruption will occur. It is inevitable in these arrangements that there will be corruption. We have a situation where an acting police and crime commissioner has to be appointed from among the staff, in the circumstances I have described, of a police and crime commissioner charged with corruption. In those circumstances what possible confidence could the public have in those arrangements and in the acting police and crime commissioner?</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="1107141000130"></a>My amendment seeks to put in place a much more sensible arrangement which allows the police and crime panel to appoint a panel member to serve as the acting police and crime commissioner. That would provide a much greater safeguard in terms of public confidence. We had a good debate on this in Committee. I very much hope that the noble Baroness will be sympathetic to my amendment.</p>

I can think of many sets of circumstances where it would be inappropriate for every single member of the elected commissioner's staff not to be eligible to be the acting commissioner for the very circumstances set out by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. If the elected police and crime commissioner has been suspended or has had to stand down temporarily because of allegations of corruption or other behavioural issues, it would not be in the public interest for a member of what is going to be, in the Minister's own words, a very small number of support staff to stand as the acting commissioner if there were a serious allegation of corruption against the commissioner. The Minister has been reasonable and conciliatory on many of these issues. This is a blindingly obvious case where it would be far more appropriate for a suitable member of the police and crime panel to act in circumstances where the elected police commissioner is no longer eligible to be commissioner for a period.</p>

I say that for two reasons. First, the acting commissioner could be in post for eight to nine months-that is, for up to six months as permitted in the Bill, together with the period during which a replacement is elected. Frankly, to have an unelected acting commissioner for that length of time is unacceptable as they will set the budget and the precept. Although there is a veto on the precept, nevertheless they will be responsible for making the proposal on the precept and they will make a decision about the budget. All those functions should be undertaken by people who have been elected as opposed to people who have not been elected.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="1107141000133"></a>Secondly, the commissioner will have appointed the staff member to their substantial post. The only power that the panel will have is over which staff member is nominated, although they have to bear in mind the advice given to them by the commissioner who is incapacitated. I regard this as an absolutely fundamental issue. The panel must be able to appoint from among its own members. Between now and the next stages of the Bill, I very much hope that my noble friend the Minister will make clear to colleagues in the other place that this matter is of fundamental concern to a large number of Members of your Lordships' House.</p>

It is 11 per cent in England and 15.5 per cent in Wales-even greater than my noble friend indicated. I respectfully suggest that there is potentially an equal underestimate in relation to the period of vacancy. As I read the Bill, the six-month period after which a vacancy would have to be declared and a new election take place, which would add to the length of time in any event, arises in connection with incapacity. However, there are other grounds on which a vacancy might arise. In particular, there is the possibility of a police

That could conceivably take an even longer period to resolve, so there is the potential for this position to be filled by a second-hand appointee, as it were, for a long period. Of course, the whole rationale of the proposal for police commissioners-flawed in the opinion of many, certainly on this side of the House-is that it is necessary to have somebody who is elected and who has a direct mandate for the purposes of exercising the functions that the Bill confers on the holder of the office.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="1107141000135"></a>There will be no such democratic element in the event that the procedure currently in the Bill is enacted. There would be no democratic mandate of any kind-direct or indirect. It is intolerable that that should be the case when within the police and crime panel, there will be people with a mandate-not the complete mandate-that will be claimed for the police and crime commissioner in as much as he or she will be elected for the whole force area. There will at least be some democratic mandate for those elected local councillors who will constitute the majority of members of the police and crime panel. In those circumstances I can see no argument for allowing-indeed requiring-the appointment of somebody who has no mandate when there are those available within the structure who would have at least some mandate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="1107141000139"></a>This is a problem of the Government's own making in that, having decided that police and crime commissioners-and for that matter MOPC in London, although the issues are slightly different-have substantial, individually held powers, the question then comes: what do you do in circumstances when there is a vacancy or someone needs to act while that happens? The Government cannot have it both ways. They cannot say, "Actually, it will be okay and we can have a member of the staff of the police and crime commissioner's office to act in this function", and at the same time say, "The police and crime commissioners are so important and will be so busy that they have to work full time on these functions". What are they working full time on?</p>

Among their duties will be setting the level of local taxation. There is no other area of British public life when something that impacts on taxation is not decided by people who are elected. If the noble Baroness wants to interrupt and tell me of one that I have not thought of, I would be delighted to receive it. There is no such area.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="1107141000141"></a>This is one of the most important decisions and it is one that will matter very much to the public in the area concerned. The task of being an elected politician is to balance what you believe are the important aspirations that you might have for the public service concerned and how much money can readily be raised in taxation. That is an issue that this and previous Governments have struggled with, and those who are actively engaged in local government struggle with it each year. You have to make a judgment and you can make it only if you see both sides of the equation. You see the side of expenditure and you see the side of what it will mean in taxation. Only somebody who is elected will have that perspective of what the public want in terms of services delivered and what they are prepared to buy through taxation. The public are not always single-minded on these matters. We are all aware of those stresses and strains, which is all the more reason why it must be an elected politician who makes that judgment. Only an elected politician with the authority of being elected can strike that balance knowing what the electorate of the area feel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="1107141000142"></a>The difficulty with this is that an official will see this only from the point of view of the need to spend. Through this practice, the Government are creating a ratchet effect that will push up public spending. Officials will see this as entirely about the need to spend, about how many police officers and services they should have and about how much information technology should be purchased. Those will be the sorts of issues that they will see, because they will not be individually accountable to the public for the level of local taxation. That is why this is such a dangerous precedent. By saying that people who do not have elected authority will make those judgments, the Government are creating an effect by which only one side of the equation will be seen by those who make the judgment. That is why the principle of having an elected person carrying out this role is so important. Their idea is that a chief executive or a chief finance officer-before one even considers whether it might be a chief of staff of a police and crime commissioner-will make those judgements. Those individuals by their nature will probably never face an electorate, will never stand as a candidate and will never have to balance the need to spend against the need to tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="1107141000143"></a>I turn to the other powers of the police and crime commissioner. I am not talking about day-to-day matters, where the understanding of how an electorate feel about an issue would be so valuable, but about the extreme, major powers that one hopes will not be exercised very often-for example, the power to dismiss or appoint a chief constable. Again, one would expect the person concerned to be accountable in quite a different way. It will be at the moments of highest  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_802"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 802</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>drama-for example, when you are in the business of dismissing a chief constable-when it will be most important for the decision to be made by somebody who is seen to be personally answerable to the electorate. Personal answerability to the electorate is the cornerstone of what the Bill is supposed to be about: putting in place people who are personally accountable to the entire electorate of a policing area and giving them the responsibility. That is what is missing.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="1107141000144"></a>I will try to predict the Minister's arguments so that I will not have the temerity to interrupt her later when she is in her new, forceful mode. No doubt she will argue that to have a member of the police and crime panel suddenly taking on this responsibility will blur the distinction between the police and crime commissioner and the police and crime panel. That may blur a distinction, but is that a more important concern than the concern of blurring the line between elected accountability and someone who is appointed to carry out the functions of raising and setting local taxation? I have to say that it is not a significant argument.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="1107141000145"></a>The matter could be addressed in other ways. The Government could have come forward with proposals that would have enabled a deputy to the directly elected police and crime commissioner to be elected to fulfil those functions. They chose not to do it. They could have created a clear, corporate structure around the directly elected individual that could have taken on this responsibility-but they chose not to do it. Therefore, the problem is of their making. They must not tell the House that it is not an important problem, because it is vital. I wait to see what will be the reaction in local communities the first time an acting police and crime commissioner-an appointed official-sets the precept and the level of local taxation, because there should be no taxation without representation.</p>

In the circumstances of my noble friend Lord Hunt's amendment, the point about it is that, rather than have some official who has never had to face an electorate making those judgments and decisions, it would at least be someone with a personal electoral mandate, albeit not for the whole force area, but for a part of it, who would be reflecting the public concern about such matters and taking the appropriate action in those circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="1107148000004"></a>Again, I think the Government's arguments are flawed and they really need to address what is actually a very serious problem, which would manifest itself most seriously in circumstances where something is seriously going wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="1107148000006"></a>On the previous intervention, the issue of offers of payment by the media to certain police officers is very much on our minds at the moment. In my view, this issue is not-and never has been-a really central and massive problem, but it has always been there. When I introduced my Freedom and Responsibility of the Press Bill 20-odd years ago, we looked at it then but it has never been dealt with so I would say it should be considered, particularly in the structure that Government are setting up. There will be a temptation for certain police officers to be paid by journalists. Usually, the journalist makes the approach, in my experience, when any offer is made. Journalists will talk about what they do on a confidential basis-"Do not quote me" and so on-but such things are said. Usually, the sums of money are not huge-perhaps £20 for a bit of information and a bit more for another piece of information.</p>

<a name="110713-0002.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="1107148000007"></a>We all have two or three concerns about this Bill, but on this particular aspect there is a danger of what you do if there is an issue of corruption, however small it is overall, and how it is dealt with. I hope that the Minister will deal with that point, which my noble friend made very adequately from the Front Bench, but has just been added to by my noble friend Lord Harris of Haringey.</p>

Between discussing this in Committee and on Report, the Minister has laid an amendment about deputies, so I think we have covered this.

If that was in fact the case and it was a politically restricted post, it would seem to me to be completely wrong for that person who is politically restricted to be able to act up. Am I correct in my understanding of that? When that deputy post was created, I had rather assumed that one of the reasons for it was that the deputy could act up, but having looked at it, I do not see how that could work. I would be most grateful if the noble Baroness would perhaps say something about that as well in her reply.</p>

The complaint is made to the chief officer of police, who has to record the complaint, which is automatically notified to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The IPCC can take over the inquiry or supervise it, and discipline remains a matter for the chief officer. If, in the doomsday scenario, the chief officer does not deal with the complaint properly, then it is for the police authority or, in this instance, the police and crime commissioner, to step in.

I shall explain to the House why I do not feel able to accept this proposal. I understand what is trying to be achieved, but plucking the acting PCC from an inherently political body is not the right solution to this issue. Some may say that I am overplaying the need for political neutrality in these situations, but I point to the debates in the other place and in this House regarding the potential risks of politicisation. If, as was put forward, politicisation is such a key risk, then I would argue that establishing an acting commissioner from within a very political pool of people with a different mandate is the worst of all worlds and likely to lead to conflict. The PCC's staff are politically neutral and, in the absence of any other person with a political mandate spanning the force area, we envisage that the PCC's chief executive would be best placed to continue to secure the maintenance of an effective police force with the close support and involvement of the police and crime panel for the interim period.</p>

But it involves the precept, the budget, the appointment of the chief constable and the dismissal of the chief constable. I am still concerned that the problem here is the construct of the Bill.

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="1107148000022"></a>It seems to me that this is a very important issue, which has been debated in the other place as well. The Government clearly still do not have a clue about how to deal with it. The noble Baroness said that she is concerned about appointing the acting PCC from the police and crime panel, which is an inherently political body. But what is the PCC but politicisation? In terms of the idea that the staff will be wonderfully neutral, what on earth will the staff be doing? I am horrified at the thought that the PCC will employ an army of people. It will have one point, which will be to ensure the re-election of the police and crime commissioner. What else are they there for but to support that person?</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="1107148000028"></a>Amendment 235 is a response to the widespread fears of your Lordships expressed in earlier debates. It is also a response to the concerns of policing professionals, charities and businesses that an elected commissioner might, for obvious reasons, want to focus on a local mandate, and the fact that a lot of important, strategic national issues are somewhat hidden from public view. There is concern that all this might lead to cross-border national or strategic policing issues being relatively neglected under the Government's proposed new model.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="1107148000029"></a>I dare say that we are as one in recognising and wishing to respond in the most effective manner possible to the ever present and, indeed, growing threats to many of the so-called protective services or national and strategic threats, which cross police force borders or require specialist attention. The sort of crimes I refer to are such things as cyber crime, threats from terrorism, extremism, serious and organised crime, people trafficking and the more sporadic-potentially devastating-impact of civil contingencies. There is a whole number of national incidents.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="1107148000030"></a>I do not wish to raise an apocalyptic spectre of crimes and emergencies, but it is exactly because these important issues are not the currency of local, political, policing debate that I am concerned that it might not be at the forefront of a commissioner's attention. There is a risk that commissioners may-for understandable reasons-not give full weight to national issues. Anybody who has attended local, public policing

One example is born out of recent excellent research undertaken by my home police authority, Lancashire, which revealed that most people's priorities for an elected Lancashire commissioner were going to be tackling quite low-level crime. Anti-social behaviour and environmental issues such as littering and abandoned cars were the sort of issues that people wanted commissioners to address.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="1107148000031"></a>I have experience of consulting local people on their policing priorities. I used to always give people a list of issues on which we wanted to consult them. It would always include anti-terrorism and other matters but the public always said "We do not want anti-terrorist activity to be at the tope of the list because that is a national responsibility". When asked how this should be paid for they said that the Government should pay. They always put national issues at the bottom of the list. As I went round the county, this happened every time.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="1107148000032"></a>Even at a time in Lancashire when the Irish situation was quite difficult-and Heysham was quite an important area for activity which meant that the Lancashire police were engaged in considerable anti-terrorist activity -none the less people in Lancashire did not want their precept to be spent on that kind of activity. That worried me then and it worries me even more now because I think that tendency will be even more emphasised in this new regime.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="1107148000033"></a>What I propose as part of the solution to act as a substantial check and balance on commissioners and force actions is to have an annual report to Parliament by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. I am sure I do not need to remind the House that it has a long and distinguished track record in both identifying and trying to identify the best ways of closing the gap in protective services. It is perfectly placed to provide an annual guarantee that the gap does not widen in the years to come, or, if it does widen, that it can alert Parliament that this is happening.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="1107148000034"></a>My idea of an annual report to Parliament draws on similar recent and successful provisions that have enabled Parliament's concerns about the potential impact of certain Acts to be monitored and to some degree ameliorated. I am thinking here of the distinguished work of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, as the independent reviewer of counterterrorism legislation. That is just one example of a way in which activity could be monitored, so that Parliament could get some sense of how things are working out. I understand that the amendment would impose a new duty on the inspectorate's already, no doubt, hard pressed resources, but the national issues are so important and the consequences of us failing to ensure adequate provision for national strategic policing requirements are so great that an annual assessment would be one way of monitoring the situation and measuring what forces are doing. It would help commissioners in their debate with local people to emphasise how important these national strategic requirements are. It is in that spirit that I beg to move the amendment.</p>

My Amendment 239 approaches the issues which my noble friend Lady Henig raised in Amendment 235 from a slightly different perspective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="1107148000039"></a>Some 35 hours ago, I sat listening to the Home Secretary introduce the new CONTEST strategy for the United Kingdom. That document, which pulls together the efforts being made to counter terrorism, is fundamental to the issues that we are talking about here in relation to the national strategic policing requirement.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="1107148000040"></a>Of course, this document describes the importance of having a national network feeding in to the counterterrorist effort-if we do not have such a national network, we cannot deliver effective counterterrorist policing. That is why it is so important that the Government have put the strategic policing requirement into the Bill. What makes it difficult for us in your Lordships' House to consider these matters tonight is that, of course, no one, as far as I am aware-certainly none of your Lordships-has yet seen the strategic policing requirement, or a draft thereof.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="1107148000041"></a>When I have listened to senior police officers, they say that there are a number of building blocks for anyone to understand how this legislation will work. One of those building blocks is the memorandum that we have seen-the Minister has promised us that she will come back to us on whether that will be part of  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_810"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 810</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Bill. Another key building block is what is going to be contained in the strategic policing requirement. Until we see that, we cannot see what will be the balance of responsibilities for chief officers of police. I hope that we will at least see a draft of the strategic policing requirement before the Bill goes to Third Reading. I had understood that something was due to be published some while back for consultation. As far as I am aware, unless it has appeared very recently, nothing has yet been published.</p>

Will he help the House and contemplate how the strategic policing requirement might fit in to the national security strategy? Would it be part of it or relate to it in any way? It has certainly not been mentioned, as I am sure my noble friend would agree, in our meetings on the national security Joint Committee.</p>

Clearly, the potential danger with police and crime commissioners elected with a local mandate to articulate the concerns of local people is that some national priorities will not be given the same priority at local level. Now, I am sure that no sensible police and crime commissioner would say, "I am not interested in anything being done on counterterrorism", just as no sensible police and crime commissioner would say that they did not want to see anything done on serious crime. However, when there are 41 directly elected individuals, some of whom will fight very fiercely contested local elections, or be facing fiercely contested re-election, the question of whether the same priority is given to national security matters as is given to other matters becomes a real issue.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="1107148000044"></a>Because of our particularly slow progress as a House on other matters before we arrived at the Bill tonight-we are making rapid progress compared to the progress earlier-I had the opportunity of listening to a presentation downstairs from Professor Dave Sloggett, a nationally known expert on counterterrorism issues. In a rather chilling 15-minute tour d'horizon, he simply spelt out the sorts of threats that we face, which are contained in the CONTEST strategy, and the context in which that is taking place at the moment. Yes, Osama bin Laden has been killed, but that does not mean that al-Qaeda goes away. We are actually seeing a fragmentation and each of the different affiliates going their own way, each presenting slightly different threats.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="1107148000045"></a>We have Gaddafi in Libya, who has made an explicit threat of suicide bombers in European cities; and there is the changing situation in Northern Ireland, where we have just seen two nights of sustained rioting and serious disorder. Again, the fact that that has not impinged significantly on the rest of the country makes it all the more likely that there will be an aspiration for it do so. We have the challenges of the Olympics. In moving her amendment, my noble friend Lady Henig referred to issues around cyber crime, and it is interesting  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_811"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 811</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the CONTEST strategy for the first time refers to the cyber terrorist threat. These are issues in which local police forces have got to play their part; they have got to raise their game. They are not necessarily issues which will immediately emerge as the priority for the elected police and crime commissioner in every part of the country, yet every part of the country is potentially affected.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="1107148000046"></a>Let us consider the way in which Roshonara Choudhry self-radicalised herself, dropped out of her university course and, having listened to speeches and read material on the internet, decided that an appropriate thing for her to do to take forward the cause would be to assassinate a British Member of Parliament. She then researched Members of Parliament on TheyWorkForYou.com and purchased two kitchen knives. Fortunately for Stephen Timms, a Member of Parliament in the other place, she decided on the day that it was easier to conceal in her clothing the shorter of the knives. That is an example of the kind of threat we face.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="1107148000047"></a>Not so long ago an individual in the south-west of the country seriously injured himself in an attempt to blow up a restaurant in which families with young children were having meals. Again, he was an individual who, as far as we know, was not significantly connected to any of the networks.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="1107148000048"></a>It will be the responsibility of local policing, local special branches and local intelligence to pick up on these issues. If you get to a stage where this is seen as not the responsibility of a local police force, your ability to combat these threats will be severely weakened. That is why the strategic policing requirement is so important.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="1107148000049"></a>It is also important in the context of serious and organised crime because we all know that if you do not maintain consistent and strong pressure on the issues around serious and organised crime, gradually the quality of community life in all kinds of areas will begin to deteriorate-and yet this will not be an immediate priority for many police and crime commissioners.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="1107148000050"></a>The Government have, properly, written into the Bill a strategic policing requirement. However, they have not specified how it will be enforced and how they will make sure that it is met in every force area. My noble friend Lady Henig has tabled an amendment which would require Her Majesty's Inspectorate to produce a report on an annual basis and lay it before Parliament to assess how the strategic policing requirement is working. My amendment has a different focus; it seeks to consider what happens in each individual force area. It does not specify that the report should be laid before Parliament because sometimes the content of that report in relation to the strength, willingness and effectiveness of local forces in combating terrorism and serious and organised crime would best not be publicly shared.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="1107148000051"></a>I know that the Home Office does not want to be top-down on all kinds of issues, but on these issues it needs to be top-down, which is why it has postulated a strategic policing requirement. This will give the Home Secretary a snapshot for each police force area and a

Whether that will result in a formal intervention by the Home Secretary or a less formal intervention with the chief officer of police and the elected politician who leads those areas applying pressure, I do not think really matters. What is important is that the Home Secretary has that information and has it as a tool. Further, it is important that the locally elected individual-the police and crime commissioner or the MOPC in London-is aware of where they stand in terms of meeting the strategic policing requirement. They may well have a rose-tinted view of what the level of problem is or what needs to be done. This gives them that information and the opportunity to decide. I find it extraordinary that there is nothing in this Bill about monitoring how the strategic policing requirement is to be met, how it is to be achieved and what is to be done about it.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="1107148000052"></a>These amendments are put forward in a genuine attempt not just to assist the Government to achieve their objectives, which as you know are constantly at the forefront of our thoughts on this side of the House, but because it is critically and crucially important for the national security of this country and indeed for our ability to deal with serious and organised crime.</p>

This Bill is to a great extent about the accountability of the police. The whole purpose of the Government's policy, which I applaud, is to make the police more accountable to the public. The noble Baroness, Lady Henig, is attempting to do precisely that-to give visible evidence of that accountability to enable the public to judge from a document how accountable the police are in terms of the strategic policing requirement.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="1107148000054"></a>The noble Baroness referred to the work of the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, which I used to be. The independent reviewer is required to produce at least two reports every year which enable Members of both Houses, who use the reports extensively, and others to judge the performance of the authorities in relation to counterterrorism law. We have an independent reviewer of the relatively new Northern Ireland provisions for what is now public order law in Northern Ireland. This role has been carried out since it was introduced by Mr Robert Whalley. He has been very successful in ensuring that those important parts of the law he reviews in Northern Ireland, which can prove, as we have seen in the past couple of days, very controversial in the context of every day life, are accounted for in the legislative assembly of Northern Ireland and in this Parliament.</p>

Those who carry out such roles from time to time have been asked ad hoc to carry out reports which call to account those who have been involved in aspects of counterterrorism and related policing.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="1107148000056"></a>Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary has a distinguished and respected record of impartiality. It has been able to secure changes in policing practice around the country by the kindly method of report, constructive criticism and engaging, sometimes, the support of those in both Houses of Parliament. It seems to me that there is nothing to be lost and potentially much to be gained from the transparency of a report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, particularly given the importance of the strategic policing requirement, which has been amply described during this short debate, particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Harris.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="1107148000057"></a>I take issue with the noble Lord on only one detail. He suggested that it might be difficult to write a report that would be published that engaged with matters of national security that are best left unsaid. I can tell the noble Lord that there are ways of doing this; it can be done. With the co-operation, which is always available, of the security services in particular, there are ways of writing reports that do not damage national security but deal fully with all the principles that need to be discussed.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="1107148000058"></a>I therefore believe that this is a constructive proposal and I hope to hear that the Minister will also allow this matter further consideration with a view to something being brought forward at Third Reading.</p>

We know that there is a strong likelihood that there will be a national crime agency some time in the next calendar year. We already have a discussion document about that. It refers to tasking, which I am confidently assured means direction from the centre. That means that there is bound to be tension between local and national issues, which is a good thing. It is democracy in action. It is inevitable that the inspectorate will become involved, at the behest of local or national figures. That is what it is there for and that is my experience, having served in it for more than five years, albeit some time ago.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="1107148000060"></a>I am concerned that the Bill is in grave danger of becoming overprescriptive. We are covering detail, which is good as far as it goes. However, to put it in the Bill rather than take it as a matter of good sense or encompass it in regulation stretches too far the issue of what should be in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="1107148000061"></a>I shall refer to Amendment 235A. Having followed an all-encompassing definition of national crime, we are then invited to put in something about children, vulnerable adults, members of minority groups and so on. I do not at all underestimate the threat to those groups; terrible things are done to and with them. However, if we are to pick out those groups, why do we not put in something about drugs, counterterrorism, and the theft of high-value motor vehicles and plant, all of which happen on a European-if not a more

Why do we not put in something about cybercrime or identity theft? I shall sit down soon because I want to brief, but my point is that we should not drop into the trap of being overprescriptive. Valid though all the comments from speakers so far have been, it is asking the Bill to accept too much.</p>

<p><a name="st_260"></a>
<a name="1107148000062"></a><b><a name="110713-0003.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="1107148000455"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, this has been a very interesting debate. I understand what the noble Lord, Lord Dear, is saying about the risks of overprescription. However, we are talking about strategic policing requirements. This is a matter of national importance. My noble friends have argued very well for their respective amendments.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="1107148000063"></a>No election will be won by a police and crime commissioner on issues to do with national policing. They will be won on local manifestos. Almost every candidate will promise more police on the beat. The question will be an auction over just how many police will be on the beat at any one time. That is fair enough and clearly responds to a general view held by many members of the public, who like the police to be visible. I do not argue with that. However, it will have some consequences. It will put the squeeze on the specialist units that the police forces have developed. It will also put the squeeze on each force's responsibility to the national policing requirement. In some way or other, without being wholly prescriptive, we need to find a way in which to reassure Parliament that the national strategic policing requirement will be carried out as effectively as possible. It is not just terrorism; it is also about serious organised crime. My noble friends Lord Harris and Lord Foulkes were absolutely right to develop the argument about the threats that we face. We are in no position today to be complacent about those threats.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="1107148000064"></a>In their approach to the Bill the Government have really rather pooh-poohed the current tripartite relationship. They have criticised police authorities for a lack of visibility-although I have yet to hear any conclusive evidence put forward on why they ought to be visible. Furthermore, they believe that the tripartite arrangement is at fault because Home Secretaries have indulged in too much target-making. There will be a debate about targets and their place but there should be no doubt that in the end the Home Secretary is accountable to Parliament and ought to be accountable to Parliament for national policing strategy and the effectiveness of police forces in making a contribution to that strategy.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="1107148000065"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dear, about the implications of the national crime agency. I also agree with him that some tension will be constructive-but tension could also be destructive. In the Bill we see that the requirement in relation to the strategic policing requirement is placed on chief officers of police. In exercising the functions, they must have regard to the strategic policing requirement. In other words, they can ignore it, because "have regard to" is a very weak use of parliamentary language. They have to have regard to it, alongside other matters that are placed in the Bill.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="1107148000066"></a>We then look to page 2 of the Bill and see that in Clause 1(4) that the,</p>
<ul><a name="1107148000204"></a>"police and crime commissioner must ... hold the chief constable to account for",</ul>

<ul><a name="1107148000205"></a>"the exercise of the duty under section 37A(2) of the Police Act 1996 (duty to have regard to strategic policing requirement)".</ul>
<p><a name="1107148000172"></a>All we have in statute is a requirement on the police and crime commissioner to hold the chief constable to account. Then we find that the actual requirement is simply to have regard to. What if the police and commissioner does not effectively hold the chief constable to account? What if the chief constable has regard to but does not take the necessary action? Where are the safeguards and sanctions? There are none. That is really our concern.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="1107148000067"></a>The amendments seem to be helpful and constructive. My noble friend Lady Henig asks for a report to be prepared assessing the extent to which the strategic policing requirement has been met in each police area. That does not seem overprescriptive; it is simply giving an assurance to Parliament that there will be a process by which Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary has a means of looking at each police force area and reporting on how they are doing in their contribution to the strategic policing requirement.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="1107148000068"></a>My noble friend Lord Harris has another constructive amendment around the inspection programme. In our first debate the Minister was very helpful, although I did not really follow her arguments. She was very constructive in being willing to engage in the area of the acting police and crime commissioner. Nothing is more important than the national strategic policing requirement. I hope that the noble Lord, who, I suspect, is going to respond to the amendment, will be able to be as constructive as his noble friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="1107148000074"></a>As I said, it is part of the intention of this Bill to build in some constructive tensions between the local and the national. We all understand that policing is a constant dialogue between local, regional and national, although I suggest to the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, that things have changed a great deal in the last 20 or 30 years. Certainly when I was a candidate in Manchester many years ago, there was a small Special Branch that dealt with the IRA, but there were not the cross-cutting collaborative units that we now see across the north of England-drugs units, organised crime units and counterterrorism units, which are now part of the network in which our police forces co-operate with each other. My perspective on policing is a West Yorkshire one, but the <I>Yorkshire Post</I>, the Bradford <I>Telegraph &amp; Argus</I> and the local radio stations do not simply focus on local crime, partly because local and national issues, such as parades by the English Defence League and drugs heists in which the drugs have just been imported from some other country, are very much part of the local scene. Therefore I think that the widespread fears suggested by the noble Baroness may be exaggerated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="1107148000075"></a>Clause 80 sets out the strategic policing requirement, which is an update of the Police Act 1996, as noble Lords have said. That strategic policing requirement is now being extensively consulted on by the Secretary of State, ACPO, the Association of Police Authorities, the Metropolitan Police service and others. Clearly that is going to be a major part-</p>

It is there in the Bill. There is a question of how much detail we want to write into the Bill, but Clause 80 sets out the fundamentals of that requirement. Clause 96 adds to that the backstop power for the Secretary of State to intervene if, in her opinion, local police forces are not paying sufficient attention to the strategic policing requirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="1107148000078"></a>I add that "have regard to" is not, as has been suggested, a weak statement. It is a commonly used phrase for a strong and appropriate duty, which places an obligation on the chief officer and the PCC to comply with the strategic policing requirement. In policing terms, the duty to have regard has previously applied, for example, to codes of practice that have been used to implement a national intelligence model across all 43 police forces in England and Wales, to codify the use of police firearms and to ensure compliance with the IPCC statutory guidance on handling police complaints, which suggests that this is a widely used and strong duty.</p>

<ul><a name="1107148000206"></a>"must, from time to time, issue a document".</ul>
<p><a name="1107148000173"></a>What I am trying to clarify is: how can we see what the impact of that strong requirement is unless we know what the Government's intentions are for the document's contents? That is not asking to have the wording of the strategic policing requirement written into the Bill. The Bill already says that there will be such a document, but none of us have seen one. The Minister has talked about consultations but as far as I am aware-I wait to be corrected-last week no full-touch document had been circulated for comments, despite the expectations set out in here.</p>

I stress that it is normal practice to pass legislation without all the details of the regulations being tied up before that Act is passed, because ongoing negotiations about how the regulations will be carried through are often under way. I am assured that negotiations and consultations on the strategic policing requirement are well under way.</p>

I thought it was simply going to be a document. There have been plenty of occasions when the document has been so pivotal that Parliament has been advised of what the content of regulations will be. Draft regulations have been circulated so that people can understand what their scope is. As I understand it, this is regarded as one of the central planks in determining what is local and what is national. I believe that Parliament should therefore see this document in draft form before we can move forward.</p>

On Clause 96, I am also informed that the backstop power available to the Secretary of State to intervene where forces are not having sufficient regard to national priorities has never been used. It is there as a backstop power but police forces, chief constables and police authorities have necessarily recognised that there is a thread between neighbourhood policing and local, regional and national priorities. The neighbourhood police groups which I have been out with in Leeds and Bradford are also

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="1107148000083"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, stressed the importance of criminal activities which, in some cases, do not respect boundaries. She also talked about the invisible crimes of domestic violence, vulnerable adults, child neglect and aggravated crimes against minorities. Again, I have sat in on MAPPA groups-multi-agency areas-where police are working with other local social services and non-governmental organisations, precisely to look at those invisible crimes. Part of the way in which attention is drawn to these crimes is by local voluntary organisations working with police and other agencies at the local level. In the nature of these cases, much domestic violence and child neglect is essentially local. Those elements which are not local-child trafficking, sexual abuse, online sexual exploitation-are dealt with now increasingly by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre and other forms of collaboration between local police forces and national agencies, which indeed will feed into the national crime agency when that is developed. Again, in this case there is not a tension but a thread between local violence, local disorder, local abuse, and those more limited elements in which children are trafficked or abused and the internet is used for these purposes. I can assure the noble Baroness that this does not need to be written again into the Bill. Having said that, I hope that I have given sufficient assurance to those who tabled these amendments to enable them not to press them.</p>

The amendments themselves are about mechanisms. Can my noble friend on the Front Bench help the House as to whether it is necessary to spell out these mechanisms? It seems that noble Lords opposite are seeking mechanisms to assist the Secretary of State-but does the Secretary of State actually need to have the legislative powers? As I read these, I would have thought that it was possible for her to take steps, certainly in one of these amendments, and to have considerable influence to ensure that the inspectorate undertakes the others. To that extent, these amendments are not necessary. However, the noble Lord has addressed the arguments rather than the amendments, and if I may say so, so have the noble Lords pressing the amendments. I hope my noble friend may be able to help the House on that.</p>

The question of whether it should have to publish reports on a regular basis for Parliament is an additional thing of which I am not persuaded. I will certainly consult further but I am not currently persuaded that that is a necessary addition. Many years ago I took part in a debate which required the Government to report to Parliament twice a year on developments in the European Union so that there could be a six-monthly debate. Those reports have continued to be published and somewhere in my attic I have a number of them. I am a little doubtful about additional reports.</p>

I agree that under the present system there is a recognised way of reconciling local and national police authorities; I do not think that is in doubt. The problem is that we are embarking on a completely new structure of police governance. Everything that we are used to is being changed, and not incrementally but quite radically. I think that we all accept that. My amendment seeks to reassure the public, given that we are faced with this completely new and untried system. We owe it to the public to reassure them that under the new system cross-border crime, serious criminal issues and national crime will be tackled by local forces.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="1107148000107"></a>Right at the beginning of our work on the Bill, the Government told us that HMIC unearthed the evidence for the failings of the present system, which necessitated the abolition of police authorities as quickly as possible. Indeed, in the absence of an analysis of the results of the Home Office's public consultation on their reform proposals and the rather limited utility of a Cabinet Office report now five or six years old, the findings of HMIC's inspections of 22 police authorities could be charitably described as the nearest thing the Government have for an evidence base on which they can build the case for change-at least as far as the suggested evidence for the weaknesses of the old system goes.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="1107148000108"></a>When it comes to this clause of the Bill, it very much surprised me-and may well surprise many of your Lordships-that, far from the excellent work of Her Majesty's inspectorate being valued and taken forward into the new era of elected accountability, it has been relegated to the sidelines. In fact, the inspectorate is no longer going to be called upon to inspect the whole range of policing accountability but is going to be focused on forces.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="1107148000109"></a>I find this a little odd. We are told that commissioners and their panels are the necessary drivers of change, the fulcrums on which the hopes of reforms are going to be founded. They are going to have the role in driving efficiency at local level, not the Home Office from the centre any more. Yet these crucial new transformative individuals and bodies are not to be subject to the same level of inspection in the public interest as police authorities. I find this quite strange. Surely it cannot be right to limit the scope of inspectors who could provide valuable, impartial and expert information to the public on complex areas of policing and police finance, including the efficiency of those overseeing that finance. Budgets are going to be tight in the next few years and the new system is going to be very costly. I find it hard to believe in the new system, which many of us think will increase costs. These costs will add up and may very well eat into the policing budget. It is therefore not unreasonable that inspections should be able to oversee how those costs are running and whether things are operating reasonably.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="1107148000110"></a>I know, because we have already had this argument, that the Government will be quick to remind me that the ballot box will be the judge of how commissioners  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_824"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 824</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>oversee and apportion their part of the policing grant and the precept. However, four years is a long time in politics and a lot of money could have been spent before the public place a cross and deliver a verdict. Who in the mean time, except HMIC, will inform the public about how effectively or otherwise commissioners have spent their money? I am reluctant to raise once again the spectre of corporations sole and, still less, the frankly frightening sight of not one but two corporations sole with two auditable bodies and consequentially opaque arrangements for overseeing public spending in policing. The only reason I want to mention them is that I think that because of that situation there will be a need for more, not less, accountability. Inspection of the new regime, when compared to what we have presently, will be more important because of the arrangements that are being set up. I believe that these areas need to be opened up to the public. Expertise should not be excluded. It is essential for public trust and confidence in the police that every penny of the policing pound is considered by those charged with inspecting and fostering improvement. That is why I think that the Government should reinsert full rights of inspection for HMIC and the ability of the local policing body and panel to call in inspectors on a regular basis.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="1107148000111"></a>I shall briefly say something about the idea that the panel should have to pay the cost of the inspections. That is a tremendous disincentive to having inspections. I could not help thinking that if existing police authorities had to pay for inspections they would have definitely seized on that as a reason not to be inspected, particularly when it is those inspections that justify the present abolition of police authorities. Slightly at a tangent, I mention that in those last inspections of police authorities-there have been 22 in the past few months-not one authority failed an Audit Commission or HMIC inspection and more than 97 per cent of HMIC's 110 individual assessment scores for police authorities' performance were excellent, good or adequate, which I think is very reasonable. It is certainly a record of achievement that compares favourably with local government. In fact, police authorities consistently and significantly outperform local authorities in Audit Commission inspections of their use of resources. I do not feel that inspections should have to be paid for in this way by those who are being inspected-hence my Amendment 238 to delete this provision.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="1107148000112"></a>In relation to police authorities' financial management, the inspectorate's report stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="1107148000185"></a>"Over the last ten years, forces and authorities have delivered efficiency improvements to meet Government targets. Between 2004 and 2008, forces and authorities declared just over £1.5 billion of efficiency improvements against a target of just over £1 billion".</p>

<p><a name="1107148000113"></a>I am sure we would want such efficiency improvements to continue into the new regime. Indeed, the public would expect commissioners on £120,000 or more a year to be driving and delivering even greater efficiencies than their predecessor police authorities. I therefore feel that the public would want the inspectorate to give them the relevant comparative information rather than leave it to the media to report, or not, as they see fit. For all these reasons, it seems to me that there should be regular inspections of commissioners and of panels. I see no reason why there should not be. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="1107148000114"></a><b><a name="110713-0003.htm_spnew38"></a><a name="1107148000484"></a>Baroness Harris of Richmond:</b> My Lords, I have put my name to Amendments 236, 237 and 238 which were tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Henig. We are being asked to support nothing less than a revolution in policing governance in the absence of any evidence base on which the benefits of such drastic changes are set and in the absence of any public clamour for costly reform-indeed, the opposite. We are being told that these changes will not be piloted or introduced in stages since reform is urgent and cannot possibly wait. I beg to differ on all those counts.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="1107148000115"></a>However, if we are to press ahead with such an untried system, I am absolutely determined that we should do our duty to ensure that all means possible are employed to insert safeguards into the Bill. HMIC inspections seem to me to be a bedrock of any such safeguards against potential pitfalls and I share the high regard in which Sir Denis O'Connor, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, is held, together with his extremely able team.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="1107148000116"></a>In short, HMIC inspections are at times a difficult and challenging process for those undergoing them and they have repeatedly yielded the improvement across policing, which is at the heart of HMIC's mission. So I am left, frankly, bemused when the Government propose not to expand but to constrict the use of this valuable tool for improvement. It makes no sense at all effectively to exclude these completely new systems of oversight from an inspection regime when that regime has already helped the current system to improve.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="1107148000117"></a>Next, I shall draw out the intention of Amendment 238, which removes the proposed new obligation on the local policing body to reimburse HMIC for the costs of its inspection. We have heard what the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, thinks of that. We have sought to replace this with a statement that the panel may request that HMIC conducts an inspection if its concerns warrant such an intervention. I am unaware of any other inspection regime in which those delivering a public service, or who invite in or are made the subject of an inspection in the interests of public trust and confidence in their work, are expected directly to cover the costs of their inspection. Surely, in some cases an inspection will be called amidst quite serious financial issues or challenges. This idea that those opening themselves up to scrutiny in the public interest must pay for the cost of such transparency seems decidedly odd to me, even bearing in mind the parlous state of Home Office finances at the present time.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="1107148000118"></a>It also seems to me to be the most bizarre disincentive to those on the panel or on the commissioner's staff who are considering whistleblowing on what might be significant issues of public interest or concern. A whistleblower or concerned panel member or local policing body member would have to gain pre-emptive approval for the costs of a possible investigation from someone who might be implicated in the very dubious activity that necessitates the inspection.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="1107148000119"></a>This parcelling of costs on to the petitioner for an inspection feels wrong to me on a very instinctive, but also on a very practical, level. Surely the Home Office should be seeing fit that the costs of HMIC's absolutely essential work should be met by a Home Office grant.  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_826"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 826</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It would seem to be neglect approaching a dereliction of the Government's duty to do otherwise. We have proposed that this apparently ill suited new subsection (2BB) should be replaced by a positive power for the panel that it should be able at any time to request that HMIC carry out an inspection of the PCC.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="1107148000120"></a>No one will be more aware of the PCC's action or inaction in some areas than the police and crime panel since it is designed as her or his safeguard and strict check and balance. However, while the panel will be equipped to oversee the PCC in most areas, it may feel that there are issues on which it lacks a professional operational judgment on a matter of controversy. In such circumstances, it may not be appropriate to pull the chief constable into what could amount to a difference of opinion with the PCC. Who then can the panel turn to for that necessary professional advice and impartial opinion?</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="1107148000121"></a>Finally, there should be a direct and clear ability, and a responsibility on the panel, to be able to involve HMIC appropriately. HMIC could, of course, take a view that it was being asked to get involved in a petty or irrelevant matter and could decline the invitation. However, we anticipate that this referral mechanism to HMIC will provide a helpful bridge to practical improvement for many forces facing difficulty in the future, as it so often has in the past.</p>

I must declare my interest again as chair of an NHS foundation trust and as a consultant trainer in the NHS. NHS foundation trusts, which the Government support, were meant to be given much more freedom than other NHS bodies but they are still subject to the tender mercies of a regulator called Monitor. For the life of me, I cannot see why the Government have taken such a light-rein approach to the construct in the Bill when we have such an excellent inspectorate in the form of HMIC. These amendments seem wholly constructive. By the grace of the usual channels, we have been given a little extra time-a day-to consider these matters. Is this not a matter which the Government might take back and consider?</p>

I feel with a number of the arguments which the noble Baronesses, Lady Henig and Lady Harris, have made that they feel the current system is superb and any different system will be untested, untried, difficult and probably worse.  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_827"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 827</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Therefore, as the noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond, said, we must insert safeguards; I think this would insert belt, braces and string as well.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="1107148000125"></a>The intention behind Clause 85-and the role of HMIC-is that HMIC should be there to inspect the professional forces. That is its job. That is what it does extremely well. In terms of funding, regular inspections will be paid for, as now, by the Home Office. The subsection which relates to police and crime panels being able to request additional inspections of part of the functions of those forces is precisely to give them added flexibility to request such inspections when needed. Therefore, it does not seem unreasonable to say, as this clause says, that,</p>
<ul><a name="1107148000207"></a>"such reasonable costs incurred or to be incurred in connection with the inspection",</ul>
<p><a name="1107148000174"></a>should be reimbursed by the PCP.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="1107148000126"></a>In terms of who inspects the PCC, the whole relationship between the police and crime panel and the police and crime commissioner is intended to be that the checks and balances are provided by the police and crime panel. The regular check on the police and crime commissioner is provided by the police and crime panel. That is the process which we are trying to build into the new model. To muddy the role of HMIC by inspecting police and crime commissioners and police and crime panels does not seem appropriate to the model we propose. The model we are introducing through the Bill is that HMIC should continue to focus on the professional police forces and to report to the public as well as the Secretary of State on that. Police and crime commissioners will be held to account, under scrutiny, on a regular basis by police and crime panels. Police and crime panels are part of the structure of local government and local authorities and, I am sure, will continue to be held to account by their fellow councillors, particularly if they vote through precepts which rise rapidly year by year. On that basis, I hope that I have provided some reassurance to the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, although I am sure that she is completely unpersuaded that any new system can possibly be as good as that which we currently have. Nevertheless, I hope that I have persuaded her to withdraw her amendment.</p>

However, I do not think that he fully understood what I was arguing. I was not arguing that everything is wonderful in the present system; in fact, until recently, police authorities were not inspected. It is only quite recently that they became inspected, which had a tremendously focusing impact. Police authorities operated much more effectively once they were inspected, which has taken place only in the past two or three years if my memory serves me correctly. If elected councillors sitting on a police authority can be inspected, I do not understand why commissioners who have been directly elected cannot be. I do not understand the difference: they are both elected, albeit perhaps in different ways.</p>

They should have the reassurance on some sort of regular basis that commissioners are operating effectively-I do not see that there is anything wrong with that. I find it difficult to accept the repeated suggestion that I am asking for all sorts of radical and extreme things, when it seems that very sensible and basic issues are being raised.

<a name="1107148000131"></a><b><a name="110713-0003.htm_spnew45"></a><a name="1107148000491"></a>Lord Ramsbotham:</b> My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments 243, 271, 272, 304, 305 and 306. Since all the amendments are to do with the British Transport Police and the British Transport Police Authority, they have been deliberately grouped together rather than with specific clauses. They aim, as I said at Second Reading, to,</p>
<ul><a name="1107148000208"></a>"strengthen the Bill by increasing co-operation between the authority and other police forces, particularly in counterterrorism and in the run-up to the Olympics".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 27/4/11; col. 173.]</ul>
<a name="110713-0003.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="1107148000132"></a>I shall first outline the context in which the amendments have been tabled and apologise to the House for being unable to be here when they were debated in Committee. Again, as I said at Second Reading, I am an unashamed proponent of two-tier policing in this country, with a national police service complemented by a number of local and specialist forces. Bearing in mind that the last royal commission on policing was in 1962 and much has happened since then which suggests the need for reform of the policing as extant at that time, I was very disappointed to find that although called the police reform Bill, there is very little in it about reform, except about the governance of policing, which is not the same thing.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="1107148000133"></a>However, these amendments are about long-needed reform; they are an attempt to complete business that was begun as long ago as October 2001, when the then Government issued a consultation document entitled <I>Modernising the British Transport Police</I>, which included detailed proposals to bring it in line with Home Office police forces in terms of accountability, status and powers. It proposed, first, placing the jurisdiction of British Transport Police constables over the railways on a statutory basis; that was partly addressed in the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003, which gave them the powers and privileges of a Home Office constable, not only over all railway property, but throughout Great Britain in relation to railway matters. It secondly proposed giving British Transport Police constables jurisdiction outside the railways in certain circumstances. This, again, was partly addressed in the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, emergency legislation that followed 9/11 and other terrorist attacks.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="1107148000134"></a>However, although welcoming these changes, the Transport Police and its authority regarded them as only partial introduction of what had been proposed. Therefore, they tried to use the opportunity presented by the August 2008 consultation that preceded the Policing and Crime Act 2009 to address the identified anomalies once and for all. They submitted a formal  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_830"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 830</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>request for a number of legislative changes that addressed the issues of police powers and jurisdiction to which, reprehensibly, they received no formal feedback from the Home Office. Instead, there was no consultation and they were surprised to find that Schedule 7 of the Act stated that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a><a name="1107148000199"></a>"Where a member of the British Transport Police Force is for the time being under the direction and control of the chief officer of another police force by virtue of a police force collaboration agreement ... the member shall have all the powers and privileges of a member of that other force".</p>

<p><a name="1107148000135"></a>Furthermore, no attempt was made to address an added complication to co-operation that they had raised, namely that the powers of jurisdiction of police officers from Home Office forces were not extended to match those of a British Transport Police officer, which include the ability to police in England, Wales and across the border in Scotland.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="1107148000136"></a>Charitably, the British Transport Police assumed that these continued inequities were not intended, but resulted from a lack of knowledge about the anomalies that resulted from gaps in existing legislation. Therefore, they continued to look for opportunities to obtain parity of police-officer powers regardless of employing force, the next opportunity coming in September 2010 with the coalition Government's consultation before the Bill, entitled <I>Policing in the 21st </I><I>C</I><I>entury; Reconnecting </I><I>P</I><I>olice and the </I><I>P</I><I>eople</I>.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="1107148000137"></a>The Bill envisages annual police plans, covering areas of the country yet to be determined, drawn up by elected police and crime commissioners. Assuming that, in logic, this must include all police forces, the Transport Police, in its response to the consultation, pointed out that, as the specialist national force for the railways, cross-border working was part of its day-to-day business. It welcomed the fact that, in drawing up their plans, PCCs would have to look beyond their own force borders,</p>
<ul><a name="1107148000209"></a>"under a strong duty to collaborate, in the interests of value for money and to tackle cross border, national and international crimes".</ul>
<a name="110713-0003.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="1107148000138"></a>The British Transport Police also said that it was keen to ensure that the different governance structures between it and its authority and their Home Office colleagues and their authorities did not create difficulties in the excellent communications and partnership working that currently existed between them. There must be, for example, adequate provision for communications between the authorities and committees of the Transport Police, the Civil and Nuclear Constabulary, the MoD Police and police and crime commissioners, if they subsume the role currently filled by the Association of Police Authorities.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="1107148000139"></a>I mention this not to criticise the Bill so much as to suggest that these amendments to do with the British Transport Police ought to be government amendments. Identified anomalies that inhibit national and local policing have existed for far too long and have been drawn to the attention of both the Home Office and the Department for Transport over a number of years. Amendments 242, 271 and 272 are designed to rectify the status anomaly; Amendment 243 is designed to provide the opportunity for the Transport Police to protect the travelling public by taking preventive action against possible sex offenders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="1107148000140"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, will speak to Amendments 271, 272 and 304 to 306, covering licensing and firearms. All are designed to save money and better protect the public.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="1107148000141"></a>I appeal to the Minister to accept the opportunity created by the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill to complete this unfinished business. I know that both she and the Transport Police and its authority have been in contact with the Department for Transport and I look forward to hearing what may have been agreed between them. I accept that she will be unable to promise more than that the issues I have raised will now be tackled positively and not allowed to drag on as they have over the past 10 years. In that anticipation, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_297"></a>
<a name="1107148000142"></a><b><a name="110713-0003.htm_spnew46"></a><a name="1107148000492"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> My Lords, I speak in favour of the seven amendments. I start by expressing my appreciation to the Minister for the constructive approach she has adopted in conversations with both the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and me about the role, powers and jurisdictions of the BTP. I know that she has written to the Transport Minister about these amendments and I hope that when she answers the debate she will be able to say that the Government at least accept the spirit of them, if not accept them tonight.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="1107148000143"></a>I know from what the Minister said in Committee that she is particularly concerned about licensing issues and the difficulties that the BTP and the travelling public face with anti-social behaviour on the railway fuelled by excessive drinking. I shall come to the amendments which deal with that issue in a moment.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="1107148000144"></a>I would like to add a word to what the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said about jurisdiction. This is covered in Amendment 242. The British Transport Police Authority has sent me a copy of a letter which was sent on 7 July from the chief constable of the force, Andrew Trotter, to the Minister of State for Transport, Theresa Villiers. In a paragraph headed "Jurisdiction", he says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a><a name="1107148000200"></a>"The current legislative anomalies mean that there are a number of caveats applied to the powers of BTP officers, these are provided not through our own Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003, but the Anti-terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 (section 100(2) and (3)) which pre-dated it. The amendment laid before the House of Lords seeks to remove the ambiguity the current legislation creates through these caveats. If the amendment is approved, in the eyes of the public and the rail industry, it will have no obvious impact on day-to-day policing of the railways and I can assure you it will have no impact on costs or other resource implications. It will however put BTP officers on the same footing as their Home Office colleagues when not physically on rail property or carrying out duties related to the railways, i.e. they will be warranted officers not civilians".</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="1107148000145"></a>Amendments 271 and 272 deal with the Firearms Act. I read in the latest issue of <I>Railnews</I>, which is the monthly newspaper for rail industry staff, that the Government have approved the creation of an armed response unit for the BTP. That paper states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a><a name="1107148000201"></a>"Transport secretary Philip Hammond said the Home Office go-ahead was not in response to any specific threat but would reduce the burden on other police forces which provide armed support to the BTP".</p>

<p><a name="1107148000175"></a>That is all well and good and it is what the BTP chief constable asked for, but it appears that BTP officers, once selected and through the selection process, will  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_832"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 832</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have to apply individually for firearms certificates. This seems ludicrous and flies in the face of the Home Secretary's determination to reduce bureaucracy in the police service-a point made by the chief constable in his letter to Theresa Villiers. The cost in direct financial terms and in opportunity costs to the BTP and Home Office forces to process more than 100 applications is completely avoidable simply by giving the BTP the same powers as those expressly quoted in the Act for the Civil Nuclear Constabulary and the Serious Organised Crime Agency. It also creates a delay in trained officers being fully operational. Our amendments avoid that and I hope the Minister will feel able to accept them too.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="1107148000146"></a>I turn finally to Amendments 304, 305 and 306. Amendments 304 and 305 seek to name the BTP as a responsible authority under the Licensing Act so it can object to a licence application, revoke a licence for premises located within the jurisdiction of the railway or object to a temporary licence. Amendment 306 explicitly provides for the BTP to receive the late-night levy from the licensing authority. Bearing in mind that so much BTP officer time is spent policing alcohol-related crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour, it seems most unfair that the BTP is not able to get some payment from the levy.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="1107148000147"></a>I have a number of statistics relating to offences on railway stations. The one that apparently has the greatest difficulty is Leeds station which has 18 venues, including a nightclub and a hotel. Alcohol-related offences at Leeds have increased by 122 per cent in the past five years. I will not go into any more detail at this late hour, but I am sure the Minister will agree with me that this is an unacceptable situation. There are few things more unpleasant or potentially terrifying for rail passengers to face, particularly women travelling on their own late at night, than a bunch of drunken yobbos terrorising a train or a station platform. We cannot claim that our amendments will solve this problem but the BTP and we certainly believe it will help them tackle it.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="1107148000148"></a>I hope very much that the Minister can accept the spirit of these amendments. The previous Government attempted to do that and were not able to produce exactly the right solution. She has the opportunity to produce a lasting solution for the future of the BTP's powers and jurisdictions. If she does that, the travelling public, railway staff and the officers of the British Transport Police will be greatly in her debt.</p>

I will not repeat what the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and my noble friend Lord Faulkner have said because I fully support all their contributions, but it is worth pointing out that the BTP is pretty unique as a very specialist police force. I think the statistics are that half of its officers tend to operate in London, both on the Underground and on the main line, and the rest are split between the main line elsewhere in the country and Network Rail.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para81"></a>

When one has been delayed on the railways and has seen the difference in response professionalism between the local force that probably has not had much experience of this and the BTP, it brings into focus how important it is that the BTP's expertise is maintained and enhanced.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="1107148000151"></a>It is absolutely essential that the ideas behind these amendments-that the BTP is put on the same footing as Home Office forces-are accepted. I hope the noble Baroness will accept the principle, but I wonder whether there is a problem because the BTP is the responsibility of the Department of Transport and other forces are the responsibility of the Home Office. I sometimes detect a kind of tension between the two, which the two previous noble Lords have also alluded to. I hope that these amendments will help to improve relationships and-something I see as being thoroughly important-enable BTP officers to move around, not just on the railways but in adjacent areas where they need to do their work without the constraint of having to apply to go into another force's territory.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="1107148000152"></a>I look forward to hearing what the noble Baroness will say in response and I thoroughly support these amendments.</p>

Like the others who have spoken, I should like to hear what the Minister will say in response to the case that has been put forward. When I spoke to these amendments in Committee, I am afraid I got into the history of the BTP but I will not repeat that. Noble Lords will know that my concern for and interest in the branch is real.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="1107148000154"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, gave us an interesting history and pointed out some of the difficulties that the BTP has faced in trying to make its case to the Government. Those are very powerful and persuasive points. The additional comments from my noble friends Lord Faulkner and Lord Berkeley have made a pretty irresistible case. It is time to look at how the geographic forces interrelate with the BTP and vice versa. The safety of the travelling public and the interests of all concerned would benefit from that. I am concerned that it is perhaps more complex than has been said in the past few minutes. Therefore, we shall need to look at that sometime. However, I hope the Minister will reassure us that she will not leave it to ordinary processes and that, on this occasion, she will tackle what is required positively to give us some hope that the situation will not be allowed to drag on, and so that we get some resolution to these points.</p>

I shall start by speaking to Amendments 242, 243, 271 and 272. In Committee I was grateful for noble Lords' comments about the importance of integrated policing between the British Transport Police and the geographic police forces. This is why my honourable friend the Minister of State for Transport and I fully

I can assure noble Lords that, in taking this matter forward between us, there is certainly no tension between the two Ministers involved. I hope we shall meet fairly soon to set out and discuss what is behind these amendments and how we might take that forward in a practical way. I pledge to take a personal interest in the progress of this.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="1107148000156"></a>The proposed amendments cover a range of detailed and technical changes. These would significantly affect the status, jurisdiction and powers of the British Transport Police. It is therefore essential that the intentions of the amendments proposed are fully understood and that the consequences of the changes, for both the British Transport Police and wider policing, are closely examined. In particular, we need to ensure that the seemingly simple and straightforward legislative changes sought do not bring with them any unintended consequences. For example, Amendment 242 would change Section 1 of the Police Act 1996 to make,</p>
<ul><a name="1107148000210"></a>"the area over which the British Transport Police Force has jurisdiction",</ul>
<p><a name="1107148000176"></a>into a police area for the purposes of the Act. The effect of this would be that references to police areas in any other legislation would apply to the police area of the British Transport Police, as defined in the amendment. A quick search has shown that there are 370 occurrences of the phrase "police area" in primary legislation. The impact of extending them all to the British Transport Police would be wide-ranging.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="1107148000177"></a>I have some detailed illustrations of what that would mean, including matters to do with the Children Act 2004, local safeguarding children boards and the Police (Property) Act. However, given the lateness of the hour, I hope noble Lords will understand that very careful and detailed consideration is needed before putting this into primary legislation. However, I am in touch with colleagues in the Department for Transport, with a view to exploring solutions to this to provide the necessary powers and jurisdiction that the British Transport Police seeks and which will enable it to deliver policing of the railways as efficiently and effectively as possible and without unintended consequences. I have discussed this with colleagues in the Department for Transport, and this examination and seeking to find the right way in which to put this into primary legislation will be an ongoing exercise for us. I assure noble Lords that, when appropriate changes are identified, my department will be prepared to consider making the necessary changes within suitable primary legislation. Although I cannot commit to putting the provision at this very late stage into the tail-end of this legislation, we will, as these proposals come forward and are validated, look to put them into primary legislation in future Bills. I understand that there is quite a bit of Home Office legislation coming up the track, if noble Lords will forgive the pun, and I would hope that there would be opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="1107148000157"></a>I thank the noble Lords, Lord Ramsbotham and Lord Faulkner of Worcester, for their amendments and I thank noble Lords for the support that has been given to them around the House. However, on the basis of what I have said, I ask them not to press their amendments.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_835"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column 835</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110713-0003.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="1107148000158"></a>I turn to Amendments 304 to 306, which address licensing. These amendments seek to put the British Transport Police on a par with the 43 territorial police forces in England and Wales for the purposes of alcohol licensing. I can see why that might seem a reasonable proposition at first glance. However, I am not able to accept the amendments, as I explained in some detail in Committee last month. However, I shall briefly reiterate the reasons.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="1107148000159"></a>Amendment 304 would make the British Transport Police a responsible authority under the Licensing Act 2003, which requires licensing authorities automatically to notify responsible authorities about licence reviews. Licence applicants, who will be local businesses or individuals, must also send copies to their local responsible authorities. In this Bill, we are increasing the list of responsible authorities to include health bodies and licensing authorities in their own right. We do not think it would be helpful to extend the list further to include the British Transport Police. Licensing is administered by local authorities, which make licensing decisions that reflect the needs of the local area. For this reason, the chief officer of police for the geographic area is a responsible authority under the Act. Likewise, other responsible authorities have as their focus the geographic area in which the premises are situated.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="1107148000160"></a>The British Transport Police is a broadly non-geographic force, with a specific, non-regional jurisdiction. It covers the transport network as a whole and so will not be relevant to some licensing authority areas. We do not think it would always be obvious in a given local area to which part of the British Transport Police licensing applicants should send their licensing forms. On top of that, the Government are unwilling to add to the burden of on businesses by adding responsible authorities unnecessarily.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="1107148000161"></a>Of course, the British Transport Police has expert knowledge on alcohol-related late-night crime and disorder around transport hubs and on the transport network. We expect the British Transport Police to have effective lines of communication with the geographic constabularies and that it will continue to use them in future to raise any issues it has relating to alcohol licensing. In addition, I point out that because under this Bill we are removing the test of vicinity from the Licensing Act 2003, it will in future be open for anyone, including members of the British Transport Police, to make representations to the licensing authority in their own right. Applications for new licences do get advertised, and we taking steps to require licensing authorities to publicise these online. I hope that would be of help to the British Transport Police. Making the British Transport Police a responsible authority would cause unnecessary bureaucracy for licensing applicants.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="1107148000162"></a>Amendment 305 seeks to make the British Transport Police a relevant person for the purposes of allowing it to object to temporary events notices. Residents' organisations told us that, after crime, noise was their greatest concern in relation to temporary events. We are extending the right to object to the environmental health authority and allowing them and the police to object on the grounds of all four licensing objectives. We think that provides adequate protection for residents

I am confident that if the British Transport Police has concerns about temporary events, it can raise these in the course of their liaison with their local constabularies.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="1107148000163"></a>Finally, Amendment 306 would make the British Transport Police a recipient of the late-night levy funds alongside the geographic police forces. The levy is a means of raising revenue from licensed premises that sell alcohol late at night so as to ensure that such premises contribute to the costs of policing the late-night economy. I mentioned in Committee that, while I recognised that the British Transport Police must deal with late-night crime and disorder, its role is more limited. Its night-time role is restricted to areas where there is little or no public use of late-night railway transport. This applies to many licensing authority areas.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="1107148000164"></a>In any event, the geographic constabularies bear the overwhelming burden of late-night policing costs. The levy clauses will allow licensing authorities to retain up to 30 per cent of the net revenue to fund services in the late night, such as taxi marshals. Licensing authorities could decide, at their discretion, to give some of their retained funds to the British Transport Police in those areas where the BTP may incur specific costs of policing alcohol-related crime and disorder in the night-time economy. In addition, the Government have retained the power to amend the beneficiaries of the levy in regulations, should it transpire that it is desirable specifically to pass some of the levy funds to bodies such as the British Transport Police.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="1107148000165"></a>We have the greatest respect for the BTP, which carries out the difficult task of tackling crime on our transport network. However, for the reasons that I have given, I ask your Lordships to withdraw the amendments.</p>

I also thank her personally for the care that she has taken to meet with us and take on board the points that we have made and transfer them to the Department for Transport as well.</p>

<a name="110713-0003.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="1107148000167"></a>I think we are all encouraged, but I hope that the Minister will forgive me if I sound a note of caution, because promises have been made to the British Transport Police since 2001. I ask the Minister if we could now have from the Department for Transport and indeed the Home Office an action plan showing who is to do what and by when, which will be reported back to this House so that we can keep in touch with what is actually happening. We have been here before over the last 10 years and people have been frightened, I suspect, by the figures that she might have quoted to us and put the matter in the "too difficult" file. It is not a "too difficult" file; it is a file that must be actioned. Therefore, if I say that I am prepared to withdraw the amendments tonight but perhaps return to the subject on Third Reading briefly, I hope that at that stage the Minister might be able to assure this House that the action plan that I am calling for will be implemented so that these things really will happen rather than be allowed to wither on the vine.</p>

I am sure that he is aware that Third Reading is next week-Tuesday or Wednesday, I believe. It was not my intention to have met with the Minister of State in the Department for Transport by then. However, I can assure him that I am planning to meet with her before the House returns in September. I think that she and I need to have an across-the-table discussion about the sort of thing that the noble Lord has mentioned. I am in favour of action plans and timelines. I quite like the concept of project management in this area. However, I do not want to talk it up too much, given that the noble Lord has told us that this has been on the table since 2001.</p>

We will of course engage the British Transport Police itself in this negotiation. I am quite sure that it will relay to the noble Lord whether it feels we are making progress or not. However, as we make progress I will endeavour, on a very informal basis, to ensure that noble Lords who have expressed an interest in this are kept informed of the progress being made. I am quite sure that if we do not make that progress, the noble Lord will call me back to this Dispatch Box pretty rapidly.</p>

I want to add to what was said towards the end of the debate on Monday. I should say that I agree with every word that the noble Lord, Lord Willis, said. He is correct that technology is not an add-on, something it would be nice to have or that we ought to be looking at. Technology in education today is absolutely fundamental. Here I must declare a series of important interests. When I worked for the department for six years between 1997 and 2003, I became fascinated by the impact of new technology in education. On leaving the department, I became engaged with and subsequently joined the board of Promethean, a company producing interactive whiteboards. I still sit on that board. I am also chairman of Futurelab, which is an educational research charity. It is important to say that the reason I joined the board of Futurelab was to try and ensure that-</p>

Could I ask our expert in the corner whether the microphones are switched on because we cannot hear the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, awfully well? Perhaps I may also suggest that noble Lords make sure that their mobile phones are turned off because it is their phones which are causing that curious buzzing noise.</p>

<p><a name="11071377000007"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="11071377000110"></a>Lord Puttnam:</b> Thank you, Lord Chairman. I could go into detail about why I think this is so important, but perhaps I should go straight to something I read the other day which is absolutely factual. It concerns a teaching assistant and special needs teacher called Bev Evans at Pembroke Dock Community School in  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC304"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC304</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Wales. Bev Evans puts lesson plans up on the web using the TES Resources website. Over the past few years she has shared 276 teaching resources on the web with other teachers. As of last month, her work has been downloaded 1,345,330 times by 237,364 educators in 169 countries. Teachers save an average of 30 minutes per resource, the equivalent of 672,665 hours of teaching time, which is worth 431 teaching years. I cite that because it is a fantastic illustration of the way that technology has the ability to transform teaching and learning. These figures and indeed the whole concept would have been unimaginable a decade ago, so the role that technology now plays in education is fundamental.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000008"></a>To put it kindly, I am afraid that, at present, the White Paper is technology-light. I am concerned about that because the whole purpose is to start a serious conversation both at the department and with the Minister. We need the reassurance of knowing that this subject will not be like discussing the adaptation to or mitigation of climate change with someone who does not really accept that climate change is an important reality. This is a reality. The noble Lord, Lord Willis, sensibly cited the example of electricity. It is absolutely true to say that in the early part of the last century, the difference between the attainments of some children over others depended on whether there was electricity in their homes. That would allow them to do homework in the evenings, whereas those without electricity  could not. Technology is as fundamental as that. That may sound like a large claim, but it is not an irrelevant one.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000009"></a>I am also puzzled because two weeks ago the Secretary of State, Mr Gove, made a really remarkable speech at the Royal Society. The second half of that absolutely nailed and eulogised the use of technology. He was completely clear as to how important the adequate but intelligent use of technology was to our competitiveness. He was very clear about the way technology is being used in other countries successfully and that we had to get our act together and make a success of it. He could not have been more crystal clear on that. Yet none of that speech is contained at the moment anywhere in the White Paper as I read it. It would be good for the Government, the country and, I suggest, the Minister if it were. The purpose of these two amendments is to try and ensure that that finds its way into the Bill and the Government prove for good and all that they are absolutely committed to technology within teaching and learning.</p>

<p><a name="11071377000010"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="11071377000111"></a>Lord Peston:</b> Before the Minister speaks, I unfortunately missed the last meeting of your Lordships' Committee. I broadly support what is said here but would like, as someone who spends a lot of time using this sort of technology, to offer one or two caveats. First, I know of no other way of wasting more time than in getting on to the net. It is not merely ordinary time-wasting because it is addictive. I am keen for our young people to get involved in all this but we should not be naïve about it. When I come into your Lordships' House, I am one of the early arrivals at 8.30. By 9.30 I am fed up to the teeth and immediately log-on. I start typing into my machine. Some two hours go by and I have looked at <I>The Wasteland </I>by TS Eliot-you can download  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC305"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC305</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it for free, which surprises me. I then begin to wonder if that is a better poem than <I>The Love Song of J</I><I> Alfred Prufrock</I>. That is all good for young people except for the amount of time that it takes. Equally, one should not be naïve in assuming that they will do as I do and look for intellectual, aesthetic and scientific things. They will spend a lot of time mucking around. I am not saying a word against any of this being the right path to go down-quite the contrary. We really must go down this path but I wanted to add those words of caution.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000011"></a>The other words of caution already emerged in your Lordships' earlier deliberations. For a lot of young people, we are talking about a great deal of money. As much as I support my noble friend's Amendment 107C, it would cost quite a lot of money. Also, one should not forget how many homes still do not have computers. That was perfectly clear from the earlier discussion. It again troubled me a little that-I have forgotten where I read it now, but it was apropos of what is developing in California-increasingly if you do not submit your work via computer it ceases to be acceptable. Are we absolutely certain that we want to be completely committed to that path? I am quite certain that, were our successors to read my speech a generation from now, they would say, "Well, they really had some old fogies in those days, didn't they?". By then, it will just be the norm but we should just be a little cautious about the path to that norm. Nothing of what I have said should be interpreted as meaning anything other than support for technology in schools. As I say, the world wide web is a fantastic treasure trove of valuable things. We certainly want our young people to use it. I simply add the caveat that there is a little more to this than just saying what a wonderful thing that is.</p>

<p><a name="11071377000012"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="11071377000112"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord Hill of Oareford):</b> First, I agree very much with the view expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, and with the powerful speech made by my noble friend Lord Willis on Monday, when we last discussed this before being rudely interrupted. My noble friend was absolutely right that the effective use of technology clearly supports good teaching and helps raise standards.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000013"></a>As he argues clearly, it is not an either/or between, for example, Shakespeare and technology. I have had that conversation with the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, before. He made the case powerfully to me that technology can bring Shakespeare within reach of people for whom the traditional way of books would be much harder; it can bring it to life in a way that the Arden set might not.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000014"></a>My noble friend was right to suggest on Monday that there has been too much emphasis on the technology itself, the kit, and the idea that we could transform teaching simply by spending money on computers or whiteboards. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, agrees with that. By the same token, I accept that there are far more exciting ways of learning than just by Latin primer.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000015"></a>One point that was not raised about technology is the fact that we have an extraordinarily successful market in educational technology in the UK. We are a  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC306"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC306</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>leader, so there are strong commercial reasons why we should support it. We want to encourage sharing of evidence of effective practice in the use of technology and improved teacher skills in using it. My noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, have given me a useful nudge-I think that that is the word-or prod about the importance of that.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000016"></a>We are talking to a number of interested parties-school leaders, professional bodies, educational charities, industry, academics and other experts-about how the department should take forward its thinking about technology. Given the pace of change, we think it important to allow schools and teachers themselves, working with industry, to respond to the changes. We want to give teachers the freedom to choose how to use it to create lessons that engage their pupils and enable them to achieve their full potential. The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, gave a powerful example of how that is happening. The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, and my noble friend talked on Monday about having a conversation with the department. I would certainly welcome such a conversation and invite both of them and any other noble Lords with an interest to help us develop our thinking.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000017"></a>Access to computers and the internet is an important point. Clearly, that can have benefits for the whole family. We know that many schools offer access to ICT before and after normal school hours to help pupils without access at home. Other schools are working with charities such as the e-Learning Foundation and the commercial sector to provide access. We want more of that.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000018"></a>On resources, the financial situation is obviously difficult. We seek to support disadvantaged pupils directly through the pupil premium. The premium enables schools to decide for themselves how best to spend additional resources to support disadvantaged pupils. On Monday, my noble friend gave the figures for the extent to which there is a disparity between rich and poor-unsurprisingly-of access to computers. The premium may well include providing computers and broadband connectivity if the schools think that that is the most effective approach for particular children in the circumstances that they face.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000019"></a>The Government certainly recognise the important role that technology can play in supporting education. We are considering that within government. I ask  my noble friend Lord Willis-and, as I said, any  other noble Lords who would be interested in such conversation-to help us with our thinking. I certainly accept the fundamental importance of the subject, as my right honourable friend the Secretary of State set out in the recent speech to which the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, referred. On that basis, I ask my noble friend to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="11071377000020"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="11071377000113"></a>Lord Willis of Knaresborough:</b> I warmly thank the Minister for his thoughtful comments and for the way in which he wishes to tackle this issue and take it forward. I thank the noble Lords, Lord Peston and Lord Puttnam, for their support. I confess that the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Peston, reminded me of St Bede, who wanted a book out of the Vatican library and set off walking from St Albans all the way to get it. You can imagine that when Caxton brought  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC307"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC307</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the printing press to Britain, people said, "It's not the same as having to walk to Rome for it". We have to be careful, and I take the comments that he made.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000021"></a>What excites me about the investigation-having been watching my wife recently, who has just found Google as well as most shopping sites-is the excitement of seeing children find new information and new ideas. That is what learning is about; it is not simply dealing with what you are taught but finding out information yourself. Experiments have been done in Africa where solar-powered computers have just been left for young children to explore them, and they have been able to access Google and information across the world without any further training. Youngsters today are hardwired into this technology, and to be able to use it is important.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000022"></a>I looked, as did the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, at the Secretary of State's speech and was hugely encouraged by what he had to say. I mentioned in my earlier remarks that I do not believe that the Secretary of State is a Luddite. He sometimes hides his passion for technology under a bushel or behind volumes of Shakespeare but it is important to take it out. He talks about Du Sautoy, the Li Ka-Shing fellowship and Professor Khan's work; these are remarkable initiatives to bring learning to millions of youngsters around the world. We need to be part of that, but you can do so only if you have good technology in school that is being used wisely and effectively and you have access to that at home as well. As the Government, local authorities and other statutory bodies move forward with delivering more and more on the internet-rightly, in my view-it is children who become the educators of the future. It is for that reason that I hope that this will be taken forward.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000023"></a>I thank the Minister for his comments. We will take up his offer of a meeting with him and his officials. With those assurances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

As is quite clear from the wording, the amendment asks the Government to consider whether it is necessary for only qualifications that are accredited by Ofqual to be counted into the points score for individual schools. It is now not only independent schools but many others that offer the international baccalaureate, for example, and other professional and vocational qualifications may not be accredited by Ofqual but are accredited by other perfectly respectable and widely acknowledged bodies. As I understand it, Ofqual has within its remit only about 15 per cent of all qualifications; the other 85 per cent are variously accredited by other organisations, many of which, as I say, are themselves well accredited.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000025"></a>The purpose of my noble friend's amendment is to ask the Government to consider whether they should collect data on all qualifications gained, assuming that they have proper provenance and whether or not they are within the empire of Ofqual. On his behalf, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="11071377000026"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="11071377000116"></a>Lord Lingfield:</b> My Lords, I rather support the amendment because, as my noble friend Lady Perry said, a large number of schools, not just in the state sector but in the independent sector, are considering innovation as regards examinations. A number of very grand independent schools can consider these and not worry about any point scoring that comes out in league tables throughout the country. However, many other schools cannot afford to take these initiatives in a way that they might wish to. This is a good idea. I am not certain what the minutiae of it could be, but I very much hope that the Minister will take away the point made by my noble friends Lord Lucas and Lady Perry and look at it carefully.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000027"></a>While we are on the subject of Ofqual, noble Lords will remember that huge difficulties were mentioned in the newspapers during the previous round of examinations which did not show some of the awarding bodies in a very good light. I understand that there were nine incidents overall. I am sure that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that Ofqual can impose two types of sanction on the awarding bodies-first, a rap over the knuckles, which may not be very effective; and, secondly, the nuclear option of striking them off the list, which may not be in any way suitable and could cause great difficulties. Therefore, will the Minister and his colleagues consider a third option that could involve a series of fines for various circumstances that would add seriously to the sanctions available to Ofqual? Perhaps some of the difficulties that arose last year and caused distress to pupils and schools will not arise in the future?</p>

It is important that Ofqual has the powers and flexibility to maintain a reputation that will be essential if standards are to be properly observed in this country.</p>

<p><a name="11071377000029"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="11071377000118"></a>Lord Boswell of Aynho:</b> My Lords, very briefly, this is my maiden contribution to this consideration in Committee of the Bill. I am a former Minister, and perhaps I should formally declare that I am a fellow  of City and Guilds, although I have no operational responsibilities there.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000030"></a>I also warm to this idea. There was a time-if noble Lords wish to look it up; as I recall, it was Section 24 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992-when it was in the hands of the Minister of the day, who happened to be me, to exercise a kind of nuclear option whereby everything that was not authorised could be extinguished. That is an extreme version and one that every year we fought off enacting. I am very glad that we did. The world is a much more protean place now. I happen recently to have had correspondence with the Minister's colleagues in the department about some very sensible input by the French inspector general of education, which I had not expected to be made in quite the tones that it was. It certainly was not insular.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000031"></a>We should allow Ofqual, as a new institution, the maximum slack to pursue its interests and duties. There are concerns about the quality of the examination system, although I suspect-given the sheer industrial volume of what is processed through the system, including the number of entries and scripts-it is perhaps not surprising that mistakes are made from time to time. However, at least let us not ask Ofqual to confine its activities to a narrow schedule in presenting the achievements of schools and the options that it can take. My message to the Minister would be to keep as much flexibility as we reasonably can.</p>

<p><a name="11071377000032"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="11071377000119"></a>Baroness Wall of New Barnet:</b> My Lords, this is also my maiden intervention in this Bill. I support the final comments that were made, for two reasons. First, I declare an interest: I work with and support EAL, a bespoke awarding body. Its view is that the extremes that are currently available are really quite worrying. Secondly, and importantly for it, if we do not have those opportunities to bring to a halt and remedy the situation, it does no good for those awarding bodies that try very hard to make sure that they work very well. For those reasons, I support those comments. Perhaps the Minister will think about whether there is something in between, but certainly that something detrimental should happen if things are not working out well.</p>

<p><a name="11071377000033"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="11071377000120"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> My Lords, on the core point of this amendment, we certainly want to create a system that encourages all schools to offer high quality qualifications and gives pupils and parents the clearest possible information. To achieve this, first, we are committed to giving everyone access to the underlying data on all the qualifications taken in schools, in both the independent and state sectors. We plan to publish  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC310"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC310</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>all the information the department holds on schools in a single place in a way that is accessible to everyone. We have made some steps already in opening up information on qualifications and we intend to do more. This puts parents in a stronger position to judge whether a school is meeting their child's needs.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000034"></a>However, qualifications reported in performance tables should first be accredited by Ofqual in order to secure standards. Ofqual's scrutiny provides a safeguard that qualifications are rigorous and challenging. It is open to all the qualification-awarding organisations to present the qualifications that they offer for accreditation. The majority of qualifications taken in the independent sector and all qualifications taken in the state sector are accredited.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000035"></a>In recent years, school performance tables have shown schools' performances based on a system of equivalencies, which have ascribed a points value to a wide range of qualifications, and presented information about schools' performance based on those points. However, sometimes that approach serves to conceal more information than it reveals, and it treats very different qualifications as if they are the same. Both may be excellent, valuable qualifications in their own right but they are not necessarily the same.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000036"></a>We want to try to give parents detailed and specific information about qualifications and not lump it all together. It is also the case that the current system of equivalencies has created some perverse incentives for schools to offer courses that score highly in performance tables but are not necessarily in the best interests of the children concerned. That is why we have accepted Professor Wolf's recommendation that we should replace the existing performance table measures based on equivalence points and try to introduce more sophisticated criteria for deciding which qualifications should count in performance tables in future.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000037"></a>My noble friend Lord Lucas is extremely experienced in slicing and dicing data and I would welcome the chance for him to come in and talk to officials about whether there are ways that we can benefit from his experience and put it to the most effective use.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000038"></a>My noble friend Lord Lingfield raised the possibility of Ofqual taking a more nuanced approach, with a range of sanctions rather than the current, as he described it, rap over the knuckle or the nuclear option, and that perhaps it would be sensible to have something more graduated, maybe with some kind of fine. It is clear from the comments that have been made that the Government ought to think about that and reflect on it, to see whether it could be made to work in a sensible way, and to give Ofqual this kind of power as it develops. I am very happy to take those suggestions away and see whether that is something we can do and come back to at a later date.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000039"></a>With that and with the earlier points on the performance, I hope my noble friend feels able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

Perhaps I should have said in introducing my noble friend's amendment that there are many good examples, in both state and independent schools who work closely with their local industry, of vocational or professional qualifications given by, for example, some of the large worldwide computer companies and so on. I would suggest that those have a rather greater standing internationally than that of simply Ofqual. It is an inhibitor on those kinds of relationships between local industries and schools if the qualifications that could form part of the collaboration are not recognised in the school's league tables. I am sure that my noble friend will wish to take this further and I would be happy to join in those discussions. In the meanwhile, I will withdraw the amendment.</p>

Among other things, the clause transfers some of the functions of the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency to the Secretary of State-principally, those functions to do with the approval of attainment targets and the development of the national curriculum and supporting materials. Having already debated the demise of a number of non-departmental public bodies and outside agencies in the course of the Bill, noble Lords may think that, among the many important issues concerning us, it is not a priority to take up this issue with the Government. This is not simply about saving another quango. It is important to understand what the process will be for changing the national curriculum if the QCDA or some other similar, independent body does not exist-as will be the case if Clause 24 is approved unamended.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000042"></a>The argument deployed in the other place in support of the abolition of the QCDA was that, to quote Nick Gibb,</p>
<ul><a name="11071377000100"></a>"responsibility for the curriculum has always rested with the Secretary of State, both under the previous Administration and this, and nothing is changing as far as that is concerned. The QCDA simply acted on behalf of Government in advising and helping to design the curriculum and, as such, no functions are transferring from the QCDA to the Department".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Public Bill Committee, 24/3/11; col. 642.]</ul>
<p><a name="11071377000087"></a>This is a partial and one-sided claim. Most importantly, it fails to acknowledge the very important element of independence and transparency, if not to the final decision which the Secretary of State of the day will take but to the process of review, and of recommendation  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC312"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC312</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and advice to the Secretary of State that ought in my view to precede any changes to the curriculum. There has in fact been an unbroken history of statutory advisory bodies on such matters since the Board of Education Act 1899. The first specific statutory NDPB to advise on the curriculum and assessment was established under the Education Reform Act 1988. Since then, this role has been continued by one such body or another-and for good reasons.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000043"></a>In 1988, in the debate on the establishment of that first statutory non-departmental body, one of the most respected educationists of the 20th century, Lord Alexander of Potterhill, drew an analogy with the role of the national curriculum in Germany in 1935 in establishing Nazism. This may be an overly dramatic analogy for the House of Lords in 2011, but the independence of advice on curriculum and assessment has always been an important point of principle for this House in its debates. Current Ministers are prepared to change or influence the curriculum without the transparency of that independent advice or evidence. For example, noble Lords may be aware of the systematic change that has occurred in the guidance to primary schools, in which every reference in the text to "phonics", introduced by the previous Government, has, without discussion, been changed to "synthetic phonics". Also, the Government's unilateral introduction of the prescriptive EBacc shows unusual levels of willingness to interfere.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000044"></a>This clause opens the door to any future Secretary of State directly to change the national curriculum in a way that is either politically motivated or, more likely, implements the pet theories or hobby horses of Ministers. Again, there is concern that we are already beginning to witness that, with views being expressed that, for example, history should be about the rote learning of Kings and Queens and their dates, and in the view of the current Minister for Schools that education should principally be about core knowledge-and core knowledge as he defines it. I am not saying that those are not valid views-they may indeed be valid-but they are contested by a wide range of views in the profession. That contest and debate about what is important ought to be transparent during any process of review.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000045"></a>Amendments 85A and 85B would try to ensure that the Secretary of State must demonstrate that the process of review of the national curriculum is independent of government. That would provide assurance to parents and pupils about the content of the curriculum. Amendment 86 tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, who cannot be here today, would require an advisory board to ensure some independence. In their amendment, they are trying to reach the same point.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000046"></a>The department issued a statement which, I suspect, was meant to allay our fears, but it compounds them. Although the Secretary of State of the day will make the final decisions about the national curriculum, what matters is the process of consultation and review-its comprehensiveness, impartiality, scope, transparency, the independence of the analysis of the responses, and the recommendations then made to the Secretary of State, who may or may not accept them. Unless the  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC313"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC313</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>process of reviewing consultation is independently conducted so that people can be assured that it is comprehensive and takes into account all the views, and that someone independent of government is trying to make sense of it to formulate an analysis and recommendation, then following the demise of the QCA with no other body taking its place, all that I have mentioned would be under the control of the Secretary of State and civil servants. They would decide who to consult, which evidence was reported publicly and the conclusions to be drawn-and all potentially supporting the decisions that the Secretary of State originally wanted to make.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000047"></a>I contend that that cannot be right. Whether it is the QCDA or another body, surely an independent body must be in charge of the process of consultation. The results will then rightly be handed to the Secretary of State of the day, who will make the decision and be accountable for them. It is important that everyone-all of us and the parents and public- can see the basis on which those important decisions are made.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000048"></a>I will draw another analogy. It occurred to me whether we would ever think about doing this as regards health. I wonder whether, if there were a review of the best and most effective treatments for cancer, we would contemplate giving the whole process to the Secretary of State and to officials in the department, rather than to a representative body of professionals and others to form an independent evaluation of the efficacy of treatments and make recommendations to the Secretary of State. We so easily seem to slip into the assumption that with education we can do things that we would not dream of doing with other professional bodies. This point has been raised before. I ask the Minister to comment in his summing up on the points I have made, but also to explain how the Government can justify this degree of control over this process by an elected politician. I beg to move Amendment 85A.</p>

<p><a name="11071377000049"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="11071377000124"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> I have been asked by my noble friend Lady Walmsley to speak in support of Amendment 86, which is in her name and that of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel. By laying this amendment, we wish to reiterate the importance of the Secretary of State having the benefit of independent advice on changes in the national curriculum. This picks up the points which have just been made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes.</p>

However, the note that the team provided says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11071377000097"></a>"Following the passage of the Education Bill, the Secretary of State will remain responsible for making proposals to change the national curriculum and will still be able to ask another body to advise him if he wishes to do so".</p>

<p><a name="11071377000051"></a>It is the phrase "if he wishes to do so" that bothers us from the Liberal Democrat stance. We would like to ensure that the Secretary of State always takes advice from experts on these matters. As we heard last Monday, the curriculum is vital, and other countries are not as  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC314"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC314</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fixated as we are on what exactly is taught. The high level of prescription in this country goes somewhat counter to the claims that teachers are trusted as professionals. In other countries, the design of the curriculum is very different from the one that seems to be emerging in this country when we look at the remit for the expert panel which are to advise the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000052"></a>In Singapore, for example, core values are emphasised. These are self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship management, and responsible decision-taking. One cannot imagine all of this being delivered without the compulsory teaching of life skills, and indeed if we look in detail, this is exactly what we find: at the core are things like health education, PSHE, citizenship, global awareness and physical education. Surrounding these are knowledge skills-which include languages-maths and science, and, lastly, humanities and the arts.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000053"></a>In New Zealand, the key competencies are critical thinking and problem solving, using languages, symbols and texts, managing self and relating to others. In Australia, there are three core interrelated strands which include heath and physical education, personal and interpersonal development and citizenship interwoven with subject knowledge and cross-curricular skills. Indeed, thinking processes are included in nearly all these curriculums, and these are three very successful education systems which I think we can learn from.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000054"></a>However, none of these issues seems to emerge in the remit for the expert review panel; it mainly talks about knowledge and facts. We would like to know how the panel's remit has been arrived at. The note from the Bill team says that the remit is always very important, and we can well believe that. But looking at it, we rather doubt whether what comes out will be anything like the curriculum of those very successful countries. This is one reason why this particular amendment has been put forward.</p>

<p><a name="11071377000059"></a>I believe that education is about finding things out and appreciating them-all that my noble friend and the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said. If we all reflect on what was the best part of our education and schooling, it was things that were not merely part of the curriculum but, in my case, not something I was ever examined on. I was in the economic sixth at Hackney Downs School and the headmaster decided that economics was clearly not part of education. He told the English master to see the five of us who had taken that option in the sixth form. The English master, Mr Brierley, who was the great discoverer of Harold Pinter, introduced us to things that we had never heard of, one of which has become a total obsession of mine-philosophy.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000060"></a>To return to my earlier remarks, I have wasted more time reading about analytical philosophy than I care to remember, but that was part of my education. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten me, but I do not believe that those responsible for our national curriculum have ever said that rational argument and logical reasoning are what education should be about. All that tells me that the last people-having worked at the Department of Education as its first ever special adviser, I include in my admonitions officials as well as the Minister-who should be deciding these things once and for all are Ministers and their officials. We need outside comment.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000061"></a>I partly address my next remark to my noble friend Lady Hughes. The one thing that gives me hope is that, although I entirely support her amendment, the department should know that many of the rest of us still have our views. Therefore, if something comes up that we think is totally crackers, the department will still hear from us on this subject, whether we are officially consulted or not.</p>

<p><a name="11071377000062"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="11071377000128"></a>Lord Willis of Knaresborough:</b> I shall take us back to the amendment. I do not have any great love for the QCDA. It was not a perfect organisation; in fact, none of these organisations is perfect. The Government's aim in terms of the drift of the Academies Bill is that by the end of this Parliament every secondary school will be an academy. That is the reality. One of the powers of an academy is that they are able to have control over their curriculum. Will the Minister give an assurance relating to schools that become academies and this small core of national curriculum subjects? Where will they get their guidance from regarding decisions on the appropriateness of those subjects? That is an important consideration and an important function that the QCDA had.</p>

I am thinking about the future of what is planned. It is said that the QCDA may well not have been the most successful of bodies, but it did a pretty adequate job nevertheless. We do not have any clear idea where it is going, but one is told and one hopes that some of the bodies will be transferred to other organisations. If the advisory body that will be giving advice to the Government as and when required-this is important-it should be much more available on an independent basis to the emerging range of academies. There will be a need for good independent advice. I am inclined to support all these amendments, but will bear in mind what the Minister says in his reply about plans that will be seen to be more satisfactory to the Committee.</p>

I could take him to a couple of primary schools not six miles from here where it is argued by the head teachers that it improves behaviour in the playground. However, that is a separate matter.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000065"></a>On the amendments before us, it is important that we get this matter right one way or the other. I do not accept the connection to 1935, and nor does my noble colleague who proposed the amendment, but if you look at the argument and the tussle going on in Scotland at the moment over the history curriculum then you will pause and have thoughts about where decisions are finally made and on what basis. There is an issue here.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000066"></a>Two things are clear. First, in the end the Secretary of State has the responsibility to make the decision. That is the current decision and I rest content with that. Secondly, though, the Secretary of State, however clever, will need advice. That advice is of great interest to Members here and elsewhere. I would not propose going backwards and effectively reconstituting the QCDA. We have been there and done that, and there were problems; let us think new thoughts. My own inclination as a time-served academic is that when the Secretary of State publishes changes to the curriculum, he or she publishes, as a good academic would, a series of footnotes and references to the advice sought, who gave it, to whom it was given, what the advice was and whether it was well evidenced. That would give me much greater confidence than setting up a board.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000067"></a>There is no final expert opinion on what should be in a curriculum. The risk for the QCDA and any successor would be an assumption that there was a right answer. There is not; there are nuances and leanings in different directions. In the end, that should be a matter for the Secretary of State to take a view on, but we need to know what the advice was so that we can protest if necessary.</p>

It helps them understand who they are and how they fit into this great big world. I hope the Minister can assure us that when we take advice about what should be in the curriculum, there

I believe that will go a long way to helping people from diverse backgrounds understand who they are and how they fit into our society.</p>

<p><a name="11071377000069"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="11071377000132"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> My Lords, in abolishing the QCDA we are not seeking to give the Secretary of State greater control over the curriculum, nor do we wish to reduce the external expertise that can be brought to bear on qualifications or curriculum policy. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes of Stretford, and others have acknowledged, the formal accountability to Parliament for the curriculum, qualifications and national curriculum assessment will remain as it is now, with Ministers. I note that no one has fought for the QCDA to be maintained in its current form. By removing it, we will bring the delivery of those essential functions, which are continuing, back into the department. This will improve clarity and transparency, simplify the system and save money.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000070"></a>As has been pointed out, under the existing legislation, the Secretary of State already makes decisions in respect of the national curriculum. What will change is that the Secretary of State will become directly responsible for taking forward the statutory consultation process whenever the national curriculum needs to be amended. In future, the Secretary of State will have to have more direct responsibility than has arguably been the case previously, for changes to the curriculum, for justifying how the decisions to make those changes have been arrived at, and their implications.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000071"></a>I hope I can give some reassurance to noble Lords on the issue that I think lies at the heart of this. Consultation on changes to the national curriculum will continue to be a requirement. The Secretary of State will have to conduct a formal consultation with interested parties, including local authorities, schools, teachers and others-the kind of people that my noble friend Lady Benjamin mentions. The precise groups with which he will need to consult are, as now: associations of local authorities, bodies representing the interests of governing bodies, organisations representing school teachers and other persons with an interest in the proposals, which is a fairly broad group. Everyone would have to have a reasonable opportunity to make representations, there would have to be a consultation, and the Cabinet Office advice, as now, is that that should be for at least 12 weeks. After the consultation has ended, the Secretary of State has to consider the responses and must publish a summary of the views expressed-which relates to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland of Houndwood. The summary published by the Secretary of State will deliver the degree of openness and transparency for which noble Lords have argued. Then, as now, final decisions would remain with the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000072"></a>The Government are certainly committed to ensuring that everyone with an interest in the national curriculum is given an opportunity to offer their views. The current review of the national curriculum, launched in January, is being conducted in an open manner and we are looking for views from a wide range of interested parties. Once we have published our proposals for a

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000073"></a>My noble friend Lady Sharp asked about international evidence. The expert panel to the current curriculum review is looking at the curricula used in the most successful education jurisdictions, including Singapore, Australia and New Zealand, but if I can find more detail I will send that to her. My noble friend Lord Willis asked about academies. As he knows, academies are required to provide a broad and balanced curriculum and we think that that has been successful to date. Although they will not be required to teach the national curriculum, we hope that by slimming it down and making it less prescriptive academies will want to use it as a benchmark. All the material previously available to schools from the QCDA will be accessible to all those schools that want to use it. Finally on the national curriculum, so regards the current review, we intend to publish all the evidence we have considered when we bring forward proposals.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000074"></a>We think that the arrangements are in place to draw on appropriate advice as policies are developed. We do not believe that the abolition of the QCDA will lead to increased government power or control over what I accept are critical elements of our education system. There will be safeguards to ensure transparency and hold the Secretary of State to account.</p>

An academy will have total control over its curriculum and will not have to consult anyone about the subjects it teaches. While I take his point that most will want to follow the national curriculum, if an academy wanted to substitute creationism for Darwinism in its science curriculum, will it be able to do that without having to ask permission of the Secretary of State or to consult with anyone else? Is that correct?</p>

<p><a name="11071377000076"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew24"></a><a name="11071377000134"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> It is not the case that the teaching of creationism in science, for example, is possible in academies because I believe that there are safeguards in place to prevent it. Further, there are various ways through the funding agreement by which one can exercise control. The basic point about freedom over the curriculum is that, through the funding agreement, academies need to provide a broad and balanced curriculum that includes English, maths and science. That is the degree of specificity over the governance.</p>

<p><a name="11071377000077"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="11071377000135"></a>Baroness Morris of Yardley:</b> The Minister's answer to his noble friend's question is substantially right in that if a school tried to teach creationism, something would happen to prevent that. I accept that. But I thought his comments on how that would happen were interesting. He said that something in the funding agreement would stop it. I cannot imagine that a funding agreement would be drawn up merely to prevent creationism being taught in a school, which leads me to believe that the agreement also gives the Secretary of State further influence and powers over the curriculum in academies. Can he explain what those powers are and how they might be used?</p>

I will need to follow up on the point about creationism and write to the noble Baroness explaining what the mechanism is to prevent that happening. It is prevented and I will make that clear in a letter.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000079"></a>On that point, I would now ask the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Willis, is extremely important and reflects one of the constant challenges in the Bill. We are debating proposals for change, many of which will not apply if the brave new world in which every school is an academy comes into being. It is an issue that I want to raise later in relation to admissions. In response to the Minister's offer to provide a letter specifically in relation to creationism, perhaps it could be sent to all noble Lords so as to address the broader question raised by my noble friend Lady Morris of Yardley. Precisely what control does the Secretary of State or anyone else have over other potentially unwanted developments in the curriculum at an academy? It might be some other obscure and unusual development, so it would be good to know what controls are in place.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000082"></a>The Minister acknowledged the point that decision and accountability rests with the Secretary of State, and I perfectly accept that. The point at issue here is the process that leads up to that. The Minister has said that the Secretary of State, not the QCDA or some replacement for it-none of us is defending any particular body; we are talking about the process in principle-would have responsibility not only for the final decision but for the process of consultation. While the Minister has given some assurances that the Secretary of State will consult with the three groups that the QCDA now has to consult-the local authorities, governing bodies and teachers-beyond that, the parameters of the review will be determined by the Secretary of State and not by an independent body. Therefore, any academics which the Secretary of State chooses to include in the process of review beyond those three groups can simply be those academics which support the view that the Secretary of State starts off with. While it may be of some assurance that the written submissions may be published at the end of the process, it will be too late for someone with alternative views to be consulted.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000083"></a>Officials sent round a note on how the new process would work. I do not know if every Member received it, but my noble friend and I did. It states that beyond those three groups which have to be consulted on a statutory basis, the Secretary of State will,</p>
<ul><a name="11071377000101"></a>"need to give notice of the proposal to any other persons with whom he thinks it would be desirable to consult".</ul>

<p><a name="11071377000088"></a>The difference that we can all recognise is that at the moment the range of additional people is decided by an independent body, not the Secretary of State who has to make the final decision. That is a crucial difference.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000084"></a>There is another crucial difference at the end of that process. Whereas the QCDA at present must arrange for a full report to be published, the advice that we are given by officials is that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11071377000098"></a>"After the consultation has ended, the Secretary of State will consider the responses and publish a summary of the views expressed and a draft of the regulations"</p>

<p><a name="11071377000089"></a>that he wants to bring forward. In other words, it is again in the gift of the Secretary of State to decide what to publish and what to reveal about what was said during the consultation process. That is not an acceptable process in this day and age, and there needs to be some division in terms of the independence of the consultation, the analysis, the recommendations and the final decision of the Secretary of State. We may return to this matter on Report but, for now, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="11071377000086"></a>Before I continue, I acknowledge with thanks the letter of 8 July that I received from the Minister, which set out in more detail what is envisaged in the new career guidance service. I shall paraphrase it, although I am sure that the Minister has his own version. It says, first, that Connexions was not providing a consistently high-quality service to all young people and that it had to change. To a certain extent, I would agree with that. Secondly, the letter also goes on to argue that schools should be left to organise their own careers provision and be held to account only through what is described as a "destination measure" of where  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC321"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC321</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>young people go when they leave school. We very much disagree with this approach and I shall explain why shortly.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000001"></a>First, I will deal with the end of the ring-fenced funding for Connexions and the transition to the all-age careers service, which is covered in our amendments to Clause 26. All the evidence shows that Connexions careers services around the country are closing as we speak. A desperately worrying scenario is developing of a cohort of young people being left with no careers advice at all, as one service ends and nothing substantial is yet in place to replace it. The department appears to have passed the buck on to individual schools rather than have a coherent transitional plan. As the ASCL has said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11071383000182"></a>"More than 2 million young people aged 16 to 19 could lose out on valuable careers services while the Government overhauls the national careers advice service at a time when young people's unemployment is reaching record highs".</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000002"></a>Meanwhile, we are all still awaiting the detail of the design of the new all-age careers service: its duties, the services it will provide, where it will be located and how it can be accessed. In the Commons debate, the Minister said that the new service would be ready to go this September, with the full service in place from April 2012. In the meantime, the Secretary of State has stated that in 2011-12 school budgets will not rise to take account of their new legal responsibility to provide careers guidance for young people, as set out in this Bill. This lack of ring-fencing means that schools will be forced to find funds from existing budgets, leading to the inevitable conclusion that the Government intend to provide careers services on the cheap. Perhaps the Minister could explain what interim provision is being made for those young people awaiting a full careers service next year. I am sure that he will acknowledge that this is particularly fraught given the current high levels of youth unemployment. Our first set of amendments would achieve the simple but important aim of delivering continuity by requiring the Secretary of State to report to Parliament on the details of a transition plan before the new careers service can take effect.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000003"></a>We move on to the next set of amendments in this group, which define and improve the package of careers advice young people should be able to access in the future. Our amendments are set against a backdrop of increasingly complex careers choices being faced by young people and evidence that lack of information is seen by young people as one of the main barriers to their participation in education or training post-16. We do not accept that the quality careers guidance that we all know is necessary can be delivered simply by the publication of data on pupils' post-school destinations. For example, there will be a terrible temptation for providers to push young people into destinations which score more highly rather than those that play to their individual strengths and interests. At the same time, there will be a real challenge to keep accurate statistics and track the longer-term destinations of young people. There may be statistics on their destinations immediately after school but surely what we are interested in is the longer-term careers choices they make as a result of the careers guidance that they get.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC322"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC322</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000004"></a>The Government have indicated that going forward the duty to provide careers advice may be satisfied by phone or online services. While we recognise that this may have a role, we absolutely do not accept that this is enough to ensure that young people get tailored guidance in tune with their talents, abilities and aspirations. Young people are happy to talk on the phone to their friends for hours, but when it comes to talking to someone older or someone in authority, all too often they pass the phone to their parents and ask them to make that phone call for them. I genuinely do not think that young people will be confident enough to deal with quite complicated issues on the phone. In the same way as they require a face-to-face environment for mentoring or indeed teaching, this type of contact is just as necessary when young people are discussing their future job plans and their future life. Therefore our amendments would require schools to provide high quality, face-to-face careers advice.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000005"></a>This advice is particularly important to children from backgrounds where they do not have access to a social network of people in a variety of jobs, and even more so when the parents do not work or where there is intergenerational unemployment. Good careers advice can make a big difference in driving social mobility, expanding pupils' horizons and helping them to see themselves working in different environments. We believe that these matters are too important to be left to schools' discretion. We also foresee the possibility of a postcode lottery developing, with careers services around the country varying considerably depending on the resources available, thus mirroring some of the problems we have already identified with the Connexions service.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000006"></a>Our amendments also address the age range when young people should be able to access advice and the frequency at which it should be provided. The Bill limits careers advice to those aged between 14 and 16. That is not good enough. EngineeringUK, for example, has identified the need for much earlier advice through what it calls the "Year 8 dip", which is when the appetite for tough science and maths decreases in young people. The organisation goes on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11071383000183"></a>"We believe that at this point, and at other critical points along the academic pathway, we need well informed careers advisers in schools able to inspire and inform young people about careers in engineering and other science, technology, engineering and maths areas".</p>

<p><a name="11071383000172"></a>We agree with that analysis, and it could equally apply to other subject areas. One careers advice session held during the term when a student leaves school is too late. It should be provided at regular intervals before key milestones in a pupil's academic life, and our amendments would provide for that.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000007"></a>Finally, the amendments also seek to ensure that only those trained in careers guidance can provide the formal careers advice to which pupils are entitled. Without these amendments, there is no guarantee that advice would be provided by a trained professional or that it would cover the full range of options, including academic and vocational options. I accept that in the guidance the noble Lord may well refer to that it is seen as something that is "desirable", but our amendments would make it an explicit requirement.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000008"></a>In a memorandum submitted to the Public Bill Committee, Careers England and the Institute of Career Guidance called for a national quality standard. It was also part of the recommendation of the Careers Profession Task Force, and we agree with this. The world of work is changing rapidly and careers guidance cannot be left to individuals whose experience of entering the job market could, in some cases, date back to 30 or 40 years ago. We all understand the need to tackle disadvantage, which all too often is exacerbated by poor education and career choices. In the Commons, the Minister referred to a report which stated that:</p>
<ul><a name="11071383000205"></a>"State school pupils are more than four times as likely to be given bad careers advice as private school students".</ul>
<p><a name="11071383000173"></a>We believe that the package of measures we are proposing will go some way towards redressing this failure and give all pupils the right to high quality, individualised, face-to-face advice at critical times in their education journey. I hope that noble Lords will feel able to support these measures. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000009"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew31"></a><a name="11071383000225"></a>Lord Boswell of Aynho:</b> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment 86G which is tabled in my name and I shall touch on some of the wider issues that have been raised by Opposition Members in introducing this debate. Perhaps I should say at the outset that I am a member of the independent Skills Commission, although it is not a formal interest. It has members from different parties as well as a large number of professionals. Some years ago the commission was involved in drawing up a report on independent advice and guidance in which, interestingly, we placed quite a lot of emphasis on reporting the growth in social media and online resources as well as the conventional role of the careers service. I shall come back to that in a moment. I, too, have a strong engagement with apprenticeships. The work preparation for, or the option of, opening up young people's eyes to the world of work is critical and, as I have already adverted to the Committee, I had previous responsibility as a Minister for progression from schools and FE.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000010"></a>First, I acknowledge the huge amount of good done by individual careers teachers and in guidance. That is an important distinction in the Minister's proposals set out in his helpful letter to Members of the Committee, which draw a distinction that is often blurred between education and guidance. While I acknowledge how much has been done in the past-and it is 20 years since I had ministerial responsibility-there have, in my experience, always been patchiness, failures in the system, and a system that is less ideal than the one we would wish for now. In particular, there have always been two problems in schools. The first is the moral hazard of schools seeking to keep hold of pupils who might be much more properly referred to, and have much more successful opportunities within, further education or the private training provider route. Secondly, there is a simple cultural difficulty, which is that some of those schools-particularly if they are teaching conventional and general academic subjects-are not aware of the whole complexity of the issue. That very much centres on, for example, the offer that is now made in apprenticeship frameworks, which are qualitatively different from what was available some years ago.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC324"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC324</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000011"></a>We have been tentatively trying to get this right for a number of years. As a result of some of the concerns that I expressed at the time, we moved towards a system of contractorisation in the 1990s. We then came back to a measure of centralisation, or at least standardisation, through the Connexions service-although that also varied very much in its salience to the target audience-and locally, in my view. Now, my noble friend the Minister, whose initiative I welcome, is providing in this clause a new duty on schools to secure independent guidance.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000012"></a>We were talking in the previous group of amendments about philosophy. Probably the only lesson that I remember from my moral philosophy days-although it is important-is that there is a distinction between saying that something ought to happen and saying that there ought to be a law to ensure that something happens. In this place, we should all be mindful that it is not absolutely necessary to ring-fence and litigate to achieve everything, and that there is an important duty on schools to say, "We need to think about this, obtain independent advice, and make sure that that advice is perceptibly independent".</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000013"></a>It is therefore important that in drawing the distinction we are not subverting the need for schools to provide good-quality careers education or work experience. They should open up the eyes of young people to the opportunities before they make critical decisions. I was once caricatured as saying at the margins of the Skills Commission, "Oh, you are in favour of work experience for five year-olds". It is not quite like that but there is a point at which we need to keep the two worlds of education and of work at least in touch with one another through the whole school career. I am delighted that the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, is nodding. I think we understand that we need to do that, and it is something on which schools need to continue to focus.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000014"></a>We then reach the point of gateway-the moment of serious consideration of the next stage. It is terribly important, for the reasons of moral hazard that I mentioned, that we make it clear that schools are expected to take independent advice and guidance at that point, in the interests of their pupils. That can be supplemented by the electronic media and all the rest of it, but it is a necessary stage.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000015"></a>The spirit of my amendment and my concern is that we are feeling our way in trying to provide a better service in the interests of young people-one that enables them to express their choices. The Government are right in doing that. There have been concerns from the Institute of Career Guidance and other professionals. I can understand why many of them feel very strongly about it, but I would say that the status quo has not been entirely successful and we need to look at a better way of doing this that respects the different roles in education and guidance, and mentoring and development, and moves on to the adult careers service whose introduction is to be welcomed. We need to make  sure that there are no wrong doors or closed doors, and that people are given good signposting through the process. In that connection, the substance of my Amendment 86G would be to say, "Do not subvert the Government's proposals now, but do leave it open and make it a requirement on the Government to report  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC325"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC325</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>back within three years". I do not quite accept the tone of the noble Baroness which suggests that everything is falling apart now, although of course I understand her concerns. I do not believe that that need necessarily be the case at all. If I am wrong about that, I would at least like to feel that Ministers are monitoring this within a finite period of time, so that we may ensure -and I hope this time to achieve-the best possible experience and support for our young people.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000016"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew32"></a><a name="11071383000226"></a>Baroness Brinton:</b> My Lords, I rise to speak to Amendments 86AA, 86CZA and 86DB in my name and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford. I want to start by commenting on the last point made by the noble Lord, Lord Boswell of Aynho. There is a real crisis currently in career advisers' roles as local authorities face some very difficult decisions, and a review even in a year's time will be too late. I therefore support the proposal made earlier by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, that there be a transition plan to make sure that we do not miss it.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000017"></a>Our amendments focus on very specific issues arising out of the new proposals for the careers service. The first is a slightly technical one regarding schools being the responsible body for careers advice. In theory this makes sense. However, the draft legislation removes the right of local authorities to enter the school and to ensure that careers advice is appropriate. This is particular bizarre since local authorities are specifically charged with ensuring that children with special needs and those in PRUs get the advice and support that they require. The same is also true for the National Careers Service, which has no right to check on the quality of careers advice and guidance. I suppose it could do so from a distance, but, frankly, there may be occasions when it would want to look at a specific school. I therefore hope that the Minister will look at this matter again, and will make sure that the bodies charged with responsibility for careers advice nationally, but also those locally with very specific responsibility for the most vulnerable pupils, actually have an opportunity to check what is going on in schools.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000018"></a>I fully support the proposal that advice and guidance must be independent. I am grateful to the Minister for his helpful letter and detailed attachment which has already been referred to. Ambitions for the new careers service are set out well therein. However, the Bill is silent on some key issues which would provide reassurance and guarantee independence and the excellence quality. First, there are no plans for quality assurance to assess whether schools secure that independent, impartial careers advice and guidance. In response to the question on how the Government will monitor the new duty, the note from the Minister says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11071383000184"></a>"Schools should be accountable to the pupils, parents and communities they serve in respect of this duty".</p>

<p><a name="11071383000174"></a>I suspect that most pupils, parents and communities would find the very onerous duty of monitoring quality control somewhat beyond them. I am not sure that it fulfils what we seek to cover in our amendment.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000175"></a>Much has been said about the importance of technology in an earlier amendment. But we are really concerned about face-to-face advice and guidance disappearing from the Bill. Young people often do not  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC326"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC326</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>know the breadth of what is on offer, despite the fact that some excellent web careers advice is available: for example, Careers Box, with little video snips on YouTube and young people talking about their experiences of apprenticeships or their first time in work. The difficulty is that young people often do not know what is out there, and starting to look is very difficult. I can give you an anecdote from the time when I was chair of the Cambridgeshire Learning and Skills Council, where we had a very severe shortage in the construction industry of both plumbers and electricians. If you ask most 12 and 13 year-olds who know they probably want to do something with their hands whether they want to go into construction, the chances are that they will say no, and I am not sure that many school teachers would automatically guide them in that direction.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000019"></a></p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000020"></a>The LSA and FE colleges worked with careers advisers and Connexions to really give young people an opportunity. I am pleased to say that within one year both plumbing and electrical courses were oversubscribed and continued to be because word went back to these young people's peers. If we remove from the loop the very specialist knowledge that careers advisers have, we might well have a problem if advice is not independent and certainly if it is restricted to just the experience that schools have.</p>
<h5><a name="11071383000214"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000021"></a>Thirdly, as others have said, we have to ensure that the advice is truly impartial and independent. I am sorry to say that some schools still pressure young people to stay on to continue with AS-levels even if it is not in their best interests. Again, the Minister's note is helpful in reinforcing the key point about independent advice and guidance but this is so important that  we want to see advisers having to be qualified. That would provide two benefits. First, we will have an assurance about the knowledge and skill base of advisers -they, too, will recognise that-and, as importantly, it will give careers advisers the professional status that they deserve.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000022"></a>Starting careers advice at the age of 14 is too late, once options for Year 11 have been chosen-whether it be the EBacc or other courses. As already commented on, the Year 8 dip is a well-known phenomenon. This country desperately needs more engineers, scientists and mathematicians but, if we look at the subjects chosen at AS-level and A2, those are consistently going down. That needs to be remedied. Starting guidance earlier is important, whether at 13 or even 12 as another amendment suggests.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000023"></a>Again, an illustration of this from my local area is a web advice tool about pathways-which was mentioned before. A 13 or 14 year-old can actually see how choosing a course that they do at 16 might lead on to either an apprenticeship, a vocational or even academic qualification, which might lead them into a profession. I suspect that the point about expecting outcomes from 16 to 18 year-olds to tell us whether a careers service's advice is working well is far too short-sighted. We need something significant earlier on.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000024"></a>Finally, I will speak briefly in support of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Low, on information, advice and guidance for special needs pupils. City  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC327"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC327</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>College Norwich has a special unit for pupils with autism spectrum disorders which has transformed their experience. The guidance is very wide-ranging. It has to be different from the standard one size fits all that we even had under the Connexions service. I met a young man whose experience was that, as he started at 16 at the college, he and his family thought that he would never get a job because of his Asperger's. He was offered some work experience in the college library-simple, repetitive work that absolutely fitted in with his needs. Two years on, he is working full-time there. That is a significant success story. I know that other pupils at City College Norwich have had similar success. We have to accept that we need special provision for pupils with SEN. Thank you.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000025"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew33"></a><a name="11071383000227"></a>Lord Peston:</b> In supporting my noble friend, I start by placing this whole problem in a proper context. A five year-old going for the first time to school this autumn has a life expectancy of 85 or maybe 95 years. The thought that you can really tell them about the world in which they will pursue their working lives is rather difficult. In my younger days as an economist in the economics of education, I wrote a number of papers about relating education and what should be in education to the needs of the economy. I did not realise that they were rubbish at the time that I published them but it was obvious that they were rubbish not many years afterwards. Those days have somewhat gone, although they did not hold me back in my career.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000026"></a>The central point about what careers advice will have to focus on is this long period-most of which, from the point of view of the economy, is difficult or even impossible to forecast. The advice given must really concentrate on that aspect of the matter. That means that it must overwhelmingly be professional.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000027"></a>If I may move into anecdote mode, after I had left the LSE as a lecturer to become a professor, one of my old friends who was still a lecturer said to me, "One of the students has just been to see me. He is thinking of dropping out of his degree because he has a pop group. What advice would you have given him?". I said, "Get your degree first and then possibly think about the pop group". He said, "I gave him the same advice and he more or less told me to drop dead". The student's name was Mick Jagger. That is a very good example of why giving casual, off-the-cuff careers advice to people is not the path to go down. That does not mean that the professionals can get it exactly right, but I am certain that my noble friend is right to emphasise that careers advice requires a very subtle expertise, because it is not easy to get over to people how complicated their whole lives and choice of careers will be.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000028"></a>Another aspect of this has always troubled me. Our young people are marvellous and lots of them are incredibly talented- particularly in the arts. We produce marvellous young actors, musicians, and so on. Our problem is that the demand for such people is-and, I guess, always will be-less than the available supply. One reason why we require not merely experts in our careers service but people with a human touch is that they must explain to people, "If you insist on going down that path-and I do not want to stop you-I  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC328"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC328</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ought to tell you that you will be competing against other people with enormous talent. Are you sure that that is the risky option that you want to take". That only reinforces my noble friend's view that we cannot let amateurs take over the service. Among amateurs, we must include teachers. That includes university teachers, although we are not talking about them at the moment. Essentially, my noble friend is pressing the Minister on the point that we need a commitment to a fully professional careers advice service covering a great range of areas. We must find funds to support that service; we cannot leave it to the school itself.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000029"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew34"></a><a name="11071383000228"></a>Baroness Howe of Idlicote:</b> I am certainly in sympathy with everything that has been said on this subject. It takes me back quite a long way to the Sex Discrimination and Equal Pay Acts, in which education was one of the areas covered. We spent quite a lot of time encouraging teachers in girls' schools to take a more proactive role in opening up ideas of different careers for the girls than was the tradition. I am sad to say that there is still quite a gap there. On the comment made about teachers not being adequate to do that job, it would not be a bad idea as part of their training if, periodically, they had to take a job for a while in the real world to see what are the practices here and now.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000030"></a>In engineering, all these years later, there is a dearth of girls prepared to take on that career. It depends to some extent on the people they see out there in the real world. If not many have made it to the top of their career, are running things and are looked up to by the rest of the engineering world, they are not as likely to go down that route. I hope that we will address that aspect.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000031"></a>I hope that my noble friend Lord Low will soon speak to his amendment. On the responsibility for special educational needs, I entirely agree with him that there is an enormous need to start that process early-incidentally, that is true for practically all girls. It is interesting to note that the Equality and Human Rights Commission makes the point by stating that a quarter of children in primary school want to go on to higher education. Among girls, more than 80 per cent have that aspiration. If they have it already, at least it should be kept going by giving them examples of the many areas where their skills would be needed. There is clearly a role for governors here. They have a role to play in this already, so this is not providing a new one because it is all part of what needs to be made available to pupils. I am certain that parents in the local area would take that view.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000032"></a>One other area I want to stress is that of the role of the universities themselves. Many of them already send their students, voluntarily of course, particularly into schools where the aspiration among pupils to go on to higher education is not high. I am sure that the Government will be pleased to know that that sort of advice does not cost very much, but it is very good practice for the students themselves and helpful to the aspirations of the pupils.</p>

I agree totally with everyone who has spoken that unless careers advice is independent, it is very worrying. I hope that the Minister will consider whether Ofsted should include as part of its assessment of the effectiveness of a school how well it provides careers advice. It would not be an unusual process for Ofsted to get involved in. Although I agree with my noble friend Lord Peston that at the age of five you do not know what you are going to do, in this day and age people start taking an interest at a much younger age.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000034"></a>An area of concern has been raised by a number of employers who I have been talking to, along with a number of colleges. Recently I visited Newcastle College and North Lindsey College in Scunthorpe for Training 2000. What those colleges said was music to my ears. Although some careers advice is okay, a lot is obviously inadequate. But the principal at Newcastle College said that when she was a young girl-it was probably a while ago-no one had ever talked to her at school what it would mean if she went down a certain career path: how much would she earn and what would be her prospects going forward? Perhaps we have stayed away from those questions as well. For me, she made a telling point because, whether we like it or not, they are keen to know if they will have money to spend.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000035"></a>Through Semta I have been working with a careers adviser at BAE Systems, which has a programme in place in which representatives talk to young people about what it means to be an engineer and explain that it is not the dirty job that everyone thinks it is. There is a slide presentation to describe the earning potential at each stage of someone's career progression. Some people might flinch at that, but in the real world of 2011-12, it is absolutely where young people are. It is the kind of information that is not always readily available. You can follow a pathway through looking at sector skills councils, but what is not often linked to it is the thought that, "If I work really hard and progress from this level to that level, what will that mean for me going forward in the sense of my future career?".</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000036"></a>I emphasise, as others have, the funding of this careers advice. A number of people who have supported me in these contributions have given me information. The previous Government put money into careers advice-now, obviously, two departments are dealing with this, with BIS and the Department for Education-but the DfE's financial involvement is down to £7 million. Before, when we were working with Connexions, £200 million was put into this. The current figure will get us some computer-aided stuff and some advice. We can complain like crazy about young people not understanding where they are going and what the advice to them might be, but that does not come cheap. We need to ensure that we have a sound resource underneath all that. For me, having an Ofsted appraisal of this included in how well a school was doing would mean that we had something substantial to measure.</p>

It is the word "school" that interests me. In its broadest sense, and I think that we would all concur with this, it is a community of people focused on the well-being and the best interests of children and pupils. It has been used in a different way in this debate, though, and it is in that different way that I would like to use it, while remaining conscious of the base meaning that lies behind it.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000039"></a>We have been using the word "school" to mean those who govern our schools. Schools are expected to take independent advice, and new legislation is placing a duty on schools to achieve two objectives-just two examples from this very debate. I am interested in that definition of "school", which I think amounts to "governing body and head teacher", who are expected, in the way that things are developing, to achieve more and more than has been done elsewhere until now.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000040"></a>I do not flinch at that. I am a governor and chair of a foundation that runs two schools in the inner city here in London. We try our hardest as governors and head teachers in the area of career development, particularly because we see increasingly that, if we want to achieve excellence in the provision that we offer, partnership with other schools is increasingly going to be the way forward. I do not know how every school can produce an adequate and rich service in this area. In the Borough of Islington, for example, our school operates with others and we try to pool our best efforts and to make careers advice available in a richer and broader way.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000041"></a>In another initiative that perhaps I might report because it is of some interest, our inner city school co-operates with a school in the independent sector, the Leys School in Cambridge, and we cross-fertilise and attend each other's careers festivals. I have to say that the independent sector provides a somewhat narrower focus for the range of careers that it seeks to interest people in, but, for all that, it is richly provided for by those who come and help people in conversation and all the rest of it.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000042"></a>We have not quite got reciprocity to the point where I would like to see it, with people from the independent sector coming to us for careers advice. We are situated on the edge of the City of London, and some quite extraordinary people come to us from City institutions to offer that kind of advice, which people from Cambridge could well benefit from. If we are envisaging that schools, in the way that I am defining them, will provide an adequate service across the land, with every school expected to provide excellence all the time in careers advice, we are just baying for the moon. Those are two initiatives that I can report now.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000043"></a>Throughout my contribution to the discussions of the Bill, I am afraid that I will drone on about the extra expectations that are coming the way of schools-that is, governing bodies and head teachers. During this afternoon's debate alone, the responsibility for  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC331"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC331</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>shaping and focusing the curriculum has fallen to governors and head teachers. I am not saying that they should not do that, but more and more expectations of schools as independent and freestanding bodies are coming our way. There is the curriculum, now there is careers advice. Before we finish our discussion on the Bill, what else will be expected of governors? I am  a governor. I attend, as regularly as I can, refresher courses offered by my local authority. I try to be up-to-date with seminars and other things that stretch your mind about new possibilities offered for all of us. I look around the table. I see some absent places where some very busy people are feeling increasingly deskilled and disempowered to do the tasks expected of them-all voluntarily, without a single penny coming our way. As we go down this path and pass more and more responsibility to the school, under the definition I have offered, we must bear in mind that implementation of these grand ideas will be left to people who will be under greater and greater burdens.</p>

As my amendment has already been referred to several times and spoken to very eloquently by the noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, there is not really a lot for to me to say, but it is obviously correct that I should speak to it.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000047"></a>Before I do that, I want to make a few comments on some of the other amendments in this large group. Some work is required on the section of the Bill dealing with careers guidance to ensure that it is effectively disability-proofed. I know that the Minister is very sympathetic on that matter, so I hope that he will be able to give me reassurances on one or two points.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000048"></a>First, in supporting the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, I seek clarification. When the amendment refers to "professionally qualified" careers practitioners, is it clear that the new professional quality standards include comprehensive training for all careers guidance practitioners on working with disabled young people and adults? It is very important that those working in the field should know about the barriers which disabled people experience, the perceptual barriers that often restrict their career choices.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000049"></a>I also want to be sure that the triennial report for which the noble Lord, Lord Boswell, calls in his amendment would include the effect of the provisions in this section of the Bill on disadvantaged groups of young people, specifically including young people with a learning difficulty and/or disability.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000050"></a>I should like to say a little more about Amendments 86E and 86F in the name of the noble Baronesses, Lady Hughes and Lady Jones, because they deal with a very important issue: the age range during which careers guidance should be provided. Those two amendments would extend the age range through which schools must provide careers guidance from 14 to 16  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC332"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC332</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to 12 to 18. That is particularly necessary for disabled young people, as many will stay in school up to the age of 19, and their most critical decisions usually take place between the ages of 16 and 19.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000051"></a>The Equality and Human Rights Commission is concerned that the age range for careers guidance provided for in the Bill is too narrow. It is particularly concerned that starting careers guidance at 14 is too late adequately to address equality issues associated with subjects or career choices. It is also concerned that the new duty requiring careers guidance to be delivered at key stage 4 only, from 14 to 16, will mean a regression from the current statutory provision that requires a programme of careers education to be delivered for key stages 3 and 4, from 11 to 16.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000052"></a>Young people begin to develop ideas about careers at an early age, and the commission's evidence suggests that starting careers guidance at 14 will present a major barrier to raising aspirations and equipping young people to make future decisions free from stereotyped ideas. Evidence-based reviews and research have consistently called for career-related learning to begin in primary school-as it currently does in Scotland, which is usually ahead of England in educational matters-so that high aspirations and achievement can be encouraged early. A new report from the commission indicates that primary school pupils' aspirations are formed and are higher at a relatively young age. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, has already referred to the evidence from that report which shows that three-quarters of children at primary school want to go into higher education-among girls, this figure is more than 80 per cent. Gender influences begin very early, with boys in primary school interested in sport and girls in performance, hairdressing and nursing. Evidence from the EHRC's triennial review reveals the extent to which particular groups continue to experience a higher level of occupational segregation, particularly related to gender, ethnicity and disability. The commission believes that school careers services have a key role in providing clear, impartial guidance to help inform young people's choices for long-term career-related experiences and progression, free from career-limiting stereotyped ideas.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000053"></a>Before I sit down, I clearly need to refer to my amendment, which would place a duty on the governing bodies and head teachers of schools to provide unlimited face-to-face careers guidance for all young people with a learning difficulty and/or disability, whether or not they have a statement of special educational needs and in both mainstream and specialist settings. The amendment more or less speaks for itself. It is a good idea that the Secretary of State should prescribe standards for careers guidance, in the manner provided for in the new clause tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Hughes and Lady Jones. It is obviously right that we should place on governing bodies and head teachers of schools a duty to comply with the standards set out by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000054"></a>I want to underline two particular points in my new clause. First, on "face-to-face", we know that the careers service will offer web-based and telephone helpline advice for all students, but disabled learners, in particular, require face-to-face support. Secondly,  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC333"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC333</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I have put "unlimited" in the new clause simply to ensure that the duty is to provide as much guidance as is required and that it is not arbitrarily limited to a set amount or quota. I hope very much that this new clause will commend itself to the Minister, as it seeks to impose duties at the local level, where they can most effectively be implemented.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000055"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew40"></a><a name="11071383000234"></a>Baroness Benjamin:</b> My Lords, I rise to support the amendment and to tell noble Lords a little story. Back in 1965, my mother and sister went to see the careers officer and my sister said that she wanted to work at a leading pharmaceutical company. The careers officer said: "I am sorry, Sandra. They don't take coloured people there". My mother said, "I brought my children to England to learn and to be educated, and they have worked hard to do so. Surely that is not possible". The careers officer said, "I am terribly sorry. I can get her a job as a nursery nurse, but not one in a pharmaceutical company". My mother proved her wrong. She got my sister to write for an interview. She got the job and she worked there for 30 years. But sadly, the myth still applies today, and there are many young people who do not believe that they will be accepted in certain places.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000056"></a>It is for that reason that I have set up an initiative called Touching Success. I get successful people to visit young people in schools and invite them into their organisations. This helps to help to inspire these young people to believe in themselves and understand that they can work and will be accepted outside their postcode. This is important because many of them do not often see role models they can identify with. That is why I believe we need experts to engage with young people, especially those from diverse, disadvantaged and lower-income backgrounds who do not believe in themselves. They do not see that they can succeed. Careers advice is essential to helping them understand that they will be accepted and can go beyond where they see themselves. We need experts to help them,  as my mother did with that careers officer way back  in 1965. Believe in yourself and the world is your oyster. Anything is possible. That is why I support this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000057"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew41"></a><a name="11071383000235"></a>Lord Elton:</b> I shall speak, if I may, to Amendments 86E and 86F, about the age at which careers advice is made available. When teaching in a secondary school myself, I remember the agonies associated with seeing how early children had to choose which subjects to specialise in. All I would ask is that the Minister should bear in mind the advisability of having careers advice available early in the year when the first choice of specialism is forced on children.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000058"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew42"></a><a name="11071383000236"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> I want to intervene briefly on this. I should declare an interest as, like the noble Lord, Lord Boswell, a member of the Skills Commission which recommended the development of an all-age careers service. I welcome the fact that the Government have moved in that direction. Currently, two problems arise. One is the rundown of the current  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC334"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC334</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>service, particularly in light of the squeeze on local government finances and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Wall, pointed out, the reduction of money devoted to this service by the Department for Education; £7 million is a miserable sum and far too little. There is also the problem of transition, mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000059"></a>Another problem is the shortage of professionals in this area. Not only have people trained to deliver careers guidance left the profession, but not enough people have been properly trained to provide the new service. One thing that the Government might do to show their earnest in setting up the new service would be to establish a crash course in training careers advisers. They are graduates who do a one-year master's course to qualify and they are desperately needed. As I said, we have the transition problem from 2011-12; let us grab this opportunity and invest in the service as required. That would show the Government's willingness to support it; they would be putting their money where their mouth is, so to speak. I realise that the question of money is very difficult.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000060"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew43"></a><a name="11071383000237"></a>Lord Morris of Handsworth:</b> My Lords, I, too, support the group of amendments so ably moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones. I support them because as a group they correct a number of the anomalies inherent in Clause 27. The amendments are consistent with good learning and with the frequency of provision. Face-to-face opportunity to discuss career needs is of very high value, and the Bill is deficient in this area. We recognise the important contribution that trained and qualified professionals can make.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000061"></a>Of course, when a person chooses to have career advice, it is because they are uncertain of their direction of travel. The whole purpose of it is to examine the options and alternatives available with professionals who are honest, who test one's capability and who advise. There are many people who start out wanting to take an academic route, and who finish up taking the vocational option, or vice versa: that is the benefit of career advice. I fail to see how you will get that interaction and that positive two-way challenge-because it can be a challenge-under what is proposed. What is being proposed is an all-age careers service. I have no difficulty with that as a principle. Indeed, I believe that the Careers Service should and can extend throughout one's working life. That happens in industry, where managers and senior professionals are supported with personal trainers from time-to-time, who provide career advice on whether to continue or change direction. This is why the online provision is deficient, because it does not provide the opportunity for challenge and interaction. As with so many of the education proposals which are emerging, we get a lot of promises but some degree of under-delivery. I see this career provision of the Bill as fitting that area of concern: much is promised, but little substance is delivered when it is tested.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000062"></a>The fact is that the people who will be denied the opportunity for face-to-face career advice are actually the people who may need it most. Not every child has access to the internet; indeed, in some parts of the country, that is for technical reasons, not just real poverty. That is adding to the reality of digital poverty from which some communities suffer disadvantage.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000063"></a>Careers advice is vital. You must get advice, you must challenge the provider and the provider must interact with your good self. What is so worrying about this aspect of the Bill is that, to the best of my knowledge, no one has seen the careers service as broken, deficient or not meeting the needs of students. All my experience is that career advisers care about what they offer and deliver.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000064"></a>The Secretary of State is taking away the duty to provide and replacing it with a duty to provide access. That is a fundamental shift in the culture, the duty and responsibility of the service. There is no way at this or any point that anyone can be certain that what is proposed will lead to better advice. Local authorities, who have that duty, will not be in the driving seat in procuring professionals to provide better advice but merely carrying through what is decreed by governing boards and the school. The bond between school, local authority and governing bodies will be broken when the all-age career advice service online becomes the norm.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000065"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew44"></a><a name="11071383000238"></a>Lord Elton:</b> I know that the Committee is anxious to get to the point. The noble Lord has spent some time demolishing the Government's position, but we are discussing amendments to change that position. I wonder which of those amendments he is supporting.</p>

That was my start point. Within the context of those amendments, the points I have made refer to issues that coincide clearly with the face-to-face provisions and the provisions about experience, and so on. I am clearly satisfied in that respect.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000067"></a>My point here concerns the shift from the duty to provide to the duty merely to give access. There is an opportunity in the amendments for real change to improve the Bill. I support the group of amendments moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000068"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew46"></a><a name="11071383000240"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> My Lords, we know that the most important determinant of success post-16 is attainment pre-16. I start with a simple point to explain why the Government have been focusing on investment in the early years, why we have been seeking to improve the quality of new teachers, why we are bringing in reforms to the curriculum and why we have introduced the pupil premium to help to address the gap in attainment between more affluent and more disadvantaged backgrounds, which is of concern to everyone in the Committee.</p>
<h5><a name="11071383000217"></a>6pm</h5>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000069"></a>Noble Lords know that, across the Bill, we are keen to give schools more freedom to take decisions in the best interests of the pupils, to have less central prescription and focus on inputs and to provide more information about actual results. Our approach to careers guidance is based on the same principles. It draws on the recommendation of the Panel on Fair Access to the Professions, led by the right honourable Alan Milburn, that responsibility for careers guidance should be given  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC336"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC336</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to schools, who know their pupils best. That is why in the core of this clause we are seeking to move responsibility to schools.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000070"></a>I agree with the point made by my noble friend Lord Boswell that young people should know about the full range of academic and vocational options available to them. I know there are concerns that schools might want to steer children towards staying on in the sixth form, for example. That is why we are clear in the clause that careers guidance provided under the duty must include information on all 16-to-18 education training options, including apprenticeships.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000071"></a>A number of noble Lords have raised points about age, which I will now address. Clause 27 places a duty on schools in relation to young people from the start of the academic year in which they turn 14 to the end of the academic year in which they turn 16-year 11. The noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, raised the point, as did my noble friend Lady Brinton and the noble Lord, Lord Low. The case has been put for extending this age range, both downwards to cover younger pupils and upwards to reach students in school sixth forms and colleges. We are going to consult formally on the question of extending the duty down to year 8 and up to young people aged 18 studying in schools and FE institutions. That acknowledges a number of points raised here and during the debate in the other place. We have discussed these plans with the Association of School and College Leaders, the Association of Colleges and the Sixth Form Colleges' Forum, all of which have warmly welcomed the commitment to consult. Subject to the consultation the duty could be extended by regulations from September 2012. However, I sense the mood of the Committee about this point and I will therefore discuss it further with my honourable friend John Hayes, the relevant Minister.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000072"></a>There have been a number of important contributions about the importance of quality. There is a clear difference between the approach of this Government and that of the previous Government. Noble Lords opposite have put the case for retaining statutory safeguards on the way in which schools fulfil their duty to ensure that pupils receive independent guidance. The Government's approach is not to require schools to work with a particular provider of careers guidance but to make sure that they can commission any specialist support that they need from a strong market in which there is choice and diversity, backed up by quality standards. That was one of the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Peston.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000073"></a>The National Careers Service will be subject to a quality standard for publicly funded careers guidance that other providers of careers services will be able to hold, to assure schools and colleges that they are delivering a high quality service. The Careers Profession Alliance is bringing together the main professional bodies for careers for the first time to establish common professional standards, so that everyone signs up to the same code of ethics and to the same standards of practice. The Careers Profession Alliance is committed to a register of careers professionals, and wishes to achieve chartered status for careers professionals over the next three years.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC337"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC337</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000074"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Low, asked whether standards would cover working with disabled people. I will of course raise that matter with the responsible Minister, Mr Hayes.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000075"></a>As has been mentioned, evidence shows that young people receive advice on their futures from many different sources: parents, teachers and obviously careers advisers. Some may prefer to get their support from a helpline or by researching online. A YouGov poll this year showed that nine in 10 young people were comfortable with using the internet to access that kind of advice. However, none of that detracts from the point that qualified professionals have a very important role to play in offering support to pupils that raises their aspirations and guides them on to a successful path. Clearly, many schools will choose to bring in support from qualified advisers at particular stages or to give advice to specific groups of pupils</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000076"></a>The Government's position is that we should trust the professionals to deal appropriately with matters such as access to careers guidance or other support services, including the sorts of partnerships referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Griffiths of Burry Port, without recourse to legislation. We should trust them to make sensible decisions about how pupils receive careers guidance. Noble Lords know that the Government's general position is to try to reduce the burden of guidance from the centre. However, listening to this debate, I recognise that it would be sensible to allow the scope for some short, focused guidance to be issued to schools to support them in fulfilling their new duty. We are retaining the provision in Section 45A of the Education Act 1997 to require schools to have regard to statutory guidance issued in respect of the new careers duty, and we will consider what guidance might be helpful in advance of the new duty being commenced.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000077"></a>Transition is clearly an important point and was raised by a number of noble Lords. The Government have set out their expectations of schools and local authorities and have issued statutory guidance to the latter under Section 68 of the Education and Skills Act 2008. We are keen to encourage the exchange of good practice between local authorities and will shortly be hosting, with the Local Government Association, a summit on shared good practice. Following that summit, we will set out clear milestones to help local authorities plan their own transition arrangements-a point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000078"></a>We have also had important contributions about monitoring the impact of the Government's proposals. We should ensure that we do that when making these changes. My noble friend Lord Boswell will know that a post-legislative review will be conducted in three to five years following enactment. He suggested that we should do it in three years-I think we should aim to do it in three rather than five. The evidence of whether schools are succeeding will be demonstrated through pupil achievement and, crucially, through the data on progression to further learning or employment provided by the destinations measures that we plan to publish and that we are working up.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000079"></a>Noble Lords will know that we want school inspections to focus on overall results rather than specific inputs, but we should look closely at how schools are fulfilling this duty. We intend to ask Ofsted to carry out a thematic review of careers guidance, as recommended to us by the Careers Profession Task Force. If this shows that there are serious issues, I would expect the Government to review the position in the way that my noble friend Lord Boswell suggested. That review should also look at the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Low.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000080"></a>Overall, the arrangements for careers guidance that the Government propose are based on trusting professionals and freeing schools from bureaucracy, trying to give them the opportunity to secure the specialist support they need from the market, which is characterised by choice and diversity of provision. Points have been raised about age, which we will reflect upon, about reporting and about quality. I hope that noble Lords will recognise that we are taking those steps and that the underlying point of moving responsibility to schools, originally recommended to the Government in reports and which has been widely welcomed, will help take that forward. On the basis of that further information, I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000081"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew47"></a><a name="11071383000241"></a>Baroness Jones of Whitchurch:</b> My Lords, we have had a very good debate on this issue. If anyone was in any doubt before we started about the complexities of children's lives and the choices that confront them, some of the examples that we have heard from around the Room will certainly have helped to open our eyes to just how difficult it is to be a child in school today, facing, as my noble friend rightly said, 85 years of career choices that they have to make. People say-this is a well known statistic these days-that you can now face three different careers in your lifetime. It used to be that you went into one job and that was your job for life, but now people often change careers two or three times during the course of their life.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000082"></a>The choices for young people facing their life ahead are complicated and require specialist knowledge. To give a quick example of that in terms of giving careers advice, wearing one of my other hats, young people who qualify with a degree in film studies think that they are all going to go off to be film directors, but fewer than 1 per cent of people with a degree in film studies ever get a job in that sector. A statistic said that about 34 per cent of those young people end up working in the retail sector. All the factors that have been mentioned today underline how important it is that we get this right.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000083"></a>The Minister has said that there will be a professional service. We understand that we may have a professional service, but the people who are providing the actual advice, online or face-to-face, would not have to be qualified under the Government's scheme. Our point is that young people's future lives are so important that these people should have some sort of qualification.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000084"></a>I underline that again. My noble friend Lord Layard has not commented on this-I am sure that he does not like people constantly making reference to him as being the happiness tsar-but if people at this age get  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC339"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC339</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this wrong then it is not just about them making the wrong career choice; it has an effect on their health and their mental health. The consequences of their making wrong choices are real and serious, and that underlines the need for people to be qualified before they are let loose on children in schools.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para122"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000085"></a>At the heart of our dilemma here is that the Government want to be enabling and we want to lay down duties on schools and rights for pupils. There is not so much of a difference between us, though; the Government have already said that there are some duties on schools regarding what they will provide. The Bill says that there will be duties for the service to be independent, which I think we would all agree with; to be based in schools, which I think is the right place to focus careers guidance; and to have a mix of academic and vocational provision, and a number of voices around the Committee have echoed the importance of both academic and vocational choices.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000086"></a>All we are attempting to do is add a few more duties, and the principle that we have already established is a way of going forward. Those duties include specifying the frequency of the careers advice, looking at a wider age range at which children can access careers advice and the whole issue of people being professionally qualified. We have established that there will be some duties, and we want more. I hope that the Minister will see that we are not so far apart in all this.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para124"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000087"></a>I am pleased that the Minister said that he will take the issue of the age range away and look at it further. We look forward to hearing about the outcome of that in more detail. I think that I understood him to say that he would be bringing forward some more short-notice guidance. Perhaps he could specify whether that will be available to us before Report, at least in draft form, so that we might know where we stand on that.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para125"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000088"></a>I like to feel that we are moving closer together on these issues, but there remains the issue of what happens in the transition. The noble Lord, Lord Boswell, said that he was not convinced there was a crisis, but I hope that he has heard some of the voices around the table saying that it is perhaps more of a crisis than he might have identified. Our understanding is that hundreds, if not thousands, of people who currently have training qualifications in careers advice are being made redundant around the country, so we are losing those skills and that expertise. It seems pretty strange to set up a new structure that starts from scratch when everyone has been scattered to the four winds, so to speak, with all the knowledge and experience that they retained beforehand. We need to look again at the transition and what else we can do to make it a smooth and well resourced one.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000089"></a>We have had a good debate. We would welcome some further discussions on this, but in the mean time I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><i><a name="11071383000286"></a>Debate on whether Clause 28 should stand part of the Bill<I></I>.</i></p>

<p><a name="11071383000091"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew48"></a><a name="11071383000242"></a>Baroness Wall of New Barnet:</b> My Lords, I will speak to the debate on whether this clause should stand part of the Bill on behalf of my noble friend Lord Knight, who regrettably has been detained outside London. He sends his apologies. I shall be brief. First, I shall explain the background of diplomas from  the point of view of my personal experience with the engineering diploma. No one would dispute that it has been exceedingly successful. The drive for diplomas came from employers who, certainly in the engineering industry, were keen to have the option that the diploma provided. When we talked about careers advice earlier, we touched on the fact that teachers tend to steer pupils down the academic rather than the vocational route. The diploma provided an answer to that because it offered the option to go either way and cross over at various different stages.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000092"></a>My question is this: why do the Government feel the need to repeal the entitlement to these diplomas? It would be disingenuous not to say that, so far as the engineering diploma was concerned, we ran into some issues around what it might mean for other areas of the curriculum, in particular for A-levels. However, employer demand overall-I think it is the right word to use-was very encouraging, and certainly the sector skills councils, which were heavily involved in the diplomas, approached them with great enthusiasm. Why are they being withdrawn when they were proving to be hugely beneficial and provided one of the answers to the many questions raised in the debate on the provisions of Clause 27?</p>

<p><a name="11071383000093"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew49"></a><a name="11071383000243"></a>Baroness Hughes of Stretford:</b> I rise briefly to support my noble friend. We have heard a lot from the Minister and his noble friend about burdens and requirements on schools, but as I am sure he knows, the entitlement was not designed so that every school had to provide the whole range of diplomas. Within an area, however, a young individual was able to access all of them. I am looking at this from the other end of the kaleidoscope, if you like; it was not a burden on schools but an entitlement for a young person. They could study for a diploma somewhere accessible in their local area. Therefore I agree with my noble friend that it seems perverse and unnecessary of the Government to repeal this entitlement.

<p><a name="11071383000094"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew50"></a><a name="11071383000244"></a>Baroness Garden of Frognal:</b> Clause 28 is the first of two clauses related to the diploma entitlement. This clause removes the duty on local authorities in England to secure the diploma entitlement for 16 to 18 year-olds. The provisions being amended are not yet in force.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para128"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000095"></a>High-quality vocational education, just as much as academic education, is crucial to improving England's educational performance. In that, I am in total agreement with the noble Baronesses, Lady Wall and Lady Hughes. That is why my right honourable friend the Secretary of State asked Professor Alison Wolf to carry out her review of vocational qualifications. Professor Wolf published her report on 3 March. In it, she found some areas of great strength. Places on the best apprenticeships, such as those provided by Network Rail or Rolls-Royce, are highly regarded by employers and more oversubscribed than the most desirable course at the best university. There are excellent qualifications available, providing clear routes for progression into full-time employment or further study in higher education. However, these examples of excellence do not add up to an excellent system and are too often provided in spite of rather than because of the structures that Government have created. The diploma entitlement is one such example where a focus on structure and process has been taken too far.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para129"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000096"></a>As I have said, the provisions being amended here are not yet in force. Were they to be implemented as originally intended, they would place a duty on every local authority to secure access for 16 to 18 year-olds to all 14 diploma subjects at all levels, regardless of local needs or any other educational priorities. I reassure noble Lords that this clause does not remove diplomas or any of their constituent qualifications. Nor does it prevent providers of education to 16 to 18 year-olds from offering diplomas if they so wish. I entirely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Wall, that the diploma in engineering has been the outstanding success of this particular qualification. We cannot say the same about the rest of the range of diplomas that were on offer.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para130"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000097"></a>The Government believe that schools and colleges should not be obliged to offer every diploma. They should be free to decide which qualifications to teach, according to the needs and aspirations of their students. Indeed, the Association of Colleges has said that it has always been uncertain about the diploma entitlement and that it has,</p>
<ul><a name="11071383000206"></a>"always wanted greater freedom for colleges to offer courses and qualifications which best meet the needs of young people".</ul>
<p><a name="11071383000176"></a>The Association of School and College Leaders has welcomed the removal of the diploma entitlement, saying that,</p>
<ul><a name="11071383000207"></a>"it was not practical to offer all lines to all students".</ul>
<p><a name="11071383000177"></a>Edge, which has done so much to promote vocational education, has said that,</p>
<ul><a name="11071383000208"></a>"it was always going to be difficult to deliver the entitlement, especially in rural areas".</ul>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000098"></a>Following Professor Wolf's review of vocational education, we are embarking on a substantial programme of reforms. We have already confirmed that some valued vocational qualifications will be funded for teaching in September 2011. We have announced that industry professionals and FE lecturers will be allowed to teach in schools. We have clarified that schools and colleges are free to offer any vocational qualification offered by a regulated awarding organisation. By removing the diploma entitlement, we are ensuring that schools and colleges are free to consider which qualifications-academic or vocational-meet the real needs of their students, enabling them to progress into further study or a job. I repeat: this clause does not remove any diplomas or other vocational option for young people. It removes a bureaucratic and burdensome requirement on local authorities, schools and colleges.</p>

Nevertheless, I think a concern remains that the opportunity will be removed if it is not widespread. Regarding the comments of Professor Wolf, she made those at the very early stages. After looking at the evidence she has in fact since said that diplomas do provide opportunities for young people to take either the academic or vocational route without feeling discriminated against in any way, and that they give equality of credence to each.</p>

They are copied, with some small changes, from three clauses in the Children Schools and Families Bill 2010, which were dropped from the Bill before it became an Act. As I said when the deletion was debated on the 7 April 2010, these clauses would have,</p>
<ul><a name="11071383000209"></a>"given children the high quality PSHE for which they have long asked, which they deserve and to which they have a right under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child".-[<I>Official Report, </I>7/4/10; col. 1578.]</ul>
<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para132"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000102"></a>Noble Lords may recall the great distress of many of us when these provisions were dropped. They had been well thought out, had been consulted upon widely and had broad support. After they had been deleted from the Bill, a number of organisations, including the Youth Parliament, signed a statement making it clear that they would not give up the fight. Many of your Lordships, including the noble Baronesses, Lady Gould and Lady Massey, vowed to do the same on behalf of young people. This is not a party matter. It is a matter of strong principle and belief and I approach it in that spirit.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC344"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC344</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para133"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000103"></a>These amendments make PSHE part of the foundation curriculum in all schools receiving funding from the state, including the rapidly increasing number of academies, for children throughout the age range. The courses must adhere to certain important principles; that is, the information must be accurate and balanced, appropriate to the age, religion and cultural background of the children, promote equality, accept diversity and emphasise the importance of rights and responsibilities. Who could argue with that? These matters can be taught in a way that reflects the school's religious character. Guidance will secure that children learn about the nature of various adult relationships and their role in the bringing up of children, where we know that stable relationships are important.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para134"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000104"></a>In these amendments I have made two changes from the original, which I hope will have the effect of attracting wider support for the measure in this revised form. I have removed the clause that would have removed the parent's right to withdraw their child. Frankly, not many parents use it and I do not see why that should get in the way of the majority of children getting better PSHE education. The other thing I have done is to take four elements of the curriculum and make them voluntary for children at Key Stage 1. They are drugs, alcohol and tobacco education, sex and relationship education, personal finance education and careers and business education. Many schools will feel they want to include these elements, in an age-appropriate way, for younger children, and they are free to do that. However, I feel we can leave that to their judgment.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para135"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000105"></a>The reason I wish to make PSHE compulsory in all schools is to ensure that all children receive it and to give parents more confidence in it by improving the quality of delivery. This would be done by improving teacher training, assessment and inspection if the subject was taken more seriously by schools and by Ofsted. Many children tell us that the quality of the PSHE they receive is poor and that it does not equip them for their future lives. A survey of 800 young people carried out by the National Children's Bureau found that nearly half felt they had not learnt all they needed to know about HIV. This can be life saving knowledge and must be taught in a social context, not just teaching the bare scientific facts in a biology lesson. I understand that the report on this matter by the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, on this matter, to be published shortly, will strongly support my position on this.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para136"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000106"></a>I strongly believe that the job of schools is to help young people become life-ready, not just job-ready or higher education-ready. Children may not go on to get first-class degrees but they will all have families, relationships, friends, personal finances, responsibility for their own health and safety, personal money and jobs. Good PSHE supports all these things. Just as importantly, PSHE also supports academic learning and develops the capabilities that young people need to flourish in life and in work. Once they leave school, no one else will do this, so it is vital.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para137"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000107"></a>There are other reasons. Children, young people and their parents want PSHE; many surveys have shown that. It promotes their health, well-being and personal safety. Goodness knows, they live in a world where safety is often threatened and there are many

PSHE also helps the school to promote the social, moral, cultural and spiritual development of its pupils and links up well with RE, as well as with arts and cultural education.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para138"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000108"></a>I see that the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, tries to achieve much the same thing, and I congratulate her on her tenacity in this regard. The amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, also has merit but the matters about which she is concerned could easily be taught in the health part of PSHE.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para139"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000109"></a>The White Paper that preceded the Bill recognised that children can benefit enormously from high-quality PSHE. That was a most welcome statement. Since then, the Government have announced an independent review of the curriculum where PSHE is not included in the remit of the expert panel. I would like to ask the Minister how the Secretary of State would respond if the expert panel reported that they felt that PSHE should be part of the national curriculum. Would he accept its recommendation? It is a widely held view among teachers that all children should receive this education, and many members of the expert panel are teachers.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para140"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000110"></a>At the same time, the Government have announced an internal review of PSHE-or at least I believe they will soon. Why have these two reviews been separated? Have decisions already been made about the fate of PSHE? In the light of the enormous body of opinion that PSHE is a vital element of the education of every child, why have the Government not seen fit to include it in the remit of their independent advisers? When the internal review concludes, as it most certainly will, that the quality of PSHE is terribly patchy and many children are being let down, what do the Government plan to do about it? Will they grasp the nettle and put this subject where it belongs, in the core compulsory part of the curriculum, and fulfil the right of every child? I beg to move.</p>

I agree that this is not a single-party, but an all-party, issue and always has been. All parties have spoken on this, including from the Bishops' Bench, with some support for her amendment. My Amendment 98, as the noble Baroness says, is fairly similar, but I want to tweak it a bit. I will say why in a minute.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para141"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000112"></a>Like the noble Baroness, I ask the Minister yet again about the details of the internal review. With the delay of the review we are sending the message to teachers, parents and pupils that this is not important. The review was announced eight months ago yet we still do not know what is happening with it. We ought to know.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para142"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000113"></a>We know enough about the subject area of PSHE to be able to do a quick review of it. We should not be denying young people access to the information and skills that they need to be human beings and to have knowledge about their own bodies. Supported by information and skills, they will learn about this.</p>

Thank you.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para144"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000120"></a>We shall resume with the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, on Amendment 88.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000121"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew56"></a><a name="11071383000254"></a>Baroness Massey of Darwen:</b> I will refrain from testing noble Lords on what I said before the Division. I was merely agreeing with my noble friend-she is my friend, but not in that sense-the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, in her amendments. I will say simply that parents and pupils support PSHE and that it is for the benefit of young people.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para145"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000122"></a>Sometimes schools provide the only source of information for young people on these issues. Parents may feel that they cannot provide it and, indeed, welcome the fact that someone else is giving their children this information. There will be more on that in a minute. Times change and the world has become increasingly complex. Years ago, who could have predicted a pandemic on the scale of HIV infection? I salute  the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, on his courage and determination in raising awareness of the issue-in the face of much opposition at the time-and on his continued support through his committee. I see that awareness of HIV has now dropped and that young people between the ages of 16 and 24 make up 12 per cent of all new diagnoses. That is worrying.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para146"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000123"></a>We should also be concerned about other health issues such as teenage pregnancy, obesity, drugs, smoking, alcohol use and so on. I have read that we are in danger of facing an obesity pandemic, largely due to inappropriate diet. But these health issues are only part of the story. As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, PSHE aims to foster good relationships with friends, parents and others. It aims to increase self-awareness and self-respect through an exploration of values and aspirations. It is known that young people who have good relationships along with a strong set of

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para147"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000124"></a>Teaching has come a long way. I will not regale the Minister again with the full story of my own sex education when we-the girls, that is-had to knit a uterus. I would say only that it put me off knitting. I remember-</p>

I just wanted to say that the noble Baroness did tell me the story about the knitted uterus when we completed the Academies Bill. The Bill team then kindly presented me with a knitted uterus in honour of the noble Baroness.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000126"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew58"></a><a name="11071383000256"></a>Baroness Massey of Darwen:</b> It was not as good as mine. I remember a story told by a very humorous Roman Catholic nun. She was on a health education course with me some years ago. She said that she had been told to say that a girl should, when she danced with a boy, have the width of a telephone directory between them and that, if she got into difficulty, she should yell, "Stop it! I am a young Ursuline". Incidentally, some excellent PSHE education takes place in Catholic schools, to which I shall come in a minute.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para148"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000127"></a>So I say yes to the amendments, but I want some modification. The notion of what I call the spiral curriculum gets lost in the amendments. By spiral curriculum, I mean teaching an issue very simply when a child is young and going into more detail as the child matures. Young children are able to grasp what foods are good for them and which are not without going into detail of nutritional bases and chemical formulae. Young children can explore the notion of friendships and good, respectful relationships without details of sex-they would not grasp them anyway, and that would be inappropriate teaching.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para149"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000128"></a>I remember the story of a little boy asking his mother where he came from. She thought, "Right, this is the teaching moment", and went into stories about daddy's seeds and mummy's seeds meeting. After a while, the little boy said, "Yes, but did I come from Birmingham or Luton?". When I was teaching my two year-old grandson to play cricket, I did not toss a Michael Holding fast ball at him first thing: they were gentle lobs. Then they got faster. My point is that I would not exclude any stage of education from certain teaching; I would make the teaching suitable to the child and then build on what had been learnt. That is why a curriculum of PSHE is necessary-just like in maths or English-which builds on knowledge and skills that children learn gradually.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para150"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000129"></a>The other area where I have some difficulty with the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, is in paragraphs (7) to (11) concerning faith schools and SRE. Although faith schools will still be required to teach SRE, they are exempted from teaching it in a balanced way which promotes equity and diversity. The amendment would give faith schools the right to allow the tenets of religion to override the principles that must guide the teaching of SRE in other maintained schools. That could lead to narrower teaching. The

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para151"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000130"></a>To return to Roman Catholic nuns, I have talked to many of them on courses. They say, "We can be very clear about our boundaries in what we teach in personal, social and health education. It does not mean that we cannot talk about contraception, abortion, homosexuality and what they mean. It means that we must give the perspective of our faith on those issues". How sensible. That is all I am looking for.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para152"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000131"></a>We all have a particular perspective on all sorts of issues. We can make that perspective clear to young people. However, they should be given full and comprehensive education. I am a humanist, but I believe that young people should be taught about different faiths and cultures. Otherwise, we are in the dangerous territory of indoctrination-a word disliked by my noble friend Lord McAvoy. Indoctrination is not education. Education seeks to bring out the best in young people.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para153"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000132"></a>I say to the Minister: please say yes to the principle of having PSHE as a statutory right for all pupils of whatever age or faith. Let us get the appropriate curriculum and teaching sorted out.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000133"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew59"></a><a name="11071383000257"></a>Lord McAvoy:</b> Can my noble friend give us a definition of what she considers to be education and what she considers to be indoctrination?</p>

If the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, were here, she would give the example of a particular school where they learned the Koran for about 80 per cent of the curriculum, and very little else. I think that is indoctrination. Education should consider all aspects of a particular faith, of other faiths, of personal, social and health education, without restriction. Trying to persuade young people to adhere to a particular thing, which they may not be ready to adhere to anyway, may influence them in unfortunate ways.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000135"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew61"></a><a name="11071383000260"></a>Lord McAvoy:</b> I am grateful to my noble friend for that clarification. I am sure she is fed up with me, but perhaps I could test her patience further. She considers indoctrination to be a set percentage of the curriculum by a Catholic school, for instance. Does she not accept that parents choose to send their children to Catholic schools or a particular faith school? I cannot grasp why people making legislation should restrict people's choices. People are not dragged into these faith schools. People choose to send their children to these faith schools.</p>

Earlier I gave the example of a Roman Catholic school where the nuns say they will teach in a broad sense but within the ethos of their own faith. That is fine by me.</p>

Amendment 85B is very good and extremely well intentioned. The only problem I have is with its wording. Subsection (7) outlines the principles of PSHE, which of course are absolutely admirable, that it "endeavours to promote equality", of course; "encourages acceptance of diversity", of course; and,</p>
<ul><a name="11071383000210"></a>"emphasises the importance of both rights and responsibilities".</ul>
<p><a name="11071383000178"></a>Of course we all agree with that; it is absolutely right. However, subsection (8) says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11071383000203"></a>"Subsections (4) to (7) are not to be read as preventing the governing body or head teacher of a school within subsection (9)"-</p>

<p><a name="11071383000179"></a>that is, schools with a religious character,</p>
<ul><a name="11071383000211"></a>"from causing or allowing PSHE to be taught in a way that reflects the school's religious character".</ul>
<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para154"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000138"></a>That gives me a problem because subsection (7) could lead us into difficulty when it says, "endeavours to promote equality". We are all aware that there are religions that, if you look at their precepts, are in dispute with the equality law that we have, and we want all citizens of this country to accept the rights that the equality law gives them. That sort of wording might lead us into some difficulty.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para155"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000139"></a>I do not have the same problem with Amendment 98, which has just been spoken to by my noble friend Lady Massey. Frankly, I would prefer that wording and that amendment to the wording in the amendment that is presently before us. However, I support the feeling behind both amendments, I think that it is right, and I congratulate both noble Baronesses for their commitment to these ideas, which I wholeheartedly support.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000140"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew64"></a><a name="11071383000263"></a>Lord Layard:</b> My Lords, I congratulate the proposers of these amendments because they deal with one of the central purposes of education. In surveys, when parents are asked what they most want for their children in school, they say they most want children to be happy and to learn how to live. Secondly, they say they want them to learn their subjects. The tragic situation is that many people, including some senior politicians, think that these two objectives are in contradiction to and competition with each other. Of course, the opposite is true. These objectives are mutually reinforcing and this is really the essence of the point that needs to be made today. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, referred to it and I want to give you a bit of evidence that by the teaching of PSHE we serve two objectives: teaching children how to manage their lives but also enabling them, through being happier and more balanced, to learn their subjects better.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para156"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000141"></a>Here is one piece of interesting evidence. Some 207 programmes in imparting life skills that were developed mainly in the United States were surveyed in terms of their effects on young people. Each programme covered  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC350"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC350</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a part of the PSHE curriculum that has been outlined in the amendment and was rigorously evaluated in comparison with a control group. From the so-called meta-analysis, one obtains the average effect of all these programmes on the well-being of the pupils and their academic achievements. Here is the effect on  the emotional well-being and balance of the child: the average programme lifted the average child by 11 percentile points-11 places in the ranking in which children are ranked from 0 to 100-and that represents a substantial effect. Guess what the effect on academic performance was. It was also 11 percentile points. So it is not a question of either life skills or academic attainment, it is both. If noble Lords are interested in these programmes, information on them can be found on a wonderful website, casel.org. The other point that emerges from these surveys is that the better of the 207 programmes have much larger effects.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para157"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000142"></a>The future of PSHE, particularly in secondary schools, has to involve a much greater use of such programmes because it is an extraordinarily difficult subject to teach. We have not talked about that very much but most people, if thrown in at the deep end, would have a lot of difficulty in teaching most of these subjects. We need much more serious teacher training in these areas and much better materials. There is some progress in this country in this area, but very little. To achieve progress in the quality of the teaching, these subjects must be firmly established in the curriculum. That is what these amendments are about. I welcome them and hope that the Government will take them seriously.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000143"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0001.htm_spnew65"></a><a name="11071383000264"></a>Baroness Tyler of Enfield:</b> My Lords, I should like to speak in support of these amendments and to talk briefly about the critical importance of relationship education within the PSHE curriculum and its links to pupils' wider emotional health and well-being, which we have just heard about. Before doing so, I should declare an interest as chief executive of the charity Relate, which delivers relationship education to children in all four key stages in about 50 primary and secondary schools across the country.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para158"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000144"></a>I often feel that I am on a personal mission to try to change the terminology in this debate to "relationships" -in capitals-and sex education, rather than the other way around, which very much puts the cart before the horse in a rather unhelpful way. That is because when sex education and relationships education are coupled together in that order, the debate too often gets bogged down and polarised, and focuses almost solely on parents' right to withdraw their children from sex education. We should be focusing on children's emotional health and well-being.</p>

This is crucial because, sadly, too many children see few examples of good relationships in their home life and, without help, are likely to repeat these patterns in their own relationships. It is also critical that young people understand, for

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para160"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000146"></a>As we have heard today, survey evidence shows that young people want opportunities to discuss things that feel relevant to their lives, like their emotions, relationships and their sex lives or sexual health. In addition, research from the Sex Education Forum showed that 84 per cent of parents see both school and home as the main source of sex and relationships education and that both should be involved. To me, this is the nub of the matter. With regard to school or the home it is never a question of either/or but very much both/and.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000147"></a>I wish I had time to tell the Committee about the various projects that we are involved with across the country, working with boys, girls, teachers and parents, trying to provide high quality information about both relationships and sex. We are helping to support young people in making important personal choices within a framework that emphasises their values. At the end of these projects, the feedback that we get from young people is often that they feel much more confident and less embarrassed talking about relationships and sex. We also get positive feedback from parents and teachers.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para162"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000148"></a>There are wider reasons for supporting the universal teaching of relationships education in schools, which is related to the duty on schools to promote children's well-being, and I am delighted to see that that remains firmly in place. As we have heard, there is a growing body of evidence that good emotional well-being is strongly associated with good educational attainment and improved employment prospects; indeed, there is some evidence that it can increase earnings potential. The reverse is true as well. From our work at Relate providing one-to-one counselling to around 15,000 children in some 650 schools across the country, we see at first hand how problems with relationships at home mean that children are often unable to learn.</p>

I remind the committee that the final report of the Teenage Pregnancy Independent Advisory Group warned that teenage pregnancy will rise again unless there is better provision of sex and relationships education. It put a particular emphasis on giving young people the knowledge and life skills to resist peer, partner and media pressures, and that is very important. My lasting memory in this area is of talking to one of our expert trainers delivering sex and relationships education to young people in school who told me, and I quote this word for word:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11071383000204"></a>"The problem is that they know everything about sex and nothing about relationships".</p>

<p><a name="11071383000180"></a>We have a chance through this amendment to ensure that all young people learn about the importance of relationships now and in the future.</p>

<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC352"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC352</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para164"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000151"></a>First, though, I shall address a small point just raised about relationships. In new Section 85B(1)(b), perhaps we should also insert, "bereavement reactions in grief and loss". There are some fantastic programmes that help children prepare for the inevitability of experiencing bereavement, grief and loss, which are tailored for different ages. We know that by the time children leave school, 10 per cent of them are going to be seriously bereaved, but we are just ignoring that when we talk about other aspects of development. Those children do very badly if they do not understand their emotions.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para165"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000152"></a>My amendment is focused on community resuscitation. In the UK we have over 30,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests a year, and currently fewer than 10 per cent of victims survive to leave hospital. That means that we have 27,000 sudden deaths in the community. To put that in perspective, about 12,000 women a year die of breast cancer, 3,000 people die on the roads and 270 people die from knife crime. The number of sudden cardiac arrest deaths out there is huge. It takes around five to 10 minutes for an emergency ambulance to reach someone and for every minute that passes in cardiac arrest the chance of successful defibrillation decreases by 10 per cent, so time is of the essence. Immediately administrated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which I am now going to call CPR because it is much shorter, will prolong the time that the patient remains shockable and therefore can be put back into a normal rhythm. It increases the chance of survival by a factor of around three. If there is a defibrillator nearby, survival rates of up to 50 per cent from a baseline of under 10 per cent have been reported.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para166"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000153"></a>Other parts of the world have already addressed this. It is part of the curriculum in Norway, Denmark and France. The American Heart Association has advised that no pupil should graduate from secondary school without being proficient in CPR, not just learning it. In Seattle, schools have taught CPR in PE lessons for over 30 years, so now half of the population of Seattle and the surrounding area are trained. In 2009 the survival rate for witnessed cardiac arrests was 46 per cent, while ours is under 10 per cent. The difference is dramatic.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0001.htm_para167"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000154"></a>Here in the UK, the British Heart Foundation has put Heartstart into over 2,700 schools, 700 of which are secondary schools or colleges. It trains thousands of children every year. British Red Cross and St John Ambulance also run training schemes, but the trouble is that the provision is patchy. There are 3.6 million children in secondary education in England, but only around 14 per cent have any training in CPR provided by one of these organisations. It is estimated that around 3 million secondary school pupils are not trained, even though the voluntary organisations are very ready to offer this training. By contrast, a poll taken by the British Heart Foundation at the beginning of this year found that 86 per cent of teachers, 70 per cent of parents and 78 per cent of children want to be trained. There is no resistance anywhere; it is a question of making the link. The campaign has wide medical, nursing and teaching support, as well as from the charities that deal with bereavement following cardiac death.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000155"></a>Training and support for teachers would enable them to deliver emergency life support. Currently, the British Heart Foundation spends around £800,000 a year on teaching resources, including mannequins, school packs, teacher supply cover and so on. It is estimated that it will be necessary to increase the provision of community resuscitation development officers, who are linked with the 12 ambulance trusts in England, by around five people to ensure that every child in every school is taught. With additional resources, the models could be successfully applied across all schools. There are over 3,000 local authority maintained secondary schools in England. The amendment aims to amend Section 84 of the Education Act 2002 so that this training becomes a community requirement at the first, second and third key stages.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000156"></a>I know that the Government can be much more prescriptive with the curriculum for maintained schools and I hope that they might consider adopting this training because that will influence the academies to take it up. However, I am well aware that the Government cannot be prescriptive for academies. Sadly, this is not part of PSHE at the moment. First aid training in the curriculum covers some parts of emergency life support but not emergency CPR, which is what can save lives. We could go from 27,000 sudden deaths in the community to approximately half that number if we spent a few hours on training all children in CPR. It has been estimated that the training takes only around four hours. It would mean that when they come across someone who has collapsed and is effectively dead on the street, they will know what to do.</p>

The Government have made it absolutely clear that they have an agenda about well-being, particularly about well-being for children. They have also made it clear that, when findings show that children in our country are less happy than in other parts of Europe, they want to do something about improving that position. They, like the previous Government, have also undertaken that elements of PSHE are very important in the curriculum. With due humility, the Minister might do well to go away with those people who have long lists of amendments and talk them through. I do not think that the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Massey, are likely to give up. We will get somewhere that way.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000159"></a>Many of the arguments I would have made have now already have been made but I intervened to put one argument particularly for a group of children who, without this education, will not have any benefit in these areas-that is, very poor and vulnerable children who come from some of the deepest, darkest estates in our country and with whom I spend quite a lot of

These children are subject to relationship breakdown or find themselves in care. They do not get this kind of education in their homes. People will try and give it in residential care-foster carers will give it-but they will have interrupted relationships and care. They will not have that kind of secure relationship and understanding that many other children will have. It is for this group of children that I plead. They are children who are in conflict.</p>

<p><a name="11071383000160"></a>As the chair of the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, I work with a young people's board. I do not give many anecdotes when speaking in Committee but those children often talk about teachers in school giving them some of the elements that help them hold themselves together through extraordinarily conflicted experiences in their homes. Teachers are at this moment attempting to give this kind of education. It needs space, skill and structure. I cannot understand why we are at this point in the debate because this is what the Government want as well.</p>

In the fascinating debate on Monday, the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland of Houndwood, was right to advocate,</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000162"></a>In the same debate on Amendment 83, the noble Lord, Lord Knight, who unfortunately is not in his place and we know why, expressed the wish that children would get up in the morning wanting to go to school. The aim should be good teaching on core subjects that encourages all pupils to feel involved and indeed excited by a love of learning and increasing their knowledge. Maths would even bring alive the dreary subject of economics-I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, is no longer with us. History could be expanded to show how social structures evolve, informing pupils on how to react to differing situations. What better way to develop good communication skills than to learn lessons from the best communicators of the past by studying works of the great poets, authors and orators?</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000163"></a>However, Amendments 88, 89, 90 and 98 would take us in a completely different direction. As we have heard, their effect would be to expand the curriculum to introduce statutory personal, social, health and economic education for all maintained schools. As we have already heard this evening from the noble Lord, Lord Layard, PSHE is extremely difficult to teach. Now we have a situation: how can we have a slimmed-down curriculum and yet put in it more and more issues that are extremely difficult to teach?</p>

There is no denying that if we want good academic results in our schools we have to give a focus to relationships education and young people feeling comfortable with themselves and their own learning abilities.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000166"></a>My greatest objection is to Amendment 98. If agreed, Amendment 98 would extend sex education to all children from five years of age upwards. I find this deeply concerning and even abhorrent. Many of us were very thankful that the previous Government ran out of time for similar plans before last year's election. Among other measures, detailed sex education lessons for children as young as five were proposed.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, is saying they were not and I will leave her to deal with that. What I would like to say-and I did say earlier-is that the curriculum should be appropriate to the age and stage of the child. I gave the example of not lobbing cricket balls fast at my two year-old grandson, but to start slowly. I should not mention the press but this popular newspaper thing about sex education at five is quite inaccurate. Teachers do not do this. Teachers talk about relationships and friendships at five, they do not talk about HIV/AIDS and all the rest of that. It is simply not true.</p>

This amendment would repeal that statutory requirement. In other words, if you are saying that you want sex education for five to seven year-olds to stay exactly as it is, I have no problem.</p>

We live in a nation of many cultures and several faiths. I declare an interest as a vice president of the British Humanist Association. These many cultures and several faiths are a huge asset for our culture, understanding of the world, trade, regeneration and enterprise-lots of things-but to realise these assets we need to be at ease with our fellow citizens, to understand their culture and their faith, especially when we do not share it. If we do not have this opportunity in school, we risk losing out culturally and economically but, almost more importantly, we risk increasing bigotry and prejudice.</p>

None the less, I accept that PSHE is a very important part of education for many young people and that it will continue in schools, and rightly so. However, it seems that we are trying to impose the shape of education through legislation, whereas the shape of education is a matter of balance and balance is never formulated in a set of clauses in a Bill. The real issue is how well this is done and whether a balance of attitude is preserved. This applies to PSHE and to the teaching of religion and about other faiths in faith schools.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="11071383000171"></a>I have reservations. First, I do not think that we do PSHE very well. We have already had mention of the fact that teenage pregnancy numbers may be falling but we are still the worst in Europe. STD admissions are rising among young people. Whatever we are doing, and we have done a lot more of it the last two years, we are not doing it well. I am not sure that legislating in this way will change that. Secondly, it is very much a delicate balance. Thirdly, one of the ways in which you try to deal with delicate balances in schools is by having an adequate inspection system. I am not saying that the one we have is good enough yet, but if there were an adequate inspection system one of the things it would ask is, "Is the balance of sex education in this school, in this community and in this culture right?". That is what you would expect from a good school inspection. It looks as if, in this Bill, many schools will be exempted from that kind of inspection and that is where I see the gap. I would be reassured about all this being written down in an Act if there were some way of ensuring that it were well done in schools. It is a delicate issue. How this is taught varies from one school and one community to the next and that can only be properly assessed by trained and qualified inspectors.</p>

I would have said it myself if I could have said it as well. It is crucial that children learn these things at school. It is daffy to prescribe that individual items should be learnt. One should look at the outcome. The only sensible way of looking at the outcome is inspection. This Bill is setting out to destroy that aspect of inspection rather than building on it, so I am entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, in my concerns. The only other thing I would like to say is that this is a great subject to be debating in this room, under a picture of a PSHE lesson.</p>

Relationships are so crucial in everything that we do. I am very much of the view that it certainly does not need to be prescribed and in the Bill. I go along with the approach of my noble friend Lord Sutherland on this. Nevertheless, the whole area is crucially important.</p>

That never happened; it got shunted around to different lessons, if it ever took place at all. I would not at all mind having an inspection with that written into it: how is it doing and is it increasing the happiness and the general well-being of our children?</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="1107142000004"></a>Returning briefly to the business of teaching religion, and what was said just now, it is crucial for all of us to know about the different religions in the world-and none. It is essential that we accept and know and are tolerant about this. One of the horrors in the rest of the world is that that form of tolerance does not exist. So we must do whatever we can in that direction. However, I hope that in the process we are not going to end up with ways that actually restrict the excellent work that many of our religious schools are doing. I am not thinking of these amendments but perhaps some that will come subsequently.</p>

I rise simply to say to our two Ministers that surely the issue of PSHE would be top of the list of priorities for Ofsted in terms of a national survey  of what is actually happening. Its report would tell us what is really going on in our schools across the country.</p>

First, I join in the general applause for the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, on the application of the law of diminishing returns in this area: the more you specify, the more you tend to lose. My second point may also relate to later debates. As far as possible in education, we should try to maintain one framework that covers all schools. There may be some adaptation in schools of different character, but it is in the spirit of our educational system to aim for a framework that brings a Church of England school, a Roman Catholic school, a Jewish school and a local authority maintained school under the same umbrella. We are one society, and it is important to make that point in our education system.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="1107142000007"></a>Finally, and perhaps more significantly, I suppose that a Bishop would have to comment on sex and relationships, but sometimes I think that people get obsessed with this area. Generally, the debate has been skewed too much towards it. I also think that linking sex and relationships, while I understand entirely why we do it-we do not want to disentangle sexual relationships from relationships-we do not want to get into the way of thinking that all relationships are therefore fundamentally sexualised as an outcome. I read Frank Field's report to the Government on children in our society, which is a serious issue. Surveys show that one of the things that children most want to learn is how to be good parents. There is something of a lacuna in these proposals in the area of what I would call parenthood, quite apart from the issues of sexualised

I rather agree with the right honourable gentleman down the corridor that what is key to our society is how we hand on civilisation to the next generation. There is some wisdom in the observation in his report that children want more than anything else to learn to be good parents. However, I do not see that coming through, and I certainly do not want to see this education reduced to sex and relationships.</p>

The danger is that if someone like myself dissents from what I consider to be the main thrust of the amendment of my noble friend Lady Massey, they are portrayed as dinosaurs, male chauvinists and all the litany of abusive terms that suggest discrimination against women. However, let me declare my credentials from when I served in another place because they will totally contradict that kind of attitude towards me. I voted for the equal age of consent. I voted for civil partnerships. Even when there was a free vote, I voted for every single equality measure. It was not a case of being whipped to vote for something because the Government said so. I hope that if that attitude has been inculcated, it will have been quickly dispelled by my record. Perhaps I would carry more credibility with my noble friend Lady Massey if she took into account the fact that the Roman Catholic church attacked me for those votes, but as far as I am concerned, it establishes my independence.</p>

<p><a name="1107142000009"></a>I would like to ask the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, to turn to page 6 of the Marshalled List, which sets out the proposed new section. Subsection (6) states:</p>

<p><a name="1107142000012"></a>When it comes to the new section in Amendment 90, the difficulty is that I maintain-I will no doubt encourage further contributions with this-that the common threads of the amendments are designed to minimise, damage and gradually remove the religious element of faith schools.</p>

<p><a name="1107142000013"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0002.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="1107142000056"></a>Baroness Massey of Darwen:</b> I am so sorry to interrupt the noble Lord again but I think that he has misunderstood a great deal of what I was saying. I am not trying to damage the ethos of faith schools. I am saying that the ethos of faith schools may well exist but children have the right to know about other faiths. I was talking today to a friend from Northern Ireland who said, "Look at what damage has been done in Northern Ireland by people not learning about other faiths". I say no more.</p>

I fully confess that I have a very limited formal education but I do not have limited intelligence, and it is my responsibility to make a judgment that I see a thread in maybe one or two contributions from my noble friend, seeing as how she has introduced this subject. It is my opinion that there is a common thread to the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and my noble friend that are designed to-I withdraw the word "damage"-minimise or devalue the existence and practice of faith schools.</p>

First, I want to put on record my support and that of my noble friend for the amendment on PSHE in the name of my noble friend Lady Massey, and those in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. Secondly, I was disappointed that such provisions disappeared from our legislation in the wash-up before the general election, because we were proceeding with this. Thirdly, these amendments appeared in our legislation following a wide-ranging review that my noble friend Lord Knight conducted over a long period and which involved all the faith schools, other schools and lots of interested parties. It reached a remarkable consensus on the way forward. Provisions similar to these amendments appeared in our legislation. I should like to ask the Minister: given the progress that was made, what else could the review that this Government are now carrying out possibly be looking at? Could they not move a little quicker to get these provisions into legislation, given that that work was already completed?</p>

We need to teach our children to develop social and interpersonal skills and, most of all, to help them to understand what unconditional love is. We have talked about sex, relationships and family life, but lots of children do not know what true unconditional  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC360"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC360</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>love is. They also need to develop a kind of strategy whereby they can think for themselves. Helping them to develop interpersonal and social skills will go a long way towards achieving that. That is what the amendment is all about.</p>

<p><a name="1107142000018"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0002.htm_spnew20"></a><a name="1107142000061"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> My Lords, I will not be quite as brief as the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, but I shall do my best. As she said, it has in many ways been an extremely interesting and engaging debate. At its heart, apart from a few outliers, it boils down to a judgment that one has to reach as to whether the best way forward on addressing these important issues around PSHE, which we all agree need to be addressed, is through the statutory prescriptive route or through a different approach by trying to slim down the statutory provisions and the national curriculum, and leaving more space and opportunity for more skill-words used by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth-for teachers to give children and young people the support that they need. Almost my first debates in this House just over a year ago were about PSHE and faith. Whoever said how tenacious my noble friend Lady Walmsley and the noble Baroness, Lady Massey-with whom I have had many discussions-have been on this subject was absolutely right.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="1107142000019"></a>We know that in a recent report on the subject, Ofsted found that PSHE education was good or outstanding in three-quarters of the schools visited and that pupils' personal development was good in most schools visited and was outstanding in about one-third of the schools. However, that same report also found that there were weaknesses, particularly around sex and relationships education, and in some other areas that we need to find ways of addressing. At heart, therefore, is a generally broad agreement on the ends to which we are working but disagreement about the means.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="1107142000020"></a>The Government's aim is to shrink the curriculum and to leave schools and teachers more time to decide for themselves what to teach-a point of view that received a fair amount of support from a number of noble Lords. Teachers have said that they feel that their professionalism is undermined by the overall degree of prescription to which they have been subjected. By stripping the curriculum back we want to give schools the space they need to offer a rounded education, including of course PSHE.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="1107142000021"></a>We know that PSHE covers a range of important areas and schools teach it in a variety of ways. It seems to me right that schools should have the discretion to teach it. They know their children. Different schools have different circumstances, and different kinds of children will need different support from their school. Ofsted has said that the most effective curriculum model seen was one in which discrete, regularly taught PSHE lessons were supplemented with cross-curricular activities. That point has also been raised. We are keen to see good practice being shared with the minority of schools that are not teaching the subject as well. Our priority should be to support schools in their efforts to do better by their pupils. That is why we are carrying out the internal review which we have heard about, which has two main objectives: to consider what should be taught; and to look at how schools can be supported  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC361"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column GC361</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to improve the quality of all PSHE teaching. That may be a new element, different from the work previously carried out by the noble Lord, Lord Knight.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="1107142000022"></a>I completely understand the impatience of the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, and my noble friend to hear from the Government when this fabled review will heave into view. I have been saying for some time to the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, that it will be soon or shortly; I think it is very soon or very shortly, and as soon as we are there, I will of course circulate that to all Members of the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="1107142000023"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0002.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="1107142000062"></a>Baroness Massey of Darwen:</b> Does the noble Lord mean that it will be finished soon, or that it will be started start soon?</p>

<p><a name="1107142000024"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0002.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="1107142000063"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> I know that the noble Baroness is keen that the review should be as short as possible and that she thinks that much of what it covers has already been covered-we have had that discussion before. I hope that it will start soon, and then aim to conclude by the end of the year.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="1107142000025"></a>On the points made about sex and relationships education, as part of our review we will determine how we can support schools to improve the quality of their teaching in this area. As I mentioned, Ofsted's report on the matter says that sex education is one of the weaker aspects of PSHE. This is perhaps a sign that legislation of itself is not a necessarily a guarantee of good quality teaching, since that is the part that is statutory.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="1107142000026"></a>On as emergency life support skills are concerned, I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, that equipping young people to be able to step in where lives are at stake is extremely important. I know that many schools, and organisations such as the British Heart Foundation and St John Ambulance, do absolutely brilliant work. My own wife is a trained first-aider, something which she needs for the work she does for Riding for the Disabled; so I know how important it is. That is one reason why we are so keen to review the national curriculum: so that the statutory content will take up less of the timetable, which in turn will enable many more schools to get involved in things such as the British Heart Foundation's Heartstart programme.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="1107142000027"></a>We know that there are many things-and my noble friend Lady Walmsley spoke about them with great experience and passion-that pupils need to learn about and can benefit from. We heard from the noble Lord, Lord Layard, who sadly is not in his place, about the link between well-being and the ability to learn. Of course that is true, but attempting to define those things from the centre, and be prescriptive about what schools must teach, removes teachers' and school leaders' ability to use their professional judgment.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="1107142000028"></a>We had an interesting exchange about inspections. Of course the new school inspection framework will cover the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, was making a point echoed by my noble friend Lord Lucas about the frequency of inspection-we will come on to talk about that under later groups. We will also come back to discuss thematic reviews and the

We know that the majority of schools already deliver good PSHE education, which is not currently a statutory part of the curriculum. I agree that we need to look at how the quality of PSHE teaching can be improved and what its content should be; that is what our review will look into. I know that I will disappoint my noble friend Lady Walmsley who has clear and strong views on this, but with these comments I ask her to withdraw her amendments.</p>
<h5><a name="1107142000048"></a>8 pm</h5>

<p><a name="1107142000029"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0002.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="1107142000064"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate, especially my noble friend the Minister. He may have disappointed me, but he has not surprised me. Perhaps I may make a few points to follow up on what noble Lords have said. First, I turn to the Minister's response. The noble Lord, Lord Knight, achieved a very wide consensus, and that is why I took the three clauses from the Bill that was lost before the general election. The reason I took them as the basis for my amendments is the wide consensus that they had achieved among people who run schools of all faiths. I felt that those clauses struck the right balance.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="1107142000030"></a>My noble friend says that he does not want to be prescriptive about what should be taught. I do not think that my amendments are prescriptive. They talk about areas that should be taught, but they certainly do not set out programmes of work which, personally, I think should be quite spare and leave a great deal to the discretion and professionalism of teachers. However, we are prescriptive in other subjects. Before long, when the review of the national curriculum reaches its conclusions, there will be prescription about what children should be taught in physics, English, geography and all the rest. We are going to get that, so why not PSHE, too, which is so fundamentally important?</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="1107142000031"></a>I would say to the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, that I understand where she is coming from in her comments but, as I have just said, these amendments came from her own Government's Bill which, before the general election, she supported. What we have to do is get the balance right between the principles I have laid down in my amendments-I think most people would agree with them-and the rights of parents to send their children to schools in the faith that they themselves uphold, and for those schools to teach PSHE in the light of their own faith. I do not see anything wrong with that.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="1107142000032"></a>I was quite disappointed that the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, could not support me. In order to address the issues that she and others of her opinion expressed when we discussed this matter before the general election, I made modifications to the clauses. I absolutely deny that five year-olds are taught the details of human sex. They are not. But it was in order to take account of some people's fear that they might be taught in that way that I made that area and one or two other areas of the curriculum I am proposing voluntary. Schools can do this in an age-appropriate way, as set out in the amendments, but if they do not want to do it, they do not have to.</p>

The point I am making-I am finding it hard to speak because I am not very well-is that at the moment there is legislation which states that sex education cannot be provided for five to seven year-olds, but these amendments would repeal that. That is what I have been informed. If I am wrong, I apologise, but that is the basis of my objection.</p>

<p><a name="1107142000034"></a><b><a name="110713-gc0002.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="1107142000066"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> I accept what the noble Baroness has heard, but it is not my understanding that that is the case. However, I am sure that we can look at it outside the Committee.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="1107142000035"></a>What I am really saying is that we want children to be learning-ready. PSHE is not an extra subject that I am trying to put into the curriculum. I agree absolutely with the Minister that we need to slim the curriculum down. However, PSHE is not any old subject; it is a fundamental underpinning. None of us ladies would go around without foundation garments because they make our fashions look better on the outside. It is really important that children have the skills and understanding that enable them to benefit from all the other subjects that we decide that they must learn-the core ones they must learn or the additional ones that they may take.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="1107142000036"></a>I understand where the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, is coming from. I would not want to load the curriculum with a lot of extra subjects, but he did make the point that we do not do this very well. That is exactly why I would like to make PSHE statutory. People would then train as specialists. As the noble Lord rightly said, without training, some of these areas are difficult to teach. I myself was thrown in at the deep end-many teachers are. I would certainly have benefited from

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="1107142000037"></a>I am grateful to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester for raising the subject of parenthood. As far as I am concerned, that would come into the relationships and sex part of PSHE. Parents have relationships between each other and with their children. It is particularly their relationship with their children that would be important there. I absolutely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, and his passion for getting young people taught some parenting skills. That is very important.</p>

<a name="110713-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="1107142000038"></a>Finally, on the voting record of the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, I am quite sure that he would want to support my amendments. I reassure him that what he seeks would not be precluded by my three amendments in any way whatever.</p>

<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS62"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column WS62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_101"></a><a name="11071358000106"></a>The <I>Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals-Great Britain-2010</I> (HC 1263), was laid before the House today. Copies will be available in the Vote Office.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_102"></a><a name="11071358000107"></a>This annual statistical report meets the requirement in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to inform Parliament about the licensed use of animals for experimental or other scientific purposes. It also forms the basis for meeting periodic reporting requirements at EU level. Supplementary information with additional tables is also available on the Home Office website.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_103"></a><a name="11071358000108"></a>The 2010 statistical report shows that the number of licensed procedures started in 2010 increased slightly over 2009 to just over 3.7 million scientific procedures and constituted a rise of 105,000 (3 per cent). This rise follows a slight fall in the 2009 statistical report. A number of factors, such as investment in research and development and strategic funding priorities, determine the overall level of scientific procedures.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_104"></a><a name="11071358000109"></a>The Home Office, as regulatory authority under the 1986 Act, ensures that its provisions are rigorously applied and only authorises work that is scientifically justified and minimises the numbers of animals used and the animal suffering that may be caused.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_107"></a><a name="11071358000112"></a>Publication of the report honours a commitment given in response to a recommendation of the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures in July 2002 that more information should be made available about the implementation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_108"></a><a name="11071358000113"></a>As in previous years, the report explains what Home Office inspectors do and how they do it and the inspectorate's role in assessing and advising on applications for personal and project licences and certificates of designation under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and reporting non-compliance.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_109"></a><a name="11071358000114"></a>The report also contains information on the work of the ASPD policy and licensing teams; it explains how, in partnership with ASPI, ASPD have continued to work towards delivering our better regulation programme and new IT system; includes a section setting out the reporting of cases of non-compliance and infringements of ASPA and the outcomes of these cases (see Annexe D), and records progress with the adoption of European Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, which came into force on 9 November 2010.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_111"></a><a name="11071358000117"></a>We have recently completed such a review, and have decided it is only appropriate to extend the OA to all those serving this country on operations in Libya.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_112"></a><a name="11071358000118"></a>This will result in the payment of OA to anyone operating within the landmass, airspace and territorial waters of Libya, including all aircrew operating over the Libyan landmass and to ships and submarines within 12 nautical miles of the coast. Payment is based on the number of days within the specified areas, and will be backdated until 18 March 2011 with funding coming from the reserve.</p>

Similarly, those on a dedicated operational work up package, of up to six months, or post operational tour leave on the day of notifications will also be excluded.</p>

<a name="11071358000120"></a><b><a name="110713-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="11071358000219"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord Hill of Oareford):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children and Families (Tim Loughton) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_114"></a><a name="11071358000121"></a>On 10 June 2010, I informed the house that the Government were commissioning the Munro review of child protection. This was the very first review established in the Department for Education, underlining the enormous priority this Government place on getting child protection right.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_115"></a><a name="11071358000122"></a>From the start, we wanted the Munro review of child protection to be different. That is why, unlike its predecessors, it was not commissioned as an immediate response to a specific crisis. That is why Professor Munro's final report-published in May-recommended that regulation and prescription are reduced rather than increased. And-most importantly of all-that is why it focused on the child, rather than the system.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_116"></a><a name="11071358000123"></a>I am extremely grateful to Professor Munro for undertaking a wide-ranging and in-depth review. I am also grateful to all the organisations in the sector, the child protection workforce and the wider public, including children and young people themselves, who contributed to the review. Their experience, insights and expertise have helped make her final report so well informed, and so widely welcomed.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_117"></a><a name="11071358000124"></a>Just as Professor Munro conducted her review openly and collaboratively, the Government have worked with the sector to develop the Government's response. An implementation working group, drawing on expertise from local authority children's services, the social work profession, the police and, in particular, education and the health service, advised on the Government's response to Professor Munro's recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_118"></a><a name="11071358000125"></a>The Government commend Professor Munro's thorough analysis of the issues and accept her fundamental argument that the child protection system has lost its focus on the thing that matters most: the views and experience of children themselves. We believe we need to move towards a child protection system with less central prescription and interference, where we place greater trust and responsibility in skilled professionals at the front line.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_119"></a><a name="11071358000126"></a>The Government's response is not a one-off set of recommended solutions to be imposed from the centre. Rather it is the start of a shift in mindset and relationship between central government, local agencies and frontline professionals, working in partnership. Change will evolve and best practice will develop based on experience, innovation and evidence. Our aim will be to create the conditions for sustained, long-term reform which enables and inspires professionals to do their best for vulnerable children and their families.</p>

<a name="11071358000128"></a><b><a name="110713-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="11071358000220"></a>Baroness Northover:</b> My honourable friend the Minister for Political and Constitutional Reform (Mark Harper) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_121"></a><a name="11071358000129"></a>I am announcing today the publication of draft legislation on three electoral administration provisions for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para122"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_122"></a><a name="11071358000130"></a>The draft legislation is intended to form part of a larger package of measures that will also include draft legislation on individual electoral registration (IER), which has been published separately for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_123"></a><a name="11071358000131"></a>The draft legislation addresses particular issues that have been raised by MPs and peers, and by electoral stakeholders, and proposes practical and sensible changes that will help to deliver more effective electoral administration.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para124"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_124"></a><a name="11071358000132"></a>The draft legislation includes provisions that extend the timetable for UK parliamentary elections from 17 to 25 days and similarly extends the timetable for UK parliamentary by-elections. The existing timetable for UK parliamentary elections and by-elections is considerably shorter than the electoral timetable for all other UK polls. The very limited time available for the postal vote process compromises effective participation in elections by certain types of voter, particularly overseas and service voters. Moreover, the existing timetable puts considerable pressure on administrative processes by compressing a large number of tasks into a short period, which represents significant risks to the effective conduct of elections.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para125"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_125"></a><a name="11071358000133"></a>Extending the timetable for UK parliamentary elections and by-elections will bring benefits for voters and administrators, as well as adding to the robustness and integrity of the electoral process. The Government propose that, within this extended timetable:</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS65"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column WS65</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the deadline for parties to nominate candidates should continue to be six days after the start of the timetable, so parties will have the same time as now to put forward candidates to stand for election. In practice this will now be 19, rather than 11, days before the date of poll, which will allow administrators to begin printing ballot papers further in advance of polling day; andprovision should be made for updated versions of the electoral register to be created at an earlier point in the timetable to allow postal votes to be distributed to new registration applicants earlier than is currently possible.
<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_126"></a><a name="11071358000134"></a>We also propose to address an oversight in existing legislation passed during the previous Government's time in office that allows a candidate standing for a single party in a UK parliamentary election to use an emblem on their ballot paper but does not allow jointly-nominated candidates to do so. This issue has primarily affected candidates standing on behalf of the Labour Party and the Co-operative Party. The proposal will ensure that electoral law is consistent on this issue.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_127"></a><a name="11071358000135"></a>The draft legislation also makes changes to the existing system for reviews of polling districts and places in Great Britain for UK parliamentary elections to bring them in line with the five-year cycle for UK parliamentary boundary reviews implemented by the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 and the proposed cycle of parliamentary terms under the Fixed-term Parliaments Bill.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para130"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_130"></a><a name="11071358000139"></a>The Government have become increasingly concerned about the distress and misery that squatters can cause. Law-abiding property owners or occupiers who work hard for a living can spend thousands of pounds evicting squatters from their properties, repairing damage and clearing up the debris they have left behind.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_131"></a><a name="11071358000140"></a>I have met honourable Members and corresponded with members of the public who have expressed concern about the appalling impact squatting has had on their properties or local neighbourhoods.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para132"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_132"></a><a name="11071358000141"></a>The Government do not accept the claim that is sometimes made that squatting is a reasonable recourse of the homeless resulting from social deprivation. There are options open to those who are genuinely destitute and who need shelter that do not involve occupying somebody else's property without authority. No matter how compelling or difficult the squatter's own circumstances are claimed to be, it is wrong that legitimate occupants should be deprived of the use of their property.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_133"></a><a name="11071358000142"></a>There should be no doubt about the seriousness with which the Government treats this problem or our determination to tackle it. The Housing Minister and I have already published new guidance on the DirectGov website for property owners on evicting squatters under existing legislation.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para134"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_134"></a><a name="11071358000143"></a>The consultation paper we are publishing today invites views on whether more should be done to strengthen the criminal law or its enforcement. We could do this, for example, by introducing a new offence of squatting; by strengthening existing offences that currently apply to squatters; or by working with the enforcement authorities to identify and overcome barriers to enforcement of existing offences that may be committed by squatters.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para135"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_135"></a><a name="11071358000144"></a>The Government acknowledge that some of the options they are proposing may have an impact on the enforcement authorities, local authorities, homelessness charities and other organisations. Any option we decide to pursue as a result of this consultation will need to be workable and affordable, taking account of the current economic climate and reduction in government expenditure.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para136"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_136"></a><a name="11071358000145"></a>Of course, we must also tackle problems affecting the wider housing market and bring more empty homes back into productive use. The Government intend to publish an empty homes strategy over the summer and a wider housing strategy in the autumn, setting out the overall approach to housing policy, including how we are supporting an increase in the supply and quality of new private and social housing, helping those seeking a home of their own, whether to rent or buy. The Government have already made available £4.5 billion to help deliver new affordable housing through the Affordable Homes Programme and as part of that £100 million to bring empty homes back into use.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para144"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_144"></a><a name="11071358000157"></a>Today, I am publishing a consultation on family migration. Immigration has enriched our culture and strengthened our economy, but uncontrolled immigration places pressure on our public services and on community cohesion. The Government have already introduced a limit on non-European Economic Area economic migrants entering the UK; has reshaped tiers 1 and 2 of the points-based system to increase selectivity and skills requirements; has started implementing changes to tier 4, the student visa system; and are currently consulting on breaking the link between economic migration and settlement, and on other temporary work routes. These policies will reduce net migration, but we need to take action across all routes to ensure this returns to sustainable levels and we bring a sense of fairness back to our immigration system.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para145"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_145"></a><a name="11071358000158"></a>This consultation on family migration is the next in our programme of immigration reforms. In the year to September 2010, family migration accounted for around 17 per cent of all non-EU immigration to the UK.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para146"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_146"></a><a name="11071358000159"></a>The proposals included in the family consultation are aimed at tackling abuse, promoting integration and reducing burdens on the taxpayer. A contribution to reduced net migration would be welcome but is not the primary goal. The focus is on delivering better family migration: better for migrants, for communities and for the UK as a whole.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para147"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_147"></a><a name="11071358000160"></a>The consultation concentrates on the family route: those non-EEA nationals entering, remaining in or settling in the UK on the basis of a relationship with a British citizen or person settled in the UK. This includes fiancé(e)s, proposed civil partners, spouses, civil partners,  


<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS68"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column WS68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>unmarried or same-sex partners, dependent children and adult and elderly dependent relatives. In 2010, 48,900 visas were granted to people on the family route, of which 40,500 were issued to people on the basis of marriage or civil or other partnership, and 8,400 were issued to dependants.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para148"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_148"></a><a name="11071358000161"></a>We set out firm proposals for reform of the family route. The key elements are: a minimum income threshold for sponsors to provide appropriate maintenance, on which we have asked the Migration Advisory Committee to advise; in line with other routes, extending the probationary period from two years to five years before a spouse or partner can apply for settlement (and before which non-contributory benefits may not be claimed. Access to the labour market, to the NHS and to schooling will be unaffected by this change); and a requirement to understand everyday English before settlement is granted. We propose that all those seeking settlement or citizenship should demonstrate an appropriate level of English, and we will consider whether changes to the current testing regime could further assist integration.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para149"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_149"></a><a name="11071358000162"></a>We also propose to help UK Border Agency caseworkers consider spouse and partner applications by defining what we mean under the rules by a genuine and continuing relationship, marriage or partnership; to end immediate settlement, and immediate access to benefits, on entry for spouses and partners who have been married or in a relationship for at least four years before coming to the UK, and for adult dependent relatives, including those aged 65 or over, and to require both groups to complete a five-year probationary period; and to look at arrangements for dependent relatives aged 65 or over to settle in the UK, reflecting health and social care costs to the taxpayer.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para150"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_150"></a><a name="11071358000163"></a>The consultation also invites discussion on some broader propositions, particularly in relation to tackling sham marriages and forced marriages. On sham marriages these build on existing joint work between the UK Border Agency and the general register offices across the UK, local registration services and the Anglican Church. They also explore the case for legislative change in England and Wales, including making "sham" an impediment to marriage and allowing a marriage to be delayed while a suspected sham is investigated.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_151"></a><a name="11071358000164"></a>It is important that we look at family migration in the round and so the consultation also deals with other family migration issues.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para152"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_152"></a><a name="11071358000165"></a>In 2010, 45,200 dependants under the points-based system were granted a visa with a route to settlement in the UK. The consultation proposes moving to a five-year probationary period and everyday English for settlement for the spouses and civil and other partners of points-based system migrants, in line with other groups.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para153"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_153"></a><a name="11071358000166"></a>Many British citizens and persons settled in the UK have family members living outside the UK. This results in a high volume of visa applications from people wishing to visit family here. In 2010, 350,300 family visit visas were issued, with around 73 per cent granted on initial decision by the visa officer. In 2010-11,  95 per cent of family visit visa applications were decided by the UK Border Agency within 15 working days.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_154"></a><a name="11071358000167"></a>We have reviewed the arrangements for the operation of the family visit visa. We are concerned that taxpayer funding of around £40 million per year is being spent on appeals where appellants are commonly misusing the appeals system, by submitting information on appeal that should have been put forward as part of the original application, or where a second application (costing another £76) is the most appropriate route for securing a visa. We are also concerned that this is a disproportionate use of taxpayer funding (for an appeal process that can take up 34 weeks to be concluded) for the benefit sought: a short-term visit to the UK. Greater priority should be given to appeal cases that have far-reaching impacts for the individuals concerned and for the public at large, for example asylum claims, settlement applications and the deportation of foreign criminals.</p>

Article 8 is not an absolute right and our proposals aim to set out requirements that must be satisfied in family migration cases which are consistent with our ECHR obligations. We also want to be clear about the circumstances in which the public interest will outweigh an individual's Article 8 right.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para159"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_159"></a><a name="11071358000173"></a>On 14 October 2010, the Government announced the outcome of their review of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs). This reported that the majority of Defra's scientific and technical advisory bodies were to be abolished and reconstituted as expert scientific committees to provide advice on specific areas. As part of implementing these reforms, the Pesticide Residues Committee (PRC), which was a non-statutory advisory NDPB, has been abolished and replaced by an expert scientific committee from 1 July 2011. The new committee will be called the Expert Committee on Pesticide Residues in Food (PRiF) to more accurately reflect its remit.</p>

<a name="11071358000176"></a><b><a name="110713-wms0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="11071358000227"></a>Baroness Northover:</b> My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (Kenneth Clarke, QC) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para162"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_162"></a><a name="11071358000177"></a>In the response to the Green Paper: <I>Breaking the Cycle: Effective Punishment, Rehabilitation and Sentencing of Offenders</I>, I set out a vision for a transformed justice system that will focus on public protection and cutting crime. An important part of delivering the changes I am committed to is ensuring that the services we provide are focused on delivering the best possible outcomes and the greatest value for money.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para163"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_163"></a><a name="11071358000178"></a>Competition between providers of our services can help us to meet these challenges as the previous Government recognised when they made contestability a feature of offender services when setting up the National Offender Management Service in 2004. The competition strategy for offender services, which I have published today, sets out how we will change the way we use competition to meet these aims. My approach is based on ensuring an effective balance between making services more efficient while reforming them so that they provide better outcomes for the public. In doing so, we will draw on a wide range of expertise from the private and voluntary sector, which will work in partnership with a strong public sector.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para164"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_164"></a><a name="11071358000179"></a>For offender services, I intend to employ the principle that competition will apply at some stage to all those services not currently bound to public sector delivery by statute. This will mean the benefits of competition can be felt much more widely, contrasting with the previous approach of only using competition when procuring new services or as a way of managing poor performance.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para165"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_165"></a><a name="11071358000180"></a>Underpinning this approach will be our commitment to apply more widely the principles of payment by results to services which reduce reoffending. By paying some or all of a contract value on the basis of the reduced re-offending levels achieved, we can focus service providers' efforts on what works. This will ensure that money spent on rehabilitation is spent effectively. We intend to run a number of pilot exercises and competition will be a key mechanism in deciding which models we adopt.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para166"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_166"></a><a name="11071358000181"></a>In practice, this will mean taking a different approach for both custodial and non-custodial services. The use of competition in custodial services is now well established as most recently demonstrated by the successful outcome of the competition for four prisons which I announced in March this year.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2011" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS71"></a><b>13 July 2011 : Column WS71</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para167"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_167"></a><a name="11071358000182"></a>To ensure that we build on this strong record I  am announcing today my intention to launch competitions for the management of a further nine prisons in the autumn. These are Lindholme, Moorland, Hatfield and the Wolds in Yorkshire, Acklington and  Castington in Northumberland, Durham, Onley in Northamptonshire and Coldingley in Surrey. The Wolds is a prison run by G4S that has come to the end of its current contract; the other eight prisons are public sector establishments being competed for the first time. The public sector will have the opportunity to compete in all of these prison competitions.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para168"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_168"></a><a name="11071358000183"></a>These prisons have been selected by the National Offender Management Service to balance our need to increase efficiency and to make real the policy intent of the Green Paper.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para169"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_169"></a><a name="11071358000184"></a>Looking to the future, there is a need to consider the future shape of probation services in England and Wales to improve justice outcomes and to make the justice system more efficient and effective. I have asked my officials to explore the possible options for service improvements and different models of delivering offender services within the community. I will set out my preferred approach in the autumn. Alongside this, and supporting it, I will set out in detail my competition strategy for non-custodial services, which will also encompass the recently launched competition for community payback services, the competition for electronic monitoring contracts I am announcing today, and payment by results pilots in the community.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para170"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_170"></a><a name="11071358000185"></a>A further important element of our drive for greater efficiency is to ensure we have a modern, fit-for-purpose prison estate which can deliver high-quality, cost-effective and secure regimes. With the prison population not growing at the rate predicted by the last Government, we have an opportunity to close some of our more inefficient places.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para171"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_171"></a><a name="11071358000186"></a>I am therefore announcing the closure of HMPs Latchmere House and Brockhill. This will see a reduction of 377 prison spaces. This is part of an overall programme that includes a further 2,500 new prison places becoming available over the next 12 months. This will ensure that our operational capacity continues to handle the projected prison population in a way that meets the need both for greater efficiency and ability to support a strengthened focus on protection of the public and rehabilitation.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para172"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_172"></a><a name="11071358000187"></a>The closure of these places will provide estimated cost savings of £4.9 million this year and an ongoing annual saving of £11.4 million. We also anticipate capital receipts from sale of the land at Latchmere House, which is in a prime location. We will transfer resettlement provision from that establishment to HMP Brixton to maintain our focus on reducing re-offending. We expect to be able to absorb staff displaced by this process elsewhere in the system and to avoid the use of compulsory redundancies.</p>

<a name="110713-wms0001.htm_para173"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_173"></a><a name="11071358000188"></a>The public have a right to expect continuing improvement in the quality and efficiency of public services, without compromising public safety. The competition strategy and adjustments to the prison estate I have outlined today will help ensure that this is the case.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_175"></a><a name="11071358000191"></a>Crossrail will support economic growth for London and the UK. As part of the comprehensive spending review in October 2010, the coalition Government confirmed their commitment to the full Crossrail scheme. A re-phased programme of delivery means that Crossrail services will commence from 2018. We expect Crossrail to cost no more than £14.5 billion. Forecasts continue to suggest that Crossrail will be delivered within its existing funding.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_176"></a><a name="11071358000192"></a>Crossrail has made significant progress since the last annual update to Parliament. Crossrail Limited has now let all its key tunnelling contracts and enabling works are continuing at a number of sites across central London. Construction is well advanced at Canary Wharf Crossrail Station, and tunnel-boring machines are expected to be launched in spring 2012. In April 2011, Crossrail passed through the final project review point, at which point the department and TfL delegated full contractual authority to Crossrail Limited to deliver the scheme. The new chief executive of Crossrail Limited, Andrew Wolstenholme, was appointed in May 2011.</p>

Anyone accused should have adequate time to prepare a defence, access to legal counsel and be tried before independent, impartial tribunals. We continue to urge the Government of Bahrain, at the highest level, to take forward their commitment to investigate the claims of abuse. In this context, we welcome the establishment on 30 June by the King, of an independent commission composed of international figures to look into the events of recent months and into allegations of human rights abuses.</p>

It will mean that people on benefit will face choices about housing costs similar to those faced by people in work. But it will not necessarily mean that they will need to move from their home. Even within the limits of this cap, households will still be able to receive significant amounts of financial assistance from state welfare payments and if a member of the household moves into work and becomes eligible for working tax credit they will be exempt from the impacts of the cap.</p>

<a name="110713w0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_86"></a><a name="11071357000113"></a>There is a range of help local authorities can offer to households at risk of becoming homeless including the provision of discretionary housing payments. We have already made an additional £190 million available over the spending review period for this purpose as a result of the changes we have made to housing benefit.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_87"></a><a name="11071357000114"></a>The Government published their impact assessment of the benefit cap in February alongside the introduction of the Welfare Reform Bill. This made clear that it is not possible to estimate the number of additional homelessness applications that might arise as a consequence of the overall benefit cap because this would have to be based on behavioural changes.

However, the legal basis under which the Turkish Members of Parliament serve is a matter for the relevant legislative authorities.</p>
