Energy performance certificates have only been required for all non-domestic buildings constructed, sold or rented since October 2008. Local weights and measures authorities are responsible for enforcing these requirements. We support them in carrying out their duties by providing guidance and access to the EPC register and database. We will assess the level of compliance later this year.</p>

A survey by National Energy Services reveals either almost total ignorance or disregard of the need for energy performance certificates in the commercial sector. Energy performance certificates are the one really useful tool to come out of the Government&#146;s regulation of the property market. Around 11,000 accredited energy inspectors, largely trained at their own expense, are wondering why Her Majesty&#146;s Government encouraged them to undertake their training. What steps are the Government considering to overcome this failure?</p>

The first phase will look at the operational effectiveness of the current arrangements and the second at compliance and value for money. It is due to report finally in the summer of next year. I can tell the noble Lord that to date some 92,000 non-domestic EPCs have been lodged on the register, so it is having some effect. However, there are issues around non-compliance which need to be seriously addressed.</p>

I shall start again. The Minister says that he supports EPCs, but is he aware that the newly formed Association of Property and Energy Professionals, which represents home inspectors and domestic energy assessors, is taking the Government to judicial review and will probably launch a class action because the Government have created two industries but, through their actions, have removed the need for DEAs and home inspectors? With the creation of the home energy assessor role, which is yet another layer, all the people who trained and who sometimes spent their life savings on it are now finding their role being taken on by other organisations. A press release from British Gas says that its meter readers will take on the role. Can the Minister say whether this is a good use of government money, given that it could cost &#163;70 million?</p>

If that is the case, I should not say too much from the Dispatch Box on the issue. The number of assessors is for the market to determine. I acknowledge that people have trained to undertake these responsibilities and, obviously, the greater the compliance that can be engendered, the greater the prospects for those people who are in the field.</p>

As from the end of last year&#151;I think it was October&#151;an energy performance certificate has been needed for any property that is available for letting. However, I am not sure I understand what has just been said. Is it that the highly-qualified people are rather like expert surgeons, who can still do minor surgery and therefore there would be employment for them in that sense, or is it that because they are so well qualified they can no longer do domestic work? What the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, said was a little confusing.</p>

The EPCs are generated by approved assessors and different standards apply for those dealing with domestic dwellings and those dealing with non-domestic dwellings. They have to be accredited through schemes which are themselves approved by the Secretary of State, but the standards and expertise required of someone doing an EPC on a domestic dwelling would not have to be the same as those required of someone doing an EPC on a commercial property.</p>

The answer is that I would certainly hope so. I asked those who briefed me about government buildings and the publication of DECs whether there was full compliance with that requirement. The answer I received is that there was a high level of compliance. I hope that that is exceeded in the case raised by the noble Earl.</p>

However, in all seriousness, this is a hugely important policy. We know that there is an overwhelming body of scientific evidence which indicates that climate change is a serious and urgent issue and that nearly half of all emissions in this country come from buildings. EPCs mean that, for the first time, consumers will know how energy efficient buildings are and how to make them perform better. I hope noble Lords will join me in trying to get those messages out generally.</p>

I agree that successful implementation will be achieved through a partnership approach that brings together Government, disabled people and the commissions that form the independent element of the monitoring and reporting framework. The convention is not owned by a single element of this partnership, and we will make a success of it if we work together.</p>

We will look to maximise the impact by making the best use of the resources that are available. There are no current plans for a debate, although the Welfare Reform Bill involves some of these issues and we will be debating it again this afternoon, but I am sure that this House will keep the Government on their toes. There are numerous ways in which we could engender a debate, which would be very welcome and a healthy thing to do.</p>

We did that because, although we have a system in place where people can be supported and appointed to receive benefits on behalf of others, we do not have a formal review procedure. We need to do that to be compliant with the convention but, as we have stated and made clear, we intend to introduce that system. Regrettably, it cannot be done overnight because a number of people are involved with this; it could take some two years. However, we are intent on removing the reservation as quickly as we can.</p>

He has not replied about the other three reservations; there was a widely held view that they were not justified. Will he give a commitment that the Government will be actively reviewing those reservations and that they will withdraw them as soon as their justification&#151;which is quite remarkably thin&#151;is demonstrated no longer to exist?</p>

We have certainly said that we would review the liberty of movement reservations within 12 months. The noble Lord will be aware that we debated the reservation in respect of the Armed Forces recently. That reservation is necessary because in our other domestic legislation the Armed Forces are not subject to the employment conditions of the Disability Discrimination Act. For as long as that remains the position, it is absolutely technically right that a reservation is maintained in respect of the convention. Otherwise, there would be a mismatch between the convention and our domestic legislation.</p>

Britain&#146;s central role in financial services in Europe is greatly enhanced by our ability to work with our European partners to ensure that we develop new methods of macro-prudential supervision, regulation and micro-supervision, which will strengthen confidence in the financial services and banking sectors across Europe.

The Prime Minister has spent weeks denying the fact that the Budget&#146;s spending projections to 2014 contain real terms cuts in total public spending. Indeed, if you strip out debt interest and social security payments, there are real terms cuts of 7 per cent to public service spending. However, instead of being straight with the public, the Prime Minister sent the First Secretary of State out to tell the media that the Comprehensive Spending Review, which could not have concealed the truth, was cancelled.</p>

That is my first point. Secondly, it is all very well to say that we have got to wait until things work out and see whether the recession is going to end on whatever date at whatever hour, but the reality out there is that there are elderly people in care homes that are subsidised by local authorities, and local authority expenditure will be cut; what do those people think? There are young people at the other end&#151;the &#147;NEETS&#148;&#151;who do not even know if they will have jobs. Yet we are told that there will be public expenditure. This does not add up. When will the Government come clean? This is not party-political playing.</p>

There is that dreadful phrase, which our soon-to-be noble friend Lord Sugar would like to use, of things being &#147;shovel ready&#148;, whereby projects which can be implemented rapidly are being brought forward. What I can be sure about is that we will continue to support the provision of public health and public education, and that the country can rely upon a Labour Government to ensure that public provision is something which we support, honour and respect.</p>

In the mean time, will the Government, given their desire to try to increase democratic renewal with the public, see whether we can devise a system whereby when the public expenditure review comes out and we can see what the Government intend to do, we could introduce a programme whereby both manifestos are put to the public before the election, including the costs and savings that will arise, so that the public in turn can be treated seriously in an adult fashion, and make a proper decision on which party they should support?</p>

How the electorate form their views on the proposals put forward by the party opposite must be for the party opposite, which must be more precise about its plans. From my perspective, we can be pretty confident that the party opposite would spend less than we would spend on education, less than we would spend on health, less than we would spend on infrastructure, and less than we would spend on security. That will be the clear and stark choice that the electorate will confront when there is an election. I have no doubt that the electorate will evidence their continuing support for significant investment in public provision.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="09070252000288"></a>&#147;A local education authority in England must secure that enough suitable education and training is provided to meet the reasonable needs of persons&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09070252000070"></a>aged 16-18 &#147;in their area&#148;. Clause 40(3) defines suitable &#147;reasonable needs&#148; as having regard to &#147;ages, abilities and aptitudes&#148;, &#147;learning difficulties&#148;, the quality available and &#147;locations and times&#148;. Subsection (4) lists a lot of things the local authority must do in performing its duty. It must encourage a diversity of provision, especially for those aged 16 to 18 who have to stay in education and training as a result of the Education and Skills Act 2008. It must think about what others might provide, make good use of resources but not incur disproportionate costs.</p>

<a name="90702-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09070252000071"></a>Yet it need not take account of the needs of local employers, which is extraordinary. Amendment 93 asks that, in its duty to secure enough suitable education and training, the local authority shall be asked to consult local employers, trade associations, chambers of commerce and, where appropriate, the sector skills council about the availability and suitability of provision in education and training in their particular local area. If the local authority is to be the commissioner of education and training facilities in the local area&#151;including, importantly, training facilities for apprentices&#151;it is vital that it takes account of what the local needs are in relation to the provision already there. The people who know best about this are the employers and their representatives: the chambers of commerce, the trade associations and&#151;at a national level&#151;the sector skills councils. The sector skills councils have their own knowledge of what goes on in localities. Amendment 93 asks directly that there shall be consultation.</p>

<a name="90702-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09070252000072"></a>Amendments 104 and 105 are applicable to Clause 41. Here again we are dealing with local authorities. Again the Government are laying down what local authorities must do. In Clause 41(1)(a), they must encourage those aged 16 to 18 to participate in education and training and in Clause (41)(1)(b), they must &#147;encourage employers to participate&#148; in this provision. Again there is no mention of consultation. These two little amendments gently suggest it would be better if, rather than banging on about it, local authorities got together with local employers and discussed with them how best to promote such participation.</p>

<a name="90702-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09070252000073"></a>With Amendments 182, 183 and 188, we jump to Clauses 81 to 83 and the duties of the chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency. In those three clauses, we are still dealing with 16 to 18 year-olds. Clause 81 is about the provision of apprentice training places, Clause 82 is about co-operation with local authorities and Clause 83 is about co-operation with employers. Clause 83 states that the chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency must,</p>
<ul><a name="09070252000295"></a>&#147;encourage employers to participate in the provision of training&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070252000274"></a>The amendment states that the chief executive, in conjunction with the sector skills councils, should consult and encourage employers and trade associations &#151;in other words, employers&#146; representatives.</p>

<a name="90702-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09070252000074"></a>With Amendment 188, we jump forward to Clause 84, providing for those aged 19 or over. The wording is subtly different. There is no more talk about &#147;enough suitable&#148; education and training to meet reasonable needs. We turn to the weasel words of the clause:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="09070252000289"></a>&#147;The Chief Executive must secure the provision of reasonable facilities&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09070252000275"></a>suitable for those aged 19 or over. Subsection (3) defines reasonable, which we shall come back to later when we discuss the clause. Subsection (4) is key to that amendment, as it lists all the things that the chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency must take account of. Subsection (4)(c) states that he or she must,</p>
<ul><a name="09070252000296"></a>&#147;take account of the education and skills required in different sectors of employment for employees and potential employees&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070252000276"></a>Once again, there is no mention of consultation with employers. This little amendment suggests that, before laying down the law about what is needed locally, the chief executive should consult employers, trade associations, and the sector skills councils&#151;who are, after all, the people who should know what sort of skills training is required. I beg to move.</p>

The Government have introduced a degree course in social work, which is very welcome, but it has attracted a younger group of people into social work. There is great advantage in also securing people with life experience and maturity, and apprenticeship is a good route for that. I would be interested in learning from the Minister, perhaps in writing, how consultation about apprenticeships for social work will take place.</p>

Consultation is a part of the process to make certain that we get the right policy.

I mention one particular group representing employers, which I believe has a greater role to play than it is currently being enabled to do: the chambers of commerce. Having talked to representatives of chambers of commerce, I know that they are very conscious that in the areas for which they have responsibility, there is great need for consultation between employers and the providers of apprenticeships to make certain that what is being offered is relevant.</p>

<a name="90702-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09070252000078"></a>In connection with the chambers of commerce&#151;I know that this is not the responsibility of the departments who are handling the Bill, but so many aspects of the various Bills going through the House at the moment impact on what is going on in other ministries&#151;I mention that there is another burgeoning role that might be considered by the Government. Jobcentres are not the ideal places for advising managers on future movement when they are declared redundant. I wonder whether consideration might be given to giving that role to the chambers of commerce, which understand what managers need, what managers&#146; skills are and where they might be applied. That is particularly relevant to making certain that they, as employers and employers&#146; representatives, are consulted about all the things to do with employers in the area where they are working.</p>

Coming from a business background, I feel that there is a great need for consultation not just on local issues, but with the particular requirements of particular businesses in mind.</p>

<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="09070252000080"></a><b><a name="90702-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09070252000405"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> Like other noble Lords who have spoken, we feel that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has brought forward some very important amendments in this group. The support from these Benches for Amendments 93, 104 and 105 will be clear from the fact that my noble friend Lady Verma and I have added our names to them.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09070252000081"></a>We have already expressed concern that the involvement of employers and the sector skills councils should be more explicitly laid out in the Bill. Will the Minister not accept that it would be sensible for the authority responsible for securing suitable education and training in the local area to have to consult with local employers and their representatives? It seems to me that this holistic approach would help to ensure that training was suitable not only for those who are going to receive it, but also for those local employers who hope to benefit from having an increasingly skilled workforce.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09070252000082"></a>As the Bill stands, the local authority must already &#147;have regard to&#148; a number of sensible measures, including encouraging diversity in the education and training available, and increasing opportunities for people to choose the programme most suited to them. These are admirable provisions, but they are all from the focus of the learner as the receiver. We think it would also be helpful to have an employer-led influence on this process. The Government themselves have used the expression &#147;demand-led&#148;. We think this is what &#147;demand-led&#148; means.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09070252000083"></a>Amendment 93 would secure that, at the very least, consultation with employers and their representatives would have to take place. In this way, employers could hope to have a direct influence on courses of training and education. Does the Minister not accept that this approach would help local communities match skills to real jobs, which would then help to increase employment? We would argue that, particularly at this time of economic difficulty, it seems not only appropriate, but, indeed, urgent that the Government should do all they can to increase the education, training and skills of our population. The critical focus of this skilling-up should be on how best to match these skills to real jobs, so it seems appropriate that the LEA should have to consult employers and their representatives on the availability and suitability of provision within their area.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09070252000084"></a>Amendments 104 and 105 further develop this point. As the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has pointed out, the Bill already states that LEAs must encourage employers to participate in the provision of education and training, so we support the idea that this should also include consultation with employers and their representatives. As it stands, the Bill seems to require only a one-way dialogue. The LEA must &#147;encourage&#148; employers to participate in this provision. We on these Benches would argue that this is completely to miss the point. It is important that there is a two-way  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_338"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 338</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>conversation between employers and their representatives on the one hand, and the LEA on the other. We should not presume that the LEA is always in a position to command the employer to interact with the education process. It is not inconceivable that the employer might sometimes be better informed as to what new provision would be useful or necessary. So we fully support the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, to make sure that the LEA must also consult employers and their representatives.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09070252000085"></a>Amendments 182, 183 and 188 mean that employers and their representatives must also be included in the consultation process for those areas where the chief executive of Skills Funding is responsible for education. This also seems to be a sensible approach to an area that, after all, must be employer-focused and employer-led. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="09070252000086"></a><b><a name="90702-0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09070252000406"></a>Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> I, too, support the amendments. The LEAs will require all the help that they can get to secure these places. I say that not least because I read today in<I> Children &amp; Young People Now</I> that staff will be transferred from the Learning and Skills Council, but that in some places there are no staff, only a massive number of vacancies&#151;for example, in the London area. Will the Minister say what will happen? They will not be transferring staff from the LSC to the local authorities, they will be transferring vacancies, so how will the staff be able to undertake all the extra tasks that they have got to do?</p>

<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="09070252000087"></a><b><a name="90702-0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09070252000407"></a>Baroness Blackstone:</b> On the face of it, this is a rather sensible group of amendments. Obviously it is very important for LEAs to consult sector skills councils. They are probably a better route than employers&#146; groups because they think very carefully about education and training needs. My experience of consulting employers more generally is that they are sometimes not terribly clued up about what particular types of education and training are required for the sort of jobs which they seek to fill. However, I am not sure whether this really has to be in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09070252000088"></a>I have no idea what the Minister will say, but I am not absolutely convinced by the amendment in that I cannot believe that any local education authority that takes on this general duty, which is what the clause is about, could properly do its job of developing sensible routes down which it should go to ensure that those  in the immediate post-compulsory age group of 16 to  18 year-olds have the right opportunities for education and training. I absolutely support the spirit that lies behind this, but it is probably best to consult the sector skills councils than an all-embracing category of employers.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09070252000089"></a>The other point is that social work is, and needs to be, an all-graduate profession, so I am not sure that apprenticeship is the best route for people who will be social workers, although there is a strong case for having an apprenticeship route for those who will be in support roles in residential care for children or the elderly, a small percentage of whom might want to go on to be social workers. That, rather than an apprenticeship for social work per se, is the right way in which to approach this.</p>

I quite agree that it has been very important to raise the status of social work by introducing a degree. I also quite agree that it is also very important that we recognise that child and family social workers must have a sound understanding of the law and make sound analytical decisions about children in families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09070252000091"></a>I also hear what the noble Baroness says about certain other circumstances. It has been put to me that it is important to have an apprenticeship route into social work as a starting point from which there is an opportunity to move to a higher academic level&#151;to degree level&#151;so I agree absolutely with what she said. My argument is that at the beginning there might be a foundation stage. One would not be a qualified social worker, but one would take steps towards being one. That would be the apprenticeship aspect of the qualification. The Open University already offers that sort of apprentice first step into social work.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09070252000092"></a>There might have been a little absurdity in what I said about local education authorities consulting local authorities about availability, but I simply want to be reassured that they will look inward as well as outward.</p>

It is perfectly true that the sector skills councils are where the serious thinking about the nature of training and so on is going on, and consultation with them is key and a starting point. Nevertheless, further education colleges are, by their nature, local institutions and it is the local employers, on the whole, who will be providing the apprenticeships. They are the ones who have to be engaged sufficiently to understand the value of providing apprenticeships. My experience of negotiating with employers is that this is the last thing on their list of priorities. They have other urgent priorities in keeping their businesses afloat and they need a lot of persuasion and engagement if they are going to make a real success of the apprenticeship scheme. So I have a great deal of sympathy with the idea of consulting local employers, getting to know them and pushing ahead in their minds the importance of the apprenticeships that they will offer.</p>

I share the view that local authorities, when engaging in the commissioning process and drawing up plans, need to encourage employers to participate. We could have a semantic debate about exactly what that means but I do not want to. I agree with the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that we want employers to be involved in the consultative process&#151;and not just employers but also sector skills councils and others. The noble Baroness, Lady Perry,  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_340"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 340</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rightly reminded us of the reservoir of knowledge and experience that exists in the colleges. They have the contact with the employers and they know exactly what the needs are. We need a coherent, holistic approach to this.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09070252000095"></a>We all agree that partnership working is the way ahead and that consultation will take place. By its very nature as a customer-focused service, having insights into employer needs and getting feedback from employers will be central to the delivery of services by the National Apprenticeship Service and, indeed, all the other services that will be housed within the Skills Funding Agency. This means that active engagement with employers and others will be a part of its core activity. We have already said that we will reflect further on whether direct reference should be made in the Bill to consultation by the chief executive of skills funding with employers, sector skills councils and others, and I repeat our genuine commitment to reflect on that.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09070252000096"></a>Employers will also have a key role to play alongside local authorities in ensuring that there are sufficient high-quality training options for learners, improving the choice available to young people and ensuring that they have a range of options to choose from. We are putting in place arrangements to ensure that this engagement happens at every level, although we have tended to focus on employers, and I understand exactly why we are doing that. The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, spoke about their role and said that we talk about a demand-led process. We do and we stand by that. But &#147;demand-led&#148; does not just mean employers; it means learners as well. We have to embrace both if we are serious about reflecting on and reaching the needs of young people&#151;and not-so-young people&#151;in this process. I make a plea that in this debate we do not forget, when we talk about this being demand-led, that we are embracing not just employers but also learners.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09070252000097"></a>Clause 41 places a new duty on local authorities to encourage employers to participate in the provision and delivery of post-16 education and training. I echo the point made by my noble friend Lady Blackstone that it is hard to envisage a local authority that would not want to engage with employers, who, after all, are going to be the source of wealth generation within their communities. It is vital that they are brought into a consultative process.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09070252000098"></a>Local authorities are well placed to perform that duty. They have a wealth of experience in dealing with employers, particularly through their education business partnerships and their existing local strategic partnerships. Employers are also critical members of consortia and the 14 to 19 partnerships in delivering 14 to 19 reforms in local areas. When we talk about employers being engaged at every level, we mean that; indeed, they already are. At a regional level, the employer voice will be heard through the regional development agencies and membership of the regional planning groups, which have an interest in ensuring that the economic and skills agency for the region is reflected in local authority commissioning plans.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09070252000099"></a>That said, the arguments in relation to consultation with employers by local authorities are different from those that apply at the national level to the chief executive of skills funding. The main relationship with  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_341"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 341</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the sector skills councils will rightly be with the National Apprenticeship Service. Local authority engagement will be through the provision in new Section 15ZA that requires local authorities to co-operate with the chief executive in the provision of apprenticeships for young people. We feel that these are the appropriate channels. Of course, employers make up and lie at the heart of the sector skills councils. A requirement on each of the 152 local authorities to consult directly every sector skills council would place a significant burden on them. They have to be cognisant of what sector skills councils are doing. However, when we talk about placing a requirement on them to consult directly, we have to recognise that there are 25 sector skills councils. We want to ensure that, when local authorities are drawing up their commissioning plans, they are responding to the needs of employers and learners.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09070252000100"></a>While I understand that you might want to include a direct duty on local authorities to consult local businesses on the exercise of their duties under new Section 15ZA, we need to look at how that will function and whether there really is that need to do it in that way. First, it is a natural consequence of the duty in Clause 41 on encouraging local businesses to provide apprenticeships and other training that there will be a consultative dialogue. Secondly, this dialogue is already happening through the education business partnerships, existing local strategic partnerships and, at a regional level, the regional development agencies. It would seem unnecessarily burdensome to overlay that with a further requirement to consult. Thirdly, there is already an expectation that local authorities will consult their communities on issues that affect them, which they would do anyway in the normal course of events. Finally, employers will also be involved in co-operation arrangements with colleges through the duties in Clause 248, which were introduced by amendment in another place. I hope that all this reassures the Committee about the centrality of employers to these reforms.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09070252000101"></a>I turn now to specific points that have been made and, first, to a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. I agree that chambers of commerce have an important role to play. Last year, I spent a lot of time going around them when they were dealing with things like skills pledges. They will have a seat on the employer reference group. In addition, the Secretary of State will issue guidance to the Skills Funding Agency about whom it should consult. We expect that to include the CBI, the British Chambers of Commerce and, probably, the Federation of Small Businesses.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09070252000102"></a>At the moment, I do not think that I am empowered to deal with the noble Lord&#146;s point about jobcentres and managers. If I had a view, I would not necessarily dismiss the approach, but I would say that we should ensure that jobcentres are able to respond to the circumstances that currently prevail and to deal with a wide range of people. I know that some of those who go into jobcentres and agencies are people who would not normally have been expected to be in that situation. We need to look at how that service is being provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09070252000103"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, asked about LSC staff transferring to local authorities. We are still working to match LSC staff to posts in local authorities. We must and will ensure that local authorities have the skills to conduct these functions. If there are vacancies, we will identify them in time to enable local authorities to access staff with the right skills before the transfer is effected, subject to the passage of the Bill. We take on board the noble Baroness&#146;s point&#151;we have to deal with the vacancy situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09070252000104"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, asked about apprenticeships in social work. That is being considered by the social work task force. We are talking about a work-based qualification. I noted the range of views that were expressed on this issue. I share the perspective of the noble Earl, who said that we should not rule out an apprenticeship route. We may in the end determine that a degree is required, but a vocational route would seem to be of benefit in attracting a wide range of people to social services. That is not to denigrate in any way the requirement for degree qualifications.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09070252000105"></a>In conclusion, I say that wherever you look in the process of commissioning and engagement, we are involving employers. I stress that we need to ensure also that young people between 14 and 19 have real choice through information, advice and guidance. We want to ensure that the autonomous providers&#151;schools with sixth forms, FE colleges, academies, private training providers&#151;can each determine their capacity, ethos, curriculum and methods of delivery, own their own buildings and land and employ their own staff. They clearly possess autonomy and are involved in the commissioning process. Local authorities are strategic leaders in their area, bringing a holistic view to the commissioning of all services for young people. Employers, as I said, engage through local strategic partnerships, which drive local area agreements.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09070252000106"></a>I repeat our commitment in relation to putting sector skills councils in the Bill. We indicated our concern not to introduce anything that would make the Bill a hybrid. We will look at that concern. I repeat also our assurance that we are as concerned as all noble Lords to ensure that there is a clear understanding. We are talking not just about participation by employers but about making sure that they are involved in the consultation process. We will look also at that and come back to noble Lords to make clear exactly where employers will be involved in the commissioning process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09070252000109"></a>We understand noble Lords&#146; concerns that we get this right. I have tried to make the point that, when we are talking about consulting, with each local authority consulting sector skills councils, we need to get that

We want to make sure that, in getting employer consultation right, which we need to do, we do not create a burden that they cannot fulfil.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09070252000110"></a>I repeat the two commitments that we have made on this issue, in relation to employers and the role of sector skills councils. I hope, in pointing out the areas where employers are already both represented and part of that commissioning process, that the mover of the amendment will be prepared to withdraw it. We will come back before the Report stage. That is a clear commitment.</p>

The Minister made the important point that we are talking not just about participation but about involvement. The noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, said that she does not think that this needs to be in the Bill. I think that this notion of consultation does need to be in the Bill, because of this element of involvement. That would be very helpful. I take on board the fact that the Minister is thinking hard about whether we can accommodate the sector skills councils. I would point out that, as far as Amendment 93 is concerned, we are not suggesting that local authorities need to consult all the sector skills councils. The amendment says &#147;including, where appropriate&#148; the sector skills councils, and it would be only those sector skills councils that were involved with the particular industries in the locality&#151;at least, that is what I envisage.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09070252000112"></a>I think that the notion of consultation is important. A great many employer organisations have been talking to many of us about their feeling that employers are a little bit taken for granted. Clause 40 is all about local education authorities having to take a view on what is needed in the provision of education for 16 to 18 year-olds in their area. I agree that &#147;demand-led&#148; refers both to employers and to young people&#151;that is also important&#151;but to some extent young people vote with their feet. We need to know that, if there is a shortage of a particular skill in an area, that is taken into account in the planning process. That is where the whole process of consultation comes in. I am grateful to the Minister for his commitment to think about this further and bring it back. With those assurances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

LEAs will specifically have regard to the learning difficulties of their population of learners in determining  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_344"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 344</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provision, including those under 25 subject to a learning difficulty assessment. Furthermore, there is a clear duty on LEAs to secure only &#147;suitable education and training&#148; to meet the &#147;reasonable needs&#148; of persons in the area. This is a straightforward and equitable way of allocating resources. The long-standing concept of reasonableness is well established and of course is understood in law. It limits access to provision which may be unnecessary and, importantly, reasonableness takes into account financial cost. In addition, local authorities are required to provide for the efficient and effective use of public funds and, of course, are audited on that basis.</p>

<a name="90702-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09070252000114"></a>Despite these clear limits on what LEAs have a duty to provide, the Bill offers a further qualification for LEAs to avoid post-16 education provision that gives rise to &#147;disproportionate expenditure&#148;. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, who has already expressed our shared fundamental concern about this issue, and indeed our amendments could well have been debated together. I ought to clarify that the Special Educational Consortium shares our discomfort with the term &#147;disproportionate expenditure&#148;, particularly in relation to local education authorities, and agrees that reference to it should be deleted from Clause 40 altogether, as per this amendment.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90702-0004.htm"/>


<a name="90702-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09070252000115"></a>I am also concerned that the extra barriers faced by disabled people in developing their skills are most likely to incur additional costs that could be judged as disproportionate. LEAs may refuse a service by arguing that the provision is either unsuitable or unreasonable, but where these arguments have failed, I strongly believe that they should not have this further get-out option. The Government have argued that new Section 15ZA(5) specifically states that the provision is not to be viewed as giving rise to disproportionate expense just because it is more expensive than something comparable. In practice, this does not set any restrictions on how LEAs can define &#147;disproportionate expenditure&#148;. On the contrary, where a learner has identified suitable education provision that meets their reasonable needs, they should have the right to access it whether or not they are disabled.</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09070252000116"></a>We do not expect a blank cheque, of course. However, the issue of expense often arises where the needs of a learner with a disability can be met only in an expensive, out-of-county residential placement. Where this happens, we believe the problem to be the lack of good quality local options rather than a person with a disability claiming disproportionate resources. Until the system can offer a better choice of provision, we hope that individual disabled people will not have their life chances curtailed because the only suitable placement is relatively expensive. In terms of redress, during the Committee debate in another place, the Government indicated that an individual may challenge an LEA if they feel that the authority is wrongly using disproportionate expenditure as a defence. However, I feel that it is not appropriate to leave it to the individual to enforce the duty on the LEA through judicial review where this will be an additional barrier to disabled people as well, of course, as associated costs. I am deeply concerned about the responsibility this places on people with a   


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_345"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 345</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>learning disability, particularly those with limited support, and so I fear that failure to provide them with suitable education and training may frequently go unchallenged.</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09070252000117"></a>I have a number of specific questions around disproportionate expenditure about which the Minister has been given prior notice. Perhaps noble Lords would like to hear them. If expenditure is to be deemed disproportionate, what would it be disproportionate to? For instance, should it be measured against a local authority&#146;s overall budget, the education budget, expenditure on other students or limits set by other local authorities? New subsection (5) states that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="09070252000291"></a>&#147;Provision is not to be considered as giving rise to disproportionate expenditure only because it is more expensive than comparable provision&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070252000277"></a>Is expenditure therefore disproportionate if it is significantly more expensive? If so, how much more? Would it be twice as much, or perhaps 20 per cent more? I hope that the Minister can clarify how local authorities should measure expenditure in order to judge what is disproportionate.</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09070252000118"></a>The word &#147;reasonable&#148; is well established and understood by the courts in relation to disability legislation, and it includes cost considerations, but so far as I am aware, the meaning of &#147;disproportionate expenditure&#148; has not been decided by a court. Why is this confusing term being used instead? How do reasonable needs and disproportionate expenditure interact? Is it possible to have a need that is completely reasonable, bearing in mind that &#147;reasonable&#148; is a term that considers cost, and yet for that need not to be met if it is considered to incur disproportionate expenditure?</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09070252000119"></a>Finally, it is dubious why provision that specifically &#147;might give rise to&#148; disproportionate expenditure should be avoided. The wording implies that potential future costs should be considered by the local authority. Does this, for instance, mean that someone might be denied provision in their local authority just because years later it could oblige an authority to provide that provision to many more learners?</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09070252000120"></a>As regards Amendment 143, Clause 40 creates a general duty on LEAs to secure suitable provision for post-16 education, but it does not give any more entitlement to provision than already exists. This means that, to a large extent, the provision available will be at the discretion of the LEA. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it will be absolutely vital to ensure that LEAs are required to monitor and report on their performance so that they can be held accountable to the public for their decisions.</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09070252000121"></a>In Committee in another place, the Government argued that structures are already in place to ensure that local authorities can be held to account for the delivery of their new duties under the Bill. LEAs will become part of the existing outcomes-focused performance management system supported by government offices, and they will also be assessed and inspected by Ofsted. We feel that these mechanisms are not robust enough to ensure LEA accountability and we need a far more targeted accountability mechanism.</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09070252000122"></a>The amendment is particularly concerned with how an LEA&#146;s performance of this duty towards learners with learning difficulties will be audited and how, in  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_346"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 346</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>particular, the failure to provide suitable education to learners with more complex needs will be monitored and addressed. However, improving accountability can only benefit all learners and allow LEAs to map provision and address gaps in the market appropriately.</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09070252000123"></a>The amendment mirrors the sufficiency duty contained in the recent Childcare Act, a widely supported measure at the time. The Government state in their guidance that the childcare sufficiency duty is designed to help local authorities to identify the nature and extent of the need for provision and, where there are gaps, plan how to support the market to address them. The measure includes giving scope for a three-yearly review of the provision for people with disabilities and learning difficulties. Young people with disabilities and learning difficulties would be involved in the audit and the results of the audit would be published. This process will go to the heart of ensuring that the apprenticeship scheme leads to truly positive outcomes for learners with a learning disability and would avoid the past mistakes of many courses which ultimately lead nowhere. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09070254000002"></a>As to the proposed new clause in Amendment 143, again as the noble Lord, Lord Rix, has said, it is necessary that local authorities should have a more targeted approach to those with learning difficulties. The proposed new clause sets out in detail precisely what is required. We have all had experience of how there are often difficulties in delivery despite the legislation that has already been passed, and it is useful to spell out in some detail precisely what is required. I give my wholehearted support to both amendments.</p>

The paragraph enters the proviso that the LEA must make the best use of its resources and must not provide for anything that would,</p>
<ul><a name="09070254000071"></a>&#147;give rise to disproportionate expenditure&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070254000061"></a>I am curious about how the Government intend to enforce this area of the Bill. While it is admirable, it will be difficult to enforce for two main reasons. First, it will be difficult to measure what the best use would be of an authority&#146;s resources, given that it will have to provide very different services for a range of diverse groups of people. Each group will have its own needs  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_347"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 347</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and concerns, and I cannot see how the LEA will decide which service will accord with the best use of its resources.</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09070254000004"></a>Secondly, and this echoes the concerns expressed by other noble Lords, this provision may provide the get-out clause for local education authorities that are on a tight budget and might therefore seek to reduce spending on providing for those with learning difficulties or other disabilities. I sympathise with the LEAs in this respect; we on these Benches think that the devolution of the duties involved in providing education will stretch resources and put a great deal of strain on already struggling authorities. Nevertheless, it is also vital that those with learning difficulties or any form of disability are not left behind.</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09070254000005"></a>Subsection (5) of the new section attempts to  clarify that expenditure should not be considered disproportionate just because it may be more expensive than comparable provision. However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said, more clarity is still needed if we are to ensure that LEAs are able to run educational provision that will include all relevant people while simultaneously making the best use of resources.</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09070254000006"></a>Amendment 143 seeks to ensure that local authorities have a duty to carry out assessments of the sufficiency of the provision of suitable education for learners with learning difficulties. I will be interested to listen to the Minister&#146;s response to it, given that I am not sure how, without such assessments, it would be possible to ensure that provision for learners with learning difficulties was being adequately provided. If such an assessment cannot be made, how will it be possible to make improvements to the system? I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

While I entirely support what the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and two opposition Front Bench spokesmen are saying about the importance of providing adequate provision for those who have special needs, and about the fact that such provision might cost more than would be the case for young people without those special needs, I cannot believe that that is what lies behind the inclusion of this clause. I am sure that the Minister will put us right on that issue.</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09070254000008"></a>My problem with the clause is that I cannot quite understand why we need to say in legislation of this sort that a local education authority should make the best use of its resources and that it should avoid provision that gives rise to disproportionate expenditure. It goes without saying that every local authority should make the best use of its resources in everything it does and should not have disproportionate expenditure, which I take to mean unnecessarily high expenditure when it could be done just as well for less money.</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09070254000009"></a>Why has this clause been put in the Bill? It looks like central government, in teaching-grandmothers-to-suck-eggs mode, telling local government what to do. We already have extensive regulation of local government expenditure, with a lot of pressure on value for money through the work of the Audit Commission. We already have Ofsted inspecting local education authorities&#151;not  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_348"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 348</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>just their educational provision but the work of the authorities right across the piece. In that inspection of work, Ofsted is looking at value for money and at whether a local authority is having regard to its expenditure and making the best use of scarce resources. This, frankly, is overegging the pudding.</p>

The previous time the Committee sat, more or less the last thing we discussed was&#151;as the first amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Rix, puts it&#151;these few lines in question. As the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, has pointed out, they merely add to the confusion and raise worries that may prove to be false. That may not be the Government&#146;s intention but these lines are quite clearly confusing the issue. Which bits of these six lines are the most important in which situation? That is one question that we have not had answered.</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09070254000011"></a>I gave examples from my own experience of where people say, &#147;We can&#146;t do it if it&#146;s something new&#148;.

The noble Lord, Lord Rix, pointed out that we have a good concept of reasonableness established in law, while the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, has said that this seems to be confusing because there are already audits and tests for what is best value for money on various occasions. Why do the Government desperately need this? If they get rid of it and go back to established principles, they will probably save everyone a great deal of time and energy.</p>

I cannot help but reflect on one word that crops up over and again when one considers the provision of these services: consistency. My noble friend has already mentioned that there is a problem; certainly, in different parts of the country there are different provisions for people with the same need. That is something that I am sure we would all like to see eliminated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09070254000015"></a>As my noble friend has said, Clause 40 says that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="09070254000065"></a>&#147;A local education authority in England must secure that enough suitable education and training is provided to meet the reasonable needs of persons&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070254000062"></a>However, there is another complicating factor on top of the inconsistency that that will expose between all the local education authorities. Clause 59, which we have not yet come to, says that the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency,</p>

<p><a name="09070254000063"></a>So on top of the inconsistency of the local education authority provision, we now have the YPLA responsible for funding. Is there any intention that the YPLA should be directed to make certain that there is consistent funding for all this provision? Otherwise, what is the situation into which we are going to be launched?</p>

From some of the briefing that I have had from the department, I think that the intention behind this was in fact a good one: at the same time as hoping that there would be value for money, which is a perfectly sensible thing to say, the intention was that the local education authority would take into account the special needs of people with disabilities. I have some sympathy with the Government, but equally I feel that they have made the situation worse. Maybe the answer will be to take the whole thing back and try to do it as simply as possible to get the message across.</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09070254000017"></a>Above all, I was going to make the same point as my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham. We all know that there is inconsistency and a postcode lottery as far as local education authorities are concerned. By no means are those with most resources necessarily the most generous. Let us put it like that. I hope very much that we will get some reassurance. I hope that there will be something rather more dramatic from the Government, and that they will take this whole thing away. Quite clearly, it is not going to work. That was outlined in the other place and it was definitely stated again in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

I will concentrate particularly on the use of the word &#147;might&#148; rather than &#147;would&#148; in line 37 of subsection (4)(e) of new Section 15ZA of the 1996 Act. It seems quite inevitable that this subsection will lead to less provision for those with learning difficulties because the way in which it is phrased means that a local authority is bound to pay what seems unnecessarily immense caution to just the possibility that there might be disproportionate expenditure in the future. I am aware of how much effort and energy goes into providing often excellent provision for those with learning difficulties. There will, it seems, inevitably be a restriction in that provision if we do not do something about this whole section of the Bill and, in particular, line 37. I hope that the Minister will be able to comment on the use of the word &#147;might&#148; in that line.</p>

It activates a principle that is often referred to in this House&#151;inclusio unius est exclusio alterius. If you apply a specific requirement to a particular

Therefore, it gives precedence to making the best use of resources only in this case, and reduces the pressure on local authorities in any other provision within this statute. I have been told by lawyers again and again that that is the effect of doing this sort of thing, so I hope that the Government will pay close attention to what the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, said.</p>

I think it established the principle that there needed to be assessments if the duty was to be complied with. I also ask the Minister&#151;perhaps he would be kind enough to write to me&#151;to assure the Committee that there is a sufficient mechanism to ensure that there is an assessment of whether the learning needs of young people in care and care leavers are met. I am grateful for what has already been done in the Bill for care leavers, particularly in securing sufficient apprenticeships as young people leave local authority care. A local authority should have a fair idea of how many young people leave care each year and should be able to seek employment opportunities and apprenticeships to meet that need. I would be grateful to hear what sort of mechanisms are in place in that regard, especially since we know that local authorities have not, until now, been very good at providing apprenticeships.</p>

Subsections (4)(e) and (5) ensure that. That is in learners&#146; interests because if local authorities commission particular provision in a way that does not give value for money, there will be less money available to support other learners. I know that throughout this debate noble Lords have taken the view that this is somehow a get-out clause and that is its sole purpose. That is by no means the intention and I will demonstrate why that is the case as I proceed.</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09070252000146"></a>There is a real need for us to ensure that, even in special needs provision, we are still getting value for money. It is not an attempt to say that we do not want to go down a particular route. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Rix, could find a number of examples of where he would have to choose between providers and might find that one offered better value for money than another. It is not an attempt to avoid responsibilities or not provide a service. We are trying to make sure that, in getting the best value for money, we can reach the widest possible group of people who need this service. We are all starting from the same intention and should not see value for money as meaning that we will deny people rights and opportunities. I would argue that it is the other way round. We are making sure that more people get the opportunities, services and support that they need.</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09070252000147"></a>This is not about comparing the provision needed for one group of learners against the provision needed for different groups with different needs and saying

It is about looking at the needs of young people and the provision available and commissioning the provision that meets those needs, while also providing value for money. Requiring value for money when commissioning education and training is not a new requirement. Under Section 2(3)(e) of the Learning and Skills Act 2000 the Learning and Skills Council is required to,</p>
<ul><a name="09070252000299"></a>&#147;make the best use of the Council&#146;s resources and in particular avoid provision which might give rise to disproportionate expenditure&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070252000148"></a>There is no suggestion that this requirement has in any way affected the LSC&#146;s ability to provide appropriate learning provision for young people with learning difficulties and disabilities. Indeed, one consistent message to come from the conversations that I have had with Skill, the RNIB and others in the past few weeks is that the LSC has a very good track record in this area, despite having this disproportionate expenditure criterion.</p>

Local authorities are entirely different. They have complex structures, increasingly stretched budgets and political considerations. There will be far more scope for local variability and considerable risk that some disabled people will miss out, based on a local authority&#146;s circumstances and their particular problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09070252000151"></a>It was felt that it would be helpful to replicate this provision for local authorities. Although they already have a general duty, under the Local Government Act 1999, to secure value for money, this does not apply to the YPLA. By giving both local authorities and the YPLA a comparable duty which specifically relates to education and training provision, we can be sure that they approach such issues in the same way. If the proposed amendment was made, the commissioning system could, in fact, be less effective.</p>

<a name="90702-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09070252000152"></a>There can be no question that replicating this clause is somehow a get-out clause for local authorities. As I have already mentioned, their duties to secure provision for all young people in their area, including those with learning difficulties or disabilities, is set out clearly in new Section 15ZA. We would not want to do anything to undermine this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09070252000153"></a>Let us look at the track record. Funding for specialist provision has increased significantly over recent years, from &#163;35 million to fund 3,000 learners in 2000, to &#163;180 million for 3,500 learners in 2006-07. The DCSF has made available additional funds through the Invest to Change programme to improve provision for learners with learning difficulties locally. We are committed to continued investment in this area and we have been clear that this will remain a priority when responsibilities transfer to local authorities. This clause is about ensuring that we make the very most of this investment for the benefit of the young people at whom it is aimed.

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09070252000154"></a>Amendment 143 would introduce a new duty on local authorities to conduct a full assessment of the suitability of provision for learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities at least every three years. The noble Lord, Lord Rix, raised this issue at Second Reading and this amendment has been modelled on that included in the Childcare Act 2006. As my noble friend Lady Morgan has written to the noble Lord to explain, we are putting in place a system to ensure that this planning function takes place. However, we do not feel it necessary to legislate for this specific administrative process and I am happy to set out the reasons why for the Committee now.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09070252000155"></a>I should like to reassure the Committee and my noble friend that we are putting in place a system which will ensure that this essential planning process takes place annually, as part of the annual commissioning cycle, and not just every three years, as proposed by the amendment. Local authorities will not be on their own. They will come together, and they have already agreed to do this, as sub-regional groupings that will act as planning bodies. We will support them to build on their existing expertise in this area. They will be required to have regard to guidance on this annual commissioning cycle&#151;this is the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Rix&#151;which will be set out by the YPLA in a national commissioning framework. This guidance is currently being developed in collaboration with our key delivery partners and stakeholder groups, including the National Association of Specialist Colleges. We are not trying to develop this guidance on our own. We are consulting the people and the representative bodies that we know are experts in this field.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09070252000156"></a>There will be a dedicated national team in the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency for learners with learning difficulties and disabilities. Regional specialists will provide advice and expertise to local authorities to help them in, among other things, planning specialist provision across local borders, something we know is vital. The React team based at the Local Government Association is already working with authorities to prepare them to take on their new responsibilities. It is also important to remember that local authorities will not be starting from a zero base. Local authorities will already have been working with many of the young people concerned as they were growing up. They already hold a significant amount of information about their needs through the client case load information system database and will be further supported in future with strategic analysis and historic data on learner trends and local needs, provided by the YPLA.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09070252000157"></a>Accountability was raised by a number of noble Lords. There is a range of ways in which local authorities will be held to account. As part of the existing system, local authorities will be performance-managed in relation to the outcomes of young people in their area. Government offices will provide support and challenge to ensure satisfactory performance. Assessments and inspections by Ofsted and other inspectorates will provide a further check on local authority performance.

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09070252000158"></a>I want to come back to some points that were made. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, raised the issue of consistency. As I said to the noble Lord, Lord Rix, the consistency we hope to achieve will be through the national commissioning framework and a national funding formula and we seek consistency in all areas. If necessary, the YPLA can be directed by the Secretary of State, through Clause 73, and we will examine whether there is a problem as this rolls out, subject to the passing of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09070252000159"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, tends to see the glass as half-empty rather than as half-full, in this area, certainly, and maybe in others. We will seek to increase the entitlement because, by providing value for money, more money will be available for more learners who need it most. The right reverend Prelate expressed his concern that the driving force would be to have less provision. We would say, look at the track record. We still had disproportion there. In fact, we have increased support and that is right, because we know that demand has increased.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09070252000160"></a>I was asked about &#147;disproportionate&#148; as a comparator. The comparison is between the provision and its cost. Is the cost proportionate, taking all relevant considerations into account? This is about value for money. That is why new Section 15ZA(5) says what it says. Relative cost is not the only thing for local authorities to consider. Others will explain better than I can that value for money is not necessarily about getting the cheapest&#151;we know that from bitter experience in many circumstances&#151;but about getting the best that you can for the money. A local education authority will have to make its own decisions about the best use of resources. It will definitely have to consider its own budget and may well look at what other LEAs are spending for guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09070252000161"></a>My noble friend Lady Blackstone says she cannot believe that what we are doing is necessary; that it goes without saying. Why are we doing this? Well, there is a general duty, as I think she referred to, in the Local Government Act 1999, which already applies to local authority functions, but not to the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency, which has specific value-for-money duties similar to those in Clause 40(4)(e) and (5).</p>

The danger is that every single piece of legislation brought to this House or another place that entails expenditure by local authorities will then have these clauses put in them. That is what I am seeking to prevent. Perhaps the Minister will take this back and consider whether we need to replicate it here. I can see why the Government may have needed it when legislation was introduced on the Learning and Skills Council some years back, but it looks to me as if there has been an automatic application of what applied to the

Three people have sadly died, all of whom had underlying health problems.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09070252000170"></a>Since the first UK case was confirmed on 27 April, health protection officers, NHS staff from across the UK, and Department of Health officials have been leading the fight to contain the virus. Last week, we started to see a considerable rise in swine flu cases, and the emergence of hotspot areas in London, the West Midlands and Scotland. Since then, cases have continued to rise significantly. There are now, on average, several hundred new cases a day.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09070252000171"></a>This creates challenges on the ground and pressure on services, but the response from the health community has been tremendous. I hope the House will join me in putting on record once again our sincere thanks to the staff in the Health Protection Agency and the NHS, general practitioners and all those who work in primary care. Our efforts during the containment phase have given us precious time to learn more about the virus, to build up antiviral and antibiotic stockpiles, and to develop a vaccine.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09070252000172"></a>We have always known it would be impossible to contain the virus indefinitely, and that at some point we would need to move away from containment to treating the increasing numbers falling ill. That is why last week I announced the move to the outbreak management phase. This gave hotspot areas, where there is sustained community-based transmission, more flexibility to deal with the virus.</p>

Cases are doubling every week and we could see more than 100,000 cases per day by the end of August, although I stress this is a projection only. As cases continue to rise, we have reached the next step in our management of the disease. Our national focus should be on treating the increasing numbers affected by swine flu. Based on experts&#146; recommendations, and with the agreement of Health Ministers across all four Administrations, I can today tell the House that we will now move to this treatment phase across the UK. This will mean that in England the Health Protection Agency will take a step back and primary care will take the lead in diagnosing and distributing antivirals.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09070252000174"></a>There will be an immediate end to contact tracing and prophylaxis in all regions; GPs will now provide clinical diagnosis of swine flu cases rather than awaiting laboratory test results; and primary care trusts will now begin to establish antiviral collection points where necessary. This new approach will mean an end to the daily reported figures from the Health Protection Agency.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09070252000175"></a>Our policy on schools is that they should not close because of individual cases of swine flu but they could close if the particular local circumstances warranted it. For example, there may be grounds for closure if a significant number of pupils or teachers are ill. The HPA will advise on outbreak control issues as usual and closures would be reported to the Department for Children, Schools and Families.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09070252000176"></a>I must emphasise to the House that the Civil Contingencies Committee has had lengthy discussions, drawing on expert scientific advice, about who should be treated with antivirals if they contract swine flu. Health Ministers across all four Administrations have  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_356"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 356</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noted clear scientific advice that the majority of cases in the UK have so far not been severe, with those catching the virus making a full and fast recovery, though a minority of people here and overseas have had more serious illness and some have died.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09070252000177"></a>As we move into the treatment phase, Ministers have considered whether we continue to offer antivirals to all patients displaying symptoms or whether a more targeted approach should be adopted, focusing on those most at risk of becoming more seriously ill. When very little was known about the disease&#151;and especially given the reported fatalities in Mexico&#151;using antivirals prophylactically was sensible to protect people, and may have helped contain the initial spread of the disease.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09070252000178"></a>During the containment phase, experts have had time to study the virus. Some experts now suggest that since the virus has proved largely mild, antivirals should be used only to treat those in designated &#147;higher risk groups&#148;; that is, those more susceptible to developing serious illness or complications. These are all the groups at risk from seasonal influenza, plus pregnant women and children under five. They argue that overusing the drugs can increase the chances of antiviral resistance, and exposes too many people to the risk of side effects from the medicine.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09070252000179"></a>The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies says that, on balance, the science points towards a targeted approach, but acknowledges that this is a &#147;finely balanced&#148; decision. Expert advice points to the fact that, as this is a new virus, its behaviour cannot be predicted with certainty. Swine flu is different from seasonal flu in that most serious illnesses have been in younger age groups, as happened in all three 20th-century influenza pandemics. A doctor faced with a symptomatic patient cannot yet predict with certainty the course of their illness and whether or not they will be in the small proportion who may become more seriously ill.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09070252000180"></a>Given this, we have decided to take a step-by-step approach. This means that, as in the outbreak management phase, we will continue to offer antivirals to all those who have contracted the illness. However, it remains a matter of clinical discretion to decide whether antivirals should be prescribed in individual cases, particularly in circumstances where doctors are likely to be contacted by patients with coughs, colds and the worried well, in addition to those with swine flu. Expert advice emphasises the high importance of treatment with antivirals of those in the higher risk groups, so we will issue clear guidance to doctors to ensure that those at higher risk get priority access to antivirals within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09070252000181"></a>I acknowledge that this is a cautious approach. Many people will be able to recover from swine flu without the need for antivirals, and may therefore choose not to seek treatment. However, we are much closer to the time when we will receive the first doses of pandemic flu vaccine. This will potentially offer high protection. In the mean time, it is prudent to use our only current measure against the virus&#151;antivirals&#151;to the maximum effect. The science indicates that as we discover more about the virus and develop a more precise categorisation of risk groups, we are likely to reassess our approach and move to a more targeted

We will keep this matter under review, with advice from SAGE, and will update the House as and when this is necessary.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09070252000182"></a>Today we will set out these new arrangements through a short guide that will be e-mailed to NHS staff, and will be available online to the public. I know that local GP surgeries and hospitals, particularly in hotspot areas, are coming under increased pressure. So it is important that we do everything we can to reduce the strain on local health services and begin to establish and use alternative routes for people to receive treatment. Initially, this will be via www.nhs.uk or the swine flu information line; subsequently, it will be via the National Pandemic Flu Service.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09070252000183"></a>So, if people think they have swine flu, they should first go online and check their symptoms on www.nhs.uk or call the swine flu information line on 0800 1 513 513. If they are still concerned, they should then call their GP, who can provide a diagnosis over the phone. If swine flu is confirmed, this will give them an authorisation voucher, which a flu friend can take to an antiviral collection point to pick up their antivirals. This may be a pharmacy or a community centre.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09070252000184"></a>As cases rise further, we will move to a system whereby cases are diagnosed and dealt with by the National Pandemic Flu Service. This will take pressure off GPs by allowing people to be diagnosed and given their antiviral vouchers either online or via a central call centre.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09070252000185"></a>Today, I can tell the House that preparations are now at an advanced stage, and that we expect the service to be ready when it is needed. At that point, if people have swine flu symptoms, they should go onto the National Pandemic Flu Service website, or ring the dedicated call centre. However, people in the higher-risk groups should still contact their GP.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09070252000186"></a>Finally, I would like to update the House on vaccines. We have now signed contracts to secure enough vaccine for the whole population. We expect the first batches of vaccines to arrive in August, and around 60 million doses will available by the end of the year&#151;enough for 30 million people&#151;with more following after that. Administering vaccines will need to be prioritised. We will make a decision on this when we know more about the risk profile.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09070252000187"></a>Most cases of swine flu have been mild and we are in a strong position to deal with this pandemic. But we must not become complacent and, while doubt remains about the way the virus attacks different groups, today&#146;s decision on the move to the treatment phase reflects our caution.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09070252000188"></a>I commend this Statement to the House&#148;.</p>

<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_358"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 358</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>coming weeks. The national and local response to this situation is quite rightly under continual review, and I accept that it is now appropriate to modify our approach to the way that we tackle the disease. Our emphasis now, as the Minister said, has to be on mitigating its impact on those who have contracted it, taking into account the severity of the virus. That must mean that we make sure that those who are most at risk of severe morbidity or complications as a result of the virus are treated rapidly.</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09070252000191"></a>Against that background, I have a number of questions. Am I correct in understanding from the Statement that the stockpile of antivirals will be reserved exclusively for symptomatic patients and those who are seen as being most at risk, and that post-exposure prophylaxis is no longer a strategy that will be pursued, other than with the approval of a GP? I ask this because I wonder about particular situations; for example, what is the policy to be applied in prisons? Are healthcare staff and employees of the emergency services not seen as possible deserving cases for post-exposure prophylaxis?</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09070252000192"></a>Can the Minister confirm that a decision on whether to close a particular school will be taken on the basis of a risk assessment by the HPA, particularly in the context of the year groups involved, but that closure of a school should no longer be seen as the preferred option, as I think it has been up to now? Most schools are about to break up for the holidays, which is fortunate, but this means that when term is about to start again in September there may be insufficient information available on which to base a decision on closure. Will schools be advised about the transmission rates in their own areas and other relevant information, including what they should do before the start of term?</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09070252000193"></a>What advice is being given to the public as regards avoiding exposure to potential infection? It has been reported in the press that there is a school of thought which states that it is in the interests of fit and able-bodied people to try to contract the virus in order to build up immunity to what may be a more severe version of it in the future. Can the Minister take this opportunity to indicate that this is not sensible advice and that the current virus, although milder than initially feared, is nevertheless capable of making people ill or, indeed, very ill, and that the prudent course is to try to avoid it?</p>

<a name="90702-0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09070252000194"></a>The Minister said that swab tests for swine flu are no longer being taken as a matter of routine and that, as a result, the running total of cases will no longer be a matter of public record. I am sure she will agree that that is unfortunate, and I cannot help observing that if the flu line were up and running, that situation would not have arisen, because we would have had a better handle on the numbers. However, can the Minister confirm that the collection points for antivirals are now determined in all areas? Can she also confirm that the interim helpline for those who suspect that they may have contracted H1N1 is working satisfactorily and that it has the capacity to deal with the very high volume of calls which are likely to arise during the next few weeks? If there are likely to be many tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of new cases by the end of August, what guidance has been issued to NHS trusts to enable them to cope with the high

What is the Government&#146;s view of the capacity of our system to cope with critical care cases on the scale that is implied? Has modelling been done which shows the probable impact of severe cases on critical care beds? What is the clinical attack rate of this virus?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09070252000195"></a>Finally, the Statement referred to the vaccine currently in preparation. The question of who is given the vaccine will be decided, in the words of the Statement,</p>
<ul><a name="09070252000300"></a>&#147;when we know more about the risk profile&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070252000281"></a>Can the Minister elaborate on what is meant by this? Do we not already have sufficient information to tell us who is most at risk? If not, when do the Government expect that we will have enough to go on? The Government have, after all, already defined the at-risk groups as regards the use of antivirals. At all events, will the Government undertake to make public the basis of prioritisation once this has been determined?</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09070252000196"></a>I end by joining the Government in expressing my condolences and sympathy to the families of those who have died of the virus. I also pay tribute to the staff of the NHS, including officials, GPs, those in primary care, in pathology labs, in hospitals, and the Health Protection Agency, who are working so hard on our behalf. We wish them well during what look certain to be some very difficult and pressurised few weeks ahead.</p>

I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement in this House. Given the dramatic increase in the number of people who have contracted flu, it is right that we should reassess whether the strategy that the Government have been following continues to be relevant and the right course of action.</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09070252000198"></a>While the Government&#146;s actions to date have rightly been focused on trying to contain the virus and then to mitigate the effects of its transmission, there is a parallel activity to monitor the information about the incidence of the disease and to evaluate the effectiveness of the NHS response. That is in many ways as valuable an activity. It will set out some valuable learning points, were there to be a future pandemic of another disease. I put my questions to the Government in that light.</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09070252000199"></a>The noble Baroness said that the Government were now moving to the treatment phase. I understand the reasons for that, but what lessons have been learnt from the containment phase of the strategy? She indicated that there had clearly been a failure to contain the virus. That failure was not entirely unexpected, but what have the Government learnt so far about the ability of the NHS to contain outbreaks? How would that be of value in any future pandemic? To what extent has the progression of the epidemic matched predicted modelling, which I believe the NHS has undertaken for some considerable years?</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09070252000200"></a>I have one nagging question about the Statement. Was the decision to offer antivirals only to high-risk groups made purely on scientific advice or was it an economic decision as well? What is the department&#146;s response to that?</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_360"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 360</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09070252000201"></a>The noble Baroness made the important point that there will be a changed role for the Health Protection Agency. It will now step back and the immediate registering and treatment of the virus will go to primary care, in particular to GPs. Has the department estimated the extent to which drawing back the HPA from its front-line role will jeopardise the tracking of data that it has been gathering about the progression of the pandemic? Does the changed role of the HPA offer any risk to the spotting or detection of a mutated virus? The noble Lord, Lord Darzi, recognised as a key problem the chance that the virus might mutate, which could mean that the antivirals that we have are not so effective.</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09070252000202"></a>Following the noble Earl, Lord Howe, I ask what the Government plan to do, particularly over the critical period of September, October and November. During that period, the start of the academic year, not only will schools be going back but a number of students will be coming to this country to universities. As always, we welcome them, but that will coincide with the peak activity period for the seasonal flu programme. Is the department now preparing to give additional plans and guidance to primary care staff to cope with a potential spike in demand over those three months?</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09070252000203"></a>Can the noble Baroness update the House&#151;this was not in the Statement&#151;on the liaison that the Government have had with foreign Governments and with the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta and the European health observatories? We can then track any parallels or distinctions between the progression of the virus in this country and its progression abroad.</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09070252000204"></a>In the Statement, the noble Baroness mentioned the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies&#151;the aptly named SAGE. She said that the change in policy to target only high-risk groups was based on SAGE&#146;s evidence but that that decision was, in its words, &#147;finely balanced&#148;. How quickly have the Government acted on the advice that SAGE has given to date? How quickly could they act were SAGE to give different advice if that balance changes in future?</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09070252000205"></a>I, too, congratulate the scientists and front-line practitioners in the NHS on the way in which they have approached this pandemic. It is clear that the NHS has had to deal with a most difficult public health problem. Individuals recognise that it is a public health risk, but it is one that they cannot measure and quantify; they do not yet know how serious this condition will be for them and their families. So far, the NHS has managed to keep the tenor of its information campaign correct. In the face of some rather hyperbolic headlines, the NHS is to be congratulated on having got on with doing a difficult job in a temperate manner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09070252000207"></a>The noble Earl asked about the policy of antiviral prophylaxis and treatment. There will be an end to antiviral prophylaxis in the norm. Treatment will be for those at higher risk of becoming severely ill. There will continue to be a clinical discretion to offer antivirals to any patient should the need arise, particularly those who we recognise would need that support, such as health service workers. I had not thought of prisons; that is a good case. I will refer that back to the department for consideration. I am sure that somebody there will have thought about it.</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09070252000208"></a>On school closures, as I said in the Statement, the HPA will help with the risk assessment, but this is not now seen as a preferred option. The noble Earl made the point about schools being about to break up and restarting in September and about our need to ensure that the information is available to them so that they are in a state of preparedness. It is a point well made. Indeed, it is in hand. Running alongside the activity of moving to treatment is a huge communications campaign to inform people and health service workers. That will make sure that schools and all those who need to will know what is going to happen and how it will happen&#151;in what order&#151;in a timely fashion.</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09070252000209"></a>Who will be offered antivirals? The use of antivirals for prophylaxis will stop. As I said, they will be used only in exceptional circumstances. With transmission in the community, the policy of widespread prophylaxis is no longer appropriate. There will continue to be clinical discretion to offer antivirals to any patient should the need arise. They will be offered to people who are diagnosed with swine flu. Anyone who thinks that they have swine flu has the right to ask their GP for the health service to provide them with antivirals.</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09070252000210"></a>The noble Earl raised the issue that I had anticipated about what the media have called &#147;swine flu parties&#148;. The Chief Medical Officer has made a firm statement about that, which I can do no more than repeat:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="09070252000293"></a>&#147;We would never recommend intentionally exposing anyone to swine flu. It is seriously flawed thinking to allow the virus to spread unabated through swine flu parties. We don&#146;t yet know enough about the risk profile of the virus and, whilst it has been mild in the UK, in some parts of the world young, previously healthy, adults have died. Parents would never forgive themselves if they exposed a vulnerable child (perhaps a contact of a child at a party) to serious illness. We need to be mindful of any future development of the virus and we remain vigilant in monitoring the disease&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09070252000211"></a>What support is being made available to primary care trusts, GPs and the health service? We are aware that GP practices must expect to be under considerable pressure during the flu pandemic. I have already mentioned the local flexibilities that we have introduced in the hot spots to enable primary care to sustain its response. The national flu service has been designed to minimise the pressure on GPs and primary care teams in a widespread outbreak by allowing patients to receive their antiviral medication via the web, a telephone call or a local network. That means that GPs can concentrate their expertise on treating patients whom they would normally see, plus those who have complications of the flu, as opposed to the potentially very large number of patients who think that they might have flu. Our

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09070252000212"></a>How will intensive care manage this? We know that fluctuating demand for and capacity in the NHS are part of normal working activity, but in May we published guidance for the NHS entitled <I>Pandemic Flu: Managing Demand and Capacity in Health Care Organisations</I>. We are giving support as far as we can.</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09070252000213"></a>Communication is very important. A communications strategy goes with this, which I have already outlined. The flu surveillance information on infections is co-ordinated and collated by the Health Protection Agency Centre for Infections. It receives regular reports from separate schemes run in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, which use the data provided by networks of GPs. The GP network includes 3,300 surgeries covering more than a quarter of the UK population and provides reports on symptoms of flu in patients as part of the QSurveillance system. A further 100 surgeries across the country collect information on flu symptoms as part of the Royal College of General Practitioners&#146; surveillance. That is during the normal flu season but the fact that we are moving into this new phase does not mean that we will not be surveying and counting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09070252000214"></a>The noble Earl asked how we predict the disease will progress. Obviously, we cannot predict the spread of the disease precisely, but we know that it has proved to be mild, except in a very few cases. Apart from the figures that I gave in the Statement, I cannot give any further information. The noble Baroness and the noble Earl asked how we will manage the transition. At the moment, we have an interim service, which we felt we needed to introduce immediately because of the increase in swine flu. We recognise that it is important to ensure that the systems are sufficiently tested before they are used. The interim solution has now been tested. It has the capacity to cope. A full programme of testing has been built into its delivery line, before a full system kicks in in the autumn.</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09070252000215"></a>The noble Baroness also asked about the lessons that we have learnt from the hot spots and the period that we are just passing out of. The Health Protection Agency, with the NHS, has done an excellent job in limiting the spread. We have learnt that what we need to do when we realise that we have hot spots is immediately to give flexibility locally to reduce the number of patient swabbings, to reduce the pressure on GPs to allow them to treat symptomatic patients on the basis of their clinical judgment, to ensure that other staff such as primary care nurses can swab and to ensure rapid access to antivirals. That is the phase that we are moving into now. The lesson that we have learnt is that that is how we need to proceed.</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09070252000216"></a>On the international situation, we fully recognise the importance of ensuring proper protection for countries in Europe and globally. I probably need to write to the noble Baroness about the spike of students coming back to this country in September and October; that is a point very well made. We support the European Commission in helping those countries without contracts to obtain vaccine for a minimum of 5 per cent of their population. We continue to work with the ECDC and

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09070252000218"></a>The Minister will be aware that the House&#146;s Select Committee on Science and Technology this morning met the Minister of State for Public Health to take evidence on this and related matters. The first piece of evidence was that a Statement would be made later in the day. However, I can fairly say that that did not inhibit what was a vigorous but good-natured discussion. One piece of evidence available to us and to the relevant Minister was from the Royal College of General Practitioners. I agree with all that has been said positively about the important role that general practitioners play, but there were some questions in the evidence that we received. For example, headings coming through the website from GPs included lack of information and conflicting advice and variation in support from primary care trusts. There was a positive side to those topics as well, but there was a serious expression of concern from the royal college, which represents the first-line troops in this area.</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09070252000219"></a>Can the Minister assure us that the effectiveness of the provisions in the Statement will be measured? It would be wrong to say that the jury is still out, because the jury is still taking evidence about the effectiveness of the policies outlined. It would be good if we could be assured, for example, that organisations such as the royal college will be consulted and that the information coming back from its network of GPs will help to inform the modification of government policy in the weeks and months to come.</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09070252000221"></a>The point about information is well made. In preparing myself for the Statement, I went online and tested it by Googling and other ways. I decided that I had swine flu and filled in the questionnaire to see what happened at the end. I did not use the phone, because I thought that that would be improper, but I thought that it would be useful to see how those things work. I must say that I found them both easy and accessible. I know that not everybody has access to the internet and would know how to do that, which is why the telephone line and the telephone number that went out to every household are so important.</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09070252000222"></a>I take the noble Lord&#146;s point, and am absolutely sure that the royal colleges will be fully involved in both consultation and evaluation as we move forward. Plans are being finalised at the moment at both national and local level to communicate to GPs and service users about what will be expected of them when the service is introduced. The exact nature of those messages

Communications to GPs will be through existing Department of Health channels. That will mean, for example, that in hotspots, where we know there is a great deal of pressure, the distribution of antivirals might not be through local pharmacies; it might be through a community centre. It might be done in a way that removes pressure from the existing health services. On the other hand, in a place where that is not the case, it will be done through the usual GP and pharmacy services.</p>

The arrangements for the National Pandemic Flu Service in each devolved Administration are still being finalised, and are, of course, the object of consultation and agreement as we move forward. This is not something that can possibly be imposed on anybody: it has to be done through co-operation. While it is the case in England that we are taking the precautionary approach as outlined in the Statement, at present in Scotland and Wales they are more likely to confine their antiviral treatments to high-risk groups. But as we discussed already, scientific opinion is very balanced on that issue.</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09070252000225"></a>I think my noble friend is asking me, &#147;What do I do if I wake up and think I might have swine flu?&#148; The answer is, that you check your symptoms if you are online, with www.direct.gov.uk or www.nhs.uk, or you phone the flu line. If you are still concerned, you should phone your local GP, who will be able to provide a clinical diagnosis over the phone. If swine flu is confirmed, they would give you a voucher number which you should give to your flu friend. A flu friend is, obviously, a neighbour or relation or somebody near you who could collect those antivirals from a collection point.</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09070252000226"></a>As the number of cases rise, we will need to move to a different system, where cases are diagnosed and dealt with by the National Pandemic Flu Service, to take the pressure off GPs. For those people who are isolated or vulnerable, the job of GPs and the National Pandemic Flu Service, when it kicks in, will be to deliver antivirals to people&#146;s homes.</p>

I think there is still some confusion as to how we are going to move from what the noble Baroness described as the interim arrangements for the distribution of antivirals, to the full-blooded national flu line service, which will bypass the GPs and the existing channels and give the patient, diagnosed over the telephone, a number with which they can collect their antivirals from a collection point. I would be grateful to know whether there will be a specific decision on when we move from the interim arrangements to the final arrangements. Will that be generally across the country or will that happen region by region, as appears appropriate?</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09070252000228"></a>I remain very confused about the Government&#146;s policy on this. Like my noble friend, I regret that the full-blooded flu line was not up and running by the end of May, as had originally been promised. We now are not going to have it until the autumn. Therefore, it seems to me that the transition from the interim to the final scheme is a very important stage, and I wonder if the Minister could tell us a bit more about that.</p>

<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="09070252000229"></a><b><a name="90702-0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09070252000445"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord is exactly right. That is why we are we are clearly calling this an interim phase. That means that the Health Protection Agency is stepping back from front-line response, and primary care is taking a lead in diagnosing and distributing antivirals. We are ending contact-tracing and prophylaxis in all areas, and will now be identifying by clinical diagnosis or from the pandemic flu service. People who are diagnosed with swine flu will be offered antivirals. We are preparing the National Pandemic Flu Service for launch within the next couple of weeks, and my understanding is that it will happen across the UK&#151;although if that is wrong, I will write to the noble Lord and the House about that. That will provide people with alternative routes to access antiviral treatment, and will relieve pressure on primary care. The noble Lord raises exactly the key point: this has to backed by a full communications strategy, aimed both at the health service and the general public, to explain why things have changed and what this means for people. That is a major part of this work.</p>

<a name="90702-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09070252000230"></a>We are finalising the plans for the public communications on the move to the treatment-only approach. There is some potential for regional variation in the initial approach, and it will partly depend on the amount of pressure that is brought to bear on the local health service in that area. So in areas like parts of London, where there are very large numbers and large demand, the collection of antivirals will be provided by other means. The strategic health authorities are already testing the PCTs&#146; ability to do that and the operational arrangements to do that. We also recognise that there has to be a clear rationale behind who will or will not get antivirals, and that has to be communicated clearly in our national messaging. The noble Lord is quite right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09070252000232"></a>I want to concentrate on asking her about community preparation and the responsibility of the general public in this whole situation. I was pleased about the very brief mention in the Statement of flu friend networks, and then about her more positive comments made since then in her answers to questions. It seems that these networks are going to be crucial in getting to people whom other people will not get to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09070252000233"></a>I was also very pleased that the Minister affirmed that she recognised that there are many people without access to the internet. Indeed, there are those who have no access to phones. One of the most important things in this situation is to do all that we can to ensure contact with those who are the most deprived in our communities and who may well fall through welfare gaps. Churches and faith organisations have a particular responsibility, in that they are among those who may have contact with those who do not fit in with the way in which our society normally operates. What are the Minister&#146;s reflections on the need to get to those who will not be found by many of the methods about which she has spoken so well in the Statement and in her previous answers?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09070252000235"></a>In addition to publishing extensive guidance for social care providers, people will be encouraged to build up networks of flu friends from among their family, friends and neighbours who may be willing to support them should they become ill and need not only someone to collect their antiviral medication from the nearest collection point and deliver it back to them but other support: namely, food shopping and getting in basic supplies. Everyone may be vulnerable during a widespread outbreak, although people with pre-existing conditions or a lifestyle that leads to their being vulnerable may be in much worse circumstances. That is why churches and third-sector organisations have a key role to play in identifying needs and supporting people, particularly those who are socially isolated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09070252000236"></a>Third-sector groups, charities and churches could be flu friends to vulnerable and hard-to-reach people and contact them through their local strategic co-ordination group.

These are civil preventive orders that are designed to protect the public from the most dangerous violent offenders: those offenders who continue to pose a high risk of serious harm to the public at the end of their licence or term of imprisonment.</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09070252000243"></a>On application from the police, a magistrate&#146;s court may impose a violent offender order containing prohibitions and restrictions on an individual. These restrictions may prevent the individual from going to any specified premises or place, attending any specified event or having any contact with a specified individual.   


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_368"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 368</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The restrictions can prohibit: residence at a particular address&#151;for example, in the vicinity of a previous victim or known criminal associates; contact with a particular individual&#151;for example, a previous partner who has been a victim of domestic abuse; or attendance at certain events&#151;for example, extremist rallies where the offender has a history of violence. Additionally, a person subject to a violent offender order will have to comply with the notification requirements of the order. An offender will need to inform the police annually of basic details such as his or her name and any aliases used, date of birth, home address and any other address at which he or she regularly stays.</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09070252000244"></a>The breaching of a violent offender order or its notification requirements is a criminal offence that is punishable by up to five years&#146; imprisonment. We are also strengthening the notification requirements for offenders who are subject to a violent offender order who intend to travel overseas or who identify themselves to the police as having no sole or main residence in the UK.</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09070252000245"></a>The police currently have a limited ability to monitor these offenders. It could clearly pose a public protection risk if police officers could not track the location of these individuals because they may be out of the country or have no sole or main UK residence. We want to close down the possibility that those subject to a violent offender order could exploit the notification requirements deliberately to mislead or exacerbate the police management of their risk.</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09070252000246"></a>The proposed amendment to Section 110(5) therefore makes it a requirement for a person subject to the violent offender order notification requirements who has no sole or main residence in the UK to provide his notification weekly rather than annually. More frequent reporting will allow better monitoring of their location and will help to close the loop for individuals who may claim to be homeless to evade the police.</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09070252000247"></a>The proposed amendment to Section 111(1) makes it a requirement for a person subject to a violent offender order and who intends to travel outside the United Kingdom to notify the police of their plan to leave the UK, the method of their travel, the countries they intend to visit and when they plan to return. This will ensure that, should it be necessary, the police can liaise with the authorities in the destination country as appropriate. Importantly, the offender will also be required to notify the police of all their personal details again on their return, which will ensure the consistency of data.</p>

Are they going to have to give information about their whereabouts weekly to the police whether or not they are going to travel? That was not quite clear in the Minister&#146;s statement.</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09070252000251"></a>Arising from that, who is going to keep track of this? One of the conditions in court that one can put on people who are on bail is that they should report to the police on a regular basis. However, the police do not always know whether they have reported or not, and it is not a very reliable handcuff, as it were. I just want to be sure where that information is going, who is going to deal with it and who is going to be running around keeping track of it if the information is not given.</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09070252000252"></a>Secondly, why three days&#146; travel? You can leave the country for one day or 30 days or whatever. I do not understand why this is limited to kick in for somebody who wants to go away for three days and over. You can say you are going away for any length of time. My own view is that it would be better if it kicked in at any time they wanted to go abroad for any length of time. That would make this a much tighter system.</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09070252000253"></a>Is the assumption that the intention of these people is to return? Or is there an assumption that they may intend to come back but it does not matter if do not come back because the information will still be passed on? I only ask that because under the heading, &#147;Additional information to be disclosed&#148;, it says firmly:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="09070252000294"></a>&#147;That the information is&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09070252000301"></a>(d) where the offender proposes to return to the United Kingdom on a particular date, that date; and</ul><ul><a name="09070252000302"></a>(e) where the offender proposes to return to the United Kingdom at a particular point of arrival&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070252000283"></a>They may never propose to come back at all so what is the lock on that?</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09070252000254"></a>One bit of information does not seem to be there. They are asked to give their national insurance number but there is no mention of passports. Presumably at the moment you still cannot leave the country or get back in without some indication of identity or a passport. I would have thought that one of the most valuable bits of information for the police to have would be the passport number, but that is not mentioned. I have no objection to the order but I think it might be helpful if we could have an explanation.</p>

It must be borne in mind that that person will, by definition, have served his period of imprisonment and will have served also the period that may be necessary for supervision after that period of imprisonment has expired. When we made these objections, they were fully supported by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, on behalf of the Conservative Party,  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_370"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 370</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and by noble Lords around the House. Nothing that I say in relation to this order should be taken as in any way diminishing our opposition to orders of this sort.</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09070252000256"></a>It is not surprising that these orders have not been brought into force yet. However, before they are brought into force, the legislation is being altered because the legislation did not, for some reason that perhaps the Minister can explain, stipulate how frequently a person must report if he does not have a home address, as defined in Section 108, which is his sole or main residence in the United Kingdom and he has to give,</p>
<ul><a name="09070252000303"></a>&#147;the address or location of a place in the United Kingdom where he can regularly be found, or if there is more than one such place, such one of them as the offender selects&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070252000284"></a>The Act and the particular matter that we are concerned about today in Section 110(5) says that the applicable period for a notification and for registering is,</p>
<ul><a name="09070252000304"></a>&#147;in any case where subsection (6) applies, such period as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070252000257"></a>We did not know when the Bill was passed how often you would have to report. Suddenly, just before the orders are brought into effect, we are told in one sentence in paragraph 11 of this order that someone has to report every week. What has happened? Why could the Government not make up their mind when the Bill went through as to what the appropriate period was for the homeless person or the person without any particularly fixed abode to have to report to the police? Why now, before the order is brought into effect, is it stipulated to be one week?</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09070252000258"></a>The rest of this order is dealing with very ordinary administrative matters that I do not propose to comment on, but changing the legislation so as to reduce the period to one week is something for which I would request an explanation from the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="09070252000259"></a><b><a name="90702-0007.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09070252000454"></a>Lord Brett:</b> My Lords, I thank noble Lords for their contributions and support, with some questions. I recognise the principled position of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and his party in respect of these orders. A number of points were raised which I will seek to address. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, pointed out that there have been, on other occasions, perhaps not the best of monitoring systems. For violent offender orders, it is intended that the information will be provided by the police and the police will undertake the monitoring of violent offenders. It is an annual monitoring in terms of the information required of someone with a static home, if I can put it that way. For homeless people, I do not think we have changed the legislation. As we said we would do, we have provided in secondary legislation, after consultation with the police and others, that a weekly notification is an appropriate monitoring period for people who are peripatetic or homeless. If people are moving around, they can no doubt inform the police where they will be in a week&#146;s time and report to a police station in that location. If they are static for any period of time, it should not be too onerous an obligation to pop into the police station and say, &#147;I am still here&#148;.</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09070252000260"></a>Why three days? Much of what this order seeks to do in terms of notification for those travelling abroad&#151;for homeless people it is automatic and applies whether they are travelling or not&#151;is based on best practice  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_371"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 371</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from the regimes that currently exist for sexual offenders, who we monitor when they go overseas. Three days, after consultation, was chosen to be the most appropriate period. That has proved successful for another group of people monitored and hopefully will prove successful in this case. The noble Baroness raised the question of passport numbers, which are currently not required. However, we will keep that under review and, if thought necessary, it could be introduced by secondary legislation at a future date.</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09070252000261"></a>The legislation enables the making of regulations to require more frequent reporting of a person of no fixed address. Thus, flexibility was always envisaged. It is preferable to set this at a period which is not too onerous on the individual concerned and yet gives the police the required monitoring information that they need. I hope I have answered the questions of the noble Baroness and the noble Lord. I commend the regulations to the House.</p>

Under Part 4 of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008, certain convicted terrorists are required to comply with a notification scheme. This includes persons  aged 16 or over who have been convicted in the United Kingdom of specified terrorism offences or offences with a terrorist connection and sentenced to 12 months&#146; or more imprisonment or detention, and persons convicted of similar offences overseas who are made subject to a notification order when they come to the UK. The majority of the notification requirements are set out in the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008, but Section 52 allows the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring a person who is subject to the notification requirements to notify details of travel outside the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09070252000263"></a>Public safety is paramount and it is the responsibility of the Government and the security and law enforcement agencies to do everything possible to protect our citizens from the threats posed by terrorism. The notification requirements are an important part of our preventive measures and, as part of that, I believe that the people subject to those requirements should be obliged to notify details of their intended foreign travel plans to the police.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_372"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 372</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90702-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09070252000264"></a>The information required by these regulations will mean that convicted terrorists cannot get around the notification requirements by claiming that they were overseas. It will also enable the police to share appropriate information with overseas authorities or to make a decision on whether to apply to the court for a foreign travel restriction order to stop the person travelling overseas or to particular countries.</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09070252000265"></a>In essence, these regulations impose notification requirements for convicted terrorists in relation to foreign travel which are very similar to those that already exist in respect of sex offenders. They require the person who is intending to travel abroad for three days or more, which we discussed on the previous order, to notify the police before they leave the United Kingdom of their intended date of departure, the country they will be travelling to, their point of arrival in that country and, where they hold the information, the points of arrival in any other country they are travelling to, the carriers they intend to use, the place they intend staying on their first night abroad and the date and place of their intended return to the UK. On return, the person will also be obliged to notify the police of the date and place they re-entered the UK, if they have not notified these details already.</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09070252000266"></a>The information required by these regulations will supplement the other information obligatory under Part 4 of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 in helping the police to manage the risks posed by convicted terrorists once they have been released from custody or detention. The information will, for example, enable the police to know if a convicted terrorist is intending to travel to a country where terrorist training is available. However, I should like to make it clear that, while individuals will have to disclose their travel information, the requirements will not stop the person doing anything. The requirements are not intended as a punishment and the foreign travel notification requirements do not prevent an individual from travelling overseas, nor is notification onerous on the individual. Its purpose is to provide information about the whereabouts of individuals who have been convicted for terrorist crimes that will help the police in managing the risks that they may pose to public safety.</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09070252000267"></a>Due to the serious consequences of a terrorist attack, the police and security service need to be given all proportionate tools to help them become and remain aware of any potential threat or compromise to our safety. Critically, we know that many countries are able to facilitate terrorism and, due to the complexity and increasing international nature of terrorist plots, it is vital to be made aware whether convicted terrorists are to travel to a country where they could prove a threat to public safety.</p>

<a name="90702-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09070252000268"></a>I believe that these measures are justified and will help in the monitoring of potentially dangerous individuals, and the security services have recently stated that they believe these regulations will be of benefit to counterterrorist policy. It is vital to strike the balance between protecting the rights of the individual subject to the requirements and mitigating any potential threat, thus ensuring the safety of the community at

Surely, whether they are being punished or not, the order rightly makes it clear that they are highly undesirable people in many countries. The only countries which probably would welcome them would be those countries which want to train them further in terrorist activity. Therefore, this seems to be a necessary but very longwinded and effuse way of making that point in the order.</p>

For example, if a person comes back into this country and fails within three days to notify the police, he is subject to a potential sentence of imprisonment of up to five years. Is that the same for sex offenders when they travel abroad or is this just a figure that has been plucked from the air by the Government?</p>

On the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Oppenheim-Barnes, the truth is that we are responsible only for our citizens who live the country. They will be subject to the immigration status and visa requirements of any country to which they want to go. They will be a matter for the sovereign country that they are in. In that sense, it fits in, but I do not think that it is a longwinded way of achieving that. We want not to punish individuals who may have turned their back on any form of terrorism, but to ensure that we have the information to enable us to monitor and to protect our citizens.</p>

It would add a paragraph (f) to new Section 15ZA in Clause 40 to impose a duty on local education authorities to ensure that each sixth form must offer A-level courses at least in English, mathematics, the three sciences, history, geography and at least two modern languages. The amendment may appear somewhat prescriptive. Nevertheless, it encapsulates a real concern that many important academic subjects are becoming the exclusive preserve of the independent sector. We think that it is essential that this range of subjects should as a minimum remain open to all those who wish to study them. Surely it is wrong that there should be a disparity in opportunities for choice between the independent and state sectors.</p>

<a name="90702-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09070254000022"></a>My honourable friend in another place, Nick Gibb, quoted the figures from 2006 and it would be helpful to reiterate them. In 2006-07, 145 schools with a sixth form did not enter any students for A-level history;  96 did not enter any for A-level maths; 115 did not enter any for A-level biology; 187 did not offer A-level chemistry; 247 entered no one for A-level physics; and 264 entered no one for A-level geography. It simply is not feasible that no one living in the catchment areas for these schools wanted to study the subjects. Does the Minister not share our concern that there should not be subjects that are allowed to become dominated by the independent sector? Does she not agree that it should be a top priority to ensure that every student has the practical opportunity to study the A-level course that most suits their needs? Does she accept that this is not what is happening at the moment?</p>

<a name="90702-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09070254000023"></a>It should be noted that the subjects listed are not exceptional or unusual. The list is not highly specialised or arcane. These are basic subjects that we might reasonably expect would be provided in any sixth form. The Minister will doubtless tell me that partnerships and federations exist that allow a pupil to travel from one school to another in search of their next lesson, but I cannot accept&#151;at least with regard to these subjects, which should be available to all students as a basic minimum&#151;that this is a useful or productive way for them to spend their time. In another place, the Minister replied:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="09070254000067"></a>&#147;I understand the calls for an A-level entitlement. That is something we have agreed to review in 2013&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill Committee, 17/3/09; col. 318.]</p>

<a name="90702-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09070254000024"></a>Another question might be: why wait? If the Government understand these calls, why wait until 2013 to conduct a review? I beg to move.</p>

While I, too, deplore the discrepancy between the independent sector and state schools&#151;any discrepancy of opportunity is of course to be deplored&#151;I do not think that this amendment is the way to solve the problems that the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, has outlined. We must bear in mind the fact that sixth forms these days are about a great deal more than A-levels. Provision for the 16 to 18 age group is much more diverse than just sixth forms. If a young person wanted to study Latin, psychology or philosophy, for

There are probably plenty of places where the young person could do that. Many young people of that age now do their spread of subjects in more than one setting. Although we have a problem with discrepancy of opportunity in some areas, this amendment is not the way to tackle the issue. That will be done by making sure that adequate resources are provided and that high-quality teaching is available to all young people, not by providing a minimum entitlement of this prescriptive nature.</p>

It is important that young people who want to study these basic subjects are given the opportunity to do so and it is not satisfactory that there are instances at the moment where that is not the case. However, I hope&#151;perhaps the Minister will enlighten me&#151;that the application of subsection (1) will cover this. If a local education authority,</p>

<p><a name="09070254000064"></a>and one such need is to study physics at A-level, I presume that we are now placing that duty on local education authorities. If that is the case, I would like to know&#151;I did not get an answer last time I asked&#151;how that duty is to be enforced.</p>

In recent years, the details of our curriculum have been upside down. Very young children have too much laid down in detail about their education but, as you go further up the ladder, there is too little. It is now widely accepted that dropping the requirement to learn modern languages at the age of 14 or 15 was a mistake. Therefore, I support the amendment, in part because it mentions two modern foreign languages. It would bring back some credibility and rigour to what must be considered for teenagers towards the end of their full-time education.</p>

I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, that sixth forms are about a lot more than A-levels. The amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, puts forward the interesting idea of creating this requirement, but the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, is right in his interpretation of the Bill. We consider that the duty of local authorities to provide suitable education would include access to this list of A-level subjects, which come in the top 10 favourite subjects that young people in this age group opt for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09070254000029"></a>We agree on the importance of the A-level subjects set out in Amendment 95 being on offer to all young people, but making sure that these subjects are on offer to all young people is not the same as making sure that they are on offer in every single institution,

That has never been the case, even before the increases in collaborative delivery. The more specific nature of the study that takes place post-16 has always led to pupils choosing to move between institutions. There has to be a balance. He makes the good point about not wanting to see young people engaged in excessive travel and, of course, local authorities have to take that into account.</p>

<a name="90702-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09070254000030"></a>Amendment 95 would require all sixth forms to offer this selection of subjects. While this will be appropriate for many learners, we think that it is right that decisions about what courses are on offer in what institutions should be determined at a local level. The sixth forms that do not offer all these subjects may not be designated or designed to do so. They may play a different role, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, pointed, in providing diversity of what is available locally and they may do it very well.</p>

<a name="90702-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09070254000031"></a>It is more important to look at whether young people are taking A-levels. The evidence from last summer shows that these subjects are doing very well. The five subjects that saw the biggest increase in entries included maths, English, history and biology. Between them, these four subjects saw increases of more than 11,000 entries&#151;more than half the overall increase in A-level entries last year. Moreover, numbers taking these subjects in maintained schools and colleges continue to rise. I offer that as reassurance to noble Lords.</p>

<a name="90702-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09070254000032"></a>We are not complacent at all about this. We recognise that there is a great deal of work to do. We started recording the type of exam centre in 2005&#151;a very recent event&#151;so we now have the data that allow us to have this debate. Since then, of the subjects listed in the amendment, only geography has seen a very small reduction in entries from maintained schools and colleges, but I reassure noble Lords that it remains in the list of top 10 subjects studied at A-level.</p>

<a name="90702-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09070254000033"></a>Following the 2007 review by the late Lord Dearing, we put in place a range of measures to boost language learning in schools because we, like noble Lords, feel that it is an important area in which we need to do better. This included a &#163;6 million communications campaign over three years to promote the importance of language learning to pupils, parents and the school workforce and reforming the secondary curriculum to make it more relevant and engaging for pupils. We expect that these measures will increase the likelihood that pupils will increase their take-up of GCSE languages, which will then lead, we hope, to a better take-up of language A-levels. We can take heart at this approach because it is the one that we have taken in science and mathematics, where we have seen an impact&#151;increasing numbers of children and young people are opting, importantly, for mathematics. I hope that, with the reassurances that I have given, the noble Lord will consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09070254000036"></a>On the wider point about attracting maths specialists into teaching, we are extremely aware of the importance of doing that and we have been investing through our STEM programme in improving the offer to maths graduates to come into teaching and in attracting maths graduates from other professions, such as the finance sector, to consider coming into maths teaching. Having expert teachers who are qualified in the subject is an important factor in exciting and encouraging young people to maintain an interest, particularly in mathematics.</p>

It puts young people at state schools that have not had the facility to teach further maths in touch with people who have that capability. It is partly online but it also provides young people with face-to-face tuition through extra classes, twilight classes and weekend tuition. It is an example that has been extremely effective and could well be copied in one or two other areas. There is a question as to why, given that we have seen this increase in mathematics at A-level, the Government are now consulting on changing the A-level maths curriculum in 2011. The general feeling&#151;and I was talking only last night to somebody representing the Mathematical Association&#151;is that the formula is now good.

A school may well recognise that there is a demand for four places to study further maths, but it also realises that if it offers such a course, it may well make a loss on it because eight students is about the break-even number for an A-level group. A school might reasonably decide of its own volition that it was not capable of offering the further maths education that the local authority has identified as being needed. Under those circumstances, can the local authority compel the school to offer it? Can it subsidise the school by offering it twice the ordinary rate for students who study further maths?

The local authority and all the other bodies the noble Baroness mentioned recognise that, but if the school was to provide those four places, in terms of what it would have to pay the teacher and what it would bring in as a proportion of those students&#146; funding, it would cost perhaps &#163;15,000 to &#163;20,000 a year to run the course.

Certainly the best of them have become national enterprises. Prisons in Kent are managed by Manchester City College, for instance, while many FE and sixth-form colleges have gained national reputations for what they do. The virtues of Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge are well known, as is Greenhead College in Huddersfield, which attracts students from the south of Manchester, Hull and right up from the far north of Yorkshire and Lancashire. People travel a long way and make great efforts to attend good sixth-form colleges, particularly where they have developed expertise in certain subjects. Where a subject is not particularly mainstream, it is very much to the advantage of students and the educational system that the expertise becomes concentrated. They can then afford to develop long-lasting links with industry, both to inform what they are teaching and to provide the routes by which their graduates go on to obtain employment.</p>

There is a six-stage process of agreement on the funding procedures and the way it moves forward. In the first stage, the YPLA will develop a national framework, working with local authorities. The second stage is that each local authority will assess supply and demand for 16 to 19 provision within its own area. The third stage is that each local authority will then take this assessment to one of the 43 sub-regional groups of local authorities of which it is a member, and the group will agree the commissioning plans within its sub-region. The fourth stage is that these plans will then have to be agreed at a regional planning group, which will scrutinise the local plans and ensure that they are coherent, can be funded within the regional budget and will deliver the 14 to 19 entitlement. The fifth stage is that the plans will go up to the YPLA, which will check them to ensure that they cohere and are affordable and then fund local authorities appropriately; if the YPLA agrees with them, it will send the funding back down to local authorities. The sixth stage is that the local authorities will then pass the funding on to colleges and other post-16 providers. The YPLA also has powers to act as a backstop authority and to intervene if it thinks there is a significant risk that local authorities have not developed robust commissioning plans.</p>

With more players involved than in the current process involving only the single learning and skills councils, what would be the process for reassessing the funding allocation?

Such learners should be referred to the possibility of distance-learning or a Ufi programme delivered by their local provider or hub in Wales or Scotland. If the learning programme is not available through this route, permission to enrol the learners must be sought from the provider&#146;s LSC partnership team&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09070254000059"></a>In January, the Welsh Affairs Select Committee in the other place reported on a cross-border provision of further and higher education and described this LSC funding guidance as unhelpful and inappropriate and urged authorities to see access across borders as something to be encouraged. The Government, in their formal response to the committee, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="09070254000070"></a>&#147;The guidance issued by the Learning and Skills Council ... to further education colleges should not be seen as restrictive or as a deterrent to English colleges responding to the needs of Welsh or Scottish learners. Rather it supports our expectations that individual colleges will focus primarily on their local communities. Where such communities embrace such cross-border travel-to-learn or travel-to-work areas it is appropriate for those colleges to include these factors within their planning and their marketing strategies&#148;.</p>

<a name="90702-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09070254000060"></a>We would welcome clarification from the Minister as to whether new guidance from the DCSF will be issued to the sub-regional groups of the local authorities near the Welsh and Scottish borders. Will it make clear that they can recruit across the border, or will it try to deter such colleges from doing so? Perhaps the Minister can provide us with such clarification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09070269000002"></a>That is not how it is done now. For the past 30 years, as a result of my freeing them from local education authority control, FE colleges have had a glorious golden age&#151;no one can deny that. FE technical and vocational training has never had such a fillip as it has had for the past 30 years, and it has had it because the colleges were freed from the dead hand of the local education authorities. They were allowed to do their own thing, and they decided to provide the courses that local people wanted. They did not go and talk regionally and nationally; they knew what they wanted to do, they knew what the local lads and lasses wanted to do, and they provided the courses for them. They were constantly in touch with the market, always adjusting, introducing new courses for tourism, expanding those for medical services for nurses and cutting back on others that were a lot less popular. That was real freedom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09070269000003"></a>The ultimate solution should be&#151;I have yet to persuade my Front Bench of the value of this argument, but I am working hard on it&#151;that they should return to being free institutions and students should be given vouchers to decide themselves which courses they want to pay for and go to. Let the students decide; that is what choice is about. We are told that the Prime Minister is all about extending choice to ordinary people, but if he really wanted to do that then he would give all qualified youngsters the chance to buy their own education. Is that not freedom? It is not planning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09070269000004"></a>My noble friend&#146;s amendment is very interesting. He is saying that, now that FE colleges are going to be under local education authority control for a time, they should be allowed to recruit students from wherever they want. That is what they have now, the complete freedom to recruit whoever they want. I know one FE college in London which is at the junction of three London boroughs. It recruits from those boroughs and from well beyond; it recruits into Kent as well. Will the colleges have that freedom? The Minister is nodding. I would like him to say one sentence: that no FE college or sixth-form college will have a catchment area. I am sure that my noble friend would like the same sentence from him. That is the real gain.</p>

<a name="90702-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09070269000005"></a>The Minister nodded, so I hope that he will use that sentence, which I will repeat: no FE college or sixth-form college will have a catchment area. The Ministers are looking to see whether that is in their brief; I am sure it is not, but I hope that it will be by the time they come to reply. I hope that they will say that, because it is the essence of freedom and the colleges should have that freedom. Otherwise, local education authorities will restrict them by saying, &#147;We want you to do these courses for our area&#148;, although they might be right next to the boundary of another area that does not want that sort of thing. We should let choice decide this matter. My noble friend&#146;s amendment is important. It goes to the heart of the arrangements in the future and the relationships of FE colleges to local education authorities. If they do not have that freedom, it will be a grave disappointment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09070269000006"></a>The difficulty is enormous: in order to deliver education up to 18, the Government have brought in the Bill and put the FE colleges back under local education authorities&#151;but at the same time they are slashing their capital expenditure. The Ministers know, because the Government made a Statement last week, that 92 projects have been submitted for sixth-form colleges and FE colleges, all of which were approved by the former council. Of those 92, only 13 have been approved. That is not the way to improve the public services that the Prime Minister is talking about and that will improve the opportunities for young people in technical and vocational education; it is holding them back. There is a great debate about whether cuts are going to happen after the next election but, as far as FE and sixth-form colleges are concerned, the cuts have started already&#151;massively so.</p>

I also declare a very different sort of interest: I made my maiden speech in this House welcoming the reforms that gave the further education colleges their freedom from local authorities. Exactly as both my noble friends have emphasised, that has resulted in an extraordinary explosion in both the status and the effectiveness of the further education sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09070269000009"></a>The part of Clause 40 that most concerns me and rather gives the negative answer to the question asked by my noble friend Lord Baker about catchment areas is subsection (4)(d) of new Section 15ZA, which says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09070269000342"></a>&#147;a local education authority must ... take account of education and training whose provision the authority think might reasonably be secured by other persons&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070269000284"></a>That is, presumably, because some college 50 miles away is providing something that is considered to be useful. That is the negative power that the Bill gives to a local education authority to tell a further education college what it may not do. Not only is there a list of things that it has the power to tell the FE college and the sixth-form that they must do, this is a negative power to tell them what they cannot do. I find that extremely worrying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09070269000010"></a>My noble friend referred to one college&#151;which may be the one that sprang to my mind, namely Lewisham College in south London&#151;which has been working voluntarily and extremely fruitfully with its neighbouring local authorities to provide 14 to 16 education. It is wonderful example of free co-operation between three local authorities and one absolutely free sixth-form college. That is the sort of thing that I fear would be cut. I see the Minister shaking his head, but of course it would be. Once they have the power, local authorities will begin to restrict things to what is in their own interests, particularly if they are footing the bill. I would very much like to see some absolute assurance from the Minister&#151;which I am sure he will get from his briefing&#151;that while the local authority will fund the colleges, it will not necessarily control them. I am afraid that the whole of Clause 40 is about control and I find that absolutely wrong in view of everything that I have seen happen in the past 20 years.</p>

The case has been argued extremely well by the noble Lord, Lord Baker, who brings his past knowledge and continuing study of this area to the debate. We are all concerned about control. Certainly, if you look at the work of the Association of Colleges over the years, its standards have been rising considerably, as we have heard. It is interesting to note that it is particularly helping those from the most deprived backgrounds. Something like 68 per cent of those in receipt of education maintenance allowance study at a college; and 13 per cent of the 16 to 18 year-olds are from deprived backgrounds, compared to 7 per cent in maintained schools. There are a number of such figures which really show that the Association of Colleges has increasingly acted as a facilitator of the talents that we all need to see developed to the full in all our children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09070269000013"></a>One part of me welcomes the fact that local authorities are taking over education. I will come to that later. In prisons, as we all know, maybe the governors had other ideas about what the priorities for young people&#151;and indeed older prisoners who would clearly benefit from further forms of education or apprenticeships&#151;should be. It is the business of control that we are all concerned about. The point about moving from one local education authority to another is absolutely basic, is it not? You have to be able to cross boundaries. Clearly a lot of this is happening now anyhow&#151;for example, if you are in a prison in one area and your home is in another. I have looked hard at the section that noble Lords want to change. I originally read it in a rather more positive way, but the more I looked at it, the more it worried me. Perhaps the Minister could take a further look at it, to see if it could be made more reassuring. I just have this instinct that the intention is the opposite of what we have all foreseen.</p>

Assuming that this is forthcoming, it will be good news. And yet&#151;here I share the concern of my noble friend Lord Elton&#151;it does not seem to be very clear in the Bill, hence this amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09070269000015"></a>One of the great benefits of sixth-form and, particularly, further education colleges is that they should be encouraged to specialise and so attract large numbers of students from outside their respective immediate areas, and indeed, outside the remit of their local authorities. The very nature of these colleges depends on being able to offer specialised education which is  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_386"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 386</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>therefore able to be of a much higher standard. Can the Minister reassure your Lordships that local authorities will continue to accept that students should be allowed&#151;indeed, actively encouraged&#151;to travel to different colleges for specialist courses? I think that most noble Lords in the Chamber would agree that the independence of these colleges has secured a virtuous cycle&#151;the more a college has specialised, the more it has attracted students from distant locations, and as it has started to attract students from far and wide to a particularly good course, the more the college is able to specialise. This must, surely, be allowed to continue.</p>

I reassure the House that this is the last thing we want. It is that very freedom of colleges to innovate and improve, through having strong governing bodies and business models that respond to the needs of learners, that has brought much of the growth and improvement in the further education system. The provisions in this Bill do not affect the independent, incorporated status of these colleges, or their business plans. Colleges will still own their own buildings. They will still own their own land. They will still command their own budgets. They will still make their own decisions about what courses they offer. They will still appoint their own staff.</p>

From next year, local authorities will be commissioning from all providers and will be responsible for performance-managing those that choose to be designated as sixth-form colleges, but this does not amount to control.</p>

With the raised participation age, we want local authorities to focus on ensuring that every young person has access to a high-quality and engaging learning offer to enable them to participate, irrespective of where the institution they choose to study in is located. In answer to his specific request, I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Baker, that there will not be such a catchment area defined; the funding will follow the learners. That is the situation that currently exists and we do not want to do anything to undermine it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09070269000024"></a>Section 15ZA(4), inserted by Clause 40, already sets out that local authorities must act with a view to encouraging diversity in the education and training available to persons and to take account of education and training whose provision might be secured elsewhere. This is the very essence of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09070269000025"></a>We will not accept any limitation of learner choice as a result of these changes. It will not be sufficient for a local authority to commission all its provision from one type of institution, even if that were possible. While there are many excellent colleges and school sixth forms in almost every local authority area, it is hard to see that any local authority would be able to meet its duties in new Section 15ZA and fulfil the needs of all its 16-19, or 19-25 year-old, population from commissioning provision just within its boundaries or from one type of provider.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09070269000026"></a>For learners who cross the Scottish or Welsh border, the national commissioning framework, issued by the YPLA, will include guidance in relation to these learners and will be clear that commissioning should focus on the needs of the learner and be based on participation, rather than where learners are resident.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09070269000027"></a>The 43 sub-regional groupings, reflecting young people&#146;s travel-to-learn patterns, will work to ensure local authorities meet the diverse needs of young people in their area and increase opportunities for young people to exercise choice. We believe that the funding should follow the learner. This brings me on to Amendment 103. New Section 15ZB of the Education Act 1996, inserted by Clause 40 of the Bill, requires local authorities to co-operate with each other when securing suitable education and training for young people, and young adults subject to a learning difficulty assessment. This duty underpins the establishment of sub-regional groupings, and beyond. These arrangements will be key to ensuring that commissioning reflects the travel-to-learn patterns of young people. The noble Lords&#146; amendment would require co-operation arrangements to be agreed with the Secretary of State. The formation of sub-regional groupings is predominantly a local decision, as local authorities are best placed to identify how they can best serve their learners. That said, there has already been a degree of national oversight. The formal governance and operational arrangements of the 43 sub-regional groups were assessed by a national panel drawn from key stakeholders inside and outside government, including the Association of Colleges and the Local Government Association. These sub-regional groupings have come together of their own volition because they see the necessity of so doing. They understand that significant numbers of young people seek their education outside their authorities. Therefore, this process is building on what already happens as it recognises the benefits of that.</p>

However, there may be circumstances when a sub-regional group needs to reassess its membership. The Young People&#146;s Learning Agency, whose primary aim is to support local authorities, will be well placed to assist with any review. This is not to say that the Secretary of State will not have an interest in how local authorities perform their new functions. Where co-operation between local authorities breaks down, to the extent that one or more of the local authorities within a particular sub-regional grouping may not be able to fulfil their duties in new Section 15ZA, we have provided through Clause 65 for the YPLA to intervene to secure the provision of education and training. These are reserve powers which we expect to be used only in extremis, as was the case with the LSC, but before that occurs, Clause 65(4) specifically requires the YPLA to consult the Secretary of State. Any intervention under this provision would have to be in line with its intervention policy statement made under Clause 71, which will have been approved by the Secretary of State.</p>

I say to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that local authorities will not determine what provision colleges will make. As regards 14-19 partnerships, the local authority as strategic leader and the providers as the curriculum and professional experts will come together to determine jointly the offer to young people. I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, asked about the mismatch between plans, funding and actual recruitment. Informed plans will be produced for the commissioning process which takes place by March of each year, although I cannot see the precise date. Recruitment will happen in September. Given that funding follows learner choice, money will flow to the colleges where learners turn up; there might have to be a reconciliation process, but we are clear about that.</p>

We do not see it in that light; it is not a negative power. It is about ensuring that local authorities take account of provisions secured by others&#151;for example, they include: the chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency securing apprenticeships for 16 to 19 year-olds; private training providers; and young people travelling across local authority boundaries. Young people need to have choice&#151;an argument which I know the noble Baroness endorses. This is not about control, but accountability and choice.</p>

It is not just a local authority which determines of its own volition; it will have to do this in consultation with colleges. It is important to offer young people choice, the ability to cross boundaries&#151;described by the noble Lord, Lord Baker, in relation to London&#151;or even to travel more widely to national specialist colleges, if they wish to attend them. We are firmly committed to that choice and to sustaining the independence of colleges in an environment where we have devolved funding to local authorities.</p>

However, I became increasingly worried as I listened to it, because all the language being used is about the local authority&#146;s duty and the local authority as a commissioner. The person who commissions provision is in charge of what provision is commissioned. The noble Lord&#146;s answer to my point was that the local authority might decide that because there was a private provider it would not to commission that provision from the further education college. Some further education colleges and sixth form colleges have taken on the private sector and have provided brilliantly, at a lower cost and far better, the kind of course or training which a private provider in the locality was already offering. Why are we shifting away from the freedom of those colleges?</p>

<a name="90702-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09070269000036"></a>Let me try to be clear about the autonomous providers. Schools with sixth forms, FE colleges, academies and so on each determine their capacity. After all, as the noble Baroness pointed out, successful colleges have already attracted their students. The funding will remain with the colleges if they have done that. It will not be taken away; it is quite clear that the colleges have already established their needs and there is no way that those will be overridden.</p>

<a name="90702-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09070269000037"></a>Similarly, because of their autonomy they will determine their capacity, ethos and curriculum offer. I do not want to reiterate that as the main concern of the noble Baroness was their ability to control and to build on an established success. We are absolutely as one with her. We are not taking away any of that. Their commissioning plans can only be built on what is already happening in any particular local authority.</p>

He said that the funding will follow the learner, and, equally, we will see commissioning in advance. As he rightly said, every March a certain number of places will be commissioned at a further education or sixth form college for the following September. If the college recruits well above the numbers that are commissioned, how far is there then reassessment? Will the college be penalised if it recruits more than the commissioned numbers?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09070269000039"></a>There is an overall problem. What if a sub-regional grouping is far too optimistic in its planning for the numbers of young people who will come forward for places and they do not come forward? Presumably it will get less money from the YPLA when things are divvied out again and will have to reallocate that among its colleges.</p>

If we are talking about building on success&#151;that it is what we want to encourage&#151;then inevitably those that are not so successful are going to have a lesser budget. Any planning process relies on the accuracy of the data collected. The point is that real data are building up. It has been gathered from discussions with learning providers in this area. I am sure the groupings will not get it absolutely right. In an endeavour to be helpful in this area of the process of commissioning and to ensure noble Lords that we are in no way attempting to undermine the capabilities of colleges, we shall write to you further on this particular issue. I am happy to do that because I do not want there to be dubiety between us. I genuinely endorse the enthusiasm with which noble Lords have commended what goes on in FE colleges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09070269000041"></a>I can resist anything but temptation and cannot resist responding to the remark made by the noble Lord, Lord Baker, on capital expenditure. I would not deny that there was a bit of hiccup in this&#151;he said with commendable understatement. Yet I make no apologies for the huge investment of well over &#163;2 billion we have put into FE colleges. When I visited my former FE college, once known as Willesden Tech and now the College of North West London, I was presiding over the opening of an impressive new annex. There were clearly mistakes in the current round. That was identified in the Foster review. Yet there has been huge investment in further education. That is why we can see the kind of success that the noble Lord, Lord Baker, was extolling in his contribution.</p>

<p><a name="st_165"></a>
<a name="09070269000047"></a><b><a name="90702-0010.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09070269000392"></a>Lord Baker of Dorking:</b> I thank the Minister for his clear statement that FE and sixth-form colleges will not have a catchment area and will continue to enjoy the freedom that they have. That is most welcome. It will be welcomed by FE and sixth-form colleges across the country. I also fully recognise the amount of money that is spent on FE. It started under the previous Conservative Government and has continued strongly under the present Government. That has resulted in magnificent colleges and national institutions. Matthew Bolton College in Birmingham is a national institution. It is a magnificent, university-standard building. So are the Middlesbrough colleges.</p>

<a name="90702-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09070269000048"></a>However, I have to point out that the handbrake is on. It is not about a foot off the accelerator or stopping the car, but the amount that will be spent in the next three or four years is a small proportion of what has been spent in the past three years. Many projects will not go ahead. This is not quite the moment to debate this, but it is a grave disappointment, because the main instrument of the Government delivering school leaving up to 18 will be the FE colleges and the school sixth-form colleges, and it is those capital programmes that are being slashed to ribbons.</p>

<a name="90702-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09070269000049"></a>I was also glad that the Minister and the whole Government are now keen on funding following the learner. That was not always the case with the noble Lord&#146;s party when we introduced it back in the 1980s and when we introduced per capita funding and did away with block grants. Money following the learner is absolutely right. Everyone agrees with it. I see that the noble Baroness is nodding. Nod a bit harder, because the ultimate conclusion of that is to give the learner the funding, so that learners themselves can decide which course they want to go to. Then you do not need sub-regional and regional planning bodies and government planning bodies; you trust the person receiving the public service. I am told that that is the Prime Minister's policy.</p>

<a name="90702-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09070269000050"></a>Of course funding follows the learner, but there has been a fundamental shift in power, which my noble friend Lady Perry has correctly identified. If we allow local authorities to commission, they will have a power that they have not had for the past 25 years. Local authorities will be under pressure from existing schools, some of which will want sixth forms and some of which will want to extend their sixth forms. They will be under pressure from local councillors who say that they want their school to expand into the sixth form, so that pupils do not go to the sixth-form college.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09070269000051"></a>In the past, that matter was decided centrally by the Government, because they provided the funding. We will go back to lots of local squabbles and fights. I see a Peer who is not actually in the House, but is standing at the Bar, who knows a great deal about education and is nodding. I see lots of nodding opposite. We would like your votes on all this one day. That will be the problem: there will be a lot of local squabbling again, just like pre-1992. That is for another day, but I should like some undertaking from the Minister today.</p>

If I may, I shall walk through my understanding of the process, so that the Minister can interrupt me if I am getting things dreadfully wrong.</p>

<a name="90702-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09070269000053"></a>Let us suppose that a local authority, as part of whatever grouping&#151;perhaps the Minister could let me know what is the grouping around Greenhead College in Huddersfield, so I can see how that meshes with the actuality of travel to learn in that part of the world&#151;decides that it wants to commission, say, 20 new places in strawberry-growing. I chose that because of the badge that the Minister is wearing. It has two FE colleges that might provide this course. They discuss it, and one of the colleges does not want to do it but the other does, so the grouping commissions the second FE college to put on this course. At that moment, the course is commissioned and no money or obligations have changed hands, except that the second college now has to put in place the facilities and the teaching staff to provide the course.</p>

<a name="90702-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09070269000054"></a>If the thing has been commissioned, it has to set up the course in some way or other. If the local authority has commissioned a course, presumably there is now a provider ready to provide it, which means recruiting someone who knows about strawberry-growing, and giving them an office and the equipment they will need in order to teach the course.</p>

<a name="90702-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09070269000055"></a>So the course is then commissioned, at which point the first FE college decides that, actually, it will put on one of those courses too, because it does not want to be left out of this wonderful new market. It recruits somebody to teach strawberry-growing&#151;</p>

There would be no point in doing that, because we are talking about responding to already established needs. It would be a process of discussion and consultation, not one of imposition. I repeat that I am conscious of time and, if the noble Lord does not mind me saying so, I do not think that we can take time to go through the minutiae of the commissioning process. I undertook to write further on this matter, because I think it is important that we try to establish clarity. I merely intervened because the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, implied that if I did not intervene, it meant that I agreed with his analysis, and I am afraid that I cannot on that point. We have explored this subject very well and, in the light of the assurances I have given, I hope he will consider withdrawing the amendment.</p>

As I said, by everyone&#146;s agreement, FE college No 2 has installed this course, and FE college No 1 then decides it wants it too. Nobody can stop it: it has total freedom to set up this course itself. It sets up another course offering 20 places in strawberry-growing, but when it comes time for the students to decide, they all flock to college No 1. College No 1 gets the funding, while college No 2, which had been commissioned by the local authority to put on this course, gets no funding. So that is my understanding of total freedom and of what the Government have promised will be the position. On that basis, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It is by no means the first time that this subject has been raised. It was raised in connection with the Education and Skills Bill only last year. The Minister at that time undertook to take the subject away and bring it back again in the Bill that is now before the Committee. I am very grateful to her for doing that, and for the meetings we have had with her and the Bill team in preparation for Committee on this Bill.</p>

<a name="90702-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09070269000059"></a>What are we probing? The amendments came from an organisation called the Communication Trust&#151;a coalition of 30-plus organisations that are working in the field of speech, language and communication, such as dyslexia trusts and the Autism Trust. I have also talked to organisations that deal with the deaf. We are dealing with a whole spectrum of people who come to the educational arena with problems that prevent them from engaging immediately in it. The trusts&#146; concern is that there is significant variation around the country in the provision of assessment and referral to specialist services for those with hidden difficulties. If you are talking about an education system, it is essential to talk about the ability of everyone to engage with it to make certain that the opportunities are there and that any remedial action is laid down and prepared.</p>

<a name="90702-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09070269000060"></a>I do not want to burden the Committee again with the story of how I came to be involved in all this, but I remind your Lordships that the governor of a young offender prison in Scotland told me that if he had to get rid of all his staff, the last one out of the gate would be his speech and language therapist. I had  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_394"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 394</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>never come across a speech and language therapist in a prison before, and I asked him why. He said, &#147;These young people cannot communicate, and unless they can communicate both with us and with each other, we do not know what is wrong with them, so we cannot start any process of helping them to live useful and law-abiding lives&#148;.</p>

<a name="90702-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09070269000061"></a>I discovered that by carrying out a speech and language assessment, the therapist could find out not only about problems of communication, such as the ability to talk to people, but about healthcare problems, memory loss, hearing problems and the inability to see the blackboard, quite apart from all the difficulties that we associate with learning. Because of that, they were unable to conduct relationships with each other. Relationships conducted with the fist are not the same as those conducted by the voice, so by enabling them to conduct normal relationships, the whole atmosphere in that place changed, as did the relationships between the staff and prisoners. The education and healthcare staff were able to take proper remedial action.</p>

<a name="90702-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09070269000062"></a>Out of that came the clear understanding that because of what is happening around us now, the inability to communicate is the scourge of the 20th century. People do not communicate in families. They do not have meals or discussions together. They do not have the normal life which I am sure noble Lords have had. Then they go to school and cannot communicate with each other, their family or their friends. They cannot communicate with the teacher. If you arrive at school unable to communicate with the teacher, you have a terrible problem to overcome. That is why I said in connection with the statement made by the Education Minister earlier in the week that it is extraordinary that people are allowed to move on from the very basic level in primary school before they have learnt to read and therefore to help communication so they can engage in further education. We therefore damage them even further.</p>

<a name="90702-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09070269000063"></a>Later amendments aim to make certain that every child receives an assessment, before they begin primary school, that will identify what are described as the hidden problems&#151;dyslexia, autism and other learning difficulties&#151;to enable something to be done to prepare them to communicate to begin the educational process. Were the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, in his place, he would tell us that Northern Ireland, sponsored by the National Health Service, has recently passed legislation to make certain that every child in Northern Ireland is assessed at the age of two. You cannot obviously understand all the nuances of the problem at the age of two, but certainly you can identify that there is something which needs to be looked at to enable that child to make progress.</p>

<a name="90702-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09070269000064"></a>Frequently people talk about evidence. I declare an interest as an adviser to the Helen Hamlyn Trust. Following what we discovered in prisons, she funded a child for two years with speech and language therapists in young offender establishments to find out the size and shape of the problem. That trial was conducted by Professor Karen Brown from Surrey University, who wrote this up academically over a period of two years. She proved conclusively that if action had been taken at a much earlier stage, the child would not have

Goodness knows what that meant, other than that their education between the ages of seven and 15 had not been properly conducted because they were not able to engage with it.</p>

<a name="90702-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09070269000065"></a>My reason for deliberately putting down the probing amendment and putting my name to other amendments to other clauses which address this issue, and the issue of young offenders in detention when we come to it, is that, if this education is going to be delegated again to local education authorities, it is essential that spelt out in the Bill is the action that they need to take to make certain that people with these learning difficulties can engage in what local education authorities are now being commissioned to provide. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09070269000067"></a>The earlier the diagnosis of any learning difficulties is made, the more effectively they can be addressed and, hopefully, remedied. Clause 40(3)(b) states that local authorities already must &#147;have regard to&#148; learning difficulties. Amendment 98 would require them to do more than that&#151;to ensure that professional screening had taken place and to follow up with appropriate action. Amendment 101 spells out specific learning difficulties which can, and should, be identified. However, this list must not be regarded as being exclusive.</p>

How frustrating for any child where he or she is not making progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09070269000069"></a>There is inevitably a cost associated with this, but any cost is as nothing compared with the cost to the individual of a diminished quality of life if their difficulties are not identified, and also the cost to society, which stands to benefit socially and economically from each individual who is able to participate to their fullest potential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09070269000070"></a>The Youth Justice Board estimates that around 150,000 children and young people under the age of 18 enter the youth justice system each year and that, of those, about 70,000 are of the current compulsory school age of 16 or under. Fifteen per cent of those have statements of special education needs, compared to about 3 per cent of the general population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09070269000071"></a>The Bercow report found that 60 per cent of the 11,000 people in young offender institutions each year have speech, language and communication difficulties. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, is absolutely right to emphasise the importance of tackling those communication difficulties, which are widespread in the community of young people who find themselves in trouble with the criminal justice system. Earlier diagnosis would have a very positive impact on the social inclusion of these young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09070269000072"></a>I know that these amendments have the support of the Communication Trust, which has pointed out that there is significant variation across the country for those with hidden difficulties in terms of assessment and referral to specialist services. Putting something like this into this legislation would help to make sure that people benefit from the services that they need in the areas where these things are not being dealt with as well as they are elsewhere.</p>

I thought for one awful moment that I was going to have to move this amendment on behalf of my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham, as it was due to be heard last week. But he has now been able to move it himself and has done it considerably better than I would have been able to. I commend what we have just heard about the figures, which clearly show that testing should start at an earlier age. It is very good news that Northern Ireland has decided that the age of two is when compulsory testing should start.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09070269000074"></a>I very much support these amendments. The Communication Trust has done an excellent job. It has provided these amendments one behalf of some&#151;I think, 30&#151;voluntary organisations. Incidentally, I believe that it gets a grant from a government department, which clearly also approves of its work. I hope that that means that greater notice will be taken of what it says. Above all, I emphasise the point about the importance of communication. If you cannot talk, you are highly unlikely to be able to read and will have all sorts of other problems as time goes on. It is good to know that one of the organisations supporting the trust is I CAN, to one of whose meetings I went the other day. We must never forget that great phrase, &#147;Chatter matters&#148;. It does indeed and it matters very importantly in this area. I support the amendment.</p>

I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has started off in such fine fashion. I am optimistic. The other day, the Prime Minister promised that every young child who started falling behind in reading and maths would receive help to catch up. However, it makes little sense to do that without having baseline, diagnostic pre-testing at the beginning or you will not know what falling behind means for any particular child.</p>

As the noble Lord said, screening will help to identify hidden disabilities. He is right to concentrate on language and basic speaking communications problems. To put it bluntly, if that is not right, it is very difficult to even explain what the other problems are, and they feed off each other. Much good computer software is rapidly removing many of the problems around dyslexia but, unless you can speak, you cannot use it, because it is voice operated. These things feed off each other, so they have to be addressed.</p>

<a name="90702-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09070269000079"></a>One thing that you have to know is what is there. We have moved on so far in the past few years and there is now a much greater recognition that these problems can be dealt with, or at least mitigated in some way, if only they can be identified. There are various fault lines in areas where you have the greatest amount of educational failure. Later, we will debate issues concerning those who go into the prison system. At all points where you have a new type of education, there is a good opportunity to put in a screening process. When the Minister responds, I would welcome an idea of how far the Government are going to take this. It would be interesting to find out what problems they have with the principle of screening.</p>

<a name="90702-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09070269000080"></a>I hope that we do not hear that we do not have the perfect test. There is no such thing. There will always be people whom you miss. If you have defence in depth, you will be able to pick them up later. If you deal with most people who have a problem, you will probably identify those who stand out as having something that is unidentified in the classroom. When you get large masses of people who are not succeeding and not achieving, it is much easier to hide. From my work with dyslexics, I know that the easy thing is to disrupt the classroom or to be at the back in a large group. You are safe: you will not get identified or placed under pressure. The survival method of people who find themselves in trouble is either to hide, smile sweetly in the middle of a group or disrupt. If the Minister introduces screening that works for the majority, that small group will no longer have this opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09070269000081"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said, this is a probing amendment. I would welcome the Minister giving us at least an idea of the Government&#146;s attitude on this question. We should remember that getting 90 per cent identification would still be a massive leap forward. It really would be something good and it would give us a chance to pick up people later. There is no perfect answer here; there is merely a better answer. I look forward to the Minister giving a positive reply.</p>

However, we need to recognise that we are looking at the problem from inside the Bill, as it were, and ought not to blinker ourselves to the fact that this problem goes much wider, and needs wider remedies, than are available in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09070269000083"></a>I wonder whether the noble Lord has read the report on this matter by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. It has eight simple recommendations, some of which fall within the Bill and some of which do not. As they are brief, I will repeat them. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="09070269000304"></a>&#147;1. Every PCT should have a speech and language therapy specialist lead with a remit to develop speech and language therapy services for vulnerable young people in the community.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="09070269000305"></a>2. Every youth offending team must have at least one full time speech and language therapist who would also provide a service to community provision such as units for children excluded from school, probation, mental health and drug misuse services.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="09070269000306"></a>3. The ASSET assessment must have a section on communication skills to identify those with speech, language and communication needs&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070269000287"></a>Where it says &#147;must&#148;, we would say &#147;should&#148;.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="09070269000307"></a>&#147;4. The intermediary schemes should be extended to support defendants.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="09070269000308"></a>5. A speech and language therapist should be appointed to work within each of the ... secure training centres.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="09070269000309"></a>6. There is at least one full time specialist speech and language therapist working in every young offender institution.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="09070269000310"></a>7. Each young offender institution should provide a communication support worker to support and carry over the work of the specialist speech and language therapist.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="09070269000311"></a>8. Establish a national professional lead to oversee and coordinate this new service&#148;.</p>

<a name="90702-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09070269000084"></a>We should think of ourselves as trying to provide part of a larger provision that will reach children who are not under the aegis of the education service in its various forms but out in the community and often passing through the hands of the National Health Service. I offer this as a gloss on what has been said before, because I think that we ought to come back to it in this Bill in detail and in other Bills on later occasions, but I support this amendment wholeheartedly.</p>

I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Addington. I was dyslexic and I hid, but other people who have a problem become disruptive and are then excluded. It should come as no surprise that they then get caught up in the criminal justice system. Whenever I think of this problem, I think of that old nursery rhyme:</p>

I was grateful for the extremely helpful meeting that he organised with many of the so-called stakeholders in this area some time ago. I ask the Minister perhaps to write to us on the situation and give the numbers of speech therapists that we have and are planning to develop.

As no doubt the Minister will inform us, the Bill already states that the LEA,</p>
<ul><a name="09070269000346"></a>&#147;must secure that enough suitable education and training is provided to meet the reasonable needs of persons in their area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070269000289"></a>This includes those who are aged 19 or over but under 25 and are subject to learning difficulty assessment. We would agree that, so far as it goes, this is an important part of the duty of an education provider and we welcome the fact that it is included in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90702-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09070269000088"></a>However, the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, would make sure that the LEA takes an active role in seeking to ensure that it has done all that it reasonably can to screen for, identify and then assess any learning difficulty. This, as he said, is considerably more than is specifically provided for in the Bill. A superficial reading of new Section 15ZA(1) might lead one to conclude that the noble Lord&#146;s amendment is already covered. A diligent LEA might not need to have it spelt out in the Bill that securing enough suitable education for all those for whom it is responsible includes screening, assessment and referral for additional support if necessary. Nevertheless, the worry would be that an overstretched, understaffed, inexperienced or underexperienced LEA might take a more passive approach and simply address the needs of those who requested extra assistance rather than imposing a rigorous assessment process to discover all those who might potentially require help.</p>

<a name="90702-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09070269000089"></a>Without a thorough assessment of the problems, there can be no hope of adequately providing for those who need help. Amendment 101, one hopes, refines the definition of those who should be considered as having learning difficulties by mentioning specific conditions. It would be dangerous if some of the conditions in this list were not to be considered covered by paragraphs (a) or (b) of subsection (7). The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, emphasised the ability to communicate, which encapsulates what most of these specific conditions come down to. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us on these matters.</p>

I am president of the organisation Skill, the National Bureau for Students with Disabilities. It has expressed concern about the learning difficulty assessment, as that will determine the route that young people take in their post-16 education and training.

There are also concerns about how all disabled learners, particularly those who have not been formally assessed, will be identified as in need of assessment and subsequent support. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us an assurance that learners without a learning difficulty assessment will not be disadvantaged in post-16 provision and support.</p>

<a name="90702-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09070269000091"></a>Statutory guidance on Section 139A and 140 assessments has only recently been published and is open to public consultation until July. The draft guidance does not refer to the new agency responsible for funding disabled learners, specifically the YPLA. Instead, it refers to the Learning and Skills Council, which will cease to exist from 2010. This is of concern, as we want to be sure that the guidance is fit for purpose before the Bill receives Royal Assent. I referred to this point at Second Reading. Disabled learners&#146; experiences of transition in post-16 learning and their ability to make informed choices will depend largely on the final form that the guidance takes, so we want to be sure that there is robust, relevant and coherent guidance in place that delivers appropriate learning choices for all disabled learners aged 16 to 25.</p>

<a name="90702-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09070269000092"></a>In the case of Alloway against the London Borough of Bromley, the judgment concluded that there needs to be tighter control over the quality and compliance of Section 139A and 140 assessments. Ensuring high-quality assessments is critical, as they determine the provision and support that young people can access and, in turn, their learning outcomes and the possibility of progression. The YPLA, I want to suggest, needs to establish a quality control framework that underpins the Section 139A and 140 assessment process. The quality control framework must include disabled learners, parents and organisations representing disabled learners in framing the provision and support that is to be made for individual disabled learners. A robust quality control framework would ensure a high standard of professional expertise and experience without being prescriptive about the specific qualifications that professionals undertaking these assessments will be required to have. It is important that there is a framework of accountability for the quality of Section 139A and 140 assessments. Senior managers within the local authority or the commissioning agency, such as Connexions, should be responsible for the final sign-off of Section 139A and 140 assessments. This is particularly important in the light of the Alloway case, which concluded that Bromley and Connexions had not met their statutory duty properly to assess the learning and support needs of Stephen Alloway.</p>

<a name="90702-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09070269000093"></a>A quality control framework would ensure that the assessment process was equitable for all disabled learners in need of it and would ensure consistency across local authority areas. Moreover, without such a framework in place to control assessments of disabled young people, judicial reviews will increasingly be sought by parents and those with responsibility for disabled young people. Implementing a quality control framework is beneficial for disabled young people and their families and for local authorities to ensure that they are meeting their new statutory duties under the Education and Skills Act of last year and under this Bill once it receives Royal Assent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09070269000094"></a>The duties and powers that LEAs have to arrange and provide an assessment must be highlighted to ensure that learners who need an assessment receive one. Currently, many disabled learners face difficulties receiving an assessment, which poses a barrier to their participation in post-16 education and training. Assessments are intended to be holistic, addressing a range of individual needs from learning support to transport provision. It is important that we get an assurance that statutory guidance on the Section 139A and 140 assessments highlights that, where a local authority believes that an assessment would benefit a learner regardless of whether the learner has been assessed or supported before, it will arrange for an assessment to take place. I am seeking from the Minister an assurance that the assessment will cover the wider transition planning for disabled young people, including the learning and support needs of the given individual, such as their transport needs.</p>

<a name="90702-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09070269000095"></a>To sum up, we need the following assurances from the Government today. First, we need to know that disabled learners without a learning difficulty assessment will not be disadvantaged in post-16 provision and support. Secondly, we need to know that there will be a robust quality control framework that will underpin the Section 139A and 140 assessment processes. Thirdly, there must be a framework of accountability for the quality of Section 139A and 140 assessments, in which, specifically, senior management within local authorities or the commissioned agency, such as Connexions, will have responsibility for the final sign-off of these assessments. Fourthly, we want to know how local authorities will identify and assess which disabled learners need an assessment and ensure that there are sufficient qualified staff to undertake them. Fifthly, the assessment must cover the wider transition planning for disabled young people, including the learning and support needs of a given individual, such as their transport needs. Sixthly, we need clarification on how local authorities will identify young people who are not in education, employment and/or training as in need of an assessment. Finally, professionals working with disabled children and young people in offender institutions should begin the assessment process of particular individuals who require it and have regard to statutory guidance relating to Section 139A and 140 assessments. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us on at least some of these points.</p>

They are also able to refer young people to the local authority and other specialist agencies if there is a previously undiagnosed difficulty or concern.</p>

<a name="90702-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09070269000098"></a>Local authorities have duties under Section 139A of the Learning and Skills Act 2000 to carry out assessments of pupils with statements in their final year of compulsory schooling, or during the sixth form, who are intending to access further education or HE. This is to ensure effective transition and that the special educational needs of these young people will be met. We have strengthened the draft statutory guidance on learning difficulties assessments, which is currently subject to consultation, to make it clear where local authorities should provide an assessment for young people without a statement.</p>

<a name="90702-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09070269000099"></a>Using the Learning for Living and Work Framework, the local authority, in conducting the assessment, will work closely with a number of practitioners to ensure a truly multi-agency process. The more relevant agencies involved in this process, the greater the opportunity for ensuring that particular issues are picked up. The assessment process should build on the views and expertise of these agencies and of other people who have already supported the young person. This is to ensure that the assessment of their educational and training needs, and the provision needed to meet them, is evidence-based and valid. It will result in a report on a young person&#146;s needs that identifies the provision and support required to meet those needs. Local authorities will be required through the national commissioning framework to have regard to the requirements set out in this report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09070269000100"></a>Of course, it is critical that these procedures work well in practice. I reassure noble Lords that Ofsted is currently conducting a major review of provision for children with special educational needs. This will include the consideration of issues around young people&#146;s transition from school to further education and the assessment and support that they receive to help with that transition and their continued success in further education. Ofsted will be reporting in the summer of 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09070269000101"></a>While I understand the intention behind Amendment 101, the definition used in this Bill is the established definition, which is more or less the same in both the Education Act 1996 and the Learning and Skills Act 2000, just altered slightly to take account of the different ages of learners and the different types of institution that they attend. It is a broad definition that rightly includes the difficulties listed in the amendment, as well as many others. It is therefore not necessary to list selected ones separately. Indeed, I would be concerned that doing so would risk creating the impression that other types of learning difficulties were less important, or even creating a hierarchy of needs, which I am sure is not the intention of the amendment. We appreciate that there are some serious challenges here, and we are taking steps to improve the identification and assessment of learning difficulties for our young people and young adults, but we acknowledge that a great deal more needs to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09070269000102"></a>I shall address some of the specific points that were raised. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, talked about the importance of early screening. On the question of why we do not introduce the screening of all children for a condition such as dyslexia, a review was conducted by Jim Rose that concluded that blanket screening for dyslexia is questionable, not least because screening tests for that purpose are as yet unreliable. His report says that a better way to identify children at risk of literacy difficulties and dyslexia is to closely observe and assess their responses to pre-reading and early reading activities in comparison to their typically developing peers in the reception year of primary school and beyond. The review found that the first step advocated in identifying children who may have learning difficulties including dyslexia is to notice those making poor progress in comparison with their typically developing peers receiving high quality wave 1 literacy teaching. We have endorsed all the recommendations and have made available &#163;10 million to support their implementation.</p>

Does the Minister agree that if the method he described is the best way of catching those with these difficulties, we will still miss many? The current education system misses dozens of people in that spectrum. Most of the suggestions in Amendment 101 relate to spectrums; if you have screening or assessments later, you stand a chance of picking up those on these spectrums who have been missed. That is the suggestion here. There is the question of those who will not be picked up by a test, even if they will not be left unidentified in such great numbers as they are at the moment. It is a bit of a cop-out to say, &#147;It isn&#146;t a perfect answer, so we won&#146;t do it&#148;.</p>

That is the most important thing. We are trying to ensure, first, that teachers are fully trained to spot children with learning difficulties or potential learning difficulties.</p>

<a name="90702-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09070269000105"></a>I will just finish my point about what we are trying to do. We have made available &#163;10 million to support the implementation of the recommendations that Jim Rose made. Do not forget that these included the point about closely observing and assessing the responses of all pre and early-reading activities. We are not, by any means, advocating doing nothing. We will also fund around 4,000 teachers to train in appropriately accredited specialist dyslexia teaching over the next two years. Surely that is a fundamentally important contribution; it is a huge step forward and, really, it is an acknowledgement of all the pressure to take positive action in this area that has come from this House. It is a huge response. We will be looking with the Dyslexia-Specific Learning Difficulties Trust and other partners at how we and they might best work together to implement Jim Rose&#146;s recommendations and to encourage local authorities and schools to do so. We expect to provide further details about this in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09070269000106"></a>In December 2008 the Department for Children, Schools and Families published <I>Better Communication</I>, the speech, language and communication needs action  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_404"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 404</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>plan, providing the Government&#146;s full response to the Bercow report. The action plan sets out plans for a series of initiatives to improve services for this group of children and young people, culminating in the National Year of Speech, Language and Communication in 2011.  We have set aside &#163;12 million over the next three years to support the additional costs of these initiatives. We are not just talking about initiatives; we are also putting funding behind them and that is obviously important.</p>

<a name="90702-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09070269000107"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, referred to the Communication Trust and I CAN. I am sure the noble Baroness will be pleased to hear that the Communication Trust has been commissioned to develop training material on speech, language and communication needs and dyslexia for those working with young people who are in contact with the criminal justice system. I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, will be pleased to hear about that. It is another example of the action that we are taking. We are also providing funding totalling almost &#163;1 million to Afasic, I CAN and the British Stammering Association through the CYPF grant programme to support parents of children with speech, language and communication needs. That is another positive action.</p>

<a name="90702-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09070269000108"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, is correct that we have introduced new measures in the <I>21st Century Schools</I> White Paper to support all children, particularly those who are falling behind. Every pupil will go to a school where they are taught in a way that meets their needs; their progress is regularly checked; additional needs are spotted early and quickly addressed; and every child will have a personal tutor. Every parent will know how their child is being supported in their areas of weakness and stretched to develop their talents, and receive real-time online reports about progress. There will be one-to-one tuition for any child aged seven to 11 who is falling behind and not catching up, and one-to-one or small group tuition at the start of secondary school for all those are behind. That last point addresses a concern expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas.</p>

<a name="90702-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09070269000109"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Low, made a very wide-ranging contribution and I could not attempt to answer every point that he raised, so I hope he will understand that, where I cannot, I may need to write to him separately. I can reassure him that the 139A assessment guidance or consultation already states that where it is felt that a young person would benefit from an assessment, they should get one. In response to another of the noble Lord&#146;s points on the question of those in further education, further education providers often have their own assessment tools to screen for difficulties and can refer to the local authority and other specialist agencies if there is a previously undiagnosed difficulty or concern. They do not complete a 139A assessment, since the LSC is unable to accept one from this source. They may contribute to one or request one to be completed to include results of tests they carry out. Routinely providers may screen all applicants for foundation level courses for potential learning difficulties.</p>

<a name="90702-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09070269000110"></a>Screening can include literacy and numeracy testing, speech, language and communication difficulties assessment and dyslexia. If a more complex difficulty

Time does not permit me to describe fully all that process. We are also trying to ensure that the quality of training for those who are involved in the Connexions service is improved. We will write in more detail to the noble Lord, Lord Low.</p>

<a name="90702-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09070269000111"></a>In conclusion, as a number of noble Lords noticed, this issue does go wider than the Bill, but I hope that, taken together with the other measures that I have described, as well as those we are taking through the Bill, that noble Lords will appreciate that there is a huge amount of work going on in this area. With those assurances, I trust that the noble Lord will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</p>

What is being done to recruit more and to retain them, if that is an issue? If he would write to me with some detail on that, I would appreciate it.</p>

<a name="09070269000113"></a><b><a name="90702-0012.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09070269000411"></a>Lord Ramsbotham:</b> First, I thank all those noble Lords who have taken part in the debate. The fact that so many different aspects came up shows that there is a general perception of the very serious nature of this. I was very grateful, in particular, to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, for bringing out the figures, and to the noble Lord, Lord Addington, for mentioning tests. I am very glad that we had this discussion because, far be it for a layman like me to tilt with someone like Sir Jim Rose, but I have to say that there are, as I understand it, tests which can, at least, identify that the problem is there, without going further. This seems to be a case of the danger of the best being the enemy of the good.</p>

<a name="90702-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09070269000114"></a>The tests being developed by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, which cover the whole raft of difficulties, not just dyslexia, seem to me to give a very valuable tool. In that connection, I was intrigued to see another report by Professor Karen Brown of work she had done in Leeds with young people on special supervision orders, which shows that there are tools available, of which better use can be made.</p>

<a name="90702-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09070269000115"></a>I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Elton, for mentioning the wider aspects of this. I should mention that the aim of the Helen Hamlyn trial was to get speech and language therapists in every young offender institution and special training centre. The cost at that time was assessed at &#163;30,000 per year per therapist. At that time, the Prison Service and the Youth Justice Board were prepared to look at that funding provision. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister&#146;s respect agenda came along with a &#163;90 million bill, &#163;30 million of which came from the Home Office, which effectively took all the money out of the Prison Service and the Youth Justice Board&#146;s ability to fund them. I remember questioning whether there was anything more respectable than being able to communicate&#151;surely the provision should have come out of the respect agenda, not the other way round.</p>

<a name="90702-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09070269000116"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, for mentioning the problem of consistency between local area authorities, which, of course, is precisely  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_406"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 406</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>where this amendment came from; concern about consistent delivery around the country. I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Low, for his coverage of the problems of the disabled, which again shows that this is something that is universally covered.</p>

<a name="90702-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09070269000117"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. As many noble Lords have said, this subject will come back in connection with other clauses. Therefore, rather than merely drop the matter, it might be sensible to wait and see what comes out of the various other discussions on the Bill and conversations with the Minister and the Bill team. At that point those of us who have raised questions can consider what further action needs to be taken on Report and possibly at later stages. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="09070269000118"></a><b><a name="90702-0012.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09070269000413"></a>Lord Elton:</b> I wish to speak also to Amendment 123. The Committee knows that my eye is apt to be caught by small words. I read through Clause 40 with some reservations and agreeable sensations. New Section 15ZA(1) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="09070269000315"></a>&#147;A local education authority ... must secure that enough suitable education and training is provided to meet the reasonable needs of persons in their area&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070269000290"></a>I eventually came to new subsection (8), which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="09070269000316"></a>&#147;But a person is not to be taken to have a learning difficulty solely because the language (or form of language) in which the person is or will be taught is different from a language (or form of language) which has at any time been spoken in the person&#146;s home&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070269000291"></a>In other words, we are looking at somebody for whom English is a second language. I wondered what &#147;solely&#148; was intended to mean. It seems reasonable that somebody having English as a second language should never of itself be considered a form of learning difficulty. Then I considered where this might bite. It seems to me there is a grey and worrying area if somebody who has English as a second language and speaks some other language at home&#151;his parents speak only that language&#151;also has a communication difficulty such as we discussed on the previous amendment. There is a great danger that the existence of this subsection will blind those looking after him to his actual and real needs. I can see that the noble Lord is looking at me with some reservations. I am used to that but I hope I can reassure him that this is a reasonable request. If somebody is having difficulty with a language which is his own, it is immediately apparent. If he is having difficulty with a language which is not his own, it is not apparent that that difficulty springs from anything except the fact that it is not his own language. I am anxious that people in danger of being caught in that situation should be protected, which is why I have asked that at the end of new Section 15ZA we should point out in an additional subsection:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="09070269000317"></a>&#147;In this section &#147;reasonable needs&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09070269000292"></a>That is where the new section started&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09070269000347"></a>&#147;includes the need to communicate effectively in English&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070269000293"></a>That is where we finished the debate on the previous amendment. I think we are agreed that that is a necessity for somebody. I think we are already apprised of the fact that an inability to communicate effectively leads to great frustration and can lead to criminality. Seeing something, wanting it badly and not being able to explain what you want or why you want it so badly leads people eventually to take it and not obtain it in the proper way.</p>

For a party which thought that &#147;Education, education, education&#148; was so important, I should have thought that someone might be present to support this Bill; but there is no one. The massed ranks of the Conservatives, the Liberals and the Cross Benches may able to win a Division or two. That is a real danger to the Government. Perhaps my noble friend could elicit from them whether they are likely to adjourn the Committee.</p>

<a name="90702-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09070269000122"></a>I return to my Amendment 123, in which, in Clause 47, page 30, line 13, I insert similar words to those in Amendment 102. The clause relates to people in detention. For reasons that have just been stated, we are not in a hurry to get to the end of this. On page 29, Clause 47 inserts new Section 18A into the 1996 Act. In subsection (1)(a) there is a requirement on the local education authority to secure,</p>
<ul><a name="09070269000348"></a>&#147;enough suitable education is provided to meet the reasonable needs of children subject to youth detention in their area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070269000294"></a>There is no reservation about second languages there&#151;which may be a little odd, because they are fairly well represented in prisons. For the reasons that I have just given, inability to communicate effectively in English is a great contributor to criminality in this country and to failure in education. That, in turn, is a contributor to criminality. Therefore, it is as well to emphasise to the authorities that when they are dealing with people in detention it is even more necessary than elsewhere that &#147;reasonable needs&#148; shall be seen to include the need to communicate effectively in English.</p>

<a name="90702-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09070269000123"></a>I am not sure how this will play, but perhaps the noble Baroness or the noble Lord when he replies can tell us. Will this part of the Bill apply to Wales? If it will, has the Welsh Assembly agreed to it? Although Welsh is an official language in Wales, I think that we agreed that you cannot have an effective life in a community in Wales without also speaking fluently in English. With those observations, and wondering what will happen to attendance on the other side of the House, I beg to move.</p>

Inability to communicate effectively in English is not the exclusive domain of people whose first language is not English. Many young people have grown up speaking English right from the start, but their vernacular is so dense that many of us cannot understand a word they say.</p>

<a name="90702-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09070269000128"></a>I recently had the experience of reading&#151;not just listening to&#151;a transcript of a conversation between two or three young people. I do not think they knew at the time they were being recorded, but that is by the by. I could not understand a single word they said. The words they used for commonly understood objects and actions were so different from the ones with which I am familiar that it made their conversation totally dense to me. I could not understand a word of it. We need to consider those young people as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09070269000129"></a>About a year ago I came across an initiative that took place in prisons. Actors went in to work with young people on a Shakespeare play. To many people the language of Shakespeare is also rather dense. That exercise got the young people to consider the language and its richness. They began to use language which the majority of the population would understand. They became more confident in themselves in so doing, particularly because they could communicate their feelings to not just each other but also other people who had some power over them. I submit that this is an important factor to bear in mind, too.</p>

The issue was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, in the previous group of amendments. It is also important&#151;my noble friend mentioned this&#151;that Amendment 123 refers to that part of the Bill dealing with persons detained in youth accommodation.</p>

We all hope that this Bill, once improved, could play such a part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09070269000133"></a>One of the primary concerns that the Opposition has been raising for a long time is that equipping young people with the skills they need not just to stay in education or training but to embrace them and prosper from them is key to keeping them on the straight and narrow later in life. I do not doubt the sincerity of the Government&#146;s aim to reach the same goals but once again raise our concern that they are dealing with a problem simply by throwing more legislation at it. Has the Minister had a chance to read his <I>Daily Telegraph</I> lately? Has he reflected on the extraordinary broadside upon this Government&#146;s education policies delivered only the other day by the DCSF&#146;s own former director-general of schools? Ralph Tabberer said that under this Government, teaching children the difference between right and wrong had been neglected. That is pretty strong stuff from someone who has seen the education system from close up.</p>

<a name="90702-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09070269000134"></a>This goes right to the heart of the point my noble friend has raised with these amendments. It is not just bald examination results that matter but educating young people in the round. The &#147;disconnect&#148;&#151;if I can used a buzzword&#151;that some young people feel between them and the rest of society is at the root of many anti-social problems. It is a reason for great concern if, as Mr Tabberer suggests, that problem is being exacerbated rather than healed by our education system. I will be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s opinion as it seems pertinent to the debate.</p>

<a name="90702-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09070269000135"></a>I welcome my noble friend&#146;s amendment as a timely opportunity to debate this issue. He may wish to revisit the topic at a later stage, perhaps when, as my noble friend Lord Baker suggested, the Government are rather better represented on their Back Benches. To help him to decide that and noble Lords to consider the matter further, can the Minister furnish the Committee with some statistics? For instance, what are the Government's most up-to-date figures for the number of people who are not in employment, education or training? What proportion of those have a criminal record? How many have a persistent criminal record? What is the proportion of people aged under 25 currently serving a custodial or community sentence who have below average results in their GCSEs? How does that compare with the general population?</p>

<a name="90702-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09070269000136"></a>I realise that the Minister may not have those statistics at his fingertips, but this is an area that deserves close attention. I would be content if he were to write to noble Lords with those figures before Report.</p>

During his initial contribution, I was ruminating on whether to declare an interest. I am a school governor at my local primary school, where we are addressing the very problem that he talked about, where English is the second language. We have 29 languages spoken at our school, which, compared to some inner London schools, is not many. We take a number of special steps, including bringing parents in with the children to help the parent&#151;it is usually mothers who attend the classes, not men. We also have our specifically trained SEN teacher. From my experience, one impressive thing is how quickly many of those young people pick

Some of the nuances take time, but they are assessed not just for their ability to speak the language but for any underlying problems. That does not mean that I do not recognise the importance of the issue.</p>

<a name="90702-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09070269000138"></a>We fully recognise the importance of good communication skills for all young people and adults so that they are better placed to succeed in learning, work and life. That is why in England we are developing functional skills in English which, along with functional skills in mathematics and information and communication technology, form the core of all learning routes for 14 to 19 year-olds. Pilots on that include young people in custody. Functional skills in English contain a range of communication skills and have been developed in consultation with employers and other stakeholders to ensure that they meet the skill needs of our modern world, to ensure that everyone in England who needs them has access to those functional skills qualifications.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90702-0013.htm"/>


<a name="90702-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09070269000139"></a>Through Clause 44, we are legislating to place responsibility on local authorities in England to secure the core entitlement for 16 to 19 year-olds. The core entitlement is to a course of study in English, mathematics and information and communication technology. It is intended to ensure that no young person misses out on the opportunity to develop vital functional skills to level 2 in English, mathematics and ICT. Employers and higher education institutions have told us that young people need those skills to succeed in the workplace and in further learning. I am sure that we all concur with that.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09070269000140"></a>Clause 47 places new duties on local education authorities in England and Wales to ensure that enough suitable education and training is provided to meet the reasonable needs of persons subject to detention in relevant youth accommodation. In doing so, the Bill provides that local authorities must have regard to any special educational needs or learning difficulties that those persons may have. It also provides that local authorities in England must have regard to the desirability of the core entitlement being satisfied for those subject to youth detention. We will make it clear in statutory guidance that we expect the core entitlement to be delivered in juvenile custody. We will also be clear in the guidance on the need for support to meet young people's needs where they speak English as an additional language.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09070269000141"></a>To address some of the specific points made, I was asked: why not cover English as a second language under Clause 40? Because we believe that all 16 to 18 year-olds will be developing functional skills in English to level 2 anyway. That is their core entitlement, as I have already explained. We have a new approach to teaching English for speakers of other languages. I am happy to send the noble Lord, Lord Elton, a copy of that document. Does the core entitlement apply in Wales? No. The additional entitlement duties for 14 to 19 year-olds apply only to local education authorities in England. Will the offender clauses apply in Wales? Yes, they will.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09070269000142"></a>I hope the noble Lord will agree that legislating for the core entitlement for post-16s through Clause 44, along with the general duties in Clauses 40 and 47, will mean that this amendment, while well intentioned, is unnecessary, and that he feels able to withdraw it.</p>

I must admit I do not always rely on the <I>Telegraph</I><I></I>as my source of statistical information or educational analysis, but I would not discount it totally. In my experience in teaching right and wrong at my primary school, I believe it is encompassed in the syllabus. We have a clear set of procedures for dealing with disciplinary problems. Also, interestingly, I believe that the latest Ofsted reports have shown a general improvement in behaviour, so I can counter with that information. We will, however, supply the noble Lord with the statistics he asked for on NEETs.</p>

Therefore, I will not move Amendment 123 when we get to it.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09070269000146"></a>I should thank noble Lords who have taken part in this debate: my noble friend Lord Baker, who was in a rather teasing mood, which we shall put behind us in order to get on with work, and the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, who made an extremely important point.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09070269000147"></a>I am hesitant about what the Minister said about Amendment 102. I was surprised that he found it necessary to say that the professional organisations had confirmed that it was necessary for people coming to employment to have fluent English or a means of communicating effectively. The point I was trying to make in the previous debate was that one actually needs it for life: in order to be effective, not to be a criminal, to enjoy oneself and raise a happy family. So it goes outside this Bill, and we do not need professionals to tell us that.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09070269000148"></a>I say to the Minister that I still think there is a danger of confusion or possible mistakes arising out of the passage which says that if one has English as a second language, this should not, on its own, mean that one has specific learning difficulties. That could lead to confusion in the future, so I would like to think about what the Minister sends me between now and the autumn, and look forward to seeing him then.

<a name="09070269000149"></a><b><a name="90702-0013.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09070269000427"></a>Baroness Verma:</b> Amendment 102A is a probing amendment, which is merely designed to draw attention to the fact that devolution of the funding of academies raises real questions about the future of sixth forms in those schools. This is a concern felt by many groups. Dr. Daniel Moynihan, chief executive of the Harris Foundation Academy Group, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="09070269000320"></a>&#147;In one local authority we were told by a different body from the Learning and Schools Council that we could not open sixth forms in two of our academies&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070269000295"></a>The reason given was that it did not fit with the plan.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09070269000150"></a>In another place, the Minister attempted to reassure the House by stating that all that the Bill really allowed was the Secretary of State to ask the YPLA to undertake some largely administrative functions in relation to academies and that it would not affect the nature of the funding of academies. He added that if agreement could not be reached about adding a new sixth form to an existing academy, the views of the academy, the 14-to-19 partnership and the local authority would be taken into account, while the Secretary of State, not the local authority, would be responsible for the decision. This is, to some extent, reassuring. I do not want the Minister to think that I have come at this amendment with all guns blazing. We merely seek assurances about the role of the provider in assessing the need for a sixth form in an existing academy. It should be enough for the academy to state that there is a need for further provision or that it is unnecessary.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09070269000151"></a>How will the assessment for an additional academy sixth form work? What role will be allocated to the academy in the decision-making process? Will it be one of consultation, or one of decision-making? The concern, as the Minister is aware, is that in a scenario in which the independence of academies has already been reduced, is it really right that the need for a new academy sixth form should be addressed by a process that risks damaging their independence still further? I remain concerned and seek further reassurances from her. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09070269000152"></a><b><a name="90702-0013.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09070269000428"></a>Baroness Perry of Southwark:</b> Briefly, I offer my strongest support for the amendment. This policy for academies is clearly shared by both parties and by both Conservative and Labour supporters. Academies have already begun to prove their worth, and it is very important for any school to be able to develop a sixth form if it so wishes. It is very difficult to recruit the best subject teachers unless you can offer them sixth-form teaching as well. Many 11-to-16 schools and their pupils found life extremely difficult, because they were devoid of good strong subject staff.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09070269000153"></a>I hope that the Minister supports the need for every academy to be able to develop a sixth form if it so wishes without any intervention from the local education authority that may prevent it from developing it in a way in which it logically needs to develop if it is to fulfil its academic purpose.</p>

It might be helpful to say for the record that we expect to open more than 60 academies in September. Only four of those will not have sixth forms, so I would like to  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_413"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 413</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>quash in one move the impression that academies do not have sixth forms as a norm. The coming year will see the opening of our 200th academy, and we can join in celebrating that when it comes around. It is a shame that the noble Lord, Lord Baker, is not in his place to hear that comment. Work undertaken by noble Lords in this House has contributed greatly to that achievement, and we are very grateful to them for that. We are particularly grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bates, who is in his place.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09070269000155"></a>Just to be clear, the Secretary of State, as noble Lords are aware, funds academies directly, including their sixth-form places. In future, the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency will act on behalf of the Secretary of State in carrying out academy functions, including funding academy sixth-form provision. When the YPLA acts on academies, it is acting as the agent of the Secretary of State. So the Secretary of State still holds the powers, but through an annual remit letter, the Secretary of State will be delegating to the YPLA the work of funding academies.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09070269000156"></a>Local authorities do not, and will not, provide funding to academies and there is no need for them to do so. The local authority&#146;s role will be to secure provision that meets the needs of learners. In doing so, they must, among other things, act with a view to encouraging diversity in both provider type and curriculum, and so increase opportunities for young people to exercise choice. This is a new process and I understand academies&#146; nervousness about how it will work and how it might impact on their sixth forms, in particular. However, there are a number of safeguards built in for academies which carefully balance those concerns alongside what must be the overall aim, which is to ensure that the commissioning of post-16 places puts pupils first.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="09070269000157"></a>I would like to emphasise that local authorities will not be responsible for approving or funding post-16 provision in academies. For a new academy, the Secretary of State will continue to decide whether it will open a sixth form, having consulted the local authority. This is what happens now. Academies are understandably curious as to what influence a local authority might have at that stage. In establishing a new academy, the Secretary of State must make a sensible decision about what is in the best interests of learners. He cannot do that unless he has some understanding of the academy&#146;s impact on other local providers. That point needs to be taken into account if he is to make a sensible decision. He must, therefore, consult local authorities. In fact, nothing is changing in that respect from what happens now. The Secretary of State currently consults on these matters with local authorities before opening academies. That obligation has existed since the academies&#146; programme began and is written into primary legislation. I do not actually have the reference here and I apologise for that. That consultation has not led to a high proportion of academies without sixth forms and that will not change. As I have said, of the 60-plus academies opening at the beginning of the next academic year, the vast majority will have sixth forms.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09070269000158"></a>An existing academy wishing to establish a sixth form, or increase the number of post-16 places, would naturally engage with the local authority, as you would  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_414"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 414</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>expect, and other local partners through the local 14-to-19 partnership and look at feeding into the local authority&#146;s commissioning plans through that partnership. However, if there is a disagreement locally about the number of academy places to be funded, the matter would be referred to the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State under the proposed agency arrangements, for consideration.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09070269000159"></a>Any decisions on academy sixth form places must have regard to the views of local providers, the local authority and the policy guidance provided by the Secretary of State. Again, I understand academies&#146; concerns because I am very careful to listen to them, but again, there are safeguards. First, the Secretary of State will make the final decision on any change of age range in an academy, including where this involves a new sixth form. In doing so, he will take into account the views of all stakeholders as he does now. The obligation on academies to consult before they open is in Section 482(3)(a) of the Education Act 1996. I am having difficulty reading the note. I will therefore write to noble Lords to clarify that because I am not sure that that is right.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09070269000160"></a>In relation to the funding of additional sixth form places, if an academy felt that the YPLA had acted unreasonably in reaching its decision, it could complain directly to the Secretary of State, who would investigate. In order to make things as transparent as possible, I can today commit to ensuring that whenever the YPLA makes a decision which prevents an open academy from increasing the size of its sixth form it must publish its reasons for that decision and why it was in the best interests of pupils. Obviously, in terms of the academy&#146;s ability to challenge any decision, that transparency is very important.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="09070269000161"></a>Secondly, we must remember that the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency will be acting under a remit letter, as I stressed at the start of my remarks, from the Secretary of State in respect of academies. Each year we will issue a new remit letter, which may contain guidance as to how the YPLA should act in relation to sixth forms. So, again, I can commit that before we issue a remit letter we will consult academy sponsors so that their views on how the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency is operating can be taken into account. This is a very important part of the process between the Secretary of State issuing the remit letter to the YPLA and, in the lead up to the issuing of that letter, the Secretary of State will consult academy sponsors.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09070269000162"></a>We want to work with all stakeholders, including academies. In response to earlier stakeholder events, we will set up a new academies&#146; reference group to work with the Secretary of State on the detail of the YPLA academy arrangements. The group will meet termly and the first meeting will take place before the end of September. Noble Lords may have seen the announcement on 30 June of the appointments of Les Walton as chair of the Young People's Learning Agency and Peter Lauener who will be its first chief executive officer, subject to parliamentary process and Royal Assent. Les and Peter are extremely keen to work with stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition to the new arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09070269000163"></a>To conclude this slightly longer contribution than I had planned, these new arrangements for academies and local authorities must ultimately put the needs of learners first, as I am sure noble Lords will agree. However, we have put in place sufficient protections to ensure that academies can be assured that decisions will be taken fairly and in a transparent manner. On the basis of these reassurances, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

I want to use it to clarify two things. One is the way that the machinery described in the clause works. The other picks up on the question raised by my noble friend Lord Lucas about funding, to see how the money and responsibility chains work in this context, as well as in the context referred to by my noble friend.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09070269000167"></a>The clause header is:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="09070269000323"></a>&#147;Power to require provision of education by institution within further education sector&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070269000296"></a>In subsection (1) of proposed new Section 51A to the 1992 Act, we find that the institution is,</p>
<ul><a name="09070269000349"></a>&#147;an institution in England within the further education sector which provides education suitable to the requirements of persons over compulsory school age but under the age of 19&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070269000297"></a>That is perfectly clear. It appears that this power can be exercised throughout England, but not throughout Wales. That is my first question. Can a local authority in Cornwall require a local authority in Hampshire or Northumberland to provide education? The power is rightly restricted to use in connection with young people in their own authority, but is not restricted to applications to institutions within their own authority.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09070269000168"></a>That brings us to the question of how it will be paid for. Are we again to have a separation between the power of commissioning and the power of payment? I will leave the question short and simple at this stage. It may be that the Minister can deal with it quickly, and content me in the process. I beg to move.</p>

As he rightly says, it is a question not only of whether such instruction can be issued, but also of how payment is made.</p>

<a name="09070269000170"></a><b><a name="90702-0013.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09070269000434"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> My noble friend Lord Elton has raised another well considered probing point, and I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response. Clause 43, through its insertion of new Section 51A into the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, creates the power for a local education authority to require an institution to provide an education for a named individual. I expect that such a power will be used as a last resort&#151;I cannot imagine that any of us want to see the power being used. Far better to reach a situation where all parties&#151;institution, individual and LEA&#151;are content with the position. However, I accept the argument that from time to time this power might be needed.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09070269000171"></a>The attraction of my noble friend&#146;s amendment, were it to be adopted, would be to make sure that an LEA looked after its own. It could not despatch a problem individual across an authority boundary and wash its hands of him. We do not want to see a scenario where the individual is shunted from pillar to post as LEAs squabble over who should do what. However, it would be useful to have flexibility in this matter, because it may be that the most suitable institution to provide the education is across an LEA boundary. In that case, it would be petty bureaucracy of the worst kind to deny the person a fresh start because the money and the order-making power cannot cross the invisible line that exists only on departmental maps.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09070269000172"></a>My noble friend is right to ask how the matter of money will be settled. Who will pay&#151;and who ought to pay? If a cash-strapped LEA sends an individual to another area that has both places and resources, should the latter not make a contribution? Or could the second area, with some justification, argue that the problem was none of its concern, thank you very much? This is a question about bureaucracy: the principles are not being questioned, but rather how it will work in practice. If the Minister were able to give some examples of problems that he and his officials have foreseen, and the solutions that they have devised, we might be much happier to accept the clause.</p>

To my mind, the wording of subsection (2)(a) makes rather a difference. If a person is willing to be taught, to require an institution to provide them with education is a reasonable thing to do. If what a person wants to be doing is spending the

You can require it to try, but you cannot require it to do it.</p>

Amendment 106 seeks to limit the use of that power to those institutions within the local authorities&#146; own boundaries as the noble Lord, Lord Elton, made clear.</p>

<a name="90702-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09070269000175"></a>I understand the intention behind the noble Lord&#146;s amendment is to seek clarification on how funding across a local authority boundary will operate. The duties rest on every local authority to secure sufficient provision for the young people in their area. Young people move around, and local authorities must work together to ensure that they still have a choice, which seems to be have been the theme of a number of the debates that we have had today. To facilitate that co-operation, as I have previously said, local authorities have voluntarily come together into 43 sub-regional groupings to act as planning bodies. Over the next few months the lead commissioning authority for every provider will be identified. For many, this will be the authority in which they are physically located. The Young People&#146;s Learning Agency will be established to ensure that the plans brought forward are coherent and affordable.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90702-0014.htm"/>


<a name="90702-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09070269000176"></a>The noble Lord seeks to know what happens to the funding when there is a cross-border flow of young people. The aim is to use that planning system and the information schools and colleges already have to better predict where young people will choose to study before any money flows at all. We do not want to return to the bureaucratic days of recoupment. Instead local authorities will be given indicative budgets based on the information from the current and next year&#146;s 16 to 19 allocation processes that will enable them to plan more effectively.</p>

<a name="90702-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09070269000177"></a>The YPLA will support that planning with high-quality, real-time analysis drawing on information from its own systems as well as from Connexions services, schools and colleges. As a plan is developed and signed off, it will be clear to where the vast majority of the money must flow, and the YPLA will then issue final budgets to ensure providers are paid.</p>

<a name="90702-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09070269000178"></a>Where a local authority has directed a college to take a young person on, we would expect that the directing local authority would have discussed the issue with the &#147;host&#148; local authority and the college first, and that all parties have reached an agreement on how that place will be funded. The YPLA will have to be notified, so it continues to monitor and adjust its records of places and budgets. We do not expect, nor want, an authority to create a financial cost in another authority and we will look to the conditions of grant that the YPLA will establish under Clause 60 as the mechanism for ensuring the system operates smoothly when a local authority feels the need to use Clause 43.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09070269000179"></a>I would also like to address the practical implications of the amendment. There are two reasons why we should avoid putting in the Bill a limitation only to use the powers for colleges in their area.</p>

I have no intention of making that restriction, but only gesturing as a means of extracting the information he is giving me about the circumstances when it would not be permitted if I put that restriction there, so he can leave that bit out. I am not sure if that is welcome to those who want to go home late, but it is certainly welcome to those who want to go home early.</p>

I was asked to give an example, and a good one is this. At least one local authority in the Isles of Scilly does not have a college in its boundary. It is obvious that this amendment would make it impossible for it to direct an institution in order to secure provision for its young people.</p>

<a name="90702-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09070269000182"></a>This power is intended to ensure that we can help our most vulnerable young people who might have problems securing a place. Young offenders, once they leave detention to begin along the road to recovery, must be supported to participate and thus make a more positive contribution to society. Here I hope that I am addressing the concerns expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. By accepting the amendment we would limit both the choice of a young person and the ability of a local authority to secure the best quality provision for the most vulnerable among our young people. A power to direct should be used when there is no other choice. It is a tool of last resort, and that is why the LSC has never had to use it. It is possible that the knowledge that the power exists means that the commissioner and the commission need to focus on the needs of the learner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09070269000183"></a>I think that I have covered the question of whether an authority in Cornwall might require a provider in Northumbria or Hampshire. Yes, and as we have said previously, the funding will follow the learner. So I hope that, with my explanation, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

Under Section 512 of the Education Act 1996, local authorities have the power to provide free meals for registered pupils at a school. If a pupil is eligible for free school meals, the local authority or the school governors have a duty to provide the lunch free of charge. Every registered pupil at a school is entitled to free school meals if they or their parents qualify under Section 512.

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09070269000193"></a>The 363 colleges in England have a central role in educating disadvantaged young people. Indeed, 69 per cent of 16 to 18 year-olds receiving the highest rate of educational maintenance allowances study at colleges. There is an issue of equity because, although young people in colleges take similar courses to their counterparts in schools, Ministers at the DCSF confirmed in a Parliamentary Answer last year that the Government have no plans to provide free meals for college students, even though the learning participation age is being raised. The abolition of the Learning and Skills Council and the return of funding for 16 to 18 year-olds to local authorities make this anomaly even more unsupportable. We&#151;I am arguing on the behalf of the Association of Colleges&#151;consider that the proposed new clause would ensure that all 16 to 18 year-olds are treated equally regardless of where they study.

One recognises that this is not a good economic stage and that it may have to be looked at in that capacity, but it is to be hoped that, when and if we recover from the situation we are in, it will be taken more seriously.</p>

Certainly, in my experience, one can come across 16 year-olds who have been edged out of their homes because a new partner has arrived and they are not so welcome. We have to recognise that many of our young people have to manage on their own, without family support, far earlier than we would want. These are the very young people who would be particularly helped by the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment. They are learning how to look after themselves. In the past they might have had a family around to ensure that they had a square meal; I am sure that we would see to it that our teenagers did. They are finding their feet in the world. Given the current financial difficulties, it would be laudable to implement this amendment. It is very much the right direction to move in and I hope that the Minister can give an encouraging response.</p>

With regard to Amendment 107, we are already doing a great deal to support and encourage young people to participate and progress in learning, to increase the post-16 learning options available to them and to support those learning choices. Education maintenance allowances, which provide up to &#163;30 a week for learners from lower-income households, are available for learners aged 16 to 19 in schools, colleges and on certain training courses. That does not discount the noble Baroness&#146;s latter point on the equity question, which the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, also addressed.</p>

<a name="90702-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="09070269000204"></a>Eligibility for EMA is based on household income. Nearly half of 16 to 19 year-olds in full-time further education currently qualify for this help on the basis of a household income assessment. Currently, families have to be in receipt of certain benefits and tax credits in order to be eligible for free school meals for their children.</p>

<a name="90702-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09070269000205"></a>In addition to EMA, discretionary learner support funds are made available via the Learning and Skills Council to colleges and local authorities. This funding is provided to enable schools and colleges, using their discretion, to help individual learners facing hardship and financial barriers to learning that are not addressed through other means. That might take into account the groups of people that the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, addressed.</p>

<a name="90702-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09070269000206"></a>In addition to the support that may be provided directly to young learners, other mechanisms exist to help with the costs of supporting young people aged 16 to 18 in learning, including universal child benefit. Child tax credits may be paid to parents if their child is participating. Recent increases to child benefit will provide additional support for parents regardless of income, and the increase to the child element of the child tax credit, a measure brought forward in the Budget, will provide substantial additional support to families.</p>

<a name="90702-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="09070269000207"></a>Given the generous support that is already made available to students who stay in learning&#151;child benefit and tax credits, as I mentioned&#151;and to families if their child is participating in any of a range of learning options, we do not feel that the case has been sufficiently made to extend the very specific form of support for free school meals for 16 to 18 year-olds to a wider range of premises.</p>

<a name="90702-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09070269000208"></a>I welcome the return of the noble Lord, Lord Baker, to more constructive contributions, such as his point about apprenticeships and work-based learning environments. We are, however, looking carefully at all the arrangements for supporting young people, especially in the context of a raised participation age. We are taking this forward through the review into financial support for 16 to 18 year-olds that we announced in the <I>New Opportunities </I>White Paper. The review will

<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="09070269000209"></a>Once again, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. This is an important issue on the grounds of equity. We also do not want to do anything that deters young people from remaining in education. I hope that the noble Baroness will acknowledge that the range of what we are trying to do for young people extends beyond free school meals to how we support young people. The fact that we have increased the participation age raises once again the importance of ensuring that we do not deter young people from remaining in education. As the noble Lord, Lord Addington, reminded us, they need food for thought and we need to ensure that they can obtain it at a reasonable cost. I trust that my explanations will enable the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I believe that breakfast is more effective than lunch. I take on board what he says, but it is still true that universal child benefit, child tax credits and so forth are available to those who are in school and the sixth form in exactly the same way that they might be available to college students. Discretionary hardship funds are also available to those in school. At the moment, colleges have to use their discretionary funds occasionally to subsidise food for young people because they know that the young people are not getting fed as they should be. The colleges step in to make sure that they get a decent meal so that they can learn. I take it from what the Minister said that, following the raising of the participation age, a fairly wide-ranging review is now taking place about financial barriers and that this is, so to speak, being put into the pot of that review.</p>

<a name="90702-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="09070269000211"></a>It seems to me that there is a strong case in equity for making sure that young people in a college or sixth-form college environment are on exactly the same level as those in school. Therefore, I hope that this question would be part of that review. I recognise that it imposes a cost, but the equity issue means that the cost has to be faced up to. Alternatively, the Government must think about reducing what is available in the school sector. We look forward to hearing about what happens in the review. Perhaps by the time we assemble in the autumn, we shall know a little more about it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09070269000213"></a>That seems very clear. However, the next new section, on the additional entitlement, which is what Amendment 107A addresses, is far vaguer. The Bill says that this is a right,</p>

<p><a name="09070269000214"></a>It then goes on to say that the Secretary of State may specify by regulation what areas will be designated in this manner, but it does not explain what kind of courses of study might be included. A quick glance at the Explanatory Notes shows that it refers to diploma lines, which will be specified by the Secretary of State. This, therefore, is simply a probing amendment, designed to ask the Minister to clarify whether it is only the diploma that will be specified as an additional entitlement and to expand on it generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09070269000215"></a>Furthermore, is the Minister not at all concerned that this may push young people towards a diploma without sufficient care being taken over what course of study or training might best suit their needs? I hope that she might be able to allay the concerns of City and Guilds, which is worried that the very specific nature of the additional entitlement may push people towards a diploma and away from a vocational course. I look forward to her response and I beg to move.</p>

Noble Lords may recall that we debated the introduction of this entitlement during the passage of the Education and Inspections Bill in 2006. It was something that the House took a great interest in, as I understand. Clause 44 merely restates the requirement in the 2006 Act to secure the core entitlement and, as the noble Lord says, the additional entitlement for 16 to 18 year-olds, and it places the duty on local authorities instead of the Learning and Skills Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="09070269000217"></a>I am happy to confirm that our intention is that the additional entitlement will relate to diploma lines, as the noble Lord describes. Our intention is that this entitlement will be delivered from the 2013-14 academic year. As for this representing undue pressure on young people to pursue diplomas, as opposed to other qualifications such as A-levels, BTEC or apprenticeships, there are strong duties in the Bill that would guard against that, such as those about the importance of delivering education that is appropriate to the individual learner. I am trying to give the noble Lord the clarity that he was looking for that this reference is about diploma lines and that our intention is that this entitlement, as he is aware, will be delivered from 2013-14 onwards. I could go on at length about how fantastic diplomas are and how we have a strong take-up by local authorities already pursuing diplomas, but I see that I may not have to do that now. I hope that, with that reassurance and clarification, the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="09070269000220"></a>It arises from my still slightly painful memory of being a teacher in a 1,500-boy comprehensive school and being responsible, in part, for teaching in the lower-ability streams and encountering the growing conviction of pupils throughout that stream, in their last year, that they ought to be out in the world doing something quite different, and that what they were doing in school was not very relevant. It was not just me; more gifted teachers than me came across this difficulty as well.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="09070269000221"></a>It intensified when word spread that the school leaving age was going to be raised by a year. Fortunately, I moved to a college of education and taught teachers to teach before that happened. However, I was well aware of the sharp distinction in the minds of many pupils of average ability&#151;some were above and many were below average ability&#151;who considered that school was a preliminary to real life. Anything outside the school was challenging, exciting and probably grown up, whereas anything inside the school was boring, tiresome and, to many of them, however hard we tried, not particularly relevant.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="09070269000222"></a>It seems to me that the Bill could capitalise on the fact that moving out of one institution into another can give a considerable boost to the engagement of the pupil concerned. This factor is even more important where one sibling decides not to continue with education or training beyond the compulsory age but a younger sibling decides to embark on that course and the elder then decides to follow. This will seem to the latter a great diminution of his stature. We are all familiar with the idea of rites of passage. Leaving school is one of them. I hope that occasionally it can act as an incentive to making more profitable use of a student&#146;s time. That is why I have suggested that education be offered at a school other than the school previously attended by a person, because that is going back to the juvenile in his or her view. If it cannot be offered at another school, it had better be offered at another sort of institution.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="09070269000223"></a>There are two pairs of amendments which deal with core and additional entitlements, but the message is the same. I have not explained it very well but those who have taught will know exactly what I mean. I beg to move.</p>

The picture he paints of the past is one with which I identify, as I attended a very large comprehensive school, probably not dissimilar to the one he described, and both my parents taught in similar schools. In the 1970s it was evident that swathes of young people felt that they needed to leave school because the learning opportunity was particularly rigid. The noble Lord talked about young people who may be less able but who should have the opportunity to continue their education in the way that is right for them.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09070269000226"></a>We need to be mindful of the fact that this issue concerns not only the young person&#146;s ability but their learning styles and experiences and the place where they feel confident and relaxed enough to learn. We know that a lot of young people might opt to learn in a more practical or work-based environment. It does not necessarily mean that they are less able. For example, they may be incredibly able in an entrepreneurial sense. It is a matter of giving them the right opportunity that suits them. That is why the Government have opted for a qualification strategy that puts diplomas very much at its heart and, through our debates on raising participation&#151;I know the noble Lord was interested in those debates&#151;making sure that if we are doing that we accept that for some young people it is right for them to take a job. While we believe that they should have access to training, we also believe that training should be suitably practical and relevant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09070269000227"></a>The point made by the noble Lord about rites of passage was very well made. I can identify with it; moving to a new institution&#151;to an FE college or a sixth form at a different school&#151;can often give a young person an opportunity to reinvent themselves as a slightly older person without all the baggage of their younger years or errors, and gain new friendship groups and so on. I appreciate all the points that the noble Lord is making. We recognise that choice is extremely important and that funding should follow the learner to facilitate that diversity. We recognise the need for diversity in providers and we have a qualification strategy that takes into account diplomas, GCSEs, A-levels and, of course, apprenticeships.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09070269000228"></a>I hope that the noble Lord can feel reassured that, as we move to a time when we have raised the participation age, those rites of passage will be possible within a learning system that allows young people to stay in learning, to grow and change, and that they are given access to the opportunity for development that we in our society need so much and is of such great benefit for them. I hope that the noble Lord will consider withdrawing his amendment on the basis of what I can only describe as a plea.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="09070269000235"></a>In the Learning and Skills Act 2000 there was a requirement for the LSC to secure boarding education if,</p>
<ul><a name="09070269000355"></a>&#147;it cannot secure the provision of facilities for education or training which are sufficient in quantity and adequate in quality&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070269000298"></a>We understand that there is no intention to dilute this clause. Clause 45 is a transfer over from the Learning and Skills Act. The current wording is:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a><a name="09070269000334"></a>&#147;A local education authority in England may secure the provision of boarding accommodation in connection with the provision of education or training for a person in their area who is ... over compulsory school age but under 25, and ... subject to learning difficulty assessment&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070269000299"></a>We would like to see the &#147;may&#148; put into a &#147;must&#148;, but with the proviso that there should also be a new paragraph (c), for those who cannot secure the provision of facilities for,</p>
<ul><a name="09070269000356"></a>&#147;education or training which are sufficient in quantity and adequate in quality without the provision of boarding accommodation&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90702-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="09070269000236"></a>Only a small number of learners&#151;currently about 3,600&#151;need access to residential provision to ensure that their further education and training needs are met. These learners have severe and complex learning difficulties and/or disabilities and require a specialist, fully integrated, multidisciplinary environment in which to receive a personalised and appropriately supported learning programme. The use of the word &#147;may&#148; risks the possibility of these learners either attending local colleges where their needs cannot be adequately met, staying on at school until the age of 25 or being denied access to any further education. We draw attention to the fact that the term &#147;boarding accommodation&#148; does not fully reflect the wide range of extended learning opportunities that are available to learners in a residential setting.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="09070269000237"></a>This same amendment was discussed in the other place. The Minister stated that it is important to read Clause 45 in conjunction with Clause 40, which inserts proposed new Section 15ZA into the Education Act 1996. Subsection 15ZA(1)(b) places local authorities under a firm duty to,</p>
<ul><a name="09070269000357"></a>&#147;secure that enough suitable education and training is provided to meet the reasonable needs of persons ... aged 19 or over but under 25 and ... subject to learning difficulty assessment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070269000300"></a>That is in effect where the &#147;must&#148; in the predecessor Act comes in. Clause 45 clarifies that the local authority may deliver that overriding duty through boarding education.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="09070269000238"></a>The Association of National Specialist Colleges, which has asked us to bring this matter forward, is unhappy because it still believes that the word &#147;may&#148; in the clause is unsatisfactory, because local authorities will not be legally obliged to arrange boarding education. A perhaps unintended consequence is that residential education and training provision for vulnerable learners will not be secured.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="09070269000239"></a>I believe that there has been considerable discussion between Ministers and the Association of National Specialist Colleges in the past few weeks and that the matter has moved forward somewhat. I know that the association is anxious that the elaboration that Ministers have given to the explanation given by the Minister, Jim Knight, in the other place, should be put on record in <I>Hansard</I><I>.</I> I would be very grateful if the Minister could give a full answer to the queries about

I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_247"></a>
<a name="09070269000240"></a><b><a name="90702-0015.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09070269000474"></a>Lord Baker of Dorking:</b> I certainly welcome the clause. First, I declare an interest. I am the president of a charity that provides boarding accommodation for blind and visually impaired children, nursery provision and schools up to the age of 16. We also have an extensive FE college for those aged from 16 to 19. That is a very expensive service. We have to provide not only in capital expenditure for a variety of needs&#151;in our case, not only the blind and visually impaired but those with emotional learning difficulties and physical learning difficulties&#151;but that requires supervision at night and even at weekends, if the youngsters cannot go to similar secure accommodation.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="09070269000241"></a>I would hope that in any discussion with specialist colleges, the Government will recognise that the most effective way for a local authority to meet its obligations under the clause will be to use the specialist colleges. Local authorities will be very reluctant to build such boarding accommodation for 16 to 25 year-olds if they have to find the money themselves. They also have responsibility for people who are disadvantaged in the adult age range, and they may have their own priorities to deal with that. That is another expensive programme. We may need some amendment to the wording of the clause so that local authorities would first call on the specialist colleges, most of which are charities and most of which are in the private sector. They give remarkably good value.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="09070269000242"></a>Several FE colleges have boarding accommodation. For example, nearly all the agricultural colleges around the country have boarding accommodation. That is because, first, the journey for youngsters may be 30 or 40 miles, which is a long journey. Secondly, if they are looking after animals, they have to get up at dawn, so they must have boarding accommodation. That should be recognised. That is not quite pertinent to the clause, but it will be an issue increasingly in future. I imagine that that will come under the new Skills Funding Agency, not local authorities, but I am sure that one consequence of the Bill going through will be a demand for more boarding accommodation, especially in rural areas, not just for children with disability or learning difficulties but for the diploma in environmental services. The Minister just said that she is very committed to diplomas. The diploma in environmental services, which covers agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, and so on, will almost certainly require boarding accommodation for most of the students that colleges hope to get. I hope that we may receive a positive answer from the Minister on both of those points.</p>

Obviously, some types of accommodation are more suited to some people than to others. Can he give the Committee any form of reassurance as to how different LEAs are expected to collaborate, so as to provide such accommodation to those who need it?</p>

Also, the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Baker, were equally important; that it makes sense, in the relatively few cases of these needy students, to make proper use of those establishments which exist already. I also think that the proviso to really make quite certain that this is necessary is important, not least in these times.</p>

I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, for again introducing an interesting issue.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="09070269000246"></a>I am grateful for the opportunity to place on record our appreciation for the valuable role played by independent specialist colleges in providing education for learners, often with very specific needs and requirements. Some learners relish the independence and confidence provided by living away from home. This can be an important step to independent living. It is essential that this type of provision continues to be available where it is needed, and that both national and local commissioning processes are centred on the needs of learners.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="09070269000247"></a>Local authorities will need to work in partnership with specialist providers to ensure that they are involved in planning and commissioning discussions. There are particular benefits to be gained from this, as these colleges often have particular skills that it would be beneficial to share with other colleges and learning providers. This outward-facing approach is one that both we and the Local Government Association are keen to promote. We will ensure that the benefits of these types of arrangement are reflected in the national commissioning framework.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="09070269000248"></a>We are working with specialist colleges nationally, through the Association of National Specialist Colleges, to develop arrangements that recognise that independent specialist colleges will often work across local authority boundaries and nationally. I absolutely endorse the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Baker, about the expensive nature of these provisions. One could certainly not expect every local authority to provide them within their own boundaries&#151;which is why we have to ensure the ability of young people to go across local authority boundaries and, in some cases, nationally as well, because that is where the facility exists.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="09070269000249"></a>On the question of the specialist FE colleges, for example, some might do boarding; in others, students might stay out in local hostels or hotels. I think there  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_431"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column 431</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are a variety of arrangements. I have met a number of apprentices who have been involved in this: it certainly does not just apply to people with learning disabilities. It is likely that the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency will act in a brokerage role for an interim period to allow local authorities to build up their expertise in this area.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="09070269000250"></a>I understand that some colleges have concerns about the specific working of Clause 45, and here is where I want to place on record the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, raised. I would like to reassure the colleges and the noble Baroness on this point: Clause 45 needs to be read in conjunction with Clause 40. Clause 40 places local authorities under a firm duty to secure enough suitable education and training to meet the reasonable needs of all young people aged 16 to 19, and those aged 19 to 25 who are subject to learning difficulty assessment. In deciding whether the education or training is suitable to meet a person&#146;s reasonable needs, the local authority must&#151;note the word &#147;must&#148;&#151;have regard to a number of considerations, including any learning difficulties that persons in their area may have. Therefore, the overriding duty and the &#147;must&#148; is in Clause 40.</p>

<a name="90702-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="09070269000251"></a>Clause 45 clarifies that, where appropriate, local authorities may deliver this overriding duty through the provision of boarding accommodation. This approach is exactly parallel with the requirements in pre-16 education and boarding provision, where the local authority has a clear duty to provide education and the legislation makes it clear that the local authority may fulfil this duty by providing boarding provision where suitable education cannot be provided without it.</p>

I am trying to think of any reason why the Government should not do this, other than the fact that they think it is difficult. We have already heard that certain people do not think there is the absolute killer test that will identify everything and I have had various discussions in the presence of the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, about the problems associated with this. However, there are plenty of tests and screening initiatives which can give a good identification for virtually all of these spectrum disorders. As the noble Lord has quite rightly put down, if you have two goes, you are much more likely to catch all of them. I have not heard anybody disagreeing with the fact that you are unlikely to get a system that is 100 per cent accurate in identifying these special needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="09070269000261"></a>No one would dispute the fact that, even if you get in early with coping and support strategies, you do not cure any of these conditions, but people can learn to live with them and deal with them properly. We need to make sure there is the right help and support for pupils with different patterns. If you are dyslexic, as I know to my cost, you are dyslexic for life. Someone comes up with a miracle cure for dyslexia, for instance, approximately every 18 months&#151;sometimes more frequently, sometimes less. And every three years there is someone who knows that it does not exist. This is roughly the pattern I have noted. As these miracle cures come and go, and the person waving a theory disappears off into the night saying that the rest of the world is mad and he is sane, those of us who suffer from these conditions know that, if you identify patterns and put structures in place early enough, many of the downsides are removed&#151;predominantly, the failure to jump through the hoops of the academic system to get into the right positions within it to access better training in later life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="09070269000262"></a>The effect of not addressing these conditions can lead to a downward spiral of bad behavioural records, certainly for dyslexics but also for dyspraxics and dyscalculics. If we can address them, we will get rid of that. Also, if you train people better&#151;for instance, dyslexics to use a voice recognition system on their computer&#151;and get in earlier, they will be able to get into learning technology more quickly. Everything about these types of conditions will be made easier if you get identification and learning strategies in earlier. I would suggest that we really must travel towards this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="09070269000263"></a>I thank the Government for their 4,000 newly trained teachers in about 25,000 schools. It would be a reasonable assumption that these 4,000 teachers have acquired a degree of knowledge. But it is still the case that only one in two schools has one specifically trained teacher. So unless it is written in the Bill that they have to buy in the expertise that is in the system for this function, we will be underachieving. I hope that the Government will see this approach as a way of cashing in on their

Many of these problems emerge only when the child&#146;s inner resources have been exhausted. I have seen bright dyslexics diagnosed in their second year at Cambridge. If you are bright enough you can carry this for a long time before you know what is going on. It is important to pick up these kids, whatever their level of innate intelligence, in order to separate out the reasons for the difficulties that they are having and to give them the right support as a result. This is much better done by way of a universal diagnosis, which is not expensive because diagnostic testing of those kids should be done at that stage anyway. If we get around to doing it, it will save a great deal of money and a great deal of heartache in the long term.</p>

Had the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, been here, he would have reiterated the point that he, I and others have made; namely, that the earliest possible testing, at the age of 2, 1 or whatever, is important. I have certainly read the Rose report and was delighted that it was accepted by the Government. My only reservation was the reasoning that testing early would not help very much. Testing early may not be the only test that one needs to do, but it could be, should be and almost certainly would be an early indication of problems and the need for support in the future.</p>

<a name="90702-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="09070269000271"></a>Noble Lords have referred to Sir Jim Rose&#146;s review, which was recently concluded and published. The Government have accepted his recommendations. His report offered the clear advice to government that there are better ways to identify children at risk of literacy difficulties and dyslexia. He advised us that the best way is to closely observe and assess their responses to pre-reading and early-reading activities in comparison with their typically developing peers in the reception year of primary school and beyond.</p>

<a name="90702-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="09070269000272"></a>As noble Lords are aware, the review found that the first step advocated in identifying that children may have language learning difficulties, including dyslexia, is to notice those making poor progress in comparison with their typically developing peers, despite receiving&#151;this is an important point that noble Lords have made in the past&#151;high-quality, wave 1 literacy activity. In other words, children who are failing to thrive despite significant expert literacy intervention.</p>

It is not always children who are making poor progress. For instance, my son had just won a scholarship when we were asked if we would have him tested. They thought that there was something the matter with his eyes. He was dyslexic, and he was 14 before we realised that whenever he read, the text moved around on the paper. I asked him why he was not reading and he said, &#147;Because it makes all those awful patterns&#148;. I asked why he had not said anything before and he said, &#147;Because I thought that happened when everybody read&#148;. It was important that he was diagnosed, because he was not doing as well as he was capable of doing. It is not always children who are doing poorly: that is why you need a general diagnostic test for everybody.</p>

It is absolutely essential. The noble Lords, Lord Addington and Lord Elton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, have stressed this on many occasions. We all agree that early identification is essential. I do not want it to be thought that there is an assumption that it is only children who are less able who have dyslexia or other learning difficulties. Very bright children struggle with these difficulties. I fully recognise that. The example given by the noble Baroness is a very important one.</p>

Noble Lords will be aware from our previous discussions and correspondence over the years that we are looking to address these concerns in ways that are different from those proposed in the amendment. We have had a very good debate today. A

The professional standards for teachers require trainee teachers to demonstrate that they can make effective personalised provision for those whom they teach, including those with special educational needs, and that they know how to differentiate their teaching accordingly. The Training and Development Agency for Schools is encouraging training providers to use new specialist study units that include material on learning and teaching for pupils with, for example, autism or dyslexia, or who require support with speech, language and communication needs. This is important new work that is being developed.</p>

<a name="90702-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="09070269000276"></a>We know that most providers are using these materials on their primary undergraduate teacher training courses. That is new; it is something that we have talked of in the past as being very necessary. We launched the units for secondary undergraduate courses on 23 June. SEN units for the PGCE will be available before the end of the year. We have also developed the inclusion development programme for the school workforce. Since we debated this issue last year, we have issued materials to increase confidence and knowledge in relation to children with autism. I know that noble Lords are very concerned about that, too.</p>

<a name="90702-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="09070269000277"></a>My noble friend has already referred at length to Sir Jim Rose&#146;s report, as I have just done, but the noble Lord, Lord Addington, touched on the 4,000 teachers in specialist dyslexia teacher training. I would say that that is an important and significant contribution. It has been welcomed by the stakeholders as an important step forward. I recognise noble Lords&#146; concerns about the need to do more for children and young people with special educational needs but, equally, I am sure that they will recognise the challenges in establishing reliable screening tools for all learning difficulties listed in the amendment.</p>

<a name="90702-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="09070269000278"></a>We are taking this seriously and trying to ensure that the teaching workforce has the skills. We are committed to supporting, in particular, children and young people with dyslexia. I accept the point about early intervention. We look forward to the significant Ofsted review that is being undertaken, in which I know this House will show a great deal of interest. I hope that, with this ongoing interest and concern, the noble Lord will consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

Do not get me wrong: this situation is a case of, &#147;You wouldn&#146;t want to start from here&#148;. Everybody has been trying to find solutions and we have found, as we have gone into it, that awareness of the problem has expanded. I appreciate that the Government have gone on to new ground, but they are the Government and they are supposed to do that. Does the Minister not agree that there is some case for some form of screening&#151;if not in all of these conditions, then in some of them&#151;which, enhanced by greater teacher awareness, stands a much better chance of not missing people?</p>

However, I will not argue with the noble Lord at all about this. I accept that early identification of learning difficulties is essential. Screening, by definition, is about looking at a whole population using a particular identification tool. To go into the debate about screening, the advice that we have had is that the most effective way of early identification is not through a school population-basis screening. We have sought expert advice and this issue, I accept, is not going to go away. We are always interested in research, the next expert review and the next Ofsted review and we are always committed to listening and learning as we go forward. We have to live up to the commitments that we have made to the Rose report, so we need to get on with that, too. I accept all that.</p>

Could she give an undertaking that the Government will fund urgent research in order to develop a test that is reliable? I believe that they exist because they are used in certain places. Indeed, I am sorry that my ally, the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, is not here because he knows a great deal about where it is being done in a youth detention centre in Northern Ireland. It is not proving to be too expensive, as we were told on the last Bill, and I hope that the noble Baroness has noticed that I have reduced my interventions from three to two in anticipation of her claim that it would be very expensive, which is what she said the last time around. I shall pursue this

<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="09070269000282"></a>I do not suppose that the 4,000 new teachers due to come along will all arrive in one year, although it would be a good thing if they did. How long will they take to get into place? Is it intended to stop the process of training them when they have arrived? In that case, along with the noble Lord, Lord Addington, I feel that that will be inadequate. It is a good start, but more than 4,000 will be needed in order to provide a significant presence in all our schools. My own view, as I expressed before, is that you do not have to have a diagnostic specialist in every school, but you need someone who can select those pupils who are most likely to need a diagnosis. A sufficient level of skill is required in every school to ensure that a child who is at risk of one of these conditions is referred to a more expensive expert who will be able to make the identification.</p>

I shall consider with great care what has been said and I can promise to come back on Report with a modified version of the amendment, if only to get my ally the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, on to the stage to deliver his expertise. I repeat my thanks to others who have contributed to the debate and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

However, I have not withdrawn the amendment because it should be in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000004"></a>In the chapter of his report entitled &#147;The Role of Sanctions&#148;, Professor Gregg recommended the introduction of a system of staged sanctions for claimants who had received a written warning for the first instance of non-compliance of attending a mandatory interview or appointment. This would spell out exactly why the claimant had been sanctioned and what the financial consequences would be for further non-compliance. Under the Bill, financial sanctions could be applied immediately, without a clear written warning, after the first non-compliance.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000005"></a>The amendment was suggested by Citizens Advice, which regularly sees clients whose benefits have been sanctioned but who do not understand why&#151;which of course makes the sanction less effective in changing future behaviour. As I said earlier, the Minister said that a written warning is sent, presumably when an interview or other appointment is missed, and that this warning letter constitutes the first sanction. If this is the case, why is it not enshrined in legislation to protect the vulnerable from being financially penalised for the first offence, which they may not have correctly understood? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000006"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09070277000389"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> My view is and has always been that we are dealing with sanctions for violent conduct&#151;in other words, punishment for behaviour that I expect all noble Lords would deplore and agree is deserving of sanctions. I hope we can get an assurance from the Minister that new Section 20C on page 28 of the Bill will offer protection from violence to all those involved  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC96"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC96</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in delivering the welfare system. That includes everyone from Jobcentre Plus office workers to employees of the organisations who have contracted to run the scheme and members of the subcontractor&#146;s staff. The threat of violence against anyone who is helping to administer welfare schemes is entirely unacceptable. I trust that the Minister would agree with that.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000007"></a>I therefore believe that sanctions are necessary. However, they should not be&#151;and must not be seen to be&#151;arbitrary. A warning letter which set out details of why sanctions are being applied would be a useful way of explaining to a claimant why his own conduct is responsible for his predicament. Perhaps it will be a salutary warning.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000008"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, that sanctions should not be imposed on claimants before they have had adequate warning that it is about to happen. Perhaps the best way is in the form of a letter. Other methods, such as telephone or e-mail, might also be helpful. Indeed, for people with a mental illness, we have already had the promise that sanctions will not be upheld without a face-to-face interview.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000009"></a>I had been planning, however, to read out an example of how not to do it in a letter&#151;a letter from the DWP to the daughter of a deceased pensioner which was so threatening in its tone that it ended up in Parliament, in my hands. I was so horrified by it that I sent it to the Minister, who I believe forwarded it to the Pension Agency. Alas, I made the crucial error of sending the original to the Minister without keeping a copy for myself, so I am unable to discomfit your Lordships by reading it out. Suffice it to say that it did not arouse feelings of sympathy for the department, which was trying to reclaim the amount of state pension that had mistakenly been paid out after the pensioner&#146;s death.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>

I hope that when I finally get a response from the Pension Agency I will be able to forward it to the Minister, because I am trying to get a response to the tone of the letter from him rather than the agency which sent the letter in the first place.</p>

Yes, it is meant to apply not only to Jobcentre Plus

As for the letter that the noble Lord sent me, operational letters are automatically passed on to the agencies. However, I shall recover his letter and ensure that he gets a detailed response directly from me.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000013"></a>The clause introduces a new benefit sanction for those customers who fail to attend their mandatory appointments within the jobseeker&#146;s allowance regime. Such appointments include, for example, the fortnightly job search review where customers demonstrate that they are available for and have been actively seeking work. This is applied only to those groups who are on JSA because they are deemed to be actively seeking and available for work.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000014"></a>The amendment proposes that JSA customers are given a warning letter and an explanation of the act of non-compliance prior to the issue of the sanction. I shall explain why this step is not appropriate for this client group. Mandatory appointments with Jobcentre Plus are a core element of the JSA regime. The appointments act as a gateway to the support on offer to help customers back to work, and they act as a crucial checkpoint in ensuring that customers are actively seeking and are available for work. The requirement to attend appointments and the consequences for failure to attend are clearly communicated to customers at the start of a claim and repeated at regular intervals throughout the course of the claim.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000015"></a>As customers are fully informed of this key commitment, if they still fail to attend, they could be trying to avoid their responsibility actively to seek work. There therefore needs to be a clear link between the customer&#146;s responsibilities under the JSA regime and the consequences of failing to comply. We believe that sending customers a warning letter before a sanction would only weaken this link between the responsibility to attend appointments and the right to receive benefit.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000016"></a>A different approach to sanctions for other client groups, notably the progression-to-work group, will apply. That is the point focused on by the noble Baroness. These groups and the progression-to-work group will, for the purposes of the pathfinders, consist of lone parents with young children claiming employment and support allowance who are not required to be actively seeking and available for work. It would therefore not be appropriate to apply this sanctions regime to those claimants.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000017"></a>We plan to test the effectiveness of a more progressive regime based on the principles recommended by Professor Gregg in the pathfinders. He suggested that the sanctions regime needs to be clearly understood. The noble Baroness made that point as well. We will use different ways to encourage re-engagement and will always offer speedy and simple routes to customers to end any sanctions imposed. We plan to follow that approach. Our model for the pathfinders is not yet fixed as we wish to discuss our plans in more detail with the stakeholders. However, our current plans particularly focus on the small number of people who repeatedly fail to meet the requirements that apply to them. We do this by progressively increasing the impact the greater the number of consecutive failures there are. Therefore, if a person fails to meet a work-focused

In line with Professor Gregg&#146;s recommendations, we will issue a formal and final written warning. This should significantly reduce the number of people who receive a financial sanction in the pathfinder areas. Obviously we will evaluate those pathfinders in due course and see whether a wider rollout of that approach would be appropriate.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000018"></a>I assure the Committee that the sanctioning regime in JSA incorporates safeguards. If customers show good cause&#151;and we have debated that extensively&#151;for failing to attend the appointment, a sanction will not be applied. Further, if customers are sanctioned, they will have the opportunity to claim a hardship payment, which we have talked about, if they or a partner is in a vulnerable group; for example if they have a medical condition or are responsible for a child. Customers will also be able to appeal the imposition of the sanction. I hope that that has clarified our position for the noble Baroness and that she feels able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

One can readily understand that the regime will be slightly different when applied to the Clause 2 group, the progression-to-work group. It would be extremely helpful if I and perhaps the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, could see the pro forma letters which currently exist for the first group and what is likely to be available or used for the second group, so that we can make a judgment on this.</p>

I am informed that the legion has been engaged in a campaign designed to alleviate pension poverty among older veterans. That followed research it commissioned, which showed that 38 per cent of older veterans, their spouses and widowers report an income level below that required for healthy living.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000026"></a>Despite these low income levels, it is estimated that only 55 to 61 per cent of all pensioners who qualify for council tax benefit actually make a claim. The Department for Work and Pensions has estimated that up to &#163;1.5 billion of CTB is left unclaimed by pensioners each year. For this reason, the legion has embarked on a campaign to rename council tax benefit and to call it a rebate. It believes that this is a simple, cost-effective and practical way of helping pensioners, many of them in the ex-service community. It believes that this will increase take up considerably, thereby lifting tens of thousands of pensioners out of poverty.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000027"></a>The legion has done a fair amount of research to see whether it would have that effect. It conducted a poll through ComRes as recently as May 2009 and found that 75 per cent of members of the public agree that renaming council tax benefit as a rebate might help encourage more people to make a claim for it. These words were used by the DWP in its submission  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC100"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the 2007 Communities and Local Government Select Committee, so it is good to know that there are people in all areas who are in agreement with the notion that changing the name to rebate would have the effect that the legion believes that it will. It has also got support from a number of organisations, including, as I said, the Select Committee. It also believes that it has support across the political spectrum. It says that it has support from the leaders of the Conservatives and of the Lib Dems, both of whom have written to the legion to say that they support the rebate.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000028"></a>In view of all this and the fact that there is a substantial amount of support right across the board for what is now proposed, I hope the Government will take heed of the results of the campaign and be prepared to accept the amendment&#151;which would, I am sure, have the effect of ensuring that claims are made by a number of people who at the moment apparently are too proud to claim benefit. That is very true of many veterans, but of course it is true of many pensioners as well. They do not like to be &#147;shamed&#148;, as they see it, into claiming for benefits. That may strike some of us as rather odd, but it is how they feel about it. I think that we should respond to that. If we change the name to rebate, there will not be the feeling of shame in making an application and more people will apply for what is their entitlement. I beg to move.</p>

To be strictly accurate, my right honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition has done rather more than support this amendment; what he did was to write to the director-general of the British Legion with the explicit promise that should the current Government fail to implement this change, a future Government will.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000030"></a>The important facts here are that less than 60 per cent of those who are eligible for council tax benefit actually make a claim, as the noble Baroness said. One reason for that is the stigma associated with being in receipt of benefit. The Minister will remember that in a recent Bill that emanated from the DWP, we talked an awful lot about stigma, in that case relating to disabled people&#151;in particular with cancer, but other elements as well. We can all agree that in certain parts of this country a stigma is associated with being in receipt of benefits. Although some may tut-tut that that is so, the Government know as well as anyone that it is a real consideration for people, not least because a report by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Select Committee in 2004 said that the stigma attached to council tax benefit being presented as a benefit rather than as, more accurately, a relief from tax contributed accounted for the dismal rate of take-up for council tax benefit. All the evidence is there. The aim behind the amendment is so strikingly simple that I cannot believe that even on an off-day the Minister could resist it&#151;and I hope that today is not an off-day.</p>

I am sure that noble Lords will understand that I must say this, having the opportunity. We think that it should be scrapped and replaced with a system based on people&#146;s ability to pay, which would be of great benefit to many older veterans living on low incomes.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000032"></a>Council tax benefit has the lowest take-up of any of the means-tested benefits. Some 1.7 million pensioners, including many ex-servicemen and women, do not claim it, as we have heard, because they are simply not prepared to claim a benefit. Research has clearly shown that rebranding council tax benefit as a rebate would increase the rate of take-up, and it would be a very practical change to help to lift a large number of older people out of poverty. We warmly support the proposal from these Benches and hope that the Government will accept the amendment.</p>

Most of these people will not be in the income tax bracket, but we have no hesitation about claiming income tax rebates. If it was an income tax benefit, we might think a bit differently. It is a tax and it should be called a rebate.</p>

She may have come close to unifying the Committee on an issue, which is perhaps a first during the course of our deliberations so far.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000035"></a>The aim of the amendment is to improve take-up of council tax benefit, particularly among pensioners, by changing its name. As my noble friend and others have done, I recognise the role that the Royal British Legion has played in highlighting this issue. My noble friend Lord Morris of Manchester has put his name to the amendment; he is unable to be here today, but he has a role as honorary parliamentary adviser to the legion and gives it his clear support. I am delighted that it has the support of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and his leader in the other place; the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and the noble Countess, Lady Mar.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000036"></a>It is very important that pensioners should claim the benefits to which they are entitled if we are to achieve our aim of reducing pensioner poverty. People should not be deterred from doing so by factors such as an off-putting name. Having said this, the Government are sympathetic to changing the name of council tax benefit to one that better describes its true nature. We recognise that it is something that has widespread support and has the potential to make a difference in helping people to claim it. The latest data that I have for council tax benefit take-up, for 2007-08, show take-up among pensioners of between 53 per cent and 60 per cent. The potential amount unclaimed is between &#163;1.2 billion and &#163;1.7 billion, so it is a lot of money that could make a real difference to the lives of many pensioners.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000037"></a>Sir Michael Lyons pointed out that council tax benefit effectively operates as a rebate and renaming it as such would do no more than reflect that fact. Even though council tax benefit already helps more than 5 million families, I should like to see the percentage of people who take up their entitlement rising and I am  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC102"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>disappointed that it is not. We have made considerable effort, working with local authorities, to make the claims process easier. For example, a change was made last October to allow pensioners to claim council tax benefit and housing benefit in a single telephone call at the same time as pension credit. There are no forms to sign or return. We are waiting to see the results of that important initiative.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000038"></a>Even so, there are clearly problems with take-up of the benefit. The most recent figures for 2007-08 show that around 62 per cent to 68 per cent of all those whom we believe to be entitled to claim council tax benefit actually do so&#151;the percentage for pensioners is smaller. Although one might draw some comfort from the fact that the percentages for take-up have been relatively stable for several years, the latest figures show a 1 per cent drop. This is extremely disappointing, even more so because we have done, and continue to do, a number of things to try to boost take-up.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000039"></a>We accept that we must do more to remedy the situation and have been impressed with the case made by the Royal British Legion, as part of its Return to Rationing? campaign, that the name &#147;council tax benefit&#148; is an obstacle to claiming. In recent weeks, the department has liaised with the Royal British Legion over what can be done in the short term in partnership with local authorities to help them re-market council tax benefit as part of their work to promote benefit take-up.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000040"></a>I am sure that noble Lords will appreciate that changing the name of a benefit is not necessarily straightforward and has wider ramifications for local authorities. For example, changes will need to be made to IT systems and forms. There are a number of resource issues to consider, and careful consideration will have to be given also to the wider implications for customers, as well as local authorities, government departments and other agencies all directly involved in some way in the delivery of this important benefit.</p>

She will be my voice. This is a pilot and we will see how it goes.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000048"></a>I begin by declaring two interests. First, I have the privilege of being the chair of the right to control working group, so all these amendments on the right to control are very close to my heart. I have been working very happily for 18 months with the Department for Work and Pensions on the design and the architecture of this new and very exciting principle. Much of it, I am delighted to say, has found itself being put into the Bill, although there are a few tweaks still to be made. I also declare that I am a long-term user of social care services and direct payments in the UK.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000049"></a>The purpose of the amendment is very simple. It is to remove the exclusion of community care services from Clause 31. Ministers have been very clear that the right-to-control trailblazers are intended to ensure that different funding streams can effectively be aligned and integrated. This is to ensure an end to fragmentation and the successful operation of individual budgets. At last, our lives are going to be won. Therefore, I am  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC104"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC104</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>naturally disappointed that health and social care funding was actively excluded from the legal framework for a right to control in the Bill. None of the explanations or assurances that I have heard to date has served to allay my concerns, and thus I feel that I have no option but to raise this issue in Committee.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000050"></a>First, perhaps I may explain why it is vital that community care funding is included in the right to control framework, and transparently so. Noble Lords will know that today disabled people face a very fragmented system that demands that we negotiate as many as six different funding agencies, with their different criteria, to secure a basic support package to enable us just to get up in the morning and live our daily lives. That is a job in itself before you begin your life. The whole point of a right to control is to put us in charge of all the resources to which we are entitled. Therefore, the Bill rightly includes&#151;this I am very happy about&#151;a dazzling array of funding streams connected with further and higher education, training, securing and retaining employment, enabling independent living in the community and overcoming barriers to participation. We then exclude one of the most significant funding streams for those of us with what are referred to as high support needs&#151;that is, people just like me.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000051"></a>For those of us who are entitled to social care support, it is vital that the right to control provides the means for us to access those resources seamlessly and incorporate them in our individual budgets; otherwise we will be at a huge disadvantage. This should not be left to chance, good will or a &#147;we will all work together later on down the line&#148; attitude. If the right to control is to be effective in freeing disabled people from dependency and bureaucracy, it must be clear from the start that this fundamental, important public support service is included.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000052"></a>I understand that Ministers have suggested that they want to avoid duplicating existing social care legislation and that somehow this right to control would override all the good work within the Department of Health. That is baffling. Not only do I know the Department of Health funding streams backwards, I know that there is no social care legislation that talks about the right to control which does not have this exciting architecture that we have been developing. Nor does the legislation require local authorities to ensure that social care funding is pooled in an individual budget. If Ministers and noble Lords consider that direct payments regulations suffice, then they really must think again. Direct payments regulations do not provide the legislative basis for self-directed support or individual budgets in the way that a right to control will do in future. Local authorities who have implemented something akin to the right to control in social care have been unable to use those regulations. Instead, they have had to rely on powers of well-being in other legislation, which I have found not fit for purpose.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000053"></a>Ministers have also suggested that there are powers in other legislation requiring local authorities to co-operate with the right to control system, but we have been given no details. What disabled people see when they look at this Bill is a gigantic hole at its heart, which makes nonsense of assurances of alignment and raises fears of continued fragmentation. To rebuild trust in  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC105"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>politics, legislation must say what it means. Social care is either included in the right to control or it is not. The White Paper and Ministers say one thing and the Bill says another, which is not an acceptable state of affairs. After all, we are looking for better legislation and regulation.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000054"></a>It is not just me who is uppity about this. Along with RADAR and fellow members of the Disability Benefits Consortium, I have sought the view of one of our leading community care lawyers, Luke Clements. He advises that the exclusions are totally unnecessary and that there is good cause to seek to remove them. I have spoken to Department of Health lawyers who have said something else. Put 10 lawyers in the room and you will probably get 10 different answers.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000055"></a>David Stocks, a user of mental health services, was recently speaking alongside me at the launch of the current right to control consultation. It was a hot potato that was being discussed. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09070277000334"></a>&#147;What disabled people want from this policy&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09070277000317"></a>the new legislation&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09070277000318"></a>For goodness&#146; sake, we should look at this together and seize this moment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000056"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09070277000410"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> I am very glad to be able to support the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, in this amendment, and finally to reach a part of the Bill of which we thoroughly approve. However, that is not to say that everything in the garden is quite as rosy as it might be. Perhaps my first quotation should be from RADAR&#146;s chief executive, Liz Sayce, during the first evidence-taking session in another place. Regarding the general principle of this part of the Bill, she said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09070277000335"></a>&#147;I ... think that the right to control is absolutely transformative, and disabled people around the country really welcome it.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000319"></a>However, she went on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09070277000336"></a>&#147;The whole point of the right to control, as set out in the White Paper, was that it promised to give disabled people the power to take a range of funding streams, and people want to be able to access that range of funding streams and pool resources to achieve what they want in their lives. If the funding streams remain separate, there is a risk that part of the White Paper&#146;s goal will not be achieved&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000057"></a>Her concern was echoed by Paul Davies, service director of adult social care in Oldham, who said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09070277000337"></a>&#147;Our experience in Oldham ... is that division in funding streams is a sovereign recipe for ensuring that people who use services, or try to negotiate their way through them, do not manage to make any progress&#148;.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000058"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, said, retaining the explicit exclusions of community care services is likely to cause confusion and is the exact opposite of joined-up government. We support the amendment to exclude the exclusions.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000059"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09070277000411"></a>The Countess of Mar:</b> The Equality and Human Rights Commission has written to me asking me to support these amendments, which I wholeheartedly do.

<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC106"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC106</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>move towards implementing that initiative. We would please the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester, as well as the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, by accepting her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000060"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09070277000412"></a>Baroness Wilkins:</b> Speaking for myself, I strongly support this amendment. It removes the exclusion of community care services and funding from the ambit of right to control. It makes no sense for a scheme that is all about ending fragmentation and introducing a seamless approach to support planning to explicitly exclude such a key funding stream. The Minister will doubtless state that the intention is for social care funding to be included in individual budgets under the trailblazers. However, the Bill provides no mechanism to insist on adult social care co-operation.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000061"></a>Given the length of time that it is taking to roll out the personalisation and the relatively few adult social care authorities which have individualised budgets, I do not think that we can be confident that alignment, let along integration, will necessarily take place. Remember that we are talking about individualised budgets and new ways of working, not simply direct payment. I would urge the Minister to undertake to work with the Department of Health to reconsider the exclusion of community care from the Bill. The message that exclusion sends out is that we are not being joined-up. I do not believe that that is a very helpful message to send out at all.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000062"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09070277000413"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> The noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, started with what I can only describe as a devastating critique of joined-up government in the area of services for disabled people, and of course she is absolutely right. The Bill holds out absolutely no help to us at all. In England, there is to be excluded: community care services, Carers and Disabled Children Act services and services under the Children Act. In Scotland, there is to be excluded: community care services and services provided under Section 22(1) of the Children (Scotland) Act. That does not smack of what the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, said was better legislation. If anything, it is a step backwards, and that is not what one wants.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000063"></a>So I, too, add my support to the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment, which leaves out the exclusion of community care services from the services that a disabled person will have the right to control; broadly speaking, the provision of carers, or accommodation, or support which is currently mainly provided by local authorities&#151;or so we are told. But it ain&#146;t so, is it? I have the figures with me, but I am sure that other Members of the Committee will know that even though personalised budgets have been available for several years in the social services field, the take-up has been deplorable. It has been miniscule&#151;I believe less than 1 per cent. However, I shall not go on about that.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000064"></a>This exclusion of services provided by local authorities seems rather short-sighted. Social care will be one of the significant areas, important in enabling the disabled person to achieve almost any of those matters. The services that most disabled people will draw on to  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC107"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC107</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>some extent at least will not be subject to direct control and, as a result, any claims by the Government that they are delivering a fully flexible and modern system sounds distinctly hollow. It is a great shame, as the Government had looked&#151;as has been pointed out&#151;as though they might have been prepared to do something brave and far-reaching, which could not only transform the lives of those who would now be in control of directing their own care but engender a new way of looking at how welfare in the widest sense is dispersed.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000065"></a>Let us look at some of the history of these proposals. It looked as if the Government would be persuaded by the arguments put to them. The Green Paper, <I>No one Written Of</I><I>f: </I><I>Reforming Welfare to Reward R</I><I>esponsibility</I>, which contained proposals to reform the welfare system, was published for consultation in July 2008. It also proposed to explore rolling out individual budgets for disabled people, should earlier pilots prove successful. Chapter 5 of the Green Paper, &#147;Delivering choice and control for disabled people&#148;, posed the following question for consultation in respect of individual budgets, which included the statement:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09070277000338"></a>&#147;We are interested in exploring how disabled people might receive a reliable and equitable service when requesting choice and control of the funds used to meet their needs, and whether public authorities could be expected not to unreasonably refuse such a request&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000320"></a>A selection of the responses to the consultation paper was set out in appendix A of the subsequent White Paper, <I>Raising Expectations and Increasing Support: Reforming Welfare for the Future</I>. It revealed that the majority of respondents, including the Scottish Government and many of the stakeholders and charities which have been briefing noble Lords, were supportive of giving disabled people greater choice and control over services. The responses were overwhelmingly in favour of direct control. However, I fear that having raised the expectations of disabled people the Government are prepared to dash them with what I can only describe as the timidity of Clause 31.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000066"></a>I have in common with other noble Lords concerns over the scope of the right to control as it is envisaged by the Government and which funding streams will be included in that right. Amendment 162, which is equivalent to an amendment tabled in another place by my honourable friend Mark Harper, includes community care budgets and social care service payments within the scope of DWP direct payments. In his response to our amendment, I should be interested to hear from the Minister why certain funding streams have been excluded. As well as diluting control for disabled people, the continuance of separate funding streams creates unnecessary complication and bureaucracy for a system intended to be user-focused. By adopting our approach, we would combine funding streams that would enable people with a disability to purchase&#151;that dreaded word&#151;holistic services, and support, and ensure consistency of approach. In addition, I fear that the confusion caused by multiple funding streams will have a detrimental effect on take-up and may even impact on the quality of services. In persisting in keeping community care services separate, the Government appear to be more concerned with promoting departmental points of view, allowing different  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC108"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>departments to hang on jealously to their pots of money instead of combining for a common purpose, rather than that of a disabled person. We should have one common framework for assessing all services&#151;and, potentially, we should put together all the funding streams and resources so that they can be directed in a way that suits requirements.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000067"></a>I urge the Minister to bear in mind a point made in the other place&#151;that we have the luxury of testing this with a pilot scheme before rolling the scheme out nationally. If he acceded to the amendment, he would be pleasantly surprised by the outcome of those pilots. I most strongly support the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000068"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09070277000414"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I start by thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, for moving this amendment, her strong leadership on this issue and her engagement with government. It is truly valued even if, on occasions, we will not see eye to eye. In that vein, I shall start off with a note of disagreement. The proposition that having 10 lawyers in a room provides 10 different answers is outwith my experience; it is usually 20.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000069"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09070277000415"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> What about accountants?</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000071"></a>In 2005, the Government made public their commitment to work towards equality for disabled people by 2025, and I say to the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, who was castigating the Government for not being joined up on issues, that over the past 12 years this Government have done a lot to support and enfranchise disabled people. I draw his attention to the independent living strategy published recently that looks at issues across government.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000072"></a>I note that the amendment has support across the Committee from the noble Baronesses, Lady Thomas and Lady Wilkins, the noble Countess, Lady Mar, and the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000073"></a>Since 2005, we have come a long way, continuing to build on commitments to create a system that allows disabled people to have maximum choice and control over the support services that they receive. The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment would bring community care services for disabled people within the scope of the right to control provisions in this Bill. Community care policy is already consistent with the aims of the Bill. Existing legislation already provides for direct payments in respect of community care services and the power to direct local authorities about the delivery of those services. There is also legislation in respect of certain services for children. The ministerial concordat, <I>Putting People First</I>, which I will cover shortly, binds together all the key players. To answer the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, directly, the exclusion of community care in the Bill is to ensure that we do not duplicate, or cause confusion with, existing powers.</p>

It sets out the shared aims and values that will guide the transformation of adult social care, and recognises that the sector will work across agendas with users and carers to transform people&#146;s experience of local support and services.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000075"></a>We have created the cross-government independent living strategy, which I referred to a moment ago. It is a five-year plan that aims to make sure that disabled people have the same choice, freedom, dignity and control over their lives as non-disabled people. We also piloted individual budgets in 13 local authorities between 2005 and 2007. Across government, the shared ambition is to put people first through a radical reform of public services, enabling people to live their own lives as they wish, confident that services are of high quality, safe and promote their individual needs for independence, well-being and dignity. The right to control is an important and welcome step forward in our journey towards increased choice and control, helping us to achieve full equality for disabled people by 2025.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000076"></a>We all recognise the importance to disabled people of giving them the choice and control they want over their lives. We need to make sure that this new right to control is implemented in a way that delivers real choice and control for disabled people. We are confident that we can achieve this by using relevant powers in community care legislation alongside the powers contained in this Bill.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000077"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, has said that the right to control will be transformative. Disabled people around the country really welcome it. It builds on the important work of the 2005 report <I>Improving the </I><I>Life Chances of Disabled People</I> and the 2008 independent living strategy. It also builds on the success of direct payments.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000078"></a>I welcome these views, which fully reflect our intentions. We want to build on best practice from direct payments, offering greater choice and control by extending direct payments and self-directed support to other services.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000079"></a>Creating a more joined-up system, which places fewer administrative burdens on disabled adults, is one of the areas we want to investigate as we trailblaze the right to control. I can confirm that we will be evaluating in the trailblazers how the services under the right to control fit with community care services in order to ensure a seamless service of self-directed support. I believe that we have a common cause on that issue.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000080"></a>We are working closely with colleagues in other government departments to ensure that our policy objectives are consistent, and to explore ways in which we can work collectively for the benefit of disabled people. The right to control, and the current changes to the delivery of adult social care, will together enable the implementation of the Government&#146;s commitment to empower disabled people, and ensure that choice and control are recognised as a right.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000081"></a>To pick up on one point that the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, raised about the legal structure around community care, I am sure that she is aware that the Law Commission is currently undertaking a project to review adult social care law in England and Wales with a view to producing a report in May 2011. The overall aim of the project is to provide a clearer and

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000082"></a>It would not seem right to make further piecemeal reform of adult social care law until the Law Commission has completed its work. We will review its findings and determine whether it impacts on the right to control after the report has been produced. That does not stop us in the trailblazers making sure we use the powers that are there to be joined up, and to test and develop what the right to control would mean, including for community care services. There is no intent that these should somehow be outwith this approach. We are really talking about how the intent should be framed in legislation, and I hope that the noble Baroness will accept that.</p>

First, he spoke of putting people first, and in this case disabled people. Nobody could take exception to that. Secondly, the Government want to avoid confusion by the duplication of existing powers. We are complaining that existing powers are not in one place or piece of legislation. It is not beyond the wit of the draftsman to import the powers already enacted in the various Acts that I read out earlier and to put them into the Bill. I cannot see that this would be in any way out of the scope of the Bill. I suppose that it is just possible that&#151;I am stretching my imagination a thundering long way&#151;the Law Commission will come up with that proposal.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000084"></a>The Minister said the Law Commission had started. Law Commission reviews, in my experience, take any length of time, starting with a minimum of five years. Can the Minister tell us how far through its operation the Law Commission is?</p>

<p><a name="09070277000086"></a>As regards the noble Lord&#146;s earlier points, we are trying to say that there is a system out there at the moment. We would cause confusion if we overrode that system and had another legislative approach included in the Bill while the Law Commission is looking at the framework of adult social care law. Therefore, what is the difficulty? We are saying that we need to work with the current system, which covers and enables a right to control in certain fields, through our trailblazers and to evaluate those various legislative streams but to achieve that common purpose. I do not see the noble Lord&#146;s difficulty.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000088"></a>To wait until 2011 for a right to control seems a long time. Luke Clements has told me that a right to control would benefit the Law Commission, including community and social care and healthcare services, as the commission reports and reviews, because it could then come under the same architecture. For that to come along later would simply be confusing. The Law Commission would benefit from aligned legislation under the right to control.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000089"></a>The intention to help bring the right to control up to the level of community care services intrigues me, because I do not see that the Government are well ahead of the game. When noble Lords hear my next amendment, they will understand why it is very important that we bring social care in line with this extremely new and exciting architecture. However, it will be neither new nor exciting if we do not align. I shall therefore probably come back to the amendment on Report, but, for now, I beg leave to withdraw it.</p>

Section 11 of that Bill enables the Secretary of State to make arrangements with third parties, including voluntary organisations, to give assistance to people in connection with direct payments. As a result of lobbying by my noble friend Lady Barker, the provision was strengthened by a government amendment to make it more explicit in the Bill that the NHS should make arrangements to ensure that patients or  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC112"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people receiving direct payments on somebody else&#146;s behalf were able to access advice, information and other support.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000093"></a>It seems strange to many of us that the right to control in this Bill makes no such provision. It is widely accepted that many direct payment users rely on support services, whether for initial information, advice, guidance, and training on becoming an employer and managing payroll and insurance, or for ongoing support in managing their money and paying staff. It is hard to imagine people who hitherto have been denied choice and control and are anxious about what direct payments involve taking the huge step to managing their own budget without access to this kind of support.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000094"></a>The Government have acknowledged the vital role that user-led organisations providing direct payments support services play in increasing the take-up of direct payments and improving direct payments users&#146; experiences and outcomes, and they want every locality to benefit from one. In the 2005 <I>Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People</I> report from the Prime Minister&#146;s Strategy Unit, a pledge was made that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09070277000340"></a>&#147;By 2010, each locality (defined as that area covered by a Council with social services responsibilities) should have a user-led organisation modelled on existing CILs&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09070277000321"></a>centres for independent living.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000095"></a>While I am on that point, will the Minister take the opportunity to update the Grand Committee on progress towards that 2010 commitment, which would underpin the effective delivery of the right to control? The life chances report is effectively government policy but, despite an ongoing programme by the Department of Health involving development funding and capacity building, no one can say if or when this target might be achieved. Furthermore, which local authority areas have such provision and what proportion of direct payments users have access to them? Therefore, can the Minister assure us that anyone accessing direct payments under these provisions, whether as part of the pilots or subsequently, following national rollout, will have access to a support service at no extra cost? I ask simply because the Bill is silent on this matter.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000096"></a>We understand that various aspects of delivering the right to control are currently being consulted on, and it is likely that other forms of advice and support will be required. However, direct payments support services specifically seem to be a fundamental prerequisite of a successful trailblazer programme and of future rollout. Will the Minister say whether part of the &#163;5 million allocated to the eight trailblazers will be invested in ensuring the availability of direct payments support services? Can he also tell us about the progress of the network of sustainable centres for independent living, be they standalone organisations or creative partnerships? Are the social care transformation grants for local authorities being deployed in capacity building of user-led organisations? If the right to control is rolled out nationally from 2013 following successful trailblazers, surely the infrastructure for support services should already be in place by that time.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000097"></a>When a similar amendment was debated in the other place, similar questions were asked but no clear response was given. The Minister said that the amendment was &#147;too prescriptive&#148; as people may prefer to draw  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC113"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on the support of family and friends, but this amendment is enabling; it prescribes nothing. Those who have family resources will doubtless draw on them, but what of those who have no such resources? There are many disabled people in that position and they need the assurance provided by this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000098"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09070277000424"></a>Baroness Wilkins:</b> I support the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, in this amendment. I absolutely agree with her that direct payments support services need to be in place to ensure the effective implementation of right to control. I declare an interest as vice-chair of Hammersmith and Fulham Action on Disability, which provides such services. HAFAD&#146;s experience is that support services take the mystery out of direct payments for disabled people. Imagine someone who has never enjoyed real choice and control in their lives&#151;someone who has been tied up in knots and disempowered by the system. How is he to feel confident in taking on budget management and the role of employer without peer support and guidance?</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000099"></a>We should not underestimate the damage to people&#146;s confidence wreaked by the disabling systems we subject them to. Unless this is taken on board, we will unnecessarily restrict disabled people&#146;s options to take control. Department of Health direct payments guidance states that the provision of a support service is key to the successful implementation of direct payments and that,</p>
<ul><a name="09070277000363"></a>&#147;support provided through voluntary/recipient-run organisations has been shown to be particularly effective and valued by recipients&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000100"></a>Moreover, there is a clear correlation between direct payment support services controlled and run by disabled people and successful implementation of direct payments. Seven out of 10 of the top-performing local authorities on direct payments contract a user-led support service to ensure effective implementation of direct payments for healthcare. Specific provision for support services has been included in the Health Bill. Surely, it would be strange if Ministers were to resist calls for similar provision in Part 2.</p>

It helps disabled children and disabled adults with learning difficulties. Since it was the holidays, children were going to the centre as well as the adults. They were trying to encourage the adults to come out with them in a bus to the local cinema. The problem was that they could not take the disabled adults with learning disabilities&#151;some with complex health needs, but perfectly competent in all sorts of ways&#151;because in the case of

This was the very group for whom many noble Lords, myself included, pressed in the 1990s, as well as after 1997, to ensure direct payments would happen.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000103"></a>I asked the manager of the very good charity what he was able to do about this. He said that he thought the charity should be providing all the care and then the people would be able to go to the cinema. I asked him, &#147;Why row when you can steer? What about encouraging younger people and those who wish to, to go on to direct payments?&#148; He said, &#147;They won&#146;t be able to manage it&#148;. I said, &#147;This is a city of financial services. There are a couple of thousand people employed in all the major financial companies, and there is a hunger to offer services for voluntary work. Why don&#146;t you organise a help list of volunteers who have financial and management skills and want to do two or four hours a fortnight, put them in contact with some of your clients and see whether together they can run a direct payment service so that at the next half-term they can go to the cinema?&#148; He said, &#147;Oh well, I don&#146;t know about that&#148;.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000104"></a>This is part of a city that is not central London, not one of the big metropolises and, to some extent, at the end of the railway line, so it is trying to work within the confines of its own experience. It seemed such an obvious way to go. The centre, which is a very good voluntary organisation, could match volunteers and needs to expand choice and put the disabled person at the centre of the care service and not at the edges of it; in other words, as the organiser of it and not the recipient. That probably cannot happen, particularly for somebody with mild learning difficulties, without the support of voluntary organisations helping them to manage and employ.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000105"></a>We are not talking about expenditure. We are talking about simple, straightforward ways of encouraging the players in local authorities and the voluntary sector to see themselves as facilitators of bringing together people who are offering voluntary time to those who may be glad of that service so that they can take greater control of their own lives. If my noble friend can take this forward even more successfully than it has been taken so far&#151;many of us have been fighting for this cause for many years&#151;he will earn the gratitude of all of us.</p>

At that time I approached our local authority for assistance and somebody duly came to see me. After looking at everything, she said, &#147;Well, I know that we&#146;re supposed to give you some assistance, but it is within available resources, you know. The resources in this area are really rather limited. Lady Turner, we would be grateful if you could do everything you can for yourself&#148;.

As a co-founder of the National Centre for Independent Living&#151;for 10 years that organisation has developed to assist support schemes to develop, grow and thrive&#151;I can clearly tell Members of the Committee that, where there was a support scheme, there were disabled people emancipated, coming out of their back rooms, employing people, learning from others, getting lots of peer support, moving on, having families and getting jobs. Surely that is what this legislation is all about. When there is a support scheme, that will happen. There is nothing better than peer support to get people out of the back room and living when they have spent many decades dependent on the state. I absolutely support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000109"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09070277000429"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I second the view of the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell. Of course I agree that access to peer support and advice on managing direct payments plays a vital role in making a success of individual budgets. How could I not? How, indeed, could the Minister not? The question that he must answer is what other options are available for people to exercise greater control. That is the only way that he can defend what I suspect will be the Government&#146;s position.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000110"></a>Having ready access to information, or contact with groups who know how the system works would, it goes without saying, be useful for boosting confidence among potential users to take up direct budgets. People who have never been offered any level of control before may be anxious about what a direct payment may involve&#151;quite understandably, given that many of them are not in the best of health.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000111"></a>In passing, I remember shocking many noble Lords many years ago&#151;before most noble Lords in this Room were in the House&#151;by making a remark along the lines of, &#147;Of course, you have to be fit to be successfully disabled&#148;.

Having built up these tremendous expectations, the Government must find a way of satisfying them.</p>

We have had some interesting contributions and some real-life and challenging experiences. I note that the amendment has support right around the Committee, from the noble Lords, Lord Skelmersdale and Lord Northbourne, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Campbell and Lady Wilkins, to my noble friends Lady Turner and Lady Hollis. I think that everyone who has spoken&#151;nearly everyone who is here&#151;has supported it.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000115"></a>This amendment would enable the Government to regulate for the provision of assistance with direct payments by voluntary organisations. I acknowledge the point&#151;which is implicit in the amendment and has been spoken to powerfully by a number of noble Lords&#151;that the availability of advice and brokerage services will be very important to the success of the trailblazers.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000116"></a>Before turning to the amendment text itself, I would like to acknowledge that the voluntary sector can and does play a key role in delivering personalisation and achieving independent living for disabled people. The 2005 report <I>Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People</I> stressed the need to improve the availability of advice and advocacy services for disabled people. That report put a particular emphasis on the role of organisations that are led and controlled by disabled people. It set out a commitment that by 2010 there should be a user-led organisation&#151;ULO&#151;in every locality in England.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000117"></a>We have brought in several measures to help us work towards this target. The Department of Health has invested &#163;1.65 million in a ULO development fund. The Office for Disability Issues has recently committed a further &#163;700,000 to provide additional support to developing ULOs. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, asked me directly about progress towards our target on that. As well as the funding that I have just mentioned, we believe that for 2009-10, the current year, a key priority is to develop the capacity and capability of existing ULOs to support the development of ULOs where none currently exists. Deputy regional directors for social care and partnerships&#151;DRDs&#151;in the nine regions will be taking forward the lessons learnt from the action and learning sites and developing plans towards meeting recommendations in their own regions. We have commissioned further mapping to identify further progress and it will be used to inform the regional development work. We will work with the DRDs to measure the progress towards the objective of a ULO in every activity. In short, we are not there yet but there is progress.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000118"></a>Voluntary organisations are not the sole providers of support and the trailblazers will explore a range of options. For example, as the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, acknowledged, the Department of Health-led individual budgets pilots found that many people chose to involve their family and friends in deciding how to  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC117"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC117</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>spend their budget. The trailblazer design should preserve flexibility to explore other options that people put forward. Our commitment to a co-production approach has been broadly welcomed, and I intend to preserve the framework that will deliver on that commitment.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000119"></a>Therefore, while I support the spirit of this amendment, I cannot accept it. The amendment focuses specifically on the voluntary sector and on assistance in connection with direct payments. This captures only a small part of the types of assistance disabled people might require and the ways in which they might choose to receive assistance. Although the amendment is not prescriptive in the noble Baroness&#146;s terms and would not prevent the Government making regulations relating to other types of assistance, it could suggest that other sources of support would not have the same emphasis.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000120"></a>I do not think that the voluntary sector should carry the burden of being the sole support provider, and we should avoid suggesting that that is the case. Neither do I see the right to control as simply a system of direct payments; the Government want to see support being made widely available in the context of the right to control, not being confined to assistance with making direct payments. I have set out some of the existing arrangements for support, which we shall explore in the trailblazers, when we can look at other options. The Bill gives us sufficient power to return to this in regulations, if necessary, so we do not need it set in the Bill. However, at this time I do not want to signal any intention to constrain our valuable co-productive approach. Accordingly, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Some very graphic phrases were used, such as when the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, said that support services would take the mystery out of direct payments. That is a very good one, and very important.

<p><a name="09070277000122"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, gave us a most graphic example. On this business of people who need assistance going to bed, their carers can sometimes turn up appallingly early. She gave a very good example of how a lot of people coming together in a city can help each other. It sounded very interesting. The experience of the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, also had great resonance, as that is exactly what happens in a lot of cases.</p>

By the time we get to Report, I shall probably have T-shirts for noble Lords with &#147;The Real Right to Control&#148; on them.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000128"></a>This amendment is about getting the principle absolutely right for this transformative initiative. It we want transformation, we can have it, but unfortunately we cannot have it with the way in which the Bill is currently written.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000129"></a>The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that Clauses 33 and 34 accurately reflect the policy intent of the right to control, as set out in the White Paper <I>Raising Expectations and Increasing Support: Reforming Welfare for the Future</I>. I have it here and I read it every night&#151;I know those principles. The White Paper heralded a radical transformation of the welfare state. No longer would public authorities serve up a one-size-fits-all service; no longer would disabled people be cast in the role of passive recipients. Instead, disabled people would be empowered to take real control of the public service support to which they are entitled. This is after decades of being passive, so it is very important.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000130"></a>However, I am afraid that the transformative approach promised in the White Paper is being lost in translation. Clause 33 states that public authorities will carry out an assessment of the disabled person&#146;s needs, but does not recognise, as the White Paper puts it, that disabled people are the experts in their own lives. It then states that the authorities will prepare, in consultation with the disabled person, a plan setting out the way in which the authority proposes to meet those needs. This merely replicates current professional and service-led relationships and does not reflect the White Paper&#146;s intention that disabled people should be recognised as experts in how best to meet their needs and achieve agreed outcomes and that there should be a more equal partnership at work. Indeed, the White Paper gives an example of support planning that clearly puts the disabled person in the driving seat, working constructively with the public authority, yet the Bill does not deliver that vision accurately.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000131"></a>Further, Clauses 33 and 34 suggest that a disabled person will need to make a specific request to trigger notification of their resource allocation and another request for a direct payment. Placing the onus on disabled people to know that they have a right to request these things simply will not do. We know from experience of community care legislation that giving disabled people the right to request really works only for highly articulate, well informed and determined individuals&#151;basically, bloody-minded people like me&#151;who get the services. However, it simply does not deliver to the majority who desperately need and want them. Therefore, there must be a clear and specific duty on the authorities to inform people of their right to control; otherwise, authorities that are less robust than we would like them to be can all too easily avoid relinquishing power to disabled people. They simply forget to tell them about it. It is wrong to assume that if people do not ask for more choice and control, they do not want it. Moreover, we must not impose yet more red tape and burdens on disabled people to request this, that and the other. That would defeat the whole purpose of the policy.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC120"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000132"></a>The final problem with this part of the Bill is that it contains no mechanism to give a disabled person the right to control other than in the form of a direct payment. Many disabled people do not want cash to buy their support. Indeed, we have just had a conversation on how difficult that whole administration bit is&#151;employing people and so on&#151;but we want a service that reflects what we need to do in our lives. Why can services not get us up at eight for work and put us to bed at 11 when we drag home from the pub? Instead, disabled people want the public agency to arrange for services to meet their needs. That is not beyond the whit of services. In these circumstances, it must still be possible to have choice and control over how needs are met. It must be a fundamental principle of a real right to control that you are not required to take responsibility for managing the money to enjoy choice and control over the services you receive. Disabled people who opt for services must be assured that those services will be arranged and delivered in line with their wishes and aspirations, so that they can access work so that they can take control of their families again.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000133"></a>These amendments reinstate the key principles outlined in the White Paper and therefore fully reflect the Government&#146;s intent. I see three major principles of intent in my amendments. First, they give disabled people the clear and automatic right to be told the level of resources they are entitled to: their budget; secondly, they give the right to be equal partners in the process of assessment and support planning; and, thirdly, they give the right to have real control over how resources are used, regardless of whether the disabled person opt for a direct payment, direct service or a mixture of both.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000134"></a>I understand that the Government have concern over certain aspects of similar amendments debated in Committee in the other place. I have aimed to address these concerns in my amendments by, for example, ensuring that there remains scope for regulations to specify exceptional cases where a disabled person may not have an unfettered right to a direct payment. In addition, I have provided for future regulations to set out how a disabled person may appeal to an independent authority against a decision not to comply with his wish for a direct payment.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000135"></a>My amendments aim to deliver the clarity we need to make this policy a success and enable disabled people to be active citizens not, as services would have them now, burdens of the state or just a bit better. The Bill does not deliver this policy. I have spent a great of time working with DWP officials in an attempt to explain these changes, and I should like to thank them for their openness and willingness to find a way through. Today, I am hoping to receive a constructive and favourable response and that the Minister will undertake to bring back government amendments on Report. I believe that we are finding a way through this one, so I am eager to hear what he has to say. I beg to move.</p>

It still looks as though they are having decisions made for them, albeit after consultation. If anyone exemplifies someone who is in charge of her own life, it is the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell. I urge the Government to listen to what she says in this area as she is the expert.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000137"></a>Gone are the days when many disabled people were content to sit back and let other people run their lives. The changes proposed in the amendment are crucial to reflect the changed climate in which these provisions are being brought forward. We support the amendments most strongly.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000138"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09070277000440"></a>Baroness Wilkins:</b> I strongly support the amendments, which seek to ensure that the radical policy of a right to control, contained in the White Paper, finds more accurate expression in the Bill. I strongly agree with the arguments put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell. Clauses 33 and 34 provide the basis on which the right to control would be implemented across Britain post the trailblazers. The White Paper states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09070277000364"></a>&#147;legislation will provide clarity for both public authorities and disabled people and&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09070277000322"></a>in the event of a wider rollout&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09070277000365"></a>&#147;would help ensure a universal and consistent application of the right to control principles&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070277000323"></a>As currently drafted, the Bill does not achieve this aim. The terminology is rooted in the old ways of care planning and a culture in which professionals always know best, rather than heralding the shift in power from the state towards disabled people which this policy is supposed to be all about.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000139"></a>Under the current model of public service support, disabled people have to fight for everything they get and are subject to a vast amount of costly and stressful red tape. If you do not know your rights, public authorities are not quick to fill you in. Many have missed out on direct payments, disabled facilities grants and the like because the system favours the well-informed, the articulate and the belligerent.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000142"></a>I know that much of the detail relating to implementation is being consulted on now, but I urge Ministers to review and revise Clauses 33 and 34 so that they provide a more solid basis for transforming public service support.</p>

The Minister will not be surprised to find these amendments, because he will have seen them debated before in an unmodified form in another place. The noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, has very sensibly taken the Commons Minister&#146;s responses to that debate and incorporated them in her amendment, which I am very pleased to support.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC122"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000144"></a>The drafting of Clauses 31 and 32 more closely resembles the right to request direct payments and does not provide for self-directed support. Clause 33(2)(a) states that the relevant authority will carry out an assessment of the disabled person&#146;s need, which suggests that it will follow the old model, where professionals dictate to disabled people rather than the self-directed support model, which involves a supported self-assessment, empowering the disabled person to say what their own needs are. The White Paper said that the intention of the legal right to control is to reflect the fact that a disabled individual is the expert in his or her life. That simply must be the case.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000145"></a>The Government will have to make clear their intentions. It is not enough, and will certainly not fob off noble Lords in this Committee&#151;still less those people outside who are waiting for government promises to be delivered&#151;for the Government to continue spouting rhetoric about guaranteeing individual choice and trusting people to judge what is in their own best interests and act accordingly, and other fine intentions, while waiting, for example, for a Law Commission report, which may or may not turn up in 2011, and while pushing forward legislation that falls far short of those ideals in practice.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000146"></a>The amendment is barely a paper&#146;s thickness from the stated positions on direct control of all parties. I hope that the Minister will look again at the provisions that we are debating and conclude that the Bill does not quite deliver what the Government suggested that it would. What we thought we would see following the White Paper, and what I and, I think, other noble Lords would like to see now that the reality of the Bill is presented to us, is for it to be quite clear that the disabled person is placed right in the centre of the arrangements affecting his or her life, and that the state will fall in with that rather than vice versa. I suppose that the amendment is asking for the Government to square a rather difficult circle. It is only the Government who can achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000149"></a>Amendments 164 and 165 would substantially restructure the section in Clause 33 dealing with the core regulation-making powers. The amended version of the text sets out a more prescriptive structure to the right to control process, which more explicitly mirrors the self-directed support process, as identified by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. As well as making further consequential changes, Amendment 166 would

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000150"></a>The Government have worked closely with disabled people in developing the proposals for the right to control. We want it to work and do not want to be caught in the trap, as the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, said, of the professionals always knowing best and people missing out because they are not as thrusting or able to make their way through systems as others might do. I welcome the innovative approaches that we are developing to co-produce proposals. The amendment illustrates that bringing the voice of disabled people into the heart of government and co-producing policy in no way impacts on the important independence of the views of disabled people</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000151"></a>The Government are fully committed to the right to control, as set out in the welfare reform White Paper. I accept that the powers in the Bill are broad, but that is to ensure delivery of our White Paper commitments and to encourage local-level innovation. It will enable us to draw on best practice experience from the right-to-control trailblazers in designing any strategy for wider rollout. As I said on the previous amendment, on Thursday 11 June the Government launched a national consultation on the right to control, which will help shape the regulations made under this section of the Bill and help to ensure that the trailblazers fully deliver on our commitments.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000152"></a>Starting with Amendment 166, I agree that there should be an effective way for an individual to challenge decisions taken by relevant authorities. We have always made it clear that the right to control places disabled people at the centre of the services they receive, and the ability to challenge decision-makers is one element of this process. That is why we have included Clause 33(3)(e). It enables the Secretary of State to require an authority to review any decision that it takes, not only in relation to direct payments, but more generally for the right to control. As noble Lords will be aware, any decision made by a public authority can also be subject to judicial review. That will include decisions made in relation to the right to control.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000153"></a>However, the creation of an independent authority as an appeal mechanism for the right to control would require significant public funding. For many relevant services that could be included in the right to control, there will already be review and appeal processes in place. There is no current evidence to suggest the need to replace these mechanisms with an independent appeals authority. At this stage, when decisions are still to be taken regarding the funding streams that will be included, it would not be appropriate to specify in the Bill an independent authority as the appeals route. Once our consultation is completed, a decision will be made regarding which services will be included in the trailblazers. We will then work with the relevant authorities to ensure that appropriate review mechanisms are in place in line with Clause 33(3)(e). We will evaluate the effectiveness of the arrangements made for reviewing right to control decisions in the trailblazers. I hope that these commitments in particular will reassure all noble Lords on this point.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000154"></a>Turning to Amendments 164 and 165, I appreciate the concerns expressed by noble Lords, and I agree that it is vital that disabled people should find the right to control easy to access and use. The Government fully expect authorities to be proactive in informing people about the right to control and what it means to them. We already have powers to ensure that this happens, both by issuing guidance and, if necessary, by imposing duties on authorities through regulations.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000155"></a>The Government also recognise the importance of ensuring that the disabled person will be at the centre of the right to control process. It is entirely right, as this amendment emphasises, that a disabled person should be able to tailor the support that they receive and have a range of options about how it is delivered. This has always been our aim and this is what we intend to deliver through regulations.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000156"></a>The right to control is not just about direct payments. The intention is for disabled people to have choice, and control, over the resources that the state makes available to meet agreed outcomes, whether these resources are taken in the form of a direct payment or in the form of services arranged by the public authority. Where a disabled person chooses to continue to receive services, the Government will expect authorities to respond flexibly to the individual&#146;s needs and wishes where reasonable and practicable.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000157"></a>However, while I appreciate the principles behind this restructuring, I feel that it fails to capture some vital aspects of our White Paper commitments. For example, this amendment does not reflect our commitment that the outcomes to be achieved through an individual&#146;s support plan must be agreed in partnership between the authority and the individual. This approach was clearly signalled in the White Paper and is central to the right to control. Although the individual will have choice and control over support, we need to recognise that the resources available have been voted for by Parliament for an agreed purpose. This approach ensures that the authority will remain ultimately responsible for the statutory outcome and will be able to provide some further assistance if needed. This does not, however, reduce the individual disabled person&#146;s role in deciding the specific details of the support they want to receive.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000158"></a>It is also worth noting that any changes to the text of the Bill would need to meet our existing commitment to protecting public expenditure. That was referred to in more detail in another place. I am sure that noble Lords will accept that this is particularly important in the current economic climate.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000159"></a>Although I would not be able to support Amendments 164 and 165 in their current form for the reasons I have stated, I recognise the importance of ensuring that the legislation clearly reflects our policy commitments and am sure that we will have made progress in this respect when we return to the matter at a later stage. So, with the assurance that we will return to this matter again after discussion, certainly with the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</p>

It is very important that we get this one right, because, for me, it is the definition of what we are about to do here. I am very pleased to hear the Minister say that it is something that he and the department will wish to look at quite deeply over the coming months before we come back, because I will come back to this one, because I feel so strongly that the overarching principles which will dictate how we take this policy forward are very important. I understand that an independent mechanism for appeal may have cost implications. However, I would like to be really reassured that there will be a clear and accessible way to appeal decisions that are made unfavourably when the disabled person wishes to take up a direct payment or have more control but does not find that they are getting it. We will need to look at those procedures again to ensure that they are clear.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000163"></a>On Amendments 164 and 165, again, we cannot simply rely on regulations and duties to take forward this principle of the right to control. We know that local authorities can be quite lazy when it comes to their duty to implement regulations, duties and laws, and I want to ensure that in this Bill we have a clear indication of what a right to control is. Quite frankly, it will be difficult for some local authorities to get their heads around this because they have spent the past 100 years helping, doing good and caring for disabled people, and it is not easy to make that transformative step in their heads.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000167"></a>In a previous debate, we watched the Minister explain&#151;perhaps &#147;tussle with&#148; would be a better phrase&#151;the justification for excluding types of funding on the grounds that different moneys come from different departments. Regardless of where the money comes from, however, one thing is true: we are not dealing with new money. We have been debating who spends the money that is already swirling around government funds, and how. There is no suggestion that direct-control payments would increase costs to the relevant departments. That is not what noble Lords have been calling for. Indeed, it is not something that we could realistically expect to call for, as the Minister has just pointed out.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000168"></a>Therefore, when I read Clause 34(3), I thought of a question. Subsection (3) allows a local authority to refuse a request for direct payments if it would create an unreasonable burden on finances. I accept that there may be circumstances to warrant this, such as a request to finance a service that would never reasonably be provided by that particular authority. However, what is there in this provision to prevent a local authority refusing a reasonable request on the ground that it cannot be afforded, a point made just now by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner? I worry about a postcode lottery and that some local authorities, perhaps one that has mismanaged its finances, may use direct control as a fig leaf to cover its own failings by refusing reasonable requests on the inaccurate grounds that they cost too much.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000169"></a>Amendment 169, which changes the word &#147;subsection&#148; to &#147;section&#148;, does not do much by itself. I merely wanted to bring into our debates the pilot schemes for direct control. I do not wish to add much to the point that I made in the debate on the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, which is that the Government have the luxury of the pilot scheme to road test ideas. I urge the Minister to be bold, to uphold the raised expectations that the White Paper aroused, and to give real teeth to direct-control payments. I suggest that, were he to do so, he would be pleasantly surprised with the results, an outcome that would please almost everyone. For the Government, there is, in the words of President Roosevelt,</p>

I said in a debate on a previous amendment, referring to my own experience, that when I had sought assistance my local authority had informed me that the whole thing was &#147;within available resources&#148; and that it did not have available resources. It looks to me as though the last line of this clause says the same thing in a different way, talking about whether it would,</p>
<ul><a name="09070277000367"></a>&#147;impose an unreasonable financial burden on the providing authority&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070277000325"></a>Can the Minister explain whether this is the same as &#147;within available resources&#148; or, if not, precisely what it does mean?</p>

<p><a name="09070277000171"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09070277000453"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> Is the phrase &#147;in all the circumstances&#148; going to be spelt out in regulations?</p>

<p><a name="09070277000172"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09070277000454"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, for giving me the opportunity to explain why the Bill is drafted as it is on this issue. I will first respond to Amendment 169, which addresses the piloting powers contained in Clause 36. The amendment seeks to extend the 36-month time limit in subsection (1) to the whole clause. I reassure noble Lords that the 36-month time limit already applies to the whole of Clause 36.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000173"></a>I welcome the chance to discuss the piloting. We prefer to describe it as &#147;trailblazing&#148;, as we think this is an accurate description of what we are proposing. The right to control marks a significant innovation in the choice and control that disabled adults have over their support and services. For this reason, it is right to test it in a number of trailblazing public authorities to inform the decision about wider rollout. The trailblazer design will encourage disabled people, their organisations, and the agencies and authorities involved, to work together to develop innovative solutions to new challenges. This will give us the opportunity to explore how the right to control will work on the ground.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000174"></a>This clause gives flexibility over who is included in the pilot and what timescales are involved. The trailblazers will commence during 2010 and it is our intention that the results from their operation should be available during 2012-13, but we have powers to run them for up to 36 months. We may also want to run subsequent pilots along the same or similar lines. Such flexibility will make a real difference, as it will help us to collect the robust evidence needed to inform a decision on national rollout.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000175"></a>We are committed to consulting on how the trailblazers will operate. Consultation on the right to control was launched, as I said previously, on 11 June this year and will run until the end of September. It will explore questions such as what we need to do to ensure that disabled people and their organisations can play a full part in our trailblazers, what the implications are for services providers and how they can be assisted to play their part in promoting choice and control in the right to control trailblazers. Answering these questions will be an important test of how the right works in practice.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000176"></a>Amendment 167 would remove the obligation on the Secretary of State to make regulations which provide that an authority does not have to give a direct payment if that payment would prove an unreasonable  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC128"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>financial burden. In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, yes, it would have to be prescribed in regulations. It is our intention to introduce the right to control to ensure that disabled people have more choice and control over the services that they receive from the state. This legislation will enable us to meet that commitment.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000177"></a>However, there is a balance to be struck. We must ensure that the introduction of the right to control does not disadvantage those who are content with the services they receive and do not wish to change them. The right to control is currently untested. If, for example, large numbers of requests for direct payments threatened existing services provided by the local authority, it would be essential that those who chose to continue to use the service were not disadvantaged&#151;I say to my noble friend Lady Turner that that is the thrust of the point that we seek to cover here&#151;and that pressures on public authorities did not become unsustainable.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000178"></a>This clause therefore provides a safeguard for services and public finances. I reassure noble Lords that the clause is not to be used as a way of preventing disabled people exercising their right to control. Clause 34(3) has been deliberately drafted to ensure that we can clarify in secondary legislation and guidance when this provision can be used. We do not want to be prescriptive in primary legislation because we want to develop clear guidelines in collaboration with disabled people and public authorities.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000179"></a>The circumstances in which this clause would be used will be carefully considered during consultation. We would expect any public authorities to provide compelling reasons for refusing a direct payment on these grounds and we will issue guidance to make that clear. As I mentioned earlier, we are conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the trailblazers. This will include monitoring the use of this clause to ensure that it has the effect of guarding against unaffordable pressures while allowing effective delivery of services. I hope that the noble Lord will be reassured by the explanation of why that provision is in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000180"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09070277000455"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> The longer these debates go on, the more confused I am becoming. Clause 31(5) specifically excludes community care services as defined by the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990. So, by definition, we are talking about different services. However, the Minister keeps referring to local authority services. Can he please explain which services are covered by this Bill and which are not?</p>

We have debated why community care services are excluded. It is not that they should be excluded from being involved in the right to control arrangements; it is simply that the legislation is dealt with elsewhere. There has been a debate about whether that is the appropriate formulation that we should accept, but I do not think that anybody is saying that community care services are excluded from this new and innovative approach of giving the disabled the right to control the services that are available to them. The precise funding streams for the

That would clearly include local authority services.</p>

The Government have committed to include in trailblazers disability employment services and independent living funds. We are also exploring including housing support for disabled people and the disabled facilities grants arrangements. Those are some of the services that could be included.</p>

I suspect that Amendment 169 depends on the draftsman. I know many draftsmen who would have used the word &#147;section&#148; at the beginning and drafted the rest of the clause slightly differently. Looking carefully at the clause, I see that it all refers to subsection (1), so in another draftsman&#146;s mind, the word &#147;subsection&#148; would be perfectly appropriate.</p>

Since introducing the Bill my ministerial colleagues and officials have continued to work with the devolved Administrations.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000188"></a>Amendments 170 to 174 will ensure that Welsh Ministers will have the power to make secondary legislation to bring devolved funding streams and services within the scope of the right to control. The right to control could impact on a number of devolved areas given the breadth of the definition of &#147;relevant service&#148; in Clause 31. These could include further education, higher education, training and skills programmes, housing in relation to living independently and services that enable disabled people to overcome barriers to participation in society. It has always been our intention that the provisions in the Bill reflect the devolution settlement. These amendments are therefore technical to ensure that this intention is accurately reflected in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000189"></a>At present, the drafting of Clause 37 would mean that Welsh Ministers will have power to make regulations under Clause 33 only if the National Assembly for Wales has legislative competence in that policy area. The provision is inconsistent with the current devolution settlement in Wales. The National Assembly&#146;s legislative competence is being increased incrementally and it currently does not have competence to legislate in a number of areas where Welsh Ministers have executive competence. When both Ministers of the Crown and Welsh Ministers have functions in relation to a particular service, both will be in a position to make right-to-control regulations.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000190"></a>The amendments are therefore necessary to ensure that regulation-making powers are afforded to Welsh Ministers that relate to their executive competence and therefore reflect the devolution settlement. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000191"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0005.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09070277000463"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> All social security law applies across the whole of the United Kingdom, even though individual bits of legislation might be slightly different in the various parts thereof. I can only assume that an eagle-eyed official spotted that the Bill would be pretty ineffective in Wales if the changes were not made, so the noble Lords who want to see the reforms work in the Principality&#151;I firmly include myself in that number&#151;owe a vote of thanks. Can we be satisfied that Scotland is fully covered?</p>

<p><a name="09070277000192"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0005.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="09070277000464"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Yes. The amendment reflects the difference in the state of devolution between Scotland and Wales. Legislative competence is not complete in respect of the Assembly, but Welsh Ministers have executive competence. That has been picked up in the Amendments. The same situation does not pertain in Scotland.</p>

Part 3 is about improving the success rate in collecting child maintenance. This probing amendment is about success in collecting child maintenance in the context of the responsibilities of fathers. The Child Support Act 1991 is still seen by many men as profoundly unfair. Many men still believe that fathering a child is a macho achievement, a scalp, a notch on the belt that does not carry with it any obligation towards the child. Other fathers complain that the mother misled them about contraception. Some have other excuses that, to them, make the collection of child maintenance  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC132"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC132</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>seem unfair. There is a real need, in practical terms, in order to facilitate the collection of child maintenance, to try to change that mindset.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000194"></a>There is an urgent need to persuade all men that they share equally with the potential mother the responsibility for the outcomes of unprotected sex. They need to understand clearly that if the woman has a child, they will also be responsible for the financial maintenance of that child until it reaches the age of 16, and they need to understand why.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000195"></a>If one wants to change a mindset, it is now widely accepted that two things have to be done. First, one must convince the majority of the public that there are good reasons for the change and, secondly, one must follow up with a degree of legal enforcement. In the case of secondary smoking, this Government did a wonderful job using both these levers successfully to achieve their objective. However, the case of child maintenance is not quite the same. Not enough effort has been put into building public consensus about the responsibilities of the father. The first step in doing this must be to define as clearly as possible the responsibilities of the father and of the father and the mother if they bring a child into the world. The Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 lays on the commission set up by that Act a duty to take steps to raise awareness among parents of the importance of taking responsibility for the maintenance of their children. I know it is an unfair question to ask the Minister, so perhaps he could write to me about what has been done about that obligation.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000196"></a>My amendment, by implication, asks two questions: first, what does the current law say about the responsibilities of a man towards any child he fathers and how are those responsibilities shared with the mother? Secondly, and more specifically, if a father pays his maintenance regularly, what residual obligations, if any, does he have towards the child and what obligations in relation to the child remain with the mother? For example, who is responsible for the emotional, social and moral guidance of the child? Are these obligations set out clearly anywhere so that mothers and fathers can understand them? I think that question needs a good deal of research to answer, and I shall be happy if the Minister wants to write to me about it. However, it is important to have clear answers to these questions and agreed policies so that they can be taught in schools. They can be taught to young people in the family and in a variety of settings so that the responsibilities of men and boys in fathering children are more clearly understood and they no longer assume that it is the responsibility of the girl alone to ensure that she does not get pregnant. In a civilised society with the availability of effective contraception for all who want it, is there any reason why there should be unwanted children? I beg to move.</p>

It is hardly surprising, then, that I support the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, in his endeavour to make it crystal clear that it is the responsibility&#151;the duty, if you like&#151;of both parents to look after the needs of any children that they bear, whether in or out of wedlock.

Although that Act is 99 per cent directed at the financial security of the child, it covers situations where the non-resident parent has a child living with him from time to time.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000198"></a>The Salvation Army recently published a report entitled <I>The Seeds of Exclusion.</I> As yet, I have read only the executive summary. It has a couple of paragraphs headed &#147;Childhood experiences&#148;, which point out that negative experiences in childhood have a significant bearing on experiences in adulthood. I accept that it is possible that single parents will have an ameliorating effect on that, but how much better would it be if both parents were involved, even if one of them were on a part-time basis. However, the best advice that I have ever heard given to young people was by the late Reverend Lord Soper. At the end of an &#147;any questions&#148; session in a school, the members of the panel were asked what advice they would give the audience. He replied, &#147;Remember who your parents are&#148;, by which he meant, &#147;Your parents&#146; standards should be your own&#148;. Perhaps he meant that but I could, of course, read it rather more cynically as, &#147;Do you really want to grow up like them?&#148;. The Bill is trying to change the standards of those affected by it in various respects. Having both parents to look at and, it is hoped, to look up to is a worthy ambition and so I am right behind the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000199"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09070277000469"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, for this amendment. With the leave of the Committee, perhaps I may briefly return to some matters that we debated earlier, one of which is certainly relevant to the amendment before us.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000200"></a>During our debates over the past few weeks, several issues have been raised, with resonance with discussions in another place, around the conditionality requirements for parents and the safeguards that we are providing for this group and for those with health conditions or disabilities. There have been some lengthy and important debates, with valuable contributions made by noble Lords from all sides. We have been listening to and carefully considering those contributions.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000201"></a>We are conscious that, to be successful, our policies need to be perceived by lone parents as positive and supportive. As noble Lords have eloquently made clear in previous sessions, this is not always the case and there remains fear about our policies and about how people may be treated in reality. The Secretary of State and I have been struck by the powerful arguments put forward by noble Lords and stakeholder groups that more reassurance needs to be given in the Bill. As such, I am pleased to inform the Committee that we intend to introduce a number of government amendments on Report.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000202"></a>We have had an extremely important debate about the need for advisers to take into account the well-being of the child when they discuss return-to-work activity with parents. In particular, I pay tribute to the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, here. We are fully persuaded of the importance of this approach  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC134"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and therefore intend to make express provision in the Bill that the well-being of the child or children must be taken into account when a jobseeker&#146;s agreement or action plan is drawn up with a parent.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000203"></a>We have had also had considerable debate on the factors that decision-makers should consider when determining whether there is good cause for failing to undertake mandatory activity. Noble Lords are aware that these factors are set out in regulations. We now intend to amend the Bill to enshrine in primary legislation that decision-makers must consider the availability of childcare, when the claimant is a parent, and the claimant has a health condition or disability. This is our current policy and practice, but it will now be set out in primary legislation.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000204"></a>We had a very useful debate on victims of domestic violence, when the noble Baronesses, Lady Thomas and Lady Kennedy, made powerful contributions. The Secretary of State and I are very sympathetic to these arguments, and wish to include in the Bill that parents who are in receipt of jobseeker&#146;s allowance and are victims, or in fear, of domestic violence should be entitled to continue to receive jobseeker&#146;s allowance without the job-seeking conditionality for a period of three months. In short, they can have a three-month exemption from conditionality.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000205"></a>There has been some confusion about our plans for lone parents with a youngest child aged seven and above. Last November we changed regulations so that this group would no longer be entitled to income support. Instead they will have to claim either jobseeker&#146;s allowance or employment and support allowance, depending on their circumstances. The Bill makes no change to this position but it seems that there may be some concern that we plan to extend jobseeker&#146;s allowance conditionality to lone parents with younger children. I give noble Lords a categorical assurance that this is not our intention. We will therefore amend the Bill to make it clear in primary legislation that lone parents and partners with a youngest child aged below seven will not be required to seek or take work. This is our commitment, and the Bill will now make it clear.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000206"></a>As we have discussed, we plan to introduce the progression-to-work pathfinders for those lone parents with a youngest child aged three to six. Concerns have been expressed that, in the future, this policy may be extended and lone parents of very young children could be required to undertake work-related activity and may be sanctioned for failure to comply. We will therefore put in the Bill that no lone parent with a child aged below three will be subject to mandatory work-related activity. They will still be able to volunteer for such activity, though, and receive appropriate support.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000207"></a>These amendments confirm existing government policy by putting it into primary legislation. We have always made it clear that the measures will be implemented in a way that supports families and children. These safeguards give parents reassurance that Governments will not be able to make changes to this landmark Bill without going back to Parliament.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000208"></a>I hope that noble Lords will welcome this statement and the proposed amendments, which we will table in advance of Report. I hope to be able to meet noble Lords in advance of Report to discuss them in more  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC135"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC135</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>detail. I will also write to all noble Lords who have spoken on the Bill, giving them the text of this statement, which I believe is available here today. I hope that noble Lords will forgive me for straying a little wider than the amendment, but I thought it a useful opportunity to put on the record some things that we have been thinking about in recent days. I thank noble Lords for all their contributions, which have been helpful.</p>

It will repay very careful study, which we will all give it&#151;or I certainly will. On the face of it, what the Minister now proposes is much closer than what my party originally proposed, from which ideas on much of the formulation of the Bill arose. So I am very grateful for what he has just said.</p>

I shall perhaps leave aside the extent to which it picks up the policy that the noble Lord&#146;s party has proposed. I do not think that it is the occasion to do that. If we have an agreement on the direction, that is a good outcome.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000211"></a>I turn to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, which seeks to modify the duty of parents to maintain their child, as defined in Section 1 of the Child Support Act 1991, so that parents of a qualifying child should make provision for the well-being of their children, alongside the need to provide financial support.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000212"></a>Some noble Lords present today will recall that the issue of parental responsibility was discussed at length during the passage of the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008. We debated a number of amendments, which would have required the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission to promote the full responsibilities of parenthood, including matters relating to health development and welfare.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000213"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, was instrumental in ensuring that these important issues were debated, and while I appreciate the sentiment behind the amendment before us today, I am sure he will not be surprised to hear that the Government have not changed their mind on that and therefore I am unable to accept the amendment. Before I set out why, for the benefit of the Committee I should like to restate the role of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission and the statutory objectives by which it operates. The noble Lord referred to these.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000214"></a>Section 2 of the 2008 Act makes it clear that the commission must maximise the number of effective maintenance arrangements in place between separated parents. Furthermore, as set out in Sections 4 and 5, the commission must take whatever steps it deems appropriate to promote financial responsibility for children among parents, and to provide them with information and guidance about how maintenance arrangements can be established.  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC136"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC136</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>This is the function of the commission&#146;s Child Maintenance Options service.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000215"></a>In summary, the commission&#146;s functions are clearly and deliberately built around the need to secure payments of child maintenance. Of course, I recognise and fully support the fundamental premise that parental responsibility does not stop with financial commitments alone. However, I do not believe that the Child Support Act is the right legislation to contain a broader statement on parental responsibility or that the commission would be the right body to pursue this broader agenda. While I recognise that the amendment being proposed would not necessarily require the commission to enforce this wider duty, the fact that it would be contained within the Child Support Act may suggest that this is the case.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000216"></a>While the proper place for such legislation would be the Children Act 1989, which already contains a definition of parental responsibility&#151;I know the noble Lord is aware of this from the debates we had both in relation to the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill and the Children and Young Person&#146;s Act 2008&#151;the Government does not favour the legislative approach in any event. However, that does not mean that the link between child maintenance payments and other aspects of parental responsibility is ignored. Part of the role of the Child Maintenance Options service is to guide parents towards specialist organisations that can help with other aspects of parental responsibility. Furthermore, Section 7 of the 2008 Act gives the commission power to enter into arrangements with other agencies that may have similar issues.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000217"></a>In addition, the commission is currently conducting research with parents to establish what factors encourage appropriate parental behaviour. The findings will be used to deliver marketing and communication campaigns that promote parents&#146; awareness of the importance of taking responsibility for maintaining their children. This approach is detailed in the commission&#146;s corporate plan, which is due to run until the end of the 2011-2012 financial year, a copy of which I will make available to the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000218"></a>The noble Lord asked about Section 4 of the 2008 Act and how the commission is promoting parental responsibility. In addition to the planned research and resultant marketing and communications campaigns, which I have already mentioned, the commission will work alongside other government departments, agencies, trusted intermediary and specialist advisory organisations that interact with families, children and separated parents. This will be done with the aim of promoting the benefits of maintenance arrangements and to build awareness and demand for the help available through the Child Maintenance Options service. Perhaps I may say that that service was introduced when we removed compulsion to use the state maintenance service on parents with care who claimed benefits. In a sense, it is early days yet, but I am more than happy to write to noble Lords to give them an update on how that is progressing. I had some data when we were debating regulations last night, but they are in another file. I hope that with those reassurances the noble Lord will

I fully accept the Government&#146;s position that it is only the financial aspects of parental responsibility that they are prepared to address at the moment. In that context, will the noble Lord consider the idea, which is only a suggestion, that the commission should be encouraged to contribute to the discussions that are now going on about the PSHE curriculum? The social element of the PSHE curriculum could be a relevant place in which to draw the attention of young people to the responsibilities of fathers.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000225"></a>The clause begs two questions: first, whether the sanction power is one that the Executive rather than the court should exercise, and secondly, whether it is really a practical and cost-effective way in which to proceed. Your Lordships&#146; Select Committee, including those of us who have spent decades dealing with constituency cases concerning child maintenance&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, has dealt with them in the courts&#151;yields to nobody in its concern for those affected, and will require a convincing reply to questions about whether the provisions will improve or diminish the rights of those who are potentially affected.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000226"></a>Amendment 174E reflects the committee&#146;s further recommendations. The Bill gives the court the power to hear an appeal against the commission&#146;s decision. If the amendments were accepted, the Bill would empower the courts to make both the original decision and hear any subsequent appeal. Amendment 174E addresses the committee&#146;s other recommendations in paragraph 10 of the report. Section 111 of the Magistrates&#146; Courts Act 1980 already provides for appeals to the High Court that could be used in the context of the circumstances covered by the Bill. Amendment 174B addresses the recommendation in paragraph 11 of your Lordships&#146; committee&#146;s report that if, contrary to the committee&#146;s view, the commission is to be given administrative powers to remove people&#146;s passports, that power should be exercised only by officials of appropriate seniority.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000227"></a>Schedule 5 contains consequential amendments to Clause 42. Your Lordships&#146; Select Committee will propose amendments to Schedule 5 if and when it is appropriate during the further proceedings on the Bill. Amendment 174G is pursuant to your Lordships&#146; committee&#146;s recommendation that if, contrary to our recommendations, the commission were to be given administrative powers to remove passports, the powers to make disqualification orders cannot be contracted out to private body or other people. If contrary to your Lordships&#146; committee&#146;s recommendations and, I venture to think, that of your Lordships' House, administrative power is created for the commission to remove passports, it should be accompanied by an amendment to Section 8(1) of the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 to exclude the imposition of sanction powers from those functions of the commission that may be contracted out.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000228"></a>In the view of your Lordships&#146; Select Committee, it would not be constitutionally appropriate for a third party or private body to have decision-making power over who may not leave the United Kingdom. That is a matter for the courts. I beg to move.</p>

I apologise to him and to noble Lords for not being here at the commencement of his speech. These amendments raise an issue of profound constitutional importance. As the Constitution Committee, of which I am a member, has pointed out, the Executive is acquiring ever more frequently powers to impose sanctions on citizens and punish them without having to take matters before the

I take the view that it is no answer to the taking of those powers that a right of appeal to a court against the imposition of the sanction is given, not least because some people who are the subject of these powers, whose passports are taken away from them, may be deterred from appealing to the court by the exercise of the administrative sanction. They may be deterred by the cost, the inconvenience and, perhaps most importantly, by the formality of the exercise of an administrative sanction against them.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000230"></a>Why is this power needed at all? Is it simply a matter of administrative convenience, as I suspect? If there is some more deep-rooted issue behind it, what is it? Why is it not, as in times gone by, enough that the state has a power to go to a court or a tribunal to seek the sanction against the individual? That would not be expensive, difficult or time-consuming, or involve any deterrent to the state with all the resources it has available to it. This is a matter of profound constitutional importance. I ask the Government to think again about it.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000231"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09070277000478"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> I have very little to add to what the noble Lords, Lord Goodlad and Lord Pannick, have said, except to support the amendments most strongly. My noble friend Lord Kirkwood, who much regrets that he cannot be here this afternoon, likened the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, to a cavalry charging over a hill into the government ranks. His Constitution Committee has produced an admirably succinct and unequivocal report, which poses the central question to this part of the Bill&#151;whether the power of sanctions is one that the Executive rather than a court should be allowed to exercise. We agree strongly with the Constitution Committee&#146;s answer to that.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000232"></a>Perhaps I might quote the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad from last year, when the Minister changed his mind and agreed with the Constitution Committee. He said, and his words were prophetic:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09070277000358"></a>&#147;I note that he reserves the right to come back with future legislation and, of course, no Parliament can bind its successors. We will scrutinise any proposals that come forward pursuant to that intention with the same rigour&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/5/08; col. 964.]</p>

<p><a name="09070277000326"></a>He then supported the amendment, which of course changed the position. Now that it has come back, I expect that the Minister will say that it is because of the number of payments that are still not coming forward. However, that does not make it right, and we strongly support the amendments coming from the Constitution Committee.</p>

Clause 25 of that Bill changed the long-standing arrangement whereby the CSA had to apply to the courts for the ultimate sanction of the removal of driving licences, identity cards and passports from absent parents who refuse to pay their dues in respect of their child or children to the parent with care. The clause allowed  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC140"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the CSA to remove those pieces of travel authorisation administratively without any reference to the courts. It was also to be possible for that to be contracted out under Clause 8.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000234"></a>Your Lordships&#146; Constitution Committee produced a report that reminded the House that the right to leave and return to one&#146;s country is recognised as a fundamental right in international law. It therefore followed that a civil servant or private sector employee should not be given the power to remove a person&#146;s travel documents without reference to a court of law. To cut my story short, the Government did a volte face and moved an amendment on the second day of Report to return to the status quo ante&#151;in other words, the sanction of a removal of travel authorisations by the courts. To my surprise, that was a totally voluntary act on behalf of the Government; no Division was required. But this Government will not take this House&#146;s clear wish for an answer for very long. The constant pressure for 42 days&#146; detention without trial for suspects of terrorism is a case in point. I have lost count of the number of times they have tried to put that into law. Is it four, five, six or seven? I do not know.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000235"></a>But I digress. The Bill does something rather different to the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill, now an Act, in respect of travel authorisation. It returns the Government&#146;s wish for CMEC to have the power to remove driving licences or travel authorisation, or both, administratively, in part for a trial period. If the trial is unsuccessful in persuading the absent parent to pay up, there is a sunset provision, returning to the position of doing this through the courts. If, however, the trial&#151;or pilot, I should call it&#151;is successful, an order must be made to continue it.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000236"></a>I said at Second Reading that my party was prepared to give these pilots for driving licences a go to see whether they had the desired effect of money being given up for the upbringing of the child. I do not resile from that statement. However, I note that your Lordships&#146; Constitution Committee, so ably chaired by my noble friend Lord Goodlad, does not resile from its position either&#151;namely, that the Executive should not be allowed such power of sanction. I am tempted to agree with the committee, but there are two ways in which to deal with this problem. Your Lordships&#146; Constitution Committee has chosen one way, which is to return more or less to the status quo ante. In the next section of the amendments, I shall produce another way in which to deal with this, which with a bit of luck will be slightly more acceptable to the Government.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000237"></a>I return to the amendments of my noble friend Lord Goodlad. My noble friend wants a decision to withdraw these authorisations to be made at a senior level within CMEC&#151;namely, by a senior director. I like this idea and could easily incorporate it into my own formulation in my next group of amendments. It seems that his say-so would set the withdrawal proceedings in motion in the courts by virtue of, as I understand it, Amendments 174C and 174D. If the courts are dealing with the matter, my noble friend sees no need for an appeals mechanism once the court order has been made, as presumably the normal appeals system through higher and higher courts would operate. This appeals

My noble friend also dislikes an award of costs being made when a court proceeding occurs. That must be the purpose of Amendment 174F. His new clause is consequential.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000238"></a>I congratulate my noble friend on his very comprehensive series of amendments, which, taken together, return us, as I said, to the status quo ante. I, however, have a rather different proposal, which will come up in the next series of amendments and which I expect the Government to find more acceptable&#151;if, that is, they find any changes acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000239"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09070277000480"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I start by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, for this amendment. I think that the debate we are going to have is likely to be pretty much a re-run of the debate that we had last year. I see that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has travelled that fine line by staying with his Front Bench in the other place, which, I believe, has changed its position on this as well.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000240"></a>I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, that the Government did not change their mind on the previous occasion; the reality was that it was an issue that we conceded in wrapping up one or two other outstanding issues in relation to the Bill. That happens sometimes with legislation. We believe that the administrative arrangements are right now and we believe that they were right then, but it was not a matter that we pressed or an issue that we were prepared to let go last time in the context of other things that needed to be settled.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000241"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09070277000481"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> Before the Minister continues, perhaps I may tell him very firmly that the Front Bench in the Conservative Party, whether in this House or another place, is totally seamless. We speak with one voice and have one view.</p>

Amendments 174A and 174C to 174F remove from the commission the power to make an order disqualifying a liable person from holding or obtaining a travel authorisation&#151;usually a passport&#151;or a driving licence. Instead, those powers would be held by the courts.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000243"></a>I am aware&#151;it has already been cited&#151;that on 23 April this year the Select Committee on the Constitution published a report expressing the opinion that it is &#147;constitutionally unsatisfactory&#148; for the commission to have that power. I am bound to say to the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, that I think that that is a lesser charge than &#147;profoundly constitutionally significant&#148;, which was the noble Lord&#146;s phrase.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000244"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, is, of course, the chairman of the Constitution Committee and, if I may say so, an extremely distinguished one at that. However, on this occasion, I find that I cannot agree with his position or that of the committee that he so expertly chairs. I draw that conclusion for a number of reasons, starting with two very important points relating to these powers as they stand in the Bill.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC142"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC142</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000245"></a>First, the provisions are drawn such that the commission may make a disqualification order only if it can be shown that the non-resident parent has either wilfully refused or culpably neglected to pay the child maintenance for which he or she is liable. I shall refer to that as the &#147;wilful and culpable test&#148;. The second point is that these powers are not intended to act as a punishment for non-payment. Along with other powers already available to the commission, a disqualification order has only one purpose: to encourage the liable person to pay the outstanding child maintenance debt that he or she owes.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000246"></a>So it may be argued, as the Constitution Committee did, that,</p>
<ul><a name="09070277000368"></a>&#147;to impose sanctions and punish people&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09070277000327"></a>should fall within the remit of the courts and not the executive. However, it does not follow that a decision to make a disqualification order such as we are debating today should not be made by the executive body whose very purpose is to ensure that parents who live apart from their children continue to make a fair contribution to their upbringing.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000247"></a>The wilful and culpable test means that the commission cannot make a disqualification order on a whim. It means that before such an order can be made there must be proper consideration of the circumstances of the case, the non-resident parent must have accrued a child maintenance debt over a period of time, and the commission must first have attempted to use its other collection and enforcement powers to no avail, some of which I am bound to say operate by administrative procedures as we were debating last night. Those powers are extensive and include, for example, the ability to deduct money direct from earnings or from a bank account.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000248"></a>Therefore, a decision to make a disqualification order may be made only after the commission has made every effort to ensure that child maintenance is paid and when, despite all its efforts, the non-resident parent has actively avoided his or her responsibilities and the children and parent with care are left wanting.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000249"></a>I have said that a disqualification order is not a punishment measure. To support that further, the Bill ensures that a non-resident parent facing the imposition of such an order has a straightforward means to avoid it by paying the child maintenance debt owed or agreeing and sticking to a satisfactory payment arrangement with the commission. By the same means, a non-resident parent against whom an order is made can equally ensure that it is rapidly lifted.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000250"></a>I am also convinced that when a court decides to impose a sanction, such as a disqualification order, it does so in the light of its prior dealings with the liable person&#151;in other words, following conviction for an offence. In the case of a non-resident parent who owes child maintenance debt, the commission is best placed to make those decisions. Its experience of prior dealings with the non-resident parent means that it is best qualified to decide whether the non-resident parent&#146;s actions meet the wilful and culpable test.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000251"></a>When the commission makes such decisions, there are further safeguards. The commission is required to consider the impact on any children affected by a   


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC143"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>decision to make a disqualification order, and it must also consider the impact of a disqualification order on the non-resident parent&#146;s ability to earn a living. There is one final safeguard. Clause 42 makes provision to ensure that there is a robust and proper right of appeal against a decision by the commission to make a disqualification order. If an appeal is lodged, the order cannot come into effect until it has been dealt with by a magistrate or a sheriff.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000252"></a>Currently, the commission has the power to make an application to the court for commitment to prison or disqualification from driving, as the court considers appropriate. Although data are limited, there is evidence that a significant proportion of non-resident parents in these cases do not bother to attend the court hearing. Under the provisions we are debating today, the onus will fall on the non-resident parents to decide whether they want their day in court, which they will get by appealing the order. That system will mean that the court&#146;s time is used more efficiently than it is currently, and therefore it will better enable the commission to focus its efforts to get more money to children.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000253"></a>Amendment 174B would require an executive director of the commission&#151;if it were to proceed&#151;to approve the making of any disqualification order in relation to holding or obtaining a travel authorisation or a driving licence.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000254"></a>I understand the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, to ensure that a decision to make a disqualification order should not be taken lightly. I agree with him that in order to ensure that is so the decision-maker should be a person with the appropriate level of seniority. That must be right. However, with respect to the amendment, I do not consider that it is either necessary or appropriate for the decision-maker&#146;s seniority to be specified in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000255"></a>Parliament has decided that the executive body responsible for operating the statutory maintenance scheme in Great Britain should be a non-departmental public body. While there was much debate over the detail of the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill, there was broad support for that particular element of the reforms. The principle of this amendment is fundamentally contrary to that approach. It would unreasonably constrain the commission&#146;s ability to organise its work and its decision-making processes as it considers appropriate.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000256"></a>Of course, the commission does not have an entirely free hand in that respect. It is obliged to ensure that all of its administrative functions are operated fairly and consistently and in accordance with human rights legislation. That, of course, includes the powers to make disqualification orders. In that respect, the commission will be held to account by the Government and the courts in respect of the way it operates these and other powers.</p>
<h5><a name="09070277000383"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000257"></a>Furthermore, a number of safeguards are already provided by the legislation. The commission must consider the impact of the decision on the non-resident parent&#146;s ability to earn a living. It must assess whether the non-resident parent has met the wilful and culpable test, and it must consider, as I said a moment ago, the  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC144"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>welfare of any child affected by the decision. Finally, there is a full and extensive right of appeal to a court against a disqualification order.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000258"></a>Therefore, I believe that the existing framework is sufficient to ensure that the decision-maker is of the appropriate seniority in every case, and I believe that, combined with the additional safeguards that we have provided, that will ensure the appropriate level of protection for the liable person.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000259"></a>Amendment 174G inserts a new clause that would amend the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 so as to ensure that the power to make a disqualification order could not be exercised by another person on the commission&#146;s behalf. By &#147;disqualification order&#148;, I mean, of course, an order preventing the liable person holding or obtaining a travel authorisation or driving licence.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000260"></a>Section 8 of the 2008 Act enables the commission to authorise any person to exercise any of its functions in whole or in part. Such authorisation may be subject to conditions, perhaps for a limited time, and may be revoked by the commission at any time. Anything done, or omitted to be done, under such an authorisation is treated as if the function had been exercised by the commission. Therefore, in effect, Section 8, as has been identified, allows the commission to contract out any of its functions to a third party.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000261"></a>However, the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, is absolutely right that a decision to make a disqualification order is serious and should not be taken lightly. Indeed, the Bill and other relevant legislation provide that the commission cannot do so without ensuring that certain conditions are met and that particular questions are considered. I can assure all noble Lords that a decision to make a disqualification order will be taken only by the commission and will not be contracted out under the provisions of Section 8.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000262"></a>I therefore urge the noble Lords not to press their amendments. I am conscious that what I have just said is probably exactly the debate that we had a year ago, but it is the Government&#146;s position, which I believe to be right. At the end of the day, the Bill is about effective mechanisms for getting payments to children, particularly in cases where people who have the resources to make them simply refuse to do so.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000263"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09070277000483"></a>Lord Pannick:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his full reply. He told us that it is not a matter of punishment, but of encouraging the relevant parent to pay up. Taking away people&#146;s right to travel abroad and to drive will inevitably be seen by them and the community at large as very much a punishment for their conduct. The difficulty with arguing that such measures are appropriate so long as there are sufficient safeguards&#151;in the sense that decisions are taken by officials of an appropriately senior level, are taken only by reference to appropriate criteria, such as wilful misconduct, and only when they think it appropriate&#151;is that exactly the same argument could be applied to any other sanction or order that Ministers think it appropriate to confer on an administrative body; for example, a curfew order or something of the sort. Why not allow administrative bodies to impose those orders? This Government are taking us down a very slippery slope

It is entirely within their hands to deal with that and relieve themselves of the consequence of an order. To describe that as &#147;punishment&#148; seems, with respect, to be a little bizarre.

A number of powers are embedded; there are deduction from earnings orders, deductions from bank accounts, which we discussed last night, and lots of other opportunities. The sad fact, though, is that there are individuals out there who will go to the most extraordinary lengths to prevent payment of sums due from them to their children. It may seem awful to you and me and, in a sense, inconceivable, but it happens. This is not the first or second port of call; it happens only after those processes have been gone through and there is a wilful refusal to pay.</p>

I am not disputing that the relevant people have brought it upon themselves nor that in many of these cases, perhaps most, it is entirely justified that the sanction order should be imposed upon them. The simple point is that it should be a court that decides that it is appropriate to impose that order upon them, and it should be for the commission simply to take out an application in the magistrates&#146; court to say, &#147;This is the history. This is what has happened. It is now appropriate to take away this man or woman&#146;s driving licence or passport&#148;. That is the constitutional point. It is inappropriate for the commission, however justified it may be on the merits, however experienced it may be and however careful it is, to do more. It is not appropriate for an administrative body to have these powers. I respectfully ask the Government to think again about this before Report.</p>

The Select Committee will examine with great care what the Minister and my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale have said to see whether it is consistent with what has been said before and with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

Where the court deals with travel restrictions, it does so in the light of its prior dealings with an individual who has been convicted of an offence. In the case of defaulting non-resident parents, I suggest that the commission is arguably better placed to decide whether a person has wilfully failed to pay maintenance and, therefore, what enforcement measure is most appropriate because of its prior dealings in that case. It knows the history and the anguish of trying to ensure that payment is made.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000271"></a>I suggest that an administrative system allows the threat of imminent action and that it may be more effective than the threat of application to a court, given that the international evidence shows the administrative process to be faster and less resource-intensive. The creation of an effective deterrent, thereby influencing the behaviour of non-resident parents who otherwise might fail to support their children financially, is of particular significance. This change could also lead to a reduction of cases coming before the courts, as I said earlier, enabling them and the commission to concentrate&#151;</p>

The Minister mentioned that the administrative decision would be quicker and less resource-intensive, but I am sitting here thinking that that is the problem. The reason that a court should be involved in these major matters is precisely that a court would look at all sides of the issue and, I imagine, take evidence from both sides, including from the father who is going to all these lengths to avoid playing for the child&#146;s upkeep. That is why a court would be the right place to make these decisions. It is unusual and, one might say, apparently bizarre for a father to refuse to support his child. There may well be major issues lying behind his determination but those issues should at least be heard. I believe that they would be heard in a court but I will be corrected if I am wrong about that.</p>

I have not developed the point because it would take quite a long time, but those of us who have dealt with these situations in constituencies over the years will know that it is much more resource-intensive to go down the route proposed by the Government than that proposed in our amendments,

The whole thing would take months and cost an absolute fortune. So it is beyond question that our proposal is less resource-intensive and much more sensible.</p>

To pick up on one point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, the issue can come before the court. The individual can appeal to the magistrates&#146; court or the sheriff&#146;s court, and that appeal will itself put a stop on the administrative action. There is nothing to stop an individual, if they feel that they are being unfairly treated, having their day in court.</p>

It would be much quicker and cheaper for the court to have a look at the thing first, rather than having two or maybe three procedures.

I said two things in relation to the last group of amendments, in the names of my noble friend Lord Goodlad and the noble Lord, Lord Pannick. The first was that I was perfectly prepared to accept the Bill's proposition that there should be a pilot, with a sunset clause, to examine the efficacy of the administrative removal of driving licences, with the ability to appeal to the courts if the decision is contra to the applicant&#146;s wishes. I merely extemporised in saying that on what I said at Second Reading. I also said that my proposals differed somewhat from those  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC148"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of my noble friend; they had the merit of being simpler and potentially more acceptable to the Government. I did not intervene in the cross-chat at the end of my noble friend&#146;s group of amendments, but it occurred to me that whether you used the courts or not, CMEC would have had to do the work already, so that the duplication that he was talking about almost certainly would not exist. It would have to prepare a case for itself, which I suspect would not differ one iota from the case that it would have to prepare for the courts.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000278"></a>What I suggest in these amendments is that the Government are allowed to test the administrative withdrawal of all travel authorisations, including passports and identity cards, for the two years they are proposing for driving licences alone. I do not believe that I have yet had an answer to the question I asked on Second Reading; namely, by what logic the Government are demanding to have a sunset clause only for driving licences and not for all travel authorisations. That position is as illogical as it would be for me to accept the Bill&#146;s proposals for driving licences, including the sunset clause, but not for passports.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000279"></a>My series of amendments, therefore, with the addition of my noble friend&#146;s Amendment 175A, for which I am grateful, would mean that all travel authorisations would be treated equally in all respects. This is, I hope, achieved by amending Clause 43 by adding the words &#147;travel authorisation&#148; to the words &#147;driving licence&#148;, which already appear in the Bill. Unfortunately, I did not have the consequential amendments as complete as I should have done, so I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Goodlad for Amendments 178ZA and 178ZB. I suspect that I should have amended Schedule 5 as well, which I shall look at that more closely if I decide to pursue this matter on Report.</p>

The Select Committee, in paragraph 13 of our report, welcomed the provision in Clause 43 for a sunset clause requiring a review after two years of the transfer of driving licence sanctions powers, if Parliament so ruled, from the court to the commission. Given the concerns that we rehearsed, if Parliament confers powers over passports to the commission, it, too, should be included in the sunset clause and that would be revisited.</p>

Clause 43 currently makes provision for a two-year pilot only in respect of disqualification from driving, as the noble Lord outlined. I shall explain why it is unnecessary to pilot disqualification from holding travel authorisation.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000282"></a>Clause 43 is intended to enable the DWP, the commission, the Department for Transport and the police to gauge whether there is any greater risk associated with an administrative as opposed to court-based power to disqualify a person from driving, as well as evaluating its effectiveness in gaining compliance with child-maintenance responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000283"></a>Requiring a two-year pilot and the publication of a report into its effects, as well as further debates in both Houses of Parliament should we decide to proceed after the pilot, will ensure that the driving-licence power will become permanent only if it is shown to be effective. The provisions will also enable us, if necessary, to identify and address any issues evidenced by the pilot.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000284"></a>Unlike with passports, we did not attempt to introduce administrative driving-licence powers in the 2008 Act due to quite legitimate concerns about the potential consequences for third parties.  A person who drives while disqualified not only commits a serious motoring offence but also invalidates his or her insurance. By contrast, we do not believe that it is necessary to have a piloting power with regards to passports. While the withdrawal of a person&#146;s passport or ID card suitable for travel is a severe measure, it does not carry any risk of harm to innocent third parties. </p>

<p><a name="09070277000285"></a>While I understand the concerns raised by the Select Committee on the Constitution, I do not see a compelling case to justify piloting the travel authorisation power. That is because the concerns raised by the committee, primarily about the constitutional appropriateness of the measure, could not be addressed simply by a pilot in any event. I hope that that has given the noble Lord the assurance that he was seeking.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>

At present, the vast majority of all births outside marriage&#151;I understand, approximately 84 per cent&#151;are already jointly registered.  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC150"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Just 7 per cent of all births, which works out at around 45,000, are solely registered, and this proportion has been on a downward trend. For unmarried fathers, birth registration has two significant consequences: it gives the father parental responsibility in relation to the child; it also serves as a record, so the child knows the identity of the father. In the vast majority of cases, these are positive outcomes, and we support the proposals. However, there are details in the schedule which I wish at this stage to probe.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000289"></a>First, there are certain circumstances where the mother will not have to give information about the father, which are spelled out in the new Section 2B (4) of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953, inserted by Schedule 6. My first amendment, Amendment 178ZBA, would leave out new paragraph (d), which states that the mother need not give information if she does not know the father's whereabouts. I find that curious. I can understand that if the mother does not know who the father is, that presents an insurmountable, if regrettable, barrier to her providing the relevant information, but simply not knowing where he is should not prevent her giving information about who he is. Let us remember that if the objection that not knowing where the father is means he cannot be contacted to verify his paternity, then new subsection (7), to which I will come shortly, provides that no information has to be entered on the register simply because the mother has supplied it. However, unless she gives a name, at the very least, there is absolutely no chance of ever tracking him down. I therefore find the exemption in paragraph (d) puzzling and unnecessary. It simply provides a get-out clause to mothers reluctant to name the father for no good reason, and I do not think that that is in the child's best interests.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000290"></a>It is on that note that Amendment 178ZCA, which leaves out subsection (7), comes into play. If no information has to be entered on the register simply because the mother has provided it, what will be needed to verify the information and therefore qualify it for entry? Presumably the father will need to verify it, and if the registrar cannot find the father, then what? Does the registrar exercise his discretion and enter the information if the mother seems believable or does he need to conduct his own investigations? How much work will he have to do under subsection (7)? Rather a lot, I imagine, if he does not even have the father's name to go on.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000291"></a>The fifth amendment in this group, if noble Lords will forgive me for jumping about a little, is designed to provoke debate on what should happen if the reverse situation were to occur, by which I mean if the mother disappears without a trace before her baby is registered and therefore cannot give her confirmation. I realise that we are beginning to get into unlikely, but by no means impossible, scenarios, but I would like to hear an assurance from the Minister that all contingencies have been considered.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000292"></a>The second amendment in the group, Amendment 178ZBB, removes paragraph (f) from the list of exemptions. This is where a mother need not provide information on the father if she fears for her or her child's safety. I re-emphasise that this is a probing amendment at this stage, as I merely want to unravel  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC151"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Government's thinking. I spy a group of amendments on the horizon in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, which will encourage a debate on domestic violence per se, so I will restrict my observations at this stage to suggesting that merely knowing there is a parental relationship will not, of itself, lead to violence against the mother or child. While it goes without saying that I abhor and condemn violence, given the importance that I think all noble Lords agree there is for children to know who their parents are, is this&#151;the birth registration&#151;the correct place to combat domestic violence?</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000293"></a>Amendment 178ZBC leaves out paragraph (g) from the list of exemptions. That paragraph simply gives carte blanche to the Minister to dream up any other exemptions that she sees fit. I cannot imagine that she thought that I would allow that one to slip away unnoticed. Is this an exhaustive list of exemptions or not? If it is not, why not? What other exemption does the noble Baroness sniff in the wind, perhaps with or without the advice of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie? I would prefer to debate other possible exemptions to the duty here, rather than have them squirreled away in regulations at a later date. I beg to move.</p>

I understand their probing nature. They seek to restrict the range of circumstances in which a sole registration would be permitted under the new system.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000295"></a>There are a number of circumstances where the mother will be exempt from the requirement to provide information relating to the father; for example, if she has reason to fear for her safety or the safety of the child. The first three amendments would remove some of these exemption conditions, including this example.</p>
<h5><a name="09070277000385"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000296"></a>The amendments would also remove the power to prescribe further exemptions. The final two amendments would have the effect that a man&#146;s details could be included in the register even though both parents had not acknowledged that he was the father. The main aim of all these amendments seems to be to further increase the number of births that are jointly registered. I fully sympathise with the aim of the noble Lord. Indeed, we also want to ensure that more children have both parents named on their birth certificates. We believe that it is important that as many children as possible know the identity of both their parents and that both parents acknowledge them and take responsibility for them. That is the point of this part of the Bill. That is why we have drafted provisions which require joint registration in all cases where this is possible and appropriate. The new system will certainly not be a voluntary one.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000297"></a>I shall now explain why, in the situations with which these amendments are concerned, joint registration would be simply either impossible or inappropriate. Amendments 178ZBA, 178ZBB and 178ZBC would remove some of the conditions which exempt the mother from providing information about the father. The exemption conditions in the Bill are few and purposeful. They are all necessary because they relate to situations in which joint registration is just not possible or appropriate. Amendment 178ZBC would  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC152"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC152</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>remove the power for the Minister to prescribe further exemption conditions in regulations. I hope that I will be able to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, that this power will be used only if new circumstances emerge which would make sole registration necessary. We are not aware of any at present but we recognise that some may come to light as a result of consultation or when the provisions are implemented. This power merely ensures that the legislation is sufficiently flexible to deal with such circumstances swiftly and effectively.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000298"></a>Amendment 178ZBB would remove the exemption for a mother who would fear for her safety or that of her child if the father were contacted in relation to the registration. In this legislation we have tried to strike a balance between a child&#146;s right to know their father&#146;s identity and the protection of vulnerable women and children. This is a difficult balance to strike and I know that a number of noble Lords have concerns. As we will have the opportunity to debate these issues further in relation to a later group of amendments, as the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said, I shall keep my comments brief.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000299"></a>As I have said, it is a difficult balance, but I believe that our provisions strike the right balance. As was explained in another place, the critical point is the role of the state. We cannot permit a situation where the state knowingly acts in a way which puts the safety of a mother or her child at risk. It would be wholly inappropriate to require a registrar to contact a man if the mother had stated that she had reason to fear for her or her child&#146;s safety. In such cases, the birth does not have to remain sole-registered for ever. The father can still come forward independently and request that his details are included in the register, subject to the mother&#146;s acknowledgement that he is the father.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000300"></a>Amendment 178ZBA would require the mother to provide information about the father in cases where she did not know his whereabouts. This, too, was debated at length in another place. I hope that I can reassure noble Lords that this exemption will not be an easy get-out, as the noble Lord said, for mothers who wish to sole-register. A mother will be able to claim this exemption only if she cannot provide useful information about the father&#146;s whereabouts. Indeed, the information that a mother will be required to provide under proposed new Section 2B(1) will cover a range of details about the father. The precise details, on which the noble Lord pressed me, will be decided in consultation with the General Register Office, practising registrars and other stakeholders. However, we do not anticipate that a mother will be able to claim an exemption because, for example, she cannot provide the father&#146;s full current address. If the mother does not know the father&#146;s whereabouts and so cannot provide information that enables him to be contacted, joint registration is impossible. The alleged father cannot be contacted and asked to acknowledge paternity. Therefore, requiring the mother to provide the limited information that she does know would serve no purpose.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000301"></a>I turn to Amendments 178ZCA and 178AA. These amendments would make it possible for the father&#146;s details to be included in the register in cases where only one parent had alleged that he was the father. I appreciate the noble Lords&#146; intention behind these amendments, which I understand is to make sure that  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC153"></a><b>2 July 2009 : Column GC153</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as many children as possible know their father&#146;s identity. However, I should like to explain why the amendments would not achieve that.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000302"></a>For information about the father to be included in the register, it is crucial that both parents acknowledge that the man is the father of the child; otherwise, information that is unverified and so not meaningful will be included in the register. The birth register is a public, legal record and the information included on it needs to be accurate. These amendments would lead to situations that were at best misleading and at worst very damaging to those involved. It is not helpful for a child to have a man named as their father on their birth certificate if this information cannot be confirmed by that person. We need to ensure that both parents acknowledge paternity before a man&#146;s details are included in the register. Because of this, the exemptions relating to the father&#146;s whereabouts and the mother&#146;s fear for her or her child&#146;s safety remain necessary.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000303"></a>I was asked a number of questions by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. He talked about the possibility of these exemptions providing an easy get-out for mothers who want to sole-register. The exemption conditions are few, as I said, and purposeful. They all cover situations in which joint registration would be impossible or inappropriate. If a mother&#146;s circumstances meet one of the exemption conditions, she will be required to make a declaration to that effect. That declaration is subject to the Perjury Act and the mother is under a duty to be truthful. Under that Act, it is an offence to give deliberately false or misleading information to a registrar. As we implement our provisions, we will reinforce the current message of the registration service to ensure that both mothers and fathers are aware that doing so would be a criminal offence.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000304"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, also asked whether the list of exemptions was exhaustive. At this stage, we consider that the list is exhaustive but we want to keep flexibility in case further situations emerge, especially during consultation or implementation.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000305"></a>The noble Lord asked what happens if the mother disappears or is ill. In such cases, another qualified informant may give details to allow registration to take place. Other qualified informants might include the midwife who delivered the child or anyone present at the birth or resident in the house where the child was born. He asked what the registrar would do if the father did not respond. In that situation, registrars will register the birth without the father&#146;s details. It would not be appropriate for the registrar to take substantial further steps to contact the father, and he or she cannot enter unverified information on the register. Therefore, we do not see the role of the registrar changing in that we would not want to expand the registrar&#146;s role to a seek-and-find job as well as ensuring that registration was legal. We will look at what additional steps it may be appropriate for the registrar to take through training and guidance.</p>

<a name="90702-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09070277000306"></a>I hope that I have covered the points that the noble Lord raised.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000307"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0008.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09070277000503"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I suppose that in the spirit of the past eight days that was a conflated response to a

As usual, I shall study carefully what she said. However, if the mother of the child goes to the registrar within the year that is now permitted and says, &#147;I don&#146;t know where he is living now, but he was living at 23 Acacia Avenue&#148;, is there any good reason why the registrar should not note that fact and try 23 Acacia Avenue when the mother wants nothing more to do with the father? Or is that not a realistic scenario? The Minister does not need to answer now but it would be useful if she did at some stage.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000308"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09070277000504"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I underline two points. First, yes, the registrar can write to the last known address; it does not have to be the current address.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000309"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0008.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09070277000505"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> But does that go on the register?</p>

Secondly, the registrar, as I understand it, has to take the information that he is receiving at face value and as the truth under the Perjury Act.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000311"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0008.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09070277000507"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I understand that; I am not worried about that. I am worried about a situation where the name of the father is known and admitted by the mother doing the registration, but she does not know where he is currently living, only his last address. Even though she is trying to register both herself and the father in a joint registration, she may be trying to set up a sort of insurance policy for her child. There may be a strong CMEC aspect to her behaviour, which from her point of view would be perfectly rational. That is why I asked the question. The Minister has a missive in her hand. I do not know whether she wants to use it or whether we can talk quietly later.</p>

<p><a name="09070277000312"></a><b><a name="90702-gc0008.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09070277000508"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I should be delighted to talk quietly later and, if the noble Lord would wish it, to write to him. The missive in my hand tells me that the lady whom we are talking about would be able to claim an exemption only if she could not provide enough information to enable the registrar to contact the man, because, in that case, she would not know his whereabouts. But we can talk more about this.</p>

<a name="09070255000003"></a><b><a name="90702-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09070255000097"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (Lord Young of Norwood Green):</b> My honourable friend the Minister for Further Education, Skills, Apprenticeships and Consumer Affairs (Apprenticeships&#151;Joint with DCSF) (Kevin Brennan), has made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09070255000004"></a>I am today publishing a consumer White Paper: <I>A Better Deal for Consumers: Delivering Real Help Now and Change for the Future.</I></p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09070255000005"></a>The White Paper sets out the Government's new, more active and strategic approach to financial and other consumer markets. It follows publication this week of <I>Building Britain's Future, </I>which sets out the Government's plans for creating growth and jobs as the economy moves out of recession, and a vision for improving consumer rights in public services. This White Paper deals with consumer rights in the wider economy.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09070255000006"></a>Consumers have been seriously affected by the turmoil in the financial markets, as well as by the longer term changes in the way that goods and services are bought and sold. We are taking decisive action to provide real help for consumers now and to enhance and enforce consumer rights in a changing world.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09070255000007"></a>Businesses now face tighter margins and more competitive prices, which can act as an incentive to provide greater choice and lower prices. This can lead to increased transparency, greater profitability for the most efficient and an opportunity to build and develop customer loyalty. It is also important at all times, but particularly in these challenging economic times, that Government are committed to minimising the burdens, including regulation, on business.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09070255000008"></a><I>A Better Deal for Consumers </I>outlines the real help we are providing now for people in financial difficulties, together with longer term measures we are planning to bolster confidence and help consumers exercise greater personal responsibility, while protecting consumers from unfair practices, and ensuring effective and proportionate enforcement.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09070255000009"></a>The White Paper focuses on four key themes:</p>
real help now for vulnerable consumers;a new approach to consumer credit;empowering consumers through better enforcement and information; andmodernising consumer law.
<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09070255000010"></a>It sets out the real help we are providing now for vulnerable consumers. It describes practical actions to help consumers facing challenging economic circumstances, including measures to help keep people in their homes and help people in difficulty in debt. These measures include help for homeowners in mortgage arrears and tenants who are falling behind on their

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09070255000011"></a>The White Paper describes a new approach to consumer credit, setting out how we intend to make the consumer credit market work better for consumers. It includes proposals to reform credit card regulation (including a ban on the sending of unsolicited credit card cheques), new requirements on all lenders to check credit-worthiness of consumers before they lend to them, and a review by the Office of Fair Trading of high-cost credit providers.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09070255000012"></a>It also sets out measures to empower consumers through better enforcement and information. Consumers need clearer information and better enforcement in order to take advantage of, and not be taken advantage by, new and rapidly developing markets. Actions include a new consumer advocate who will co-ordinate work to educate consumers, and be a champion for consumers. The White Paper also gives details of a new national strategy and specialist team for internet enforcement on consumer issues, and a central &#147;fighting fund&#148; to tackle rogues operating on a big scale.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09070255000013"></a>Building on evidence gathered in the consumer law review, the White Paper sets out our plans for modernising consumer law to enhance and protect consumer rights in a changing world. We will do this through a new consumer rights Bill, which will implement in due course the EU consumer rights directive and modernise and simplify UK consumer sales law.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09070255000014"></a><I>A Better Deal for Consumers </I>has been produced in consultation with the devolved Administrations. In those policy areas where the Government's responsibilities extend, the proposals outlined will apply across the UK. However, other aspects of policy highlighted in the White Paper are devolved, in differing settlements, to the Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Devolved Administrations can tailor their policies to deliver public services which meet the specific needs of each country.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09070255000015"></a>The proposals and actions in this White Paper will form the basis of a consumer policy that responds to change and helps all consumers make informed and responsible choices.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a><a name="09070255000078"></a>Today the Forced Marriage Unit (a joint Home Office/Foreign and Commonwealth Office unit) launches revised forced marriage multi-agency practice guidelines intended for all front-line practitioners (such as teachers, police officers, social and healthcare professionals, housing officers) to help them to work more closely together to better identify and protect children and adults at risk of forced marriage. These practice guidelines have been designed to provide step-by-step advice to front-line workers and have been produced to complement the statutory guidance, (which came into force with the launch of the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act) in November 2008), which sets out the broader strategic responsibilities of chief executives and senior managers in tackling forced marriage locally.</p>

<a name="09070255000083"></a><b><a name="90702-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="09070255000101"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Malloch-Brown):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Chris Bryant) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a><a name="09070255000084"></a>On 16 March 2009, the Minister for the Overseas Territories informed the House of the publication by the Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) of the interim report of the commission of inquiry into whether there was information that corruption or other serious dishonesty in relation to past and present elected members of the TCI House of Assembly may have taken place in recent years. In his interim report, the commissioner, the right honourable Sir Robin Auld, found there was information in abundance pointing to a high probability of systemic corruption and/or serious dishonesty. In Sir Robin&#146;s view this, together with clear signs of political amorality and immaturity and of general administrative incompetence, demonstrated a need for urgent suspension in whole or in part of the constitution and for other legislative and administrative reforms.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"></a><a name="09070255000085"></a>On 31 May Sir Robin delivered his final report to the Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_78"></a><a name="09070255000086"></a>In that report, the commissioner has confirmed that nothing that has happened since he submitted his interim report has prompted him to change his original view. His close examination of the information and evidence before the inquiry has reinforced, not weakened, his conviction of a need for urgent and wide-ranging systemic change.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_79"></a><a name="09070255000087"></a>On systemic weaknesses, he confirms the recommendations in his interim report covering: partial suspension of the constitution and interim direct rule; criminal sanctions and civil recovery; integrity in public life, Crown land allocation, sale and management; and a new constitution. Some recommendations focus on deterring or preventing corruption and other serious dishonesty, while others look at the broader constitutional and statutory framework of governance. He recommends the appointment of an independent expert on the management and allocation of Crown land as well as strengthening the Governor&#146;s Office and Attorney-General&#146;s Chambers.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_80"></a><a name="09070255000088"></a>The commissioner&#146;s final report also makes preliminary findings and recommendations including the institution of criminal investigations in relation to former Premier Michael Misick, and four of his former Cabinet ministers. It confirms the recommendation in the interim report for the establishment of a civil and criminal recovery unit and the appointment of a special prosecutor.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_81"></a><a name="09070255000089"></a>The commissioner states that the information he has gathered points to a high probability of systemic corruption and/or other serious dishonesty involving past and present elected Members of the legislature in

This same information (and his preliminary findings against individuals) has highlighted weaknesses in the law and its administration.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"></a><a name="09070255000090"></a>Although the governor intends, if possible, to publish the full final report in due course, he is not currently able to do so owing to legal proceedings brought in TCI by two persons named in it. Consequently, I hope that a redacted version of the final report will be published as soon as possible.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"></a><a name="09070255000091"></a>Legal proceedings are also ongoing in the United Kingdom, relating to the Order in Council made on  18 March which would suspend parts of the TCI constitution. This was to be expected and it will take time for this to run its course. However, I am determined  to push forward now with the implementation of recommendations in the final report that do not depend on the entry into force of the order. To ensure that good governance can be re-established as swiftly as possible in TCI, the governor, with the full support and assistance of the British Government,<I></I>is therefore taking steps to appoint experts to work in areas of concern highlighted in the final report. These include: a special adviser to the governor to oversee reform of the public service; three public financial management advisers; an economic adviser; a good governance adviser and a Crown land adviser. Other governance recommendations are under active consideration. Direct support for the governor has also been increased with the appointment of an additional senior FCO official to his office.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a><a name="09070255000092"></a>A special prosecutor and head of the civil and criminal recovery unit, and a senior investigating officer have been identified and the necessary procedures relating to their appointment are now under way. The holders of these positions will work together with a team on the investigations recommended by the commission. I will announce further details soon.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a><a name="09070255000093"></a>In summary, the British Government are working hand in hand with the governor to start implementing commission recommendations without delay and remain determined to do everything in our power, as swiftly as possible, to tackle systemic corruption and to restore good governance in TCI.</p>

<a name="90702-wms0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_86"></a><a name="09070255000094"></a>I wish to acknowledge, again, the help and support provided by the keen eye of the FAC in highlighting the situation in TCI.</p>

<ul><a name="09070280000957"></a>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will make representations to the Government of Afghanistan suggesting that 600 prisoners at Bagram be charged if suspected of criminal offences; and that they and other detainees in Afghanistan be provided with a satisfactory review process for their detention. [HL4342]</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="09070280000003"></a><b><a name="90702w0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09070280001005"></a>The Minister for Europe (Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead):</b> The UK works closely with the Afghan authorities to support a strengthening of the criminal justice system across Afghanistan. The UK is clear that all detainees should be treated humanely. It is right that the International Committee of the Red Cross have access to those detained at the Bagram detention facility.</p>

<a name="90702w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="09070280000004"></a>The question of prisoners detained at Bagram is a matter for the US and Afghan Governments as Bagram is a US detention facility. President Obama has set in motion a comprehensive review of detention policy and practice, including in Afghanistan. We welcome this and await its outcome.</p>

<a name="90702w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="09070280000005"></a>The formal justice system in Afghanistan faces many challenges, including a shortage of trained judges and legal representation. The UK and international community are supporting the strengthening of the justice sector to address these; for example, at the national level the UK is building the capacity of the Criminal Justice Task Force and, through the Department for International Development, has supported the World Bank's Justice Sector Reform Project.</p>

<a name="90702w0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="09070280000006"></a>The UK also supports human rights in Afghanistan. Since 2001 the UK has given nearly &#163;2 million to support the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC). The AIHRC has over 500 staff across Afghanistan, actively tackling human rights issues, including false imprisonment.</p>

<a name="90702w0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a><a name="09070280000007"></a>In its 2007 annual report, the AIHRC stated that its Monitoring and Investigation Unit, in close co-operation with the Afghan Ministry of Justice, prepared a list of 2,392 people who were in prison after the completion of their sentences or who were otherwise illegally detained. The AIHRC later released an update stating that 819 of those who were illegally detained had been released and the sentences of an estimated 1,500 more had been determined.</p>

That is why the UK is pushing for an ambitious global climate change deal in Copenhagen later this year that will meet our objective of keeping global temperature rises below 2 degrees Celsius. This will mean nothing less than a 50 per cent reduction in global emissions by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels).</p>

In November 2008, the Environment Agency, working with the Met Office Hadley Centre, published some climate change research findings as part of the Thames Estuary 2100 project (TE100).

This figure allows for small land movements over that time, but does not fully account for the remote possibility of future rapid changes in ice flows in the Atlantic or in Greenland, which could lead to the upper figures being much higher.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a><a name="09070280000022"></a>In response, the Environment Agency commissioned the Met Office to consider this gap in ice flow science. The work investigated a most extreme scenario, known as High + +. This suggested a higher range of sea level rise of up to 1.9m. This is regarded as a remote possibility, highly uncertain and highly unlikely in this century. As we go forward, we will refine our projections in the light of what is happening in practice and as science deepens our understanding.</p>

<a name="90702w0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_14"></a><a name="09070280000034"></a>Security in the civil nuclear industry is subject to regulation which reflects the international obligations and best practice. The Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS) regulates the civil nuclear industry by means of the Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003 (NISR), which makes provision for the protection of nuclear material, both on sites and in transit, against the risks of theft and sabotage, and for the protection of sensitive nuclear information.</p>

<a name="90702w0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_15"></a><a name="09070280000035"></a>Security measures in the civil nuclear industry are applied in a graduated manner in accordance with the severity of the threat and the level of consequence of a successful attack in a manner that provides defence in depth. OCNS may give directions to the nuclear operators at any time, for instance in the light of a change in the threat level for the industry. This is aided by OCNS being an active member of the UK intelligence community.</p>

<a name="90702w0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_16"></a><a name="09070280000036"></a>Any new licensed nuclear sites would need to satisfy the demanding requirements of the NISR. OCNS will ensure that security measures are included in plans for the construction of any new nuclear power station from the outset. Doing so will avoid the need to retrofit security measures once construction is under way. This will also enable regulators to make an early judgment on the most appropriate measures for any construction site. This will help ensure that security is ingrained into practices at any site from day one. The Government are confident that this approach will ensure that security measures will continue to be robust and effective.</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_46"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will extend the power to ban the use of hosepipes to include the filling of private swimming pools. [HL4519]</p>

<p><a name="wa_st_89"></a>
<a name="09070280000954"></a><b><a name="90702w0005.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09070280001093"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Davies of Oldham):</b> In 2007 the Government consulted on proposals to modernise the powers to restrict non-essential uses of water. It was agreed that the existing hosepipe ban powers would be replaced with a new wider power that will increase the range of water uses which could be limited or prohibited when water resources are in short supply.</p>

<a name="90702w0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_907"></a><a name="09070280000955"></a>The Government intend to bring these changes into effect through an enabling power in the flood and water management Bill. This would allow the Secretary of State to extend the uses of water that may be restricted under existing water company hosepipe ban powers. The existing hosepipe ban powers apply only to the watering of private gardens and the washing of private motor vehicles. The proposed legislative change is currently being consulted on as part of the draft flood and water management Bill.</p>

<a name="90702w0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_908"></a><a name="09070280000956"></a>The department has committed to undertake further work to identify evidence of the costs and benefits of these changes. Any additional non-essential uses of water that may be prohibited, which could include the filling of private swimming pools, would be added to the legislation through an order, and would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
