<H4><center>Thursday, 20th March 1997.</center></H4>
<H4><center>The House met at three of the clock (Prayers having been read earlier at the Judicial Sitting by the Lord Bishop of Ripon): The LORD CHANCELLOR on the Woolsack.</center></H4>
<H4><center>Several Lords--Took the Oath.</center></H4>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-01_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Montgomery of Alamein </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "70320-01_para0"></a>Whether they consider that Bletchley Park should become a national monument to wartime achievement.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="70320-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, the Government recognise that Bletchley Park is of great historical importance to the nation. We hope that a way can be found to preserve the park as a monument to its wartime activities. I must declare an interest because I worked at Bletchley Park during the war and have been a friend of the trust since its inception.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-01_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Montgomery of Alamein: </B>   My Lords, I too must declare an interest, albeit a minor one and in no way comparable to the distinguished wartime service rendered by my noble friend during the war when she was a young girl. I am one of a number of honorary patrons of the Bletchley Park Trust.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-01_para1"></a>If the Government appreciate the importance of the achievements of Bletchley in saving lives both on land and at sea and in the creation of the computer industry--it was there at its inception--should not resources be put behind a programme to create a museum which will enable young and old, both now and in the future, also to appreciate what was achieved?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, I greatly resented the Daily Telegraph for saying that I joined Bletchley when I was 22; in fact I was 18. In answer to my noble friend, there are already 2,500 museums in the UK. The Government can only provide direct funding for a limited number, such as the country's national museums and galleries.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that, in addition to herself working at Bletchley as a teenager, a number of other ladies at the other end of the Palace also worked there? Is it not a fact that some of the outstanding successes of the last war--such as the tracking and sinking of the "Bismarck" and later the "Scharnhorst"--can be laid at the door of ULTRA. While at the time Britain stood alone and was not able to deliver many victories, its use certainly gave enough warning to mitigate the worst of some of the German's successes. It is absolutely right that the noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery, asks this Question and the <P>


<a name="column_1044"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1044</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suggestion should be accepted by the Government. If Bletchley is destroyed, there is no record of what those people did.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, without the successes of Bletchley Park this nation could have starved to death. If I may be garrulous for one moment, perhaps I may read a letter I received from a Mrs. Morley. She said that she ended her service in the WRNS taking apart with tweezers and a screwdriver the very machines that helped us to end the war, thereby committing the secret of the bombs to oblivion. She continues,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I have read books and articles about the Enigma Miracle and the brilliant code breakers but I have seen very little indeed about the contribution made by hundreds of WRENS to this special war effort with eyes straining but devoted commitment to a boring job". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-01_para2"></a>I should like to pay tribute to and honour the Wrens and civilians who did the actual donkey work for the brilliant mathematicians.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Hillhead: </B>   My Lords, I was 23 rather than 18 when I was sent to Bletchley Park. It was a large establishment and to my great regret I did not have the honour of knowing the noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington, there. However, as it now seems to be generally appreciated that Bletchley Park was crucial, perhaps to a greater extent than those who were working there appreciated at the time, and as it has been vastly seminal from a computer point of view, it would be a great pity if it just became a built-over site on the outskirts of Milton Keynes. No expressions of goodwill can achieve that unless the Government are prepared to take a financial initiative and put some limited but necessary sums of money forward.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, when I went to Bletchley there were 400 people there; when I left there were 6,000. Had the noble Lord and I met then, think how different our lives might have been!
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-01_para3"></a>In answer to the noble Lord's Question, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State met representatives of the Bletchley Park Trust on 3rd March to hear their plans for a further lottery application. Their first application was turned down and the Heritage Lottery Fund provided the trust with detailed advice on how to submit a revised application and on how applicants can receive help with preparation of a business plan. It is up to the trust to submit a decent plan. It can then raise money and run the trust.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, Bletchley Park has been so secret that people have not known enough about the amazing work it did. What terms have Her Majesty's Government and BT offered the Bletchley Park Trust for the transfer of the land in question?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, the site is currently owned by British Telecom and by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment. They have jointly agreed to terms under <P>


<a name="column_1045"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1045</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which the Bletchley Park Trust can be offered a permanent leasehold interest in the site, allowing the trust to acquire the majority of the museum land free of charge.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, on the eve of what may be a political change, may I, with the permission of the House, say how much I have enjoyed working opposite and with the noble Baroness? Her openness, her warmth and her sense of fun have been a pleasure to us all. I did not know that she was one of the delectable band of maidens of Bletchley Park, assuming they were maidens. Is she aware that we on this side of the House wholly support the proposals that have been put forward? But will she confirm that in fact none of the original technology is still there? In that context, and bearing in mind that the first programmable computer, Colossus, was there, would it not be appropriate if the centre was also a museum for computer technology, which might attract support from private industry?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, I am sure the noble Lord is adept at bowling a maiden over. The noble Lord is perfectly correct with regard to the first part of his question. I am given to understand that Churchill for some reason decreed that all the machinery there should be destroyed at the end of the war. The letter I quoted gives the House an example. Some of it, like Colossus, has been rebuilt. Other machines are being rebuilt. But there will be no original machines in the museum. The trustees want to have a history of the computer because the two really major historical events of the 20th century that took place at Bletchley were the development during World War II of the science of cryptology and the first digital electronic computer.

<A NAME="70320-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Hayman </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "70320-01_para4"></a>Whether they are satisfied with the current management policies within the Prison Service relating to women prisoners.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="70320-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Blatch): </B>  My Lords, the Prison Service fully recognises the special needs of women prisoners and keeps the relevant policies under review. That is why in November 1996 the director general announced his intention to set up a new unit to ensure appropriate oversight and co-ordination of the care and treatment of women prisoners. That unit is now operational.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for that reply. But does she not accept that there are still concerns about the overview with regard to women prisoners? Will she undertake to give serious consideration to the advice of the Chief Inspector of Prisons that there should be a director of women's prisons at board level within the Prison Service? Given the rising number of women prisoners <P>


<a name="column_1046"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1046</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the very special and sensitive issues that relate both to them and their children, would it not be sensible to revert to the practice of the past and have one person with an overview in this area?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, that is not without its difficulties. At present, Prison Service establishments are for good reasons largely managed on a geographical basis. The chief inspector's proposals would cut across that structure. But the director general recognises the particular needs of women and young offenders and has set up this new unit in the Prison Service headquarters to focus on the management of these prisons and on improving current levels of care and treatment. He is confident that this change will bring significant benefits. But whether a radical change would be appropriate is one of the issues which will be considered by the current review which the director general is undertaking.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-01_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Macleod of Borve: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend assure the House that women prisoners who are pregnant are taken outside the prison walls to have their babies?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo970320/text/70320-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I can give my noble friend an absolute assurance that no baby is born inside a prison, barring accidents, of course, where it cannot be avoided. All babies are born in hospitals outside of prisons.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Winston: </B>   My Lords, that assurance from the Minister is received with gratitude but it does not go far enough. Can she tell us what provision is made for ante-natal care for women prisoners? These are women whose pregnancies are of a high risk nature. We now know that ante-natal influences can affect paediatric development. Can she tell us what ante-natal paediatric expert help there is in their care and what qualified obstetric care?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord raises an important point. All the needs of the pregnant mother are properly met. There are also facilities post-pregnancy. Some will be met within the prison through prison staff. Some will be met by visiting medical staff; for example, doctors come in each day to give check-ups. Some is external to the prison where the prisoner goes to an external hospital. No medical needs are neglected.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Acton: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that in the 1950s and 1960s there was an assistant prison commissioner with responsibility for women prisoners and borstal girls? Is it the intention of the Government at least to consider restoring that position? I am not clear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I have said that a review is looking at the structure. Given that we have a unit and that there is a head of that unit with specific responsibility for women prisoners, who represent 4.3 per cent. of the prison population, I hope the House will agree with me that what really matters is the service <P>


<a name="column_1047"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1047</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>delivery on the ground at a local level. That is where our efforts must be, and not on some bureaucratic head of a service.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Baroness's review look into the question in particular of Category A prisoners held in Holloway where the conditions are totally unsuitable for them? Is it possible for conditions in Holloway to be modified so that those who need to be kept there because they are on remand can enjoy civilised facilities?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I should like the noble Lord to tell me what particular provision is not being made for Category A prisoners at Holloway or any other prison.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Minister has given answers which reflect administrative arrangements rather than real care. I am sorry to say that but it seems to be the case. Is it not a fact that the scandals which have been made public in recent years, in particular of the shackling of women prisoners going to hospital and going into and enduring childbirth, have made it clear to the public that something other than the present administrative arrangements is necessary? Would it not be wise to look again at the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Acton, who reminded us that between 1943 and 1959 there was indeed a deputy commissioner of prisons responsible for all women prisoners and for policy in that area? Would it not be desirable to consider returning to that position?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, what I am addressing is almost entirely the opposite. I am not talking about administrative arrangements. I am talking about having sound strategic and policy oversight. But the real executive management ought to be found at a local level. A particular instance was cited by the noble Lord. He will know that that practice was not approved of at a local level. It was very quickly remedied. A policy statement was put out by the Home Secretary on 18th January. No pregnant woman is shackled in hospital either during birth or from the time of her arrival at the hospital.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Cockfield: </B>   My Lords, as the interests of the child are obviously affected by this, can my noble friend say whether, if a birth occurs by misadventure inside the prison, it can be registered as having occurred outside the prison, following the precedent which is adopted in the case of death in the Palace of Westminster?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I need to check out a technical answer to my noble friend's question. It is the policy that no baby should be born in prison. For the particular reason my noble friend has given, we do not wish the address to be prison. I believe it is administratively possible in the case of any pregnant mother who may have started having the baby in prison for the address to be the hospital at which she would complete the medical treatment for that birth.

<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "70320-02_para0"></a>What action they have taken following the fundamental expenditure review of the Overseas Development Administration.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="70320-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Chalker of Wallasey): </B>  My Lords, most of the recommendations in the fundamental expenditure review were accepted and have now been implemented.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister accept--and this is the last opportunity to say so--how much, in view of her own personal commitment, we have all felt for her in the steadily declining priority given by the Government as whole to overseas aid programmes, let alone the sad diversion of resources from poverty and development priorities, as evidenced in episodes like the Pergau Dam? Is it not unfortunate that when months ago the far-reaching fundamental expenditure review stated explicitly that the resources available to ODA were not adequate to cover its commitments and that prioritisation was essential, no considered strategic response by the Government was put before this House? Where do the Government stand on the recommendations for prioritising the 20 poorest countries, reducing commitments in regions like the Caribbean and cutting specific multilateral programmes? What consultations have there been with those adversely affected?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   Oh, my Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Judd, really does not know what is going on! He will have to do a lot better than that because he has not bothered to find out. I have good news for him because today the report on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, including the ODA, which extends to 160 pages, has been published. He will find in the blue section a great deal of information which will help him. I am sure that he will benefit from reading it. Further to that, perhaps I may tell him that we have been concentrating on the poorest countries and that is exactly what the outcome of the FER was. Assistance to the value of &#163;175 million has gone to the 10 poorest countries. Eighty per cent. of Britain's bilateral aid goes to sub-Saharan Africa and to South Asia. We have been concentrating on pumping in that development assistance from which countries can benefit, and will benefit by their own efforts as well as ours, as fast as we possibly can. In addition, we have the second highest combined private and official flows going into the developing world. It is 1.38 per cent. compared with the UN target of one per cent. of GNP. My officers in Scotland, London and across the world have done a fine job. It is beneath the noble Lord, Lord Judd, to criticise them. They have delivered better value for money than ever before. They are targeting it and have the common <P>


<a name="column_1049"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1049</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sense to make sure that the money is applied where it can do most good in the poorest countries with the poorest populations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Judd.: </B>   My Lords, I certainly do not take second place to anybody in my appreciation of what the dedicated staff of the ODA do with their meagre resources. But the Minister cannot have it both ways. If she accepts all the recommendations of the fundamental expenditure review, she accepts that the resources are not adequate for the programme; that prioritisation is essential; and that the 20 poorest countries must be targeted in a way that they were not before. Does the Minister agree that it is no good reading off a lot of ad hoc statistics if she accepts, as she said she does, the recommendations of the fundamental expenditure review?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-02_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, with the permission of the House, I was tempted not to respond, but maybe I should. Since the honourable Member in another place, Mr Gordon Brown, said that he would keep to this Government's expenditure programme, and since we are credited by OECD and all the other international organisations with having the best targeted and the best-delivered development programme in the world, I have no reason to apologise for what we have been doing with the resources which have been made available. Of course, we all wish to do more in many different areas of life, but we also know that, unless Britain continues to have a sound economy, as it will have under the next Conservative Government, we will not be able to do as much.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to the Minister for not having read the 165-page review published this morning. It is obviously a failing that we have on these Benches. Does the Minister foresee that the bilateral budget will be sufficient this year or, because of commitments to the European budget, will there have to be some topping up of the bilateral budget?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-02_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, as I believe the noble Lord knows, there is an undertaking by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that should the non-discretionary spending exceed the revised forecast, the Exchequer will meet the bill. That is a guarantee that we have never had before and it shows the importance that we attach to development. Any reductions in the baseline were fully attributed to the lower forecast of the UK's commitments to multilateral organisations, largely the European Union. So if the demands of the European Union or of other international bodies increase, the Treasury will have to go to the reserves. We will deliver no less than what we have planned. We have planned with great care and with the full co-operation of the governments we seek to help. I believe that is a good record and my staff can be proud of it.

<A NAME="70320-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   Well, my Lords, we are sinking to a depth which I did not expect to see in your Lordships' House, whatever might happen in other places. I can only say to the noble Lord that I do not believe he has looked at the figures. According to the figures, the average household is a good deal better off in real terms than any of those with whom I deal on a day-to-day basis. I am talking about countries which have fewer than 700 dollars per head per annum. That is a very tiny sum when compared with the average income in this country. Anyone who knows anything about figures will not deny that some people will be poorer than others. The overall movement in this country of income after tax has been up and up, and under a Conservative Government it will continue to be so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Judd:  </B>   My Lords, will the Minister accept that it is a final indictment of the Government's approach to overseas development that, at the eleventh hour plus, they produce 160 pages in response to an Opposition Question when in 18 years of government they have never produced a single White Paper on the overseas aid and development programme?

This annual report was published last year and the year before. It is a regular document which, if he had read it in previous years, he might have learnt something about it. All I can say is that I am very grateful to the people who really know what is going on, and they are the staff of the ODA.

<A NAME = "70320-03_para2"></a>What has been the increase in the level of violent crime in London between 1979 and the present time.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="70320-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, there has been a steady and consistent increase in violent crime in England and Wales since 1946. I understand from the Commissioner <P>


<a name="column_1051"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1051</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of Police for the Metropolis that violent crime in the Metropolitan Police District has risen from 24,995 incidents in 1979 to 89,861 in 1996.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that while the Metropolitan Police have been doing a good job in difficult circumstances, the Government have failed abysmally in dealing with violent crime? Is it not a disaster for the people of London that the violent crime rate increased by 20 per cent. in the past year alone to 90,000? Is not the truth that this Government are weak on violent crime and weak on the causes of violent crime?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, since 1946, crime has risen by 2,305 per cent.; between 1946 and 1979, violent crime rose by 803 per cent. and between 1979 and 1996, it rose by 166 per cent. Noble Lords opposite may wring their hands about crime, and about violent crime in particular, but where were they when I looked for support to crack down on violent crime? We are extremely concerned about the rise in violent crime and we are committed to introducing tough measures to cut down on crime, and particularly on violent and persistent crime as well as crimes such as domestic burglary, drug dealing and repeat violent offences. Noble Lords opposite, however, were found wanting when it came to putting their fine words into action.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Molloy: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister prepared to consider what I regard as a vital issue; namely, the reduction of manpower in the police force in many of our London boroughs? We are all proud of our police officers, who do splendid work. However, in the London Borough of Ealing there has been such a massive reduction in the number of police officers that the Greenford and Northolt areas now have no patrolling policemen whatsoever. Such things are noted by the criminal classes who take full advantage of them.

<P>

<A NAME="70320-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, since 1979 the Government have increased the funding for the police by 90 per cent. in real terms. I and my ministerial colleagues on these Benches take daily criticism from noble Lords opposite about the level of expenditure on our programmes, but tell that to Mr. Gordon Brown in another place who has pledged to continue that level of expenditure on programmes!
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-03_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Molloy, makes an important point because there are now 16,000 more policemen than in 1979. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister pledged to fund another 5,000. The money for that was made available last year and money has been made available this year. The whole 5,000 will be funded by the end of the next financial year. We shall meet our pledge. However, two points arise from that, one with particular regard to London. Sadly, because of the reappearance of the IRA on the streets of London, the Commissioner chose to use the money to pay for extra overtime using experienced policemen. That was what happened to London's money for new policemen. However, the Metropolitan Commissioner has welcomed the extra money for the financial year <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "70320-03_para6"></a>Those of your Lordships who have had an opportunity of reading the opinions of the noble and learned Lords will, I am sure, have no doubt that the committee has reached the right conclusion and that neither of the two sons purporting to be the sons of the Third Baron can, in fact, be an heir to the peerage. In the case of the elder, Andrew, the committee was shown overwhelming genetic evidence that he cannot be the son of the late Lord Moynihan; and so far as the younger, Daniel, is concerned, the evidence clearly shows that he is the child of a bigamous marriage and is therefore illegitimate. In those circumstances, it is clear beyond doubt that the petitioner, Colin Moynihan, must be the rightful heir and that his Petitions must succeed.

<A NAME="70320-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to your Lordships if I am a little more incoherent than usual, but I have only just arrived on the premises to see to my surprise this report on the Order Paper. Perhaps the Chairman of Committees will in due course, after the election, furnish the House with a list of the dates when the committee reported to the House and the dates when Parliament rose. I suggest that this is not the first time that such reports have been put through at the very last minute. Although I am not suggesting any ulterior motive, the practice is unfortunate for those of us who take an interest in these matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para2"></a>Paragraph 1 on the "enhanced message" service was the subject of some discussion last time when the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, inquired about the cost of the service. At that time the Chairman of Committees was unable to enlighten the noble Lord, but I can tell the House that the consultancy charge was &#163;144,000. It was done on a daily basis and included the charges of two partners for two days. I believe that the House is being taken for a ride, as is the other place, which shares the expense with us. Therefore, I should like some more information on this because when we discussed it previously it was suggested that there should be wider consultation. Will the Chairman of Committees tell us what opportunity there has been for ordinary Members of your Lordships' House to contribute; and how much notice was given, and how, of the demonstration that was available to members of the committee?
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para3"></a>I do not think that the other items in the report are of a sufficiently contentious nature to mention, but the question of the message service is terribly important <P>


<a name="column_1055"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1055</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because we have recently seen an example in another place of how the use of automatic message services can be grossly abused to devalue the entire traditions and honour of both Houses.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-04_spmin1"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, in reply to the noble Lord, perhaps I may point out--your Lordships may know this already--that the Select Committee on House of Lords Offices met on Wednesday of this week. It was thought--I strongly supported, and do support, this view--that it would be right to present the report of that committee to your Lordships at the earliest possible moment so that there would be no delay into the next Parliament. That is the first point. As the noble Lord, Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe, knows, I am always anxious to assist your Lordships as much as possible on such matters, not least the noble Lord himself, because I know that these domestic matters are of interest and are regarded by your Lordships as of importance to the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para4"></a>If I may say so, ample notice was given of the demonstration carried out last month for members of the committee. There is to be an extensive consultation process between now and September of this year in which noble Lords will be consulted about their requirements. There will be ample opportunity for noble Lords' views to be put forward before the matter comes back to your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para5"></a>As the noble Lord has said, mention has already been made of the costs. As far as concerns the consultancies, your Lordships' committee has been assured that the costs are certainly in accordance with normal practice in these matters. They are regarded as being market value, if I may put it in that short way. As the noble Lord has indicated, the costs have been shared with another place, which has also scrutinised them.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para6"></a>I hope that that provides some assistance to the noble Lord. If I am able to provide any further information I shall do so by means of writing to the noble Lord. Any queries on further matters arising out of this report to your Lordships' House can always be dealt with in the new Parliament by means of Questions for Written Answer.
<P>

<A NAME="70320-04_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move the Motion standing in my name on the Order Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para8"></a>It may be of assistance to your Lordships if I say a few words about the background to this Resolution and explain why I bring it before the House and commend it to your Lordships.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para9"></a>The Resolution stems from a recommendation by the Public Service Committee of another place in July last year. In its 1996 report on ministerial accountability and responsibility, the committee recommended that Parliament should lay down in the form of a Resolution how it expected Ministers to discharge their duty of accountability to Parliament. In their response, the <P>


<a name="column_1056"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1056</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government agreed that there could be value in this, not because Ministers were in any way unsure about what was required of them, but because such a Resolution could set out clearly and unambiguously for all to see what the standards were and the standards against which Ministers were prepared to be judged.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para10"></a>The Prime Minister's document Questions of Procedure for Ministers sets out what he, as head of the Government, expects of his ministerial colleagues in this respect. This Resolution would parallel my right honourable friend's expectations by laying down in similar terms, perhaps even more importantly, what Parliament required. The Government took the view that to have the full authority it deserved, such a Resolution should, so far as possible, be adopted by cross-party agreement, and that both Houses would want to consider it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para11"></a>To this end, my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster initiated discussions with the main opposition parties in another place. I have done likewise with representatives of the main opposition parties and the Convener of the Cross-Benchers in our House. I should like to take this opportunity to thank noble Lords who took part in those discussions for their courteous and constructive participation. Our aim throughout has been to reach a stage where we can lay Resolutions before both Houses to complete this piece of business during this Parliament. This we have now done. Noble Lords may be aware that colleagues in another place last evening adopted a very similar Resolution to the one now before us.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para12"></a>I make just two points about the wording of the Resolution. First, I make a technical but nevertheless important point. The Resolution refers to two documents: the Civil Service Code and the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. These documents have, I believe, attracted widespread support, but they remain government documents rather than parliamentary documents and are therefore capable of subsequent amendment by the Government. I should like to make clear that if these documents were amended, they would not automatically alter the terms of the Resolution itself. For that to happen, the House would be required to take an independent decision on whether the Resolution should be amended to refer to any additions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para13"></a>Secondly, the Resolution that I commend to your Lordships is not identical in every particular to the one adopted last night by another place. While the principles are identical, the format is slightly different. I am indebted to the learned Clerk of the Parliaments for his advice that technically it would be more appropriate if in a Resolution of this House the two government documents that I have mentioned were referred to in a separate paragraph; that is, paragraph (5) on interpretation. That is the paragraph that we have before us. The advice he gave was that that would be more appropriate rather than that it should be cited within paragraphs (3) and (4). I found that an extremely helpful suggestion, for which I am most grateful. I am more than happy to adopt it.
<P>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1057</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para14"></a>I hope that is sufficient to explain why I believe that this is a useful addition to the armoury that the House possesses in its manifest duty to render Ministers accountable to Parliament. It is in that spirit that I commend the Resolution to your Lordships.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para15"></a>Moved, That, in the opinion of this House, the following principles should govern the conduct of Ministers of the Crown in relation to Parliament:
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para16"></a>(1) Ministers have a duty to Parliament to account, and be held to account, for the policies, decisions and actions of their Departments and Next Steps Agencies;
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para17"></a>(2) It is of paramount importance that Ministers should give accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity. Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister;
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para18"></a>(3) Ministers should be as open as possible with Parliament, refusing to provide information only when disclosure would not be in the public interest;
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para19"></a>(4) Ministers should require civil servants who give evidence before Parliamentary Committees on their behalf and under their directions to be as helpful as possible in providing accurate, truthful and full information;
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-04_para20"></a>(5) The interpretation of "public interest" in paragraph (3) shall be decided in accordance with statute and the Government's Code of Practice on Access to Government Information (Second Edition, January 1997); and compliance with the duty in paragraph (4) shall be in accordance with the duties and responsibilities of civil servants set out in the Civil Service Code (January 1996).--(Viscount Cranborne.)

<A NAME="70320-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, we on this side of the House welcome the Resolution. We believe that it is sensible and appropriate. We have waited long enough for it. It is time that Parliament had its say on ministerial responsibility. Is it not extraordinary how the approach of a general election concentrates the Government's mind? Here we are on the very last day of the Parliament and at last we have a sensible Statement on ministerial responsibility. For every sinner that repenteth there is joy on these Benches!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Harris of Greenwich: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Leader of the House for his Statement. My noble friend Lord Jenkins of Hillhead was consulted. The noble Viscount will be aware that he is content, as are the rest of us on these Benches.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, this is a matter of great constitutional importance. I am grateful to my noble friend the Leader of the House for his lucid explanation of it. It is a matter of great satisfaction that this is agreed between the parties.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para0"></a>For centuries ministerial responsibility has been a matter of convention. Now we have it clearly laid down. I believe that sometimes in the past it went too far. <P>


<a name="column_1058"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1058</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Ministers were held responsible for the actions of all their civil servants, sometimes several thousands of them, with an ever-widening scope of activity. It was impossible for Ministers to know about everything that was happening in their departments, even within the scope of the policies that they had declared and laid down.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para1"></a>With that in mind, I invite your Lordships' attention to paragraph (1), which says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Ministers have a duty to Parliament to account, and be held to account, for the policies, decisions and actions of their Departments and Next Steps agencies". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para2"></a>Let us briefly consider that proposition in the light of what I have said about the vast number of civil servants and the scope of their activities. It is quite clear that Ministers should be responsible for policies and decisions of a major kind, but not all of the minor decisions that must be taken from time to time to implement those policies. It is right that they should be responsible for the actions of the government departments so long as Ministers know in advance what those actions are required to be.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para3"></a>For Ministers to be responsible for every minor incident, which has sometimes led to parliamentary embarrassment and even the resignation of Ministers in unjust circumstances, would be absurd. Therefore I hope that that important paragraph will, in future, always be interpreted in the light of reason.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may ask the Lord Privy Seal two questions on the Resolution. In his helpful elucidation he referred to Questions of Procedure  for Ministers. In fact the resolution is not about responsibility; it is about accountability. But Questions of Procedure for Ministers deals also with responsibility. Does this resolution take the place of paragraph 27 of Questions of Procedure for Ministers, which hitherto has made it clear that Ministers have not just a duty of accountability but also of responsibility?
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para4"></a>Is the Lord Privy Seal reminded of Sir Richard Scott's report which at reference D4.42 stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The answers to Parliamentary Questions in both Houses of Parliament failed to inform Parliament of the current state of Government policy on non-lethal arms sales to Iraq. This failure was deliberate and was the inevitable result of the agreement between the three junior Ministers"? </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para5"></a>Does the Lord Privy Seal believe that, if we had had the resolution at the time of the Scott report, the three junior Ministers would have been required to resign because of their deliberate lack of openness to both Houses of Parliament?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Merlyn-Rees: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Renton, does the House a service by drawing our attention to principle (1) of the resolution. He dealt with the first part, for which I am grateful. I wish to take the matter a little further. The principle refers to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Actions of their Departments and Next Steps Agencies". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para6"></a>The Next Step agencies are meant to be different. Members on the Select Committee of your Lordships' House are finding that there are Next Steps agencies and Next Steps agencies. They are not all the same.

<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para7"></a>I had an answer from the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, the other day to a Question I asked about the Prisons Agency, for example. The Prisons Agency is very different from other agencies. Are we to take it from the first principle that there is no difference between a department and a Next Steps agency? If that is the case all the talk about the difference there would be in government as a result of the setting up of Next Steps agencies, which are different from normal departments and are within a big department, amounts to nought. Why Next Steps agencies? We are told by the Government that they are different.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, I support the Motion that the Leader of the House has put before the House. Perhaps I may ask him a technical question of some importance which, from me, I can assure him, is completely non-controversial as usual. According to paragraph (1) of the Motion, Ministers have various duties in relation to Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para8"></a>In view of the fact that both Scrutiny Committees of European legislation are to be out of action for about six weeks, how do Her Majesty's Government intend to safeguard the interests of Parliament with regard to the normal cascade of regulations that appears from the European Commission on Parliament's steps? May we have an assurance that those matters will be dealt with promptly, and that all concerned will be duly informed?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cockfield: </B>   My Lords, unlike the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, I must apologise for rising twice in the same day. I should like to put a point to my noble friend the Leader of the House on paragraph (3) which states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Ministers should be as open as possible with Parliament, refusing to provide information only when disclosure would not be in the public interest". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para9"></a>We are constantly having cases at Question Time when information is refused on the ground of "commercial confidentiality". I quote that phrase. A case occurred in the House this very week.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para10"></a>It is well known that British industry is secretive compared with American industry; it is well known that government departments are excessively secretive; it is well known that in this country governments of all complexions are excessively secretive. The excuse of commercial confidentiality is usually only a cloak to hide inefficiency, incompetence, and uncompetitive behaviour.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para11"></a>May we have an assurance that, in the interests of the greater efficiency of British industry, Ministers will take great care not to advance the excuse of commercial confidentiality in order to justify a refusal to give the House information only in the most extreme circumstances, and where, in the terms of this resolution:

<a name="column_1060"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1060</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Harris, is not still in his place--for their support. With the indulgence of the House, perhaps I may take the opportunity to pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Richard, during the past two and a half years or so during which I have had the privilege of being the Leader of your Lordships' House, and say that, although we may differ politically, I have learned to view him with a mixture of respect and affection, which has been a great pleasure during my time here, and which I hope will continue when we face each other from the same positions from 7th May next. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, has always been a great exponent of wishful thinking, and I see that that has not changed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para13"></a>My noble friend Lord Renton, almost predictably, puts his finger on an extremely important point. It has become almost a truism that, in the days of highly complex government and administration, often involving many civil servants, it is impossible for a Minister to know everything that happens in his department. Nevertheless, those of us who have had the privilege to be departmental Ministers--in my case an extremely junior one--will know that any hard working, conscientious Minister will make it his or her business to know the essentials of what is going on in the department and to be able to make a judgment. The noble Baroness, Lady Symons, may be in a better position to know whether or not what I say is justified as to where, perhaps, the ministerial gimlet eye should alight.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para14"></a>Nevertheless it means that Ministers have an extraordinarily difficult judgment to make, but also--dare I say it?--Parliament has a difficult judgment to make, particularly when Parliament inevitably will have its judgment coloured--I make no complaint about this--by considerations of party politics. There have been, as the House will know perhaps better than any other body, attempts, particularly by my right honourable friends, to try to define, as is only right, where that difficult decision should lie. There have been attempts to differentiate between operational responsibility and ministerial accountability.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para15"></a>In the end, it is a matter of careful judgment. Ministers are only human; they can get things wrong. I dare say that we all do, and that if in a decade or so the party opposite found itself in office it would be faced with similar decisions. My noble friend Lord Cockfield and the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, are right in stressing the importance of paragraph (3) of the Motion before us. There is an absolute obligation for Ministers to be as open as possible with Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para16"></a>If, like me, your Lordships are fans of that extraordinarily perspicacious programme, "Yes, Minister", you will remember that often both civil servants and Ministers are depicted by Mr. Anthony Jay and his co-writers as saying that the object of Answers to Parliamentary Questions is to reveal as little as possible. It might be for the edification of your Lordships if you allowed me to take a trip down memory lane to when I made what was clearly a joke in very poor taste to the first civil servant who came to brief me on a Parliamentary Question, implying that perhaps that was the object of all <P>


<a name="column_1061"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1061</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>civil servants. I shall never forget the chastening look that I received from the individual concerned; it made it very clear that one does not joke about such matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para17"></a>I hope that your Lordships will take at least some comfort from the fact that the best traditions of the Civil Service will try to make sure that even the most tempted of Ministers do not stray from an obligation of this kind. Questions of procedures for Ministers and Parliament insisting on a complementary regulation of this kind will reinforce something that has been called into question in recent years.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para18"></a>I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, that I do not want to go over the individual paragraphs of the Scott Report. They are paragraphs which, as the noble Baroness will appreciate, I know entirely by heart. I dare say that if I try very hard I can complete the quotation that she gave, but I hope that she will not test my assertion. I do not believe that Ministers would have been required to resign. I believe that if Ministers take their job seriously they will always try to keep Parliament as well informed as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para19"></a>My noble friend Lord Cockfield knows more about commerce than I suspect I ever shall and I bow to his superior wisdom. However, I suspect that, more often than not, government contracts and their terms, particularly in the defence field and in substantial contract terms, are very sensitive. It is a matter of judgment to see how we can reconcile commercial confidentiality with the demands of Parliament. That is a difficult judgment to make but it is one that we attempt.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-05_para20"></a>My noble friend Lord Bruce--perhaps I may be allowed to indulge myself for a moment--knows that during our term of office we have done perhaps more than most to increase the level of parliamentary scrutiny of European matters and that parliamentary reserves apply. I can assure him that when we are returned by the electorate on 1st May any parliamentary scrutiny which has had to go by the board because of the events of the next six weeks will, without question, be put before Parliament as speedily as possible.

<A NAME="70320-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, lest the House slips into confrontation in its last Session, I thank the noble Viscount the Leader of the House for his kind words. We have had a vigorous relationship over the past two-and-a-half years. Certainly we have not always agreed. Our disagreements have usually been civil, but not invariably. Given the nature of your Lordships' House, of course, the incivility is dressed up in the most extraordinary politeness and charm. Therefore, when the noble Viscount began by saying nice things about me my limited classical education sent me straight back to the quotation which begins "timeo Danaos". I was wrong and I am delighted.

<P>

<A NAME = "70320-06_para18"></a>The whole question of who should be permitted to provide services under the Bill featured prominently in our earlier discussions of the Bill. We have in fact, I believe, always been entirely at one over the objective of the Bill--to enable NHS primary care to be delivered to even higher standards across the country, as part of the NHS. Nonetheless, we listened carefully to the views put to us, both in this House and by the professions, about the possible threat of commercialisation, and we took prompt action to deal comprehensively with that threat.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-06_para19"></a>The amendments now before your Lordships make it explicitly clear that only those whom we have called members of the NHS family will be able to put forward proposals for pilot schemes and make contracts with health authorities for the provision of services under the Bill. The list of those who comprise the NHS family ensures that key groups who work in the NHS--doctors, <P>


<a name="column_1064"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1064</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>dentists, nurses, NHS trusts--are included, but puts beyond doubt the exclusion of commercial organisations from these possibilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-06_para20"></a>One important feature of the new provisions is that it ensures that all professional groups encompassed by the definition of the NHS family are treated equally under the Bill. We will look at all proposals which meet the new rules we have set on their merits, regardless of the professional group they come from. However, we will expect all proposals to indicate clearly how they intend to secure the medical or dental involvement that all pilots and permanent arrangements will require.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-06_para21"></a>There has been a lot of concern about the danger of commercialisation resulting from this Bill. This has always been at the periphery of what the Bill is really about. The changes made to the Bill in another place deal fully with those concerns, and I am glad to say that the British Medical Association has endorsed the changes we have made. But the changes also refocus attention on the main thrust of the Bill which is and always has been about new opportunities for the existing primary care workforce. We believe strongly that it is the NHS workforce, with its range of professional skills and expertise and its commitment to NHS principles that will develop NHS primary care and take it into the next century. That is what we want, and that is what these changes help to underpin.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-06_para22"></a>Moved, That the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 2.--(Baroness Cumberlege.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-06_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, this is the first of a substantive group of amendments which importantly affect the operation and principle of the Bill as it was first debated and considered in detail in your Lordships' House. We certainly do not intend to debate every one of the amendments and on these Benches we accept that the amended Bill as it stands, as it has come back from the other place, will be a useful tool for an incoming Labour Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-06_para23"></a>Nevertheless, at this stage, it is appropriate to repeat the general point which has been made several times in the past 72 hours in your Lordships' House. It would have been more appropriate to the functions of this House if the 117 Commons amendments that are now before us on this important Bill could have been considered in more detail and with less haste than will be possible this afternoon.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-06_para24"></a>That applies particularly to this group of amendments, which goes to the heart of the Bill, and, as the Minister has just explained, it contains the provisions which the Government are now suggesting to deal with the problem of commercialisation which was threatened by the Bill as previously drafted. That was one of the major concerns which we on these Benches have been raising ever since the Second Reading of the Bill. Had the Government been able to accept or redraft some of the amendments which we on these Benches proposed at earlier stages, which dealt precisely with that issue, we should not have needed this rather breathless consideration this afternoon.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-06_para25"></a>We know--and the noble Baroness has referred to it--that one of the important matters in relation to the Bill has been the intervention of the British Medical <P>


<a name="column_1065"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1065</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Association. We know too that the BMA has made firm representations to the Government that, had they not achieved the terms of the amendment which are now before your Lordships, it was prepared to campaign on this issue during the forthcoming general election campaign. As has been mentioned several times on many other pieces of legislation in your Lordships' House within the past two days, that has greatly focused the mind of the Government. As the noble Baroness said, the amendments now before us deal with the issue of commercialisation and limit those who can propose pilot schemes to those within the NHS family.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-06_para26"></a>As the Minister knows, because she has been kind enough to discuss this with me, we still have doubts as to whether the new clause is sufficiently strong to exclude positively commercial companies. We should have preferred a new clause which made that more specific and explicit. This afternoon the noble Baroness has said that that is done in the terms of the present amendment. But she knows also that there are private companies--for example, Unichem, BUPA and PPP--all of which have been saying very recently and publicly that they regard their plans for proposed pilot schemes as being very much still alive and on the table. I hope that they have now heard the message that the Minister has given clearly.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-06_para27"></a>Finally, I ask the Minister whether she is now able to underline that commitment to the exclusion of commercial companies by correcting her earlier statement when she said:

<A NAME = "70320-06_para28"></a>I she were able to correct that statement, that would lay our fears to rest and make the exclusion of the private companies about which we have been concerned since Second Reading much more remote.

<A NAME="70320-06_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, I should just like to remind your Lordships of the sequence of events when this Bill came to this House and during its various stages before we parted with it and it went to another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-06_para29"></a>During the first stages of the Bill, the BMA gave its general support to what was in the Bill. It was only two days before Third Reading, just before it was leaving us, that it issued a press release--and some of us received a document from the BMA--saying that it was very worried about the possible commercialisation which might result from the Bill. On Third Reading, my noble friend Lady Cumberlege was very sensible in saying that rather than move amendments, the matter should be sorted out in the other place. Therefore, I am glad to note that it has been sorted out in the other place and with the BMA behind the scenes.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-06_para30"></a>On Third Reading, I said that I thought it was wise of the Government to suspend what they were doing until they had had an opportunity to discuss the matter with the BMA and that they had time in the other place <P>


<a name="column_1066"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1066</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to make other changes or pursue different policies. I am sure that it was right for the Government to work closely with the BMA, the profession.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-06_para31"></a>Only today, I received a document from the BMA indicating that it now appears to be happy with the restrictions on what is called the NHS family. Bearing in mind the atmosphere when the Bill left us to go to the other place, I am glad that those matters now seem to have been sorted out and that these amendments are being put forward.

<A NAME="70320-07_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Robson of Kiddington: </B>   My Lords, on behalf of these Benches, I too welcome these amendments. This is much too late a stage to start even trying to play around because it is not possible to achieve anything. We may not have 100 per cent. of what we were asking for but it is a tremendous improvement on the Bill as it was drafted and we welcome that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-07_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I thank noble Lords for their support for the principle of the Bill. I understand the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, as to how we managed to clarify, throughout the course of the Bill, some of the fears and misunderstandings which were originally apparent.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-07_para0"></a>At one point during the course of the passage of the Bill, the noble Baroness was concerned about my use of the word "chatter"; that there was a good deal of chatter going on as regards commercialisation. I should like to assure your Lordships that no organisation has approached us to explain how it thinks it might be able to provide services under the new provisions in the Bill. Therefore, I am very happy to put clearly on the record exactly what the provisions mean. We have taken great care to rule in members of the NHS family and to define that and to rule out others. Now the only companies whose proposals may come forward to the Secretary of State and which may make contracts with health authorities to provide services under the Bill are those which fall within the definition of a qualifying body. We have defined a "qualifying body" very carefully; that is,

<A NAME="70320-07_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Cumberledge: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 7. In moving this amendment, I should like to speak also to Commons Amendments Nos. 8, 25 and 32.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-07_para11"></a>Your Lordships will recall that the issue of the distribution of GPs and the role of the Medical Practices Committee was subject to continuing discussions with the profession. We have reached an agreement on the new arrangements. In brief, these involve greater scope for local people, who know about local needs, to decide on the distribution of doctors within an authority's area. We shall also ensure that a robust national overview of the GP workforce is drawn together so that we can achieve an equitable distribution of GPs between health authorities. That will draw on the expertise of the MPC and the NHS Executive's national resource allocation group and involve representatives of the profession and of health authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-07_para12"></a>The amendments before the House reflect the agreement that we have struck. Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 ensure that the Secretary of State pays due regard to the effect that pilot schemes will have on the distribution of GPs. To enable him to do this, he will be required to consult the Medical Practices Committee when proposals for pilot schemes are put to him which increase or reduce the number of GPs in the area of the authority concerned. In short, the amendments acknowledge the important role of the Medical Practices Committee and ensure that its knowledge and expertise inform decisions on pilots made by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-07_para13"></a>I can also assure your Lordships that, before we take forward any regulations on the issue, we will discuss the relevant issues with the MPC. That will provide a further opportunity for us to consider any outstanding concerns that it may have. Amendments Nos. 25 and 32 give legislative effect to proposals that recognise that national distribution of the GP workforce must be kept in view by the Secretary of State in considering permanent schemes. They ensure that any regulations governing the introduction of permanent arrangements are framed with this in mind. I commend the amendment to the House.

<A NAME="70320-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I should like briefly to welcome what the Minister said when introducing the amendments. As she will be aware, the crucial role of the MPC--the work that it has carried out thus far in terms of ensuring a proper distribution of GP services--was an area that we discussed at length during the Committee and later stages of the Bill in this House and in another place. While we welcome what has been done so far, there remain concerns about the role of the MPC and whether we are in fact striking the right balance between a national overview and a local input into those areas.
<P>


<a name="column_1070"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1070</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-08_para0"></a>I heard what the Minister said about her feeling that it was the correct balance. However, I know that the MPC, and many others, are concerned that we have pitched the balance too far in putting the responsibility on health authorities in some of those areas. I therefore welcome what the noble Baroness said about looking very carefully into the matter before regulations are introduced to assess whether the balance is right and whether we should perhaps be strengthening the provisions of the Bill through regulations in regard to the role of the MPC. That is something which has been built up over the years and which we should not let go lightly. Certainly the area of the regulations, as regards what the input of the MPC would be when permanent versions of the pilot schemes come into force, is something that we would want to consider very closely in government. However, given the procedural situation that we are in, I believe that we have to say that, thus far, we welcome what has been done. However, we would welcome the opportunity to look more closely at the areas where we believe there is still scope for further action when it comes to regulation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-08_para1"></a>As regards the issue of local consultation, we would also have to consider an area where the BMA has signified that it is still unhappy; namely, on consultation with local medical committees; indeed, I believe that the BDA has the same anxiety regarding local dental organisations. Some of us feel that the actual nature of the involvement of those working in pilot schemes and on local representative committees is not as strong as it ought to be and that it does not necessarily provide enough robust structures for ensuring that local professional views are fully taken into account at all stages.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-08_para2"></a>Perhaps the Minister could tell the House how she foresees involving those GPs who are working in pilot schemes in the statutory and non-statutory consultation process with local representative committees, which I know the department has said that it is anxious to continue. That is another area where I believe that the Bill has been improved during the course of its passage but where concerns still remain. While we do not have the procedural opportunities at this stage further to improve the Bill, I believe that we should put down markers that these are areas where, had we perhaps had more time and opportunity, we would have wished to go further.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend the Minister will not be surprised to know that I am pleased to see both this amendment and those associated with it. More than once during the earlier stages of the Bill I raised the concern of the BMA that the MPCs were apparently being ignored. Clearly that has been sorted out and now I welcome the wording which will be inserted in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-08_para3"></a>Of course, I drew attention to the fact that the MPC does not extend to Scotland and therefore the Scottish Medical Practices Committee is also to be included in the new section to be inserted in the Bill. I believe that <P>


<a name="column_1071"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1071</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>meets the main objectives which were raised and that it should help to get an optimum distribution of medical practitioners over the country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-08_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Robson of Kiddington: </B>   My Lords, I too welcome the improvement that have been made to the Bill, although in my view it is not quite enough. Together with the noble Baroness, I look forward to seeing the regulations that are due to be introduced whereupon we may be able to make alternative arrangements. There is an enormous difference between the MPC having the right of approval of pilot schemes and, under the new amendment, the right only to consultation. It is not the same thing. Consultation sometimes can be a negative process. For instance, one can ask someone, "You are going to be killed; which way would you like us to do it"? That is sometimes what consultation means. I want to be certain that this Bill will ensure that the MPC has a real input into the distribution of general practitioners over the country. It has done a good job in the past and I believe that the regulations must enable it to continue to do so.

<A NAME="70320-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy is right to say that we now have a different approach with these pilot schemes. There is much more flexibility. We believe that the flexibility which the Bill provides will allow different ways of delivering services to be tested.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-08_para4"></a>During various debates your Lordships have referred to the salaried employment of doctors or, in some cases, different roles for different healthcare professionals. That is an important point with regard to the MPC and the powers that it has had. It cannot consider in great depth schemes that involve other health professionals. We know that primary care is about team work. Therefore it is important that the whole team is taken into consideration. We believe there is a call for a different approach to workforce planning. That is why the Secretary of State intends to use a range of expertise which will of course include the MPC but also the resource allocation group because we believe that will ensure an equitable distribution of human and financial resources. We have listened to the concerns of the MPC and of your Lordships. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, has said, we believe that the balance is about right.

<P>
<A NAME="70320-08_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I, too, welcome this amendment and congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Robson, on succeeding in having it accepted. I believe it was the only amendment from this side of the House during the passage of the Bill which has succeeded in reaching this stage of the proceedings. Without wishing in any way to diminish that success as regards the timing of evaluation, I should add that we remain concerned that the nature of the evaluation is not made more specific on the face of the Bill. As noble Lords will remember, at many stages during the passage of the Bill we asked how the pilot schemes were to be evaluated. This amendment has made specific the time period over which they will be evaluated. However, we remain concerned that simply to rely on the evaluation--however, the word "evaluation" is not used--or the review of the Secretary of State of what may be disparate types of schemes undertaken in different parts of the country without any central criteria for judging them against one another may cause great problems in deciding whether one has been more effective in improving services.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-08_para11"></a>I remember from the context of the discussions which we had at earlier stages of the Bill that noble Lords on all sides of the House agreed that there would be considerable difficulty in establishing any formal matrix, as it were, of national criteria by which these pilot schemes could be judged by the Secretary of State, or whoever undertook that task. Nevertheless, there is an issue to which we shall certainly wish to return at a later stage if we have the opportunity to put this Bill into force; namely, considering the ways of integrating <P>


<a name="column_1073"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1073</B></P>

<P>
<A NAME="70320-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I wish to pick up some of the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Jay. I understand her feelings about the one amendment that has been passed in your Lordships' House. However, I would not want the noble Baroness to think that all her hard work and that of her colleagues on the Benches opposite has not made an impact in another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-09_para0"></a>We take the issue of evaluation seriously. However, as the noble Baroness has said on the Floor of the House it is hard to work out the details. Indeed, we felt it was not appropriate to put that on the face of the Bill. As your Lordships will know, we have set a high priority on working with those in the National Health Service who provide the services.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-09_para1"></a>In the intervening period since your Lordships had the Second Reading of this Bill we have set up national consultative groups. They have a wide-ranging membership which guarantees their representative nature. They are looking at local criteria. They are looking to see the principles which need to be established. When the initial pilot schemes are set up, they will set out detailed requirements for evaluation. They will cover the principles of the wider impact that the pilots may have on local services. That is the important point. They will need to ensure that there is improvement in quality; that there is a wide range and accessibility of services; and that value for money is provided by the pilot. Those will be the principles but clearly every scheme will need to have its much more detailed criteria against which it can be measured.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-09_para2"></a>I am aware that I did not reply to the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, on LMCs. We consider that they also have an important role to play in terms of evaluation and consultation. In the new developments health authorities will need to seek their views on the impact of pilots and on existing arrangements before the piloting and during evaluation stages. We very much value LMCs but we felt that it was time for a change in that there will not be a statutory duty for LMCs to be funded specifically relating to contracts. However, we still think that they will have an important part to play. It will be up to GPs to decide whether they want to use the LMCs or seek an alternative in terms of the full consultation necessary.

At Second Reading in another place cross-party concerns were raised about the limitations in the Medical Act 1983 which prevented pre-registration house officers taking placements in general practice except in health centres. The Government responded to those concerns through Amendments Nos. 54 and 106.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-09_para10"></a>These amendments are designed to enable more young doctors in their final year of basic training--the pre-registration house officer year--to undertake part of that training in general practice.

Our proposals are also fully supported by the profession.

We have all been concerned with the issues of recruitment and retention in general practice. It is wise to allow those pre-registration house officers to have a taster of general practice. It is to be hoped that they will be encouraged to spend at least a part of their career in that branch of the service. The combination of the training opportunities, together with the possibilities of salaried service--we hope that the pilot schemes will give an opportunity for more flexibility at various stages of people's careers than general practice has allowed for in the past--is <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "70320-09_para15"></a>Amendments Nos. 13 to 16 clarify who may apply to become a health service body for the purpose of piloting. The provisions of Clause 14, to which the amendments relate, will of course be available only to members of the NHS family. Individual GPs or dentists can already apply to become health service bodies under the Bill. These amendments will enable applications to be made by various groupings from within the NHS family--for example, partnerships of GPs--and ensure that such groupings can comprise a single health service body. The amendments also ensure that each time the membership of a health service body changes after it has been granted health service body status (for example, where one partner in a partnership retires) it does not have to re-apply for such status. The provision fits in well with the flexibilities which the Bill aims to achieve.

<A NAME = "70320-10_para8"></a>These amendments make minor drafting amendments which help clarify the text of the Bill and repeals. For example, they extend provision enabling the right to choose a medical and dental practitioner to be exercised on behalf of certain individuals by others. This can be used when parents choose practitioners for their children; they also ensure that the powers of the NHS Tribunal in Schedule 1 are brought into line with existing legislation; and they put it beyond doubt that the Secretary of State's direction-making power may be exercised as flexibly as his regulation-making powers.

<P>
<A NAME="70320-11_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in the new clause inserted by Amendment No. 46. This takes account of development in the role of ophthalmic opticians, who I know prefer to be known as optometrists. Thirty years ago they were primarily concerned with the testing of sight and correction of refraction errors through the prescription of glasses. Now, in addition, they undertake a clinical examination of the eye for signs of common eye diseases.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-11_para28"></a>The General Optical Council's present rule requires that, otherwise than in an emergency, the optometrist should refer the patient to a registered medical practitioner. In practice, by local agreement with GPs and hospital ophthalmologists, they use discretion. For example, most elderly people acquire opacities in their lenses, but only a few progress to cataracts. Hence, an optometrist might advise a patient to attend annually for a sight test in the knowledge that he could still refer the patient in time for successful treatment if the opacity started to thicken.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-11_para29"></a>That is accepted good practice but, under the present rules, could leave the optometrist exposed to sanction under the investigative and disciplinary procedures which the GOC is obliged to follow. That would clearly be unreasonable.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-11_para30"></a>The new clause inserted by this amendment would enable the General Optical Council to submit a new rule for consideration by the Privy Council which would give the GOC virtually full discretion in prescribing when an optometrist should refer a patient with a disease or injury of the eye to a registered medical practitioner. I commend the new clause to the House.

Amendments Nos. 50 to 53 were tabled in response to concerns expressed by the profession and have the support of the BMA. They make clear that health authorities will nominate doctors to fill sole practitioner vacancies, and will approve doctors to fill partnership vacancies. This reflects the policy, to be enshrined in regulations, that candidates for appointment to GP partnerships should be selected by the practice. I hope that your Lordships will support the amendments. I commend them to the House.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "70320-15_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: It is not my intention to speak on most of the amendments in my name. However, this is so simple and so straightforward an amendment that I thought I should take the opportunity to present it to the Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-15_para17"></a>The clause that it seeks to amend is the clause that provides for the inspection of private dwelling-houses by an inspector where he or she has cause to believe that trade or businesses are being carried out. It goes on in subsection (6) to define:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For the purposes of this section--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) a benefit claimant is a person who has claimed housing benefit or council tax benefit; and </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(b) a benefit recipient is a person to whom housing benefit or council tax benefit has been paid". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
It does not define how long one has been a claimant. It is possible, I suppose, to have been a claimant some years ago and still qualify for inspection under the terms of this clause. The intention of Amendments Nos. 75 and 76 is to provide that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(a) a benefit claimant is a person who has claimed housing benefit or council tax benefit within the preceding 3 years; and </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-15_para18"></a>It seems to us necessary to define precisely the length of period required to qualify as a benefit claimant under this clause of the Bill. Is the position "once a claimant, always a claimant", as was put to me by one of the organisations that wrote to me about the clause? It seems to me that we must have some sort of qualification, otherwise there is a lack of clarity about what a benefit claimant is and whether that person continues indefinitely to be subject to the inspections provided for in this clause. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-15_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Without more ado, I support this amendment. The Minister may not wish to accept it at this stage of proceedings, but would he consider incorporating the point in guidance?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-15_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I shall certainly bear in mind the point that the noble Earl has made, but I hope that, once I have explained Clause 12 and put on record how we see it operating, both the noble Baroness and the noble Earl will feel that that will be sufficient.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-15_para19"></a>Clause 12 provides for an authority administering housing benefit or council tax benefit to appoint inspectors who may enter business premises to make inquiries about any person believed to be a benefit claimant or recipient. This measure is needed because at present local authority investigators have no more power to make investigations than any ordinary citizen. Investigations can be halted by the refusal of a landlord or an employer to co-operate in providing details of their tenants or employees. This clause will provide those appointed as inspectors with the powers that they need to investigate fraud thoroughly.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-15_para20"></a>The powers are broadly comparable with those already available to Department of Social Security staff. Local authority inspectors will have the right to enter a place of business, inspect records, copy records and interview anyone found there. The clause will allow an inspector to seek information or documents from or about anyone who has claimed or received housing benefit or council tax benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-15_para21"></a>The effect of the noble Baroness's amendments would be to limit this provision by allowing details to be sought in relation only to persons who had claimed or received those benefits within the previous three years. It may be argued--and indeed that is what the noble Baroness has done--that there should be a time limit beyond which someone suspected of fraud should be safe from investigation. I believe that that ignores the different types of benefit fraud with which investigators may need to deal. For example, in the case of an individual who years ago obtained small sums by fraud--perhaps by failing to report an increase in wages--it is extremely unlikely that authorities would go back several years with their inquiries.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-15_para22"></a>But what about the large scale fraudster operating on an extensive scale, the crooked landlord whose frauds extend over a large number of properties and who has been operating for years? It may be that suspicion relating to a particular claim only surfaces some considerable time after the event. Possibly in the course <P>


<a name="column_1094"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1094</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of investigating one fraud, evidence may come to light of other frauds, maybe of a whole series of frauds, which occurred more than three years previously. There is nothing in law to prevent authorities taking such cases to court. I do not think that we would want to restrict the freedom of local authorities and inspectors to investigate such serious cases and allow those involved to escape the consequences of their actions solely because of an arbitrary time limit restricting the ability to gather the necessary evidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-15_para23"></a>In the case of big-time fraudsters--possibly landlords, managing agents, collusive employers or even individual claimants who are organised or professional criminals--local authorities may well need to go back as far as is necessary to collect sufficient evidence to ensure that the large-scale cheats do not escape the consequences of their crimes.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-15_para24"></a>I hope that, in the light of that explanation of how we believe the clause will operate when looking back a long time and of why I believe it is needed for the serious cases I referred to--which I know all Members of the Committee treat very seriously indeed--the noble Baroness will be able to withdraw her amendments.

<A NAME="70320-16_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   I thank the Minister very much for that explanation. It is quite true that we on this side of the Chamber--and indeed everybody in the Chamber--are very much against protection for crooked landlords. We have done our best during discussion of this Bill to ensure that provisions in relation to that sort of fraud are strengthened rather than weakened and we would not want to do anything that protected such people.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para0"></a>I am also glad of the Minister's assurance, given earlier in his statement, in regard to what one might call the poorer claimant who may have made a mistake many years ago. The Minister does not think that local authorities would go back that far in order to check on that kind of suspected fraud. It is that kind of individual that we most wanted to protect.

Page 25, line 5, at beginning insert ("Where there is evidence to raise a question with a view to a review of entitlement under subsections (2) and (5) above,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para17"></a>The noble Baroness said: I beg leave to move Amendment No. 95 and to speak to Amendments Nos. 96 and 97. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that reviews can only be initiated where the Secretary of State has adequate reasons to question the validity of continuing claims for attendance allowance, disability living allowance and disability working allowance.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para18"></a>At the present time, there are two ways in which a review can be initiated: either by the claimant on the decision of the adjudication officer or by the adjudication officer where there has been ignorance of a material fact, a mistake or a change of circumstance.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para19"></a>There is, however, some confusion--and it is partly because I seek clarification that I move this amendment--on how broadly a Secretary of State, through the adjudication officer, can go in initiating a review. This clause clarifies that position, but the opportunity also seems to have been taken to give the Secretary of State substantial new powers to obtain information prior to instigating review.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para20"></a>Amendment No. 95 would ensure that such investigations are only carried out where there is some evidence which puts the claimant's entitlement in doubt, such as change of circumstance or other reason for review already stated in subsections (2) and (5). It would prevent the Benefits Agency from carrying out random fraud visits to vulnerable people without good reason.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para21"></a>Amendment No. 96 makes it explicit that there would have to be initial information available which throws doubt on the continued validity of the claim. Subsection <P>


<a name="column_1096"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1096</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>(2) is deleted as the Benefits Agency already has the power to review a life award of DLA and AA, either because the person requests it or because the adjudication officer has information that the entitlement should not continue. Perhaps the Minister can indicate why that needs to be changed and what information he believes would be necessary to prompt a review.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para22"></a>I am grateful to both the RNIB and the Disability Alliance for providing me with evidence in support of the amendments. For instance, the RNIB evidence draws on work undertaken for its report, Seeing it our way, carried out to assess the attitudes of fully sighted people on visual impairment. The report reveals that there is substantial public ignorance about visual impairment and the need for aids such as a dog or a white stick. One must not assume that a lack of a visual sign of blindness means that blind and partially sighted people do not need assistance. Given that ignorance, it is possible for someone to ring the fraud hotline and initiate a review because they falsely believe that a visually impaired person is a bogus claimer because he does not have a guide dog.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para23"></a>As we have constantly said, there must be initiatives to tackle fraud, but we must be concerned that spurious allegations do not lead to unwarranted information-gathering exercises, causing considerable worry and distress to claimants whose claims are completely legitimate. These amendments would at least secure that the Secretary of State would have reasonable grounds to doubt the continued validity of the claims before seeking additional information.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para24"></a>In the Committee stage in the other place the Minister stated that disability is not a fraud issue; rather that this Bill is a convenient vehicle to clarify existing legislation. If that is the case one must ask why a Bill aimed at tackling fraud includes two clauses on disability benefits.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para25"></a>It can only relate to a reply given on 12th February to a parliamentary Answer which seems to suggest that, following a review into DLA, the Government perceive a link between claims for DLA and fraud based on an assumed overspend of around &#163;250 million annually. Can the Minister say how he relates that to the Benefits Agency having met its 1995-96 accuracy targets of 96 per cent. for DLA?
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para26"></a>I should like an assurance from the Minister that the whole text of the report on DLA and incorrectness is made available and that no decisions are taken on tackling that assumed incorrectness without full consultation with disability organisations. If the review focused on the lower and higher rate mobility components of DLA and the DLA and the "ability to walk", as we understand was the case, can the Minister deny the rumours about changes in interpreting "ability to walk" and give an assurance that no changes are planned which may diminish the right of blind and partially-sighted people to get the lower rate mobility component of DLA.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para27"></a>In conclusion, the Bill as it stands gives wide power to the Secretary of State to gather information which may be maliciously or spuriously activated and result in intrusive and unnecessary information gathering. These <P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Perhaps I may respond to the noble Baroness and explain why this clause is included in the Bill and the reasons behind it. That may perhaps allay her worries.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para28"></a>Clause 17 is concerned with the Secretary of State's ability to investigate the correctness of existing awards of attendance allowance and disability living allowance and, if appropriate, to refer cases to an adjudication officer for review. The investigation concerns simply the power to obtain evidence. It carries no other implications. Clause 17 is not intended to confer a new power but to clarify an existing one.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para29"></a>It is right and proper that, in order to safeguard the public purse, the Secretary of State may take action to satisfy himself that benefit is being paid to an individual correctly. In DLA and AA, as in most others benefits, decisions and reviews of decisions are made by adjudication officers. Uniquely in the DLA and AA, the adjudication officer cannot initiate a review of the decision off his own bat but must rely on an application for a review being put to him. That position came about as a result of introducing a specific provision allowing the claimant to apply for review. That was intended to be helpful to the claimant, and indeed it is. However, it has had the unforeseen side effect of opening to question the Secretary of State's ability to apply for a review because it is not so specified.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para30"></a>The question concerning the Secretary of State's power to apply for a review has been posed by Mr. Mark Rowland, now Commissioner Rowland, in his book Medical and Disability Appeal Tribunals: the Legislation. It was always intended that the Secretary of State would apply for a review, and the Government have no doubt that the Secretary of State does have those powers. That necessarily includes the ability to investigate cases in order to establish whether a review is necessary, and, if so, why.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para31"></a>Where a question arises about a specific case, whether as a result of information received from a claimant or from a third party, obviously the Secretary of State will want to investigate. That is right and proper. Where a question arises in relation to a specific type of case--for example, as a result of management checks on individual cases or a survey such as the recently published benefit review of DLA--the Secretary of State needs to investigate. To do that he also needs to establish whether the benefit as a whole is being administered properly and, indeed, to identify those areas in which it is weak. That is a normal activity in benefit administration. It is necessary and right and within the Secretary of State's power.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para32"></a>The Secretary of State has a duty to taxpayers and to claimants to ensure that the benefit, which is worth &#163;6.25 billion this year, is going to those who are entitled to it. The benefit review I mentioned, which has been published, identified 27 per cent. of current awards as <P>


<a name="column_1098"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1098</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>being incorrect. The noble Baroness rightly points out that that is considerably above the target that we like to aim for in the Benefits Agency. Obviously, therefore, we are concerned about that situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para33"></a>The 27 per cent. of current awards which are incorrect includes some 10 per cent. of claimants who are being underpaid. That seems to arise largely as a result of unreported change. The incorrectness therefore is not just through bad calculations on the part of the Benefits Agency; it is also through unreported change of one kind or another. The important point is that, largely due to unreported change, something like 10 per cent. of claimants were being underpaid.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para34"></a>Amendment No. 95 would restrict the Secretary of State's ability to carry out investigations that would provide him with information about the correct level of benefit. As I outlined, it is unacceptable for that reason. There has been speculation that the department proposes wholesale investigations throughout the entire DLA caseload. The noble Baroness or those advising her seemed to fear that. I can assure her that that is not the intention. Our interest is in ensuring that the awards in payment are correct, which includes increasing them where appropriate, as well as reducing them.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para35"></a>Amendment No. 97 would remove Clause 17(2), which makes it explicit that the Secretary of State's power to investigate and apply for review includes cases where AA or DLA have not been awarded for a fixed period. Let me first make plain what the term "life award" refers to. It relates to awards in which it is expected that the person's condition will remain with him and will not improve throughout the remainder of his life, so removing the need for unnecessary periodic review. It was never intended to mean that such awards were immune from review. Indeed, review is provided for in legislation. For the care component of DLA, Section 72 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 provides that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a person shall be entitled to the care component of a disability living allowance for any period throughout which he is so severely disabled physically or mentally that", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
and so forth. The legislation then lists the care needs which would entitle him to each of the three rates of the care component. Similarly, in Section 73, the legislation again provides that a person shall be entitled to the mobility component for any period throughout which he meets one of the list of qualifying conditions. The intention is plain. Regardless of the length of the initial award, entitlement exists only as long as the qualifying conditions relating to specified care and mobility needs are met.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para36"></a>The provisions in Section 32(4) of the Social Security Administration Act which relate to the circumstances in which a component awarded for life may be reviewed were designed to remove the need for a review when both components had been awarded but only one was a life award, the other being for a fixed period. That protection for the component awarded for life is unaffected by the amendment, which is itself aimed only at putting the Secretary of State's existing power to apply for review beyond doubt in this particular circumstance as in others.
<P>


<a name="column_1099"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1099</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para37"></a>The amendment before us would prevent the Secretary of State from investigating these awards when it was appropriate to do so, but it would also prevent clarification of the law so far as those awards are concerned. As I think I indicated, we have no intention of going on some wholesale review of DLA. We had always believed, until Commissioner Rowland's book appeared, that the Secretary of State had the power to initiate a review and that it was not just a claimant who had the power to initiate a review.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-16_para38"></a>I appreciate that these allowances go to people who are very often severely disabled and very much in need of help. I very much appreciate that a clause like this at least demands some explanation. I hope I have explained what we are doing. I hope the noble Baroness accepts that what we are doing is entirely above board and does not in any way represent an attack on DLA or the people who receive it.

<A NAME="70320-17_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gould of Potternewton: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply and for his explanation of the power of the Secretary of State and of the incorrectness of levels of benefit. I thank him for his assurance that there will not be a wholesale review of DLA. I am not saying that I am absolutely convinced about the motivation behind introducing the clause. I still believe that adjudication officers can instigate reviews in particular circumstances. Nor am I completely reassured that there are adequate safeguards against these vague powers being abused at a later stage. Unless there are assurances on the face of the Bill a future Secretary of State might interpret them very differently. However, I would sincerely hope not. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

I thank the officials who have helped me with the Bill and who have worked so busily behind the scenes. I thank the noble Baronesses, Lady Gould of Potternewton and Lady Turner of Camden, and the noble Lords, Lord Carter and Lord Whitty, for their contributions to our debates. I thank my noble friends who have supported me in the Division Lobby when it has come to it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-17_para20"></a>I wish to look wider than the Bill to the two-and-a-half years when I have answered social security questions at this Dispatch Box. I thank my noble friend Lord Lucas for his excellent support as my Whip. There have been many occasions, as hour succeeded hour in debate, during which I am sure he must have realised that his official title of Lord in Waiting had more than one interpretation. Not only has he done a good job in looking after me, but I am sure he has impressed us all at the Dispatch Box in dealing with the very difficult issues which have fallen to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the past year or so.

His story of the two men taking the barrel of beer to the races to sell it and drinking it themselves on the way, passing the same threepenny bit between them for payment, as an example of the internal market, will always be with me. In some ways he reminds me of the ancestor of my noble friend the Duke of Montrose, whose military campaigns--the noble Earl is perhaps more of an expert on this subject than I am, so I am being cautious--involved him taking his army on long, seemingly impossible marches, often deep into the night--that will not surprise your Lordships--back and forward across the mountains and glens of Scotland, catching the then Earl of Argyll, the ancestor of my noble friend the Duke of Argyll (Campbell of Argyll), unawares on a number of occasions. I believe that Mackay of Ardbrecknish, also of Argyll, has managed a bit better than the ancestor of my noble friend the Duke of Argyll in not being caught unawares quite so often. I shall perhaps admit at this stage that my patience has been tried just a little by the noble Earl; but more often than not I have enjoyed crossing verbal swords with him and I thank him for his unfailing courtesy and good humour.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-17_para22"></a>One of my problems is that I have been able to use only my left hand in order to fend off the noble Earl, keeping my right hand to fend off the noble Baroness, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Lady Hollis of Heigham. I am very sorry that she cannot be here today. I fully understand why she cannot be here and I know that she, too, regrets that. We have debated against each other on six social security Bills and on parts of two others; on many pieces of secondary legislation and on innumerable Questions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-17_para23"></a>The noble Baroness has carried a formidable workload on the Front Bench opposite--perhaps the largest workload of anybody on that Front Bench. She has always been well briefed and well prepared. She has made good use of her distinctive debating style, her formidable intellect and her feminine charms to try to persuade your Lordships, especially those on the Cross-Benches and some of my noble friends, to unseat me. I believe that I can claim that we have been the lead players in some of the high drama debates of this Parliament. Indeed, on one or two of these occasions she has managed to weave her spell to such good effect that my noble friend the Captain of the Gentlemen of Arms has not carried the result of the Division to the Lord Chairman or to my noble and learned friend and fellow clansman, the Lord Chancellor. These battles and their results are now in the bound editions of Hansard. Your Lordships may be looking at the three of us and wondering, with Shakespeare and "Macbeth", when the three witches say,

My noble friend Lady Hollis has asked me to apologise to the House and to the Minister for her absence. She has been unavoidably called away on a temporary family problem. Lady Hollis and Lord Carter were responsible for presenting to your Lordships' House many amendments to improve the Bill, including amendments to provide adequate safeguards for data protection and that highly sensitive personal information is controlled; to give greater powers to local authorities to tackle organised landlord fraud and for the Bill to be a vehicle for benefit entitlement and not just for the elimination of fraud.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-17_para27"></a>I know that my noble friend Lady Hollis would also wish me to thank on her behalf her colleagues on the Labour Benches, my noble friends Lord Carter, Lady Turner of Camden and Lord Whitty, who made notable contributions to this Bill.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-17_para28"></a>We on this side of the House welcome the overall thrust of this Bill to reduce the level of benefit fraud. Perhaps I may paraphrase the words of my noble friend Lady Hollis of Heigham at Second Reading. She said that with this Bill the Government have finally accepted the argument that we have consistently put to them, that there is an unacceptably high level of error and fraud of benefit payments. As a consequence, in principle we welcome one of the main planks of the Bill in respect of data matching.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-17_para29"></a>However, the Bill as it stands does not strike the necessary balance between the rights of the individual and the collection of information to check fraud. We were heartened, however, by the undertaking given by the Minister that the Department of Social Security will publish a code of practice on data matching and that data matching exercises under the new powers in the relevant clauses of the Bill will not be conducted until the code has been published. I am personally grateful to the Minister for his sympathetic response on the question of appointees and the procedure by which they are appointed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-17_para30"></a>We do appreciate the good humour, which we have heard again today, and the courtesy and honesty with which the Minister has responded to the many amendments. I know that my noble friend Lady Hollis of Heigham will appreciate very much his kind words when she reads them in Hansard tomorrow. I am sure that she will read them with great pleasure. We are grateful, too, for the work of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. We are also grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Russell, for his erudite and, at times, extremely amusing contributions to the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-17_para31"></a>We express our thanks to the team of advisers for their able assistance, which has been invaluable to us. In particular, we should like to thank representatives of the ALG, the ADC/AMA, the head of Lambeth's anti-fraud unit and the head of benefits at Westminster, including representatives of the offices of John Denham and Harry Cohen, Members in another place, for all their help with the amendments. We also thank the many organisations which have helped to provide briefings to us. That has been invaluable. Not least, we would like to thank our researcher, Robert McGeachy, who has always been there to give us support, both administratively and with background research and information.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-17_para32"></a>In conclusion, there are a number of aspects of the Bill about which we still have reservations, but we believe that the assurances that we have received from the Minister will be honoured.

Whatever may happen in the next Parliament and whenever it may be that we three meet again, I will inevitably think of the Table over there as the cauldron. It is most appropriately provided with water for which I have been most grateful on many occasions. Both the Minister and I have very much enjoyed our numerous engagements. At times they have been inconclusive. I always think of speaking from this side of the House as being a little like bowling. I found the Minister's defence impregnable. <P>


<a name="column_1103"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1103</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Whatever I have come up with, the Minister's bat always seems to be there. Thinking of new ways of getting round it has been a wonderful challenge. But his defence! Well, I do not see how to get round it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-18_para0"></a>He knows the story of my dentist who used to bowl to his clansman, the Australian "Slasher" Mackay. He asked him whether there was any way of getting him out. He thought for a long time and replied, "Hand grenades". I do not propose to employ them on the Minister because I have found that not only have we developed that relationship of trust, which is essential for doing any business across the Chamber, but we have also come to look on each other with a good deal of warmth. I very much enjoyed our exchanges and our conversations inside the Chamber and out. He is a person with whom any day I am happy to do business.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-18_para1"></a>I am also extremely sorry that the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, is unable to be here today. I offer my sympathy for the reasons why she is not able to be here. I very much enjoyed working side by side with her--speed at one end and spin at the other. It is an ideal bowling combination. I am sure that the two of us have been far more successful than either of us could ever have hoped to be alone. I believe that the contrast of styles has been a very great asset. I have very much enjoyed working not only with the fire and the force with which her arguments are put forward, but also with the weight of academic knowledge and intelligence which is behind them. I have been proud to work beside her.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-18_para2"></a>I too should like to offer thanks to all those who have helped us with this work; to the team behind me in our Whips' Office who have been rushed off their feet with amendments many times; to organisations which have advised us and to all those in the Chamber on both sides of the House and in all quarters of the House, who have enlivened the debates in which we have taken part.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-18_para3"></a>Now a brief word about this Bill: it is not the Crime (Sentences) Bill. This is a Bill which has general agreement as to its object. We all support what it is trying to do. We all believe that this Bill should become law. My concern about it has been with misdemeanours and not with felonies.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-18_para4"></a>As I see it, this is a "tea-break Bill", rather like the old "tea-break car" which is what an unlucky purchaser occasionally acquired. The Bill has been prepared in considerable haste. In my view, it could have done with rather more scrutiny than it has yet received. We all understand about the pressure caused by the unexpectedly early prorogation. Inevitably, there are deals in such circumstances. It takes two to make a deal: there must be give and take. On this Bill, I believe that the Opposition have sold themselves a little cheap in the deal that they have made.

So, the Opposition might be wise, if they are in charge of the Bill in future, to make it their fairly urgent business in the next Parliament while the major Bills are being prepared to tidy up this Bill to bring it into line with the European Convention and to ensure that it is legal. I am sorry that we have not done that--amendments to achieve it could have been offered.

<A NAME = "70320-18_para6"></a>The Bill may risk doing damage to people who have been guilty of innocent misrepresentation.

<P>
<A NAME="70320-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 7 to Part III of the Bill. I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 8 to 68 and 108 to 120. These amendments are of more substance.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-18_para22"></a>I do not believe that there is any dispute about the need for the police and Customs to use intrusive surveillance techniques against serious and organised criminals. These techniques must be available to the police and Customs if they are to gain the vital intelligence necessary to disrupt and bring to book our most dangerous criminals.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-18_para23"></a>A great deal has been said about the provisions of Part III of the Bill. Debate in this House confirmed the extent of the concerns evident at the Government's original proposals for chief officer authorisation and independent oversight by a surveillance commissioner. I have to say that some of the concerns were unfounded and I cannot agree with them. But the will of this House was made very apparent with the passing of contradictory amendments. We have therefore taken Part III away and applied detailed consideration to the most effective way of returning the Bill to a workable condition. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced a number of modifications to Part III in advance of Second Reading in another place. These modifications have been discussed and approved. Part III has therefore been effectively rewritten. But I hope these modifications will serve to illustrate to this House our commitment to provide further safeguards to meet the concerns of this House, while ensuring a system which enables the police and Customs to be able to continue to get the benefit of these techniques so necessary to the fight against organised crime into the next millennium.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-18_para24"></a>We could not accept the amendment approved in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers. This would have required all intrusive surveillance to have the prior authorisation of a circuit judge. We could not accept that judges can properly be expected to make these decisions. But there are other difficulties. Accountability would be reduced: judges cannot be called to account in the same way as chief officers. Furthermore, the absence of provisions for urgent cases would seriously inhibit the fight against serious crime. It could even endanger life, and I think particularly of hostage situations in which an immediate response can be vital.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-18_para25"></a>The amendment approved by this House in the name of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, does not present quite the same difficulties. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has responded positively in another place by modifying this amendment to produce a system of authorisation which builds upon existing accountability arrangements, leaves operational decisions to those best qualified to take them and provides for effective independent scrutiny.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-18_para26"></a>Amendment No. 36 builds upon the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, and requires that the prior approval of a commissioner be obtained before an operation begins in the most sensitive categories of case. These circumstances will include cases in which there are reasonable grounds for thinking that the operation authorised under Part III could involve intrusion into dwellings, offices or hotel bedrooms or could affect legal privilege, confidential personal information (including spiritual counselling and medical consultations) and confidential journalistic material. The Government have added definitions of legal privilege and the other prescribed categories for the purposes of Part III in Amendments Nos. 37, 38 and 39. These definitions are based on those which exist under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-18_para27"></a>Prior approval will not be necessary in urgent cases, but the commissioner would have to be notified as soon as reasonably practicable after the authorisation had been given. He will able to quash the authorisation if he is not satisfied with the reasons given for considering the case one of urgency.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-18_para28"></a>Government amendments approved in another place also provide for authorising officers and complainants to appeal to the Chief Commissioner against decisions taken by commissioners. On reflection, we have taken the view that there should be avenues of appeal for authorising officers or complainants to challenge what they consider to be unreasonable decisions taken by commissioners. Amendments Nos. 48, 49 and 50 provide the necessary mechanism for the making and consideration of these appeals which represent a further significant safeguard.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-18_para29"></a>The addition of this appeals mechanism is one of the considerations which requires a clear demarcation to be drawn between the responsibilities of the chief and the other commissioners appointed for the purposes of Part III. Amendments to Clause 98 therefore clarify that the commissioner shall keep under review the performance of functions under Part III. This is a crucial point. The Chief Commissioner will not be responsible for day-to-day approval of authorisations or investigation of complaints. These are functions of the commissioners.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-18_para30"></a>The Government have responded positively in another place to the concerns raised in this House. What has resulted is an effective system for the authorisation of these operations by those best qualified to make these operational decisions, with the addition of a number of effective safeguards. I commend these amendments to this House.

<P>
<A NAME="70320-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, we are all grateful to the Minister for the clarity with which she has introduced these complex amendments. As the House will know, they occupied a great deal of time when the Bill was before this House and a considerable amount of time when the Bill was considered in the Commons, and particularly when it was in Committee there.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-19_para0"></a>The Minister was generous enough to acknowledge that it had been necessary to build upon rather than reverse the amendments in my name that had been carried by the House. She is right to point out the complexity of the issues. That is apparent from the complexity of the amendments that have been passed by the Commons. Indeed, when I compare the complexity of these amendments with the relevant simplicity of my own I acknowledge that the drafting of legislation from scratch is not one of my strengths.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-19_para1"></a>There are still areas in which we can take exception to what is being done. Referring to the important Amendment No. 36, I regret that the restriction of the location of intrusive surveillance is as great as it is. I do not believe that it makes very good sense to include in judicial authorisation office premises without including other places of work. Our intention was to have a wider remit for judicial authorisation. I do not believe that the restriction relating to office premises will work very well.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-19_para2"></a>I acknowledge that the amendments now spell out in very much greater detail than we did the enormously important issues of legal privilege, confidential personal information and confidential journalistic information. These are important changes to the Bill that bring it into line with international legislation, which I am still convinced the original Bill would not have achieved. I am sorry that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, who played such a distinguished part in the deliberations of these amendments, is not in his place. I believe that we should all pay tribute to him for his persistence, clarity and grasp of the fundamental principles of civil liberty which infused his contribution. I believe--I hope he agrees--that they have resulted in a satisfactory outcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-19_para3"></a>I turn to the amendments dealing with complaints and appeals. It is necessary that there should be an opportunity for appeals by authorising officers, and they are provided for in Amendments Nos. 48 and 49. I welcome the fact that Amendment No. 50, which introduces a new clause, allows for appeals by complainants on a much wider basis than the very limited judicial review procedures provided in the original Bill. At the time I believed that the least valid complaint about our amendments was that the commissioner who authorised surveillance in the first place would be in difficulty because he would also be responsible for review. I felt that that could be overcome by the provision of a body of commissioners. I tabled amendments comparable with those of the Government to ensure that there would be a body of commissioners, <P>


<a name="column_1108"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1108</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>thus avoiding a potential conflict of interest. By their amendments to Clauses 96 and 98 the Government have ensured that the separation of responsibility between initial authorisation and overall review is secured by distinguishing between the role of the commissioner and that of the Chief Commissioner. That seems to us to be a satisfactory outcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-19_para4"></a>All in all, without wanting to appear in any way triumphalist I believe that the concerns of the House, so overwhelmingly expressed on the vote on my amendments, as the Bill was originally before your Lordships have been fairly met by the Government. I thank them and congratulate them on producing a Bill which, in this respect, is a substantially better one than that originally put before us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   My Lords, on the eve of Prorogation we on these Benches would have most welcomed amendments that set aside Parts II and III, which we are now discussing, and Part V for further reflection and consultation in the knowledge that, when that had taken place, they could be brought back in a separate Bill before the end of the calendar year. That is not the case. We must therefore turn our minds to the amendments before us.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-19_para5"></a>I too welcome the acceptance by the Government of the principle of judicial authorisation. Although the Government have chosen to substitute the word "approval" for "authorisation", I do not mind such a cosmetic change (which I believe to be semantic) if it enables them to do what this House judges to be right. I welcome the changes that have been made. I am glad that the Government recognised the force of opinion in this House and, more importantly, that the force of opinion reflected what was right.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-19_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, referred to one matter of disagreement in terms of the amendments which were carried by this House: the role of the commissioners. I too welcome the change which I understand is embodied in some of the amendments that we are now discussing. But it remains to be seen whether the distinction between the Chief Commissioner and the remaining commissioners is sufficient to ensure that those who approve-- which I understand means "authorise"--electronic surveillance will not be those who review it. Time will tell. We welcome the amendment, but that is one matter that we will want to monitor.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-19_para7"></a>Equally, we shall want to watch very closely how Amendment No. 36 works. When the original amendment of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, was moved in this House I was concerned about whether the door was being left wide open for the emergence of provisions to enable the Police Service--I make no criticism--to decide to go ahead with electronic surveillance without turning to one of the commissioners or (as I would prefer) a High Court judge. If the amendment closes that gap, we should be delighted; but we shall want to watch very carefully how many of the authorisations go forward without judicial approval in the light of experience. We still believe that approval by a High Court judge is better. We regret that the proposals were not made in the original legislation. <P>


<a name="column_1109"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1109</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Having said that, we welcome the changes. I too am grateful to the noble Baroness for making the changes so specific and clear to the House this afternoon.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-19_spnew2"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Ripon: </B>   My Lords, I should like to speak to Amendment No. 38, to which the Minister has already spoken. The provision in the Commons amendment, which appears as subsection (2)(b) of the new clause, refers to spiritual counselling or assistance. This has given the Church of England serious cause for concern. I stress that it also affects other Christian churches and religions other than Christianity.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-19_para8"></a>As I understand it, agreement has been reached with the Secretary of State and the police authorities that surveillance under the Bill should not breach the seal of the confessional and that that would be reflected in the code of practice. However, the Church of England and representatives of the Free Churches have pointed out that very much the same considerations apply to other cases where a person is receiving spiritual counselling from a priest or minister, even though that does not amount to the sacrament of confession in the strict sense.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-19_para9"></a>Within the Church of England less use is made of the confessional than within the Roman Catholic Church and spiritual counselling is widely used. The same is true of the Free Churches. The Government were therefore asked to deal with cases of spiritual counselling in the code of practice along similar lines to the seal of the confessional in the narrow sense. We appreciate that the precise wording would need to be considered very carefully. We also appreciate that "spiritual counselling or assistance" is a very broad expression and that some cases which fall within it may qualify for a different degree of protection from surveillance than other cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-19_para10"></a>The Minister has already referred to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Under that Act, the police cannot require documentary material about spiritual counselling sessions to be handed over. With regard to the Bill, the Churches are deeply concerned about the possibility of spiritual counselling being subject to surveillance. What has been done in response to that concern, although it was not what the Churches asked for, is to include subsection(2)(b) in the Bill. That does not meet the Churches' concern because it merely requires surveillance which may yield information relating to spiritual counselling or assistance to be approved by a commissioner, unless the case is urgent. The commissioner cannot refuse approval just because the case involves spiritual counselling if the basic requirements for surveillance under the Bill are satisfied.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-19_para11"></a>We are concerned also about the drafting of the provision which has been lifted from a different context in other legislation and which we believe is not appropriate, as it stands, in the Bill. For instance, it refers to information relating to spiritual counselling and not what is actually said during the spiritual counselling session. However, our chief concern is that it could be argued that the provision in the amendment is a clear indication that surveillance affecting matters covered by spiritual counselling can take place under the Bill, <P>


<a name="column_1110"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1110</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and thus that a provision in the code of practice of the kind that we are seeking would be inconsistent with what is provided in the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-19_para12"></a>If that is the case, I have to express my opposition to subsection (2)(b). The assurance for which the Churches are looking is that the appearance in the amendment of that provision does not close off the option which we are seeking through the code of practice. I hope that the Minister will be able to give that assurance.

<A NAME="70320-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, I await my noble friend's reply to that penetrating criticism with interest. I hope that it is as reassuring as I expect. I should like to join in the thanks that have been expressed to my noble friend the Minister not just for her explanation of what is involved here but for the way in which the Government have cleverly arrived at a satisfactory solution to almost all the concerns that have been expressed. In particular, given that individual judges while serving are not the proper source of the authority which is needed for a commissioner, the combination of having them recruited from among those who have held high judicial authority and, if it is not possible to take the appointment completely out of politics, then to restrict the grounds for which dismissal may take place as narrowly as has been done in the Bill, is a welcome and satisfactory solution. The only improvement beyond that for which one could ask would be an extension of an appointment beyond three years. But I, for one, am satisfied with what has been done.

<P>
<A NAME="70320-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, first, I thank all noble Lords for the way in which they have accepted these changes. That was due in large part to the initiating work done by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, and my noble friend Lord Elton and my noble friend Lord Carr, who is not with us today, and others who spoke so forcefully in this House. Perhaps I may say to the right reverend Prelate that I thank the Church for giving me notice that this question was to be raised on the Floor of the House today. I am happy to confirm that Amendment No. 38 does not preclude fuller discussion of spiritual counselling in the code of practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-20_para0"></a>The provision is deliberately drawn widely and protects a range of different circumstances, so I would expect the ensuing discussions to include many examples that were given by my noble friend--of course at this stage without prejudice to the outcome of those discussions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-20_para1"></a>The draft code of practice refers already to a specific undertaking by the police and Customs not to mount operations which would affect the seal of confession. It may be that other particular forms of spiritual counselling need to be addressed in particular ways, but we do not need to discuss the code in detail this afternoon. It remains a draft. There will be an opportunity for full discussions with interested parties before a revised version is laid before Parliament. It will not come into force unless approved by both Houses.

<P>
<A NAME="70320-23_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 69. I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 70, 73, 74, 75, 80 and 81.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-23_para6"></a>These amendments replace the provisions for free checks for volunteers which were passed by noble Lords during consideration of this Bill in Committee and provide instead a statutory power which will allow the Secretary of State to exempt certain groups, such as volunteers, from paying any fee.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-23_para7"></a>During previous consideration of this Bill, both here and in another place, we have paid tribute to the enormous amount of good work that is done by volunteers in this country. I would like to do so again today. They selflessly give up their own time to help others and are a credit to their communities. This Government have a long-standing commitment to the voluntary sector which was encapsulated in the Make a Difference commitment. That commitment remains. Despite that commitment, the Government believe that the amendments passed by your Lordships' House for all checks to be provided free for all volunteers went too far.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-23_para8"></a>During discussion of this issue, both within Parliament and outside, there has been much difference of opinion about what free checks for volunteers would actually cost. Many noble Lords have themselves given examples of the high costs which voluntary organisations believe they, or their volunteers, would have to meet. If free checks were to be provided that money would need to be found.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-23_para9"></a>It is difficult to be precise, but available information suggests that between 8 million and 20 million people in this country act as volunteers. If we assume that checks were restricted to new volunteers, and that only those eligible for the higher level of checks--that is to say, enhanced criminal record certificates--were included, the minimum sum likely to be needed would be about &#163;10 million a year.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-23_para10"></a>Although we remain of the view that the provision of free checks for volunteers, or any other group, presents substantial difficulties, the Government recognise that there is a need to be flexible. We do not want entirely to rule out the prospect of free checks, should it prove possible to provide them to deserving groups at some point in the future. This is why we have amended the Bill so as to provide for a power which would allow certain groups, such as volunteers, to be exempted from paying fees for criminal record checks should it be possible at some time in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-23_para11"></a>I fully acknowledge that this is an important and sensitive issue, but I believe that the Government's approach is a sensible one. It balances our very real commitment to the voluntary sector with the realities of keeping down public expenditure.

<P>

<A NAME = "70320-23_para12"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Weatherill, felt particularly strongly and led the fray, as it were, on this issue. I have no doubt that he will wish to respond to the Government's power to extend the possibility of free checks to categories of volunteers. I beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-23_para13"></a>Moved, That the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 69.--(Baroness Blatch.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Weatherill: </B>   My Lords, I am naturally sorry that my amendment, which was supported by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, has failed and has been overturned in another place. I toyed with the idea of submitting a manuscript amendment this afternoon in same terms as that introduced yesterday in the other place by the right honourable gentleman the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed. It failed to find favour by 38 votes to 267. It would therefore be a waste of your Lordships' time if I were to do that today.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-23_para14"></a>I must accept that the Government and the Minister have given a crumb of comfort to volunteering organisations, in essence, by saying that free checks on volunteers and other classes will be introduced when resources become available and that the matter will be kept under review. During many years in the other place, and fewer years here, I have heard those comfortable words on many occasions. I fear that in practice they do not add up to much.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-23_para15"></a>In the meantime, volunteers will have to pay for themselves or, alternatively, the organisations to which they belong will have to pay. I shall not recount all the figures, but as I am so heavily involved with the Scouts and with St. John Ambulance, I must say that they estimate the cost to be in the region of &#163;450,000. They do not believe that the volunteers who support them will pay for themselves.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-23_para16"></a>There are many other organisations which are concerned with old and young people. It will not surprise your Lordships to hear that I am actively involved with Help the Aged--people of my age certainly should help the aged--and with Abbeyfields, the National Trust and the Prince's Trust. All those organisations will be affected.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-23_para17"></a>As the Minister correctly said, there are approximately 8 million to 20 million volunteers in this country on whom we greatly depend. I am the first to agree that those who work with vulnerable people, whether they be young or old, should be properly screened, especially after the tragedy at Dunblane. But did not Lord Cullen state in his report that the costs should be kept within the limits of what organisations can pay? Have not the Government, in their commendable bid to encourage volunteering, introduced the Make a Difference campaign? My concern is that this clause of the Police Bill may well make a difference, but, sadly, an adverse difference. That would be a very great shame.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, I support the noble Lord, Lord Weatherill. I am sure that the House will agree that he has reached the age of sagacity and has a much better mind than those as young as myself.

<P>

<A NAME = "70320-23_para18"></a>I declare an interest because I work for a charity which employs volunteers. I should have liked the Commons not to have rejected the amendment accepted by this House and so ably moved by the noble Lord, Lord Weatherill. I am sure that those who insure voluntary organisations and charities will insist that these checks are carried out, sometimes to enormous cost to charities or to smaller cost to masses of individuals.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-23_para19"></a>The trustees of such organisations will have a legal duty to those who are looked after by the charities and voluntary organisations to have the checks undertaken. The officers of those organisations, for their own protection, will want to see that the checks are carried out. I believe that if something happens to a vulnerable person, no matter of what age, the nearest relation may well be advised to sue the charity, particularly where the check has not been undertaken. Therefore, I fear that there will be considerable cost to all charities as a result of this provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-23_para20"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Weatherill, said, Lord Cullen in his report advised, particularly when dealing with cases of children, that the costs should be kept to the minimum for charities and that government funds should be provided to assist. Perhaps in reply my noble friend the Minister can give a ray of hope that the organisations dealing with children, or even certain groups of children, will in the foreseeable future have the costs reduced or abolished entirely.

<P>
<A NAME="70320-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, noble Lords have been dignified in defeat. It is not a happy situation. The spirit behind the amendments which were carried by the House was that they are of great importance. At the same time, we must recognise their cost implications. I do not wish to appear too responsible; occasionally I enjoy being irresponsible about money, but perhaps this is not one of those occasions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-23_para21"></a>The balance will have to be struck in due course between the range of certificates which are provided by Part V and the problems which have been addressed by noble Lords in the amendments which we carried. The problem is that the charities to which they refer are covered by what are now Clauses 104 and 105. They are covered by the criminal records certificates rather than by the more general criminal conviction certificate in Clause 103. If there is a possibility of providing extra resources for Clauses 104 and 105, perhaps by delaying the implementation of Clause 103, that might go part of the way to solving the problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-23_para22"></a>I note that in the letter which the Home Secretary wrote to the noble Lord, Lord Weatherill--the noble Lord has been kind enough to show it to me--he confirms that there is the possibility of providing free checks through an order-making power, which is provided for in an amendment. I recognise that it would be highly desirable when resources permit to use that order-making power. However, these are difficult areas. None of us knows the true cost. For example, none of us knows how many volunteers work for several organisations and therefore would require only a single <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>certificate. Like the noble Lords, I do not believe that it is realistic to seek to overturn the amendment, but there must be great regret over the additional burdens which will be put on the voluntary movement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the half conversion of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, to the merits of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Weatherill. I understand that when the amendment was proposed the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, was properly concerned about the consequences in terms of costs. I fully understand that and make no criticism. He reminds me that he supported the amendment at that time. I am glad that he did so, despite the reservations that I knew he had about the burden which might fall on the Treasury. The amendment made by your Lordships' House was most worthwhile and, like the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, I am sorry that it has been rejected.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-24_para0"></a>Will the Minister remind your Lordships, because I have forgotten, of the intention with regard to the implementation of the separate parts of Part V? That was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. I am not clear whether the Government have committed themselves to early implementation of the provisions in relation to criminal conviction certificates or whether that is to be phased in. That was referred to at the early stages of our debate, but I now cannot recall precisely what was said.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-24_para1"></a>I agree that it is difficult to calculate what will be the cost. I make no criticism of the noble Baroness that she has found it possible on this and other occasions to speak more briefly to your Lordships than have her colleagues in another place. But in the rather fuller remarks made by her colleague, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Mr. Kirkhope, although he sought to describe equity, practicality and cost as the three reasons that the Government were unable to accept the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Weatherill, in the final resort it amounted to the question of cost; who was to pay; and what the cost would be.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-24_para2"></a>I hope that these provisions do not result in fewer people coming forward to volunteer, the organisations being able to have fewer volunteers, or the facilities provided in the Bill not being used. I should be very unhappy about any of those outcomes. But I believe a future government will have to return to the provisions of the Bill and bring forward amendments. It may well be that experience will show what amendments are acceptable not only to your Lordships' House but also to another place on a future occasion.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-24_para3"></a>Therefore, while I regret the amendments and believe that the gesture made by the Government may well turn out to be cosmetic, there is widespread understanding on all sides of the House of the problem. We want the voluntary organisations to make the best use possible of the Bill but we do not want them to be penalised by the costs which may very well fall on that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   I have the deepest sympathy for the noble Lord, Lord Weatherill, and all those who <P>


<a name="column_1124"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1124</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>supported his amendments. Being active in the voluntary sector, I am fully alive to the penalty which the voluntary sector may have to face in years to come.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-24_para4"></a>However, we must strike a balance in relation to what is desirable. If it is agreed that this is a form of protection for young people which is needed, the question is how it is to be paid for. It is either put onto central taxation or onto the voluntary sector or the volunteer. The Government's response is much better than they have been given credit for. I am not at all sure that the amendments to which the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, referred will be necessary to bring about the state of affairs which he seeks.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-24_para5"></a>The Secretary of State is empowered to make regulations when he wishes to exempt certain people from payment. That payment will then fall on the general taxpayer. No amendment is needed to bring that about but merely the stroke of a pen of an incoming Secretary of State. Therefore, the matter remains in the political arena and the next government will be able to decide who shall and who shall not have to pay. In doing so by means of regulation, I should point out, because it is not at the end of the Bill where one would expect to find it but in Clause 114, that the regulations will be by statutory instrument through the negative procedure and therefore available for debate by Parliament. That is a better solution than noble Lords have given credit for.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-24_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I share the regret that the amendment has not been accepted. The Government have lavished a great deal of praise on your Lordships' House in recent times and, while we are all grateful for praise, that praise does not appear to have been matched by any general readiness to accept your Lordships' amendments. I have occasionally entertained the perhaps uncharitable suspicion that their liking for your Lordships' House is in proportion to the ease with which they are able to reverse its amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-24_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, it is end of term and I am not going to bite too much on the words of the noble Earl. However, a great deal of time and serious consideration have been given to the amendments to the Bill by my right honourable friend--and I refer both to the surveillance amendments and the amendments on this matter. I have come to appreciate that when in government, one must consider some of the points made so eloquently by my noble friend Lord Elton. It is a question of balance and determining who pays. We have that indeterminate number of people out there in the voluntary sector--between 8 million and 20 million people. Therefore, it seems to us responsible to think about how the concern could be addressed while at the same time remembering that some difficult decisions would need to be faced as to who is to pay.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-24_para6"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Weatherill, is disappointed. I accept and understand that. But I think he would be much more disappointed had the debates been cut off at this point. As my noble friend said, the matter is still alive and future parliaments will be able to consider the issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-24_para7"></a>Perhaps I may say to my noble friend Lord Swinfen that it is not possible for me to be definitive about priorities at this stage. There is no question that children <P>


<a name="column_1125"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1125</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are a priority, but the category of people to be exempt will depend very much on the ability of that category to meet the payments and on the particular case that it is able to make. That will all be part of extremely extensive consultation. Therefore, without anticipating the outcome of that debate which would follow by prompting the use of the powers available to a future Secretary of State, I hope that noble Lords will accept that the Government's response was not wholly negative.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-24_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, asked when this is to be implemented. The intention would be to phase the criminal conviction certificate after the introduction of the criminal record and enhanced criminal certificate.

<A NAME = "70320-26_para4"></a>This amendment changes the name of the Humberside police area to Humber. Your Lordships will be aware that there was some debate in another place as to whether a change of name was desirable. The Government have no desire to oppose the wishes of the local community if there is widespread support, not just for a change of name, but for what the new name should be. The Government have made their views known on the timing and costs of any change. We envisage a gradual change to the new name. We would certainly not want to see this happen overnight, thereby diverting resources from policing activities. I commend the amendment to the House.

<A NAME = "70320-27_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving the above amendment, I shall, with the leave of the Committee, speak also to Amendments Nos. 2 and 3. Perhaps I may preface my remarks by reminding Members of the Committee, as one or two of them may have forgotten, <P>


<a name="column_1133"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the Bill does not deal solely with paedophilia as normally understood. Now and again that fact has been overlooked.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para9"></a>On Second Reading, differences of opinion were expressed as to whether the notification requirements in Clause 1 constituted punishment. Speaking from the Liberal Democrat Benches, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, suggested that they did, while the Government maintained that they did not. I believe that the truth lies somewhere in between. Whether or not notification/registration is actually meant to be punitive, it is bound to be so in practice to some degree.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para10"></a>As I said on Second Reading, while the information can doubtless be kept secret from the public in a large anonymous conurbation, in closely-knit rural areas the secret is more likely than not to leak out before very long. Even if that does not occur, the police are quite likely to make a habit of stopping the car of the individual on the register more often than they stop other people's cars, or to question him and require him to submit to DNA tests every time any sex crime occurs in the area, even if the sex crime for which the person was convicted is a trivial one.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para11"></a>If it was a matter of no more than a trivial offence, one does worry about the de facto punishment inherent in being placed on any black list being disproportionate to the crime. Let us take the case of an office Christmas party where men, and quite often women, traditionally end up behaving badly. After a few drinks a man--who may not necessarily be the boss but perhaps a relatively junior employee in his early twenties--approaches a 17 year-old typist from behind, puts an arm around her waist, squeezes it and plants an unwanted kiss upon her cheek. Her mother in a similar situation 25 years ago, and her grandmother in a similar situation 50 years ago, would almost certainly have shrugged off the whole thing. But today's 17 year-old may well feel, indignantly, that her "space had been invaded", or whatever transatlantic phrase happens to be in vogue at the time, and complain to the police. The latter would almost certainly feel that they had to charge the young man with indecent assault. If convicted, that young man might be fined no more than &#163;30 or so or, more likely, given a conditional discharge. Nevertheless, under the Bill as it stands, he would remain on the register as a potential sex offender for a full five years. Is that necessary, and is it right?
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para12"></a>Incidentally, I know of cases where the roles have been reversed; for example, where an older woman has blatantly made physical passes at a shy young man. Of course, in such a case men are usually too embarrassed to complain to the police. However, if they were to do so and a conviction were to result, I would feel exactly the same way about the woman being placed on the register.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para13"></a>However, let us take a slightly more serious case as reported in today's newspapers. A 35 year-old hospital doctor was used to indulging in horseplay with one or more nurses at the hospital where he worked. He claimed that the nurses normally entered fully into the spirit of the thing. But it appears that one day he misjudged the signals and went too far by placing a hand <P>


<a name="column_1134"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>where the nurse did not want it placed. She yelled out and he immediately removed it. Nevertheless, the doctor was prosecuted for indecent assault, convicted and sentenced yesterday to three months' imprisonment, possibly jeopardising his future career.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para14"></a>It may be that a three-month sentence would be justified, especially if the lady in question happened to be a 17 year-old student nurse rather than the slightly older registered nurse involved in the case to which I referred. Nevertheless, is it really necessary for that doctor to remain on police files as a potentially dangerous sex maniac for six years and 10 months after he emerges from his token spell in prison? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-27_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The amendments seek to replace the current notification period with shorter periods for the three categories of offenders at the lower end of the scale. The noble Lord, Lord Monson, proposes to replace seven years with five years for those imprisoned for a term of six months or less or who had been admitted to hospital without being subject to a restriction order.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para15"></a>The noble Lord seeks to reduce the length of the notification requirement provided under the Bill. We take the view that, for registration to be of any value whatever, a minimum period of five years should apply. A period of registration for two years only would not provide the level of protection for children that people require from those who commit the type of offence caught under the provisions of the Bill. It is a well-known fact that paedophiles are cunning, they are deceptive and they can avoid coming to attention for long periods of time. That is why we are providing for a minimum period of notification of five years.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para16"></a>I should point out to the Committee that we are not talking about a particularly onerous requirement. After initial notification of his name and address, an offender is only required to notify any changes to those details. Indeed, I remember during the debates on the Crime (Sentences) Bill that the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, who is not now in his place, raised the question of someone arriving at a police station and being treated in a way that would be unacceptable in terms of what we come to expect from the police when dealing with such people. However, I am assured that this can be a matter of written notification to a police authority and that no more need happen unless there is a change of address. In those circumstances, I am afraid that I cannot accept the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I wish that the Minister would not keep referring to paedophiles. As the noble Lord, Lord Monson, said, the Bill is not restricted to paedophiles. Indeed, we discussed the issue previously and I thought that the Minister agreed with me that the Bill goes wider. It includes consensual sex acts and acts which do not relate to children,because it catches those who are affected by differential ages of consent. It is the <P>


<a name="column_1135"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>only chance I shall have to say this; namely, that this is not a paedophile Bill. It is a Sex Offenders Bill in a broader sense.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-27_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   I agree with the noble Baroness that a minimum five-year registration period would be appropriate for a repeat offence, and it might even be appropriate for a single offence which involved paedophile activities. However, as the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, kindly confirmed, this Bill does not deal only with paedophilia. None of the examples I gave involved people who could remotely be described as paedophiles. If we had been allocated the correct amount of time in which to deliberate this Bill: the time which it deserved--as so many other Bills did--I suspect that it would have ended up as much less of a blunt instrument than it is at the moment. In my opinion it will go on to the statute book in a defective form. I do not believe that I am alone in that opinion. However, having made my point, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-27_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I was unable to speak at Second Reading of this Bill because it came up at a time on a Friday when I was engaged in teaching. My overall position on the Bill remains that I stated in the debate on the humble Address; namely, that I am in favour in principle of such a Bill being on the statute book as I think it meets a real need, but that any such Bill must be brought in subject to a good deal of care, first, to make sure that it applies to the right offences, and, secondly, to make sure that the notification which results from it is handled with due caution and on a need to know basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para24"></a>Inevitably this Bill has been prepared in haste. It is a Bill on a rather complicated subject which is difficult to get right at any time. I am not quite certain that the Bill is yet in a form where we can leave it in peace. It will require some attention in the next Parliament. My misgivings relate to two distinct themes: one, the type of offences which are covered by the Bill, and, secondly, the use which may be made of the notification which it requires.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para25"></a>In general I think it ought to be the principle of this Bill that it does not apply to consensual offences. Because the age of consent, sadly, does not always command general confidence among people of the age to which it applies, there may be quite a lot of people involved in this. Some consenting offences are in the Bill, some are out of it. <P>


<a name="column_1136"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1136</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Indecent assault may take place with consent or without it. My argument would be that those cases should be distinguished. In cases where there is, say, a boy of 16 and a girl of 15, the required notification may perhaps sometimes be a little stringent.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para26"></a>For people who are gay, because of the unequal age of consent there will be an unequal impact resulting from the Bill. This is an area in which we owe a great debt of gratitude to the Prime Minister who has opened up discussion of this subject since his meeting with Sir Ian McKellen. The majority in another place against an equal age of consent was a narrow one. It is therefore ironic that this Bill increases the practical effects of that unequal age of consent. That is something which may require attention in a future Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para27"></a>I also have misgivings about the use that is made of the notification. The Bill has practically nothing to say on that subject. Notification is to be made to the police. What happens to the notification thereafter is left wide open. I do not for a moment express any criticism of the police here. Indeed my views on this subject are extremely close to those of Mr. Butler, the chief constable of Gloucestershire constabulary, who reported on this subject on behalf of the Association of Chief Police Officers. That is an interesting report and well worth thought. The report discussed the possible advantages and disadvantages of a general warning system. It stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Three police forces were not in favour of a warning system at all and without exception all the other forces agreed that it must only be used in extreme circumstances". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para28"></a>It was thought the warning might make the job of the police more difficult. The report further states that if an offender's,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"address and activities are known the police are aware of his movements whereas displacement may occur making the most devious paedophile determined to achieve anonymity and further opportunity to offend". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para29"></a>The police believe that wide notification could be self-defeating. The report refers to one case where the police disclosed information from a warning list to an education department, which reported it to a school, which passed it to parents by newsletter. That brought in the media and meant that the probation department had to provide accommodation in a new force area. The report argues that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a warning scheme, if not used as a means of last resort, could be detrimental to public safety in the long term". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para30"></a>It argues that it could provide a threat to rehabilitation, which is, of course, the ultimate need. The report refers to a case in the West Midlands where revealing the identity of a sex offender led to an arson attack in which a 14 year-old girl--not the offender--died. Therefore there are risks here. Disclosure should be conducted subject to restrictions. I do not see any such restrictions in the Bill. It should be done on a need to know basis and with regard to public safety.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para31"></a>My noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford, who spoke at Second Reading, recently received a letter on this subject from someone who in the usual way had been abused as a child, became an abuser as a result and had subsequently sought treatment. His offences are far in his past. He is a respectable citizen but his name reached his <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>local newspaper, which published it. As a result, a man came after him with a gun and he has had to leave the area and look for another job.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para32"></a>There are risks. I do not think that it is enough to leave the matter to local discretion. The Bill should have sought to restrict the issue. I think that the measure will need attention in the next Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-27_para33"></a>I expressed my thanks to the Minister on the Crime (Sentences) Bill for her conduct during the Session. In order not to prolong the sitting of the House, perhaps I may ask the Minister to take as read that my sentiments about her conduct are as they were then. I thank her warmly.

<A NAME="70320-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I was present at the Second Reading, as were a number of noble Lords. Some of us expressed concerns about various aspects of the Bill, including the fact that it would have to be taken rather more rapidly than would be desirable. But I do not think that it is appropriate for a noble Lord who was not present at Second Reading to make a seven-minute Second Reading speech. Some of us who are not able to be present at the proper time deny the House the benefit of our wisdom.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-28_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord makes me regret that I did not put down the amendments that I have here.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, I rise only to reassure the noble Earl, Lord Russell, that the Bill does not apply to a boy of 16 who has sexual relations with a girl of 15, as he will see if he examines Schedule 1 closely.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-28_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, first, perhaps I may accept the earlier rebuke by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. I have used the word paedophilia on more than one occasion. The main reason that I used it was simply that that was where our concern began. Our concern was about sexually abusive behaviour, in particular to children.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para0"></a>However, the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, is absolutely right. By these measures we seek to discourage sexually abusive behaviour to children and/or adults.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para1"></a>All I can say to the noble Earl, Lord Russell, is this. First, I thank him for his complimentary remarks. However, I have looked again at the offences set out in Schedules 1 and 2. We regard them as sufficiently serious for these measures; they justify this Bill. I commend the Bill to your Lordships.

<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para3"></a>The Bill was introduced in another place in January as part of the Government's commitment to helping public service employees who may have suffered loss as a <P>


<a name="column_1138"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>result of being mis-sold a personal pension to have that loss made good by the personal pension provider concerned. As the House may know, there has been concern that between mid-1988 and mid-1994 a number of members or potential members of occupational pension schemes may have been incorrectly advised by financial advisers or by personal pension providers to leave or not to join their occupational scheme and to opt instead for a personal pension.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para4"></a>In view of that, the public service pension schemes have agreed to restore current employees to the position they would have been in, had no mis-selling taken place and had they not left their occupational scheme, on receipt of an appropriate payment from those responsible for mis-selling. Unlike the other public service pension schemes, the police and fire pension schemes cannot be amended by means of secondary legislation alone to enable the police and fire authorities to participate in the review at no cost to the public purse or to reinstate pensionable service where mis-selling has taken place.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para5"></a>The Bill, which extends to England and Wales and to Scotland, amends the Police Pensions Act 1976 and the Fire Services Act 1947 to enable the relevant secondary legislation containing the provisions for police and fire pensions to be amended in two ways. First, the Bill enables provision to be made for police and fire authorities to reinstate in their occupational pension schemes police officers and firefighters who have been mis-sold personal pensions. This is to be done by means of Clause 1 of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para6"></a>Secondly, the Bill paves the way for police and fire authorities to recover the reasonable administrative costs of dealing with inquiries made by personal pension providers when conducting their review of the pensions they have sold to police officers and firefighters. The Bill also enables police and fire authorities to recover the costs of reinstating a person's occupational pension rights where a personal pension was mis-sold. These measures are contained in Clause 2 in respect of police pensions and in Clause 3 in respect of fire pensions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para7"></a>I also believe that the Bill will be equally welcomed by the insurance industry, since I know that a good number of personal pension providers are keen to get on with their reviews of the pensions sold to police officers and firefighters and to settle the cases where mis-selling is found to have taken place. This Bill will enable police and fire authorities to play their part in making progress with the review.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para8"></a>The Bill is not a controversial measure. It was welcomed in another place, and I commend it to your Lordships' House. I beg to move.

<A NAME = "70320-28_para14"></a>There will be few in your Lordships' House who will not be familiar with the general principles of the original dangerous dogs legislation; and few noble Lords will not remember the powerful speeches made over a number of years in your Lordships' House by the late Lord Houghton of Sowerby. Sadly--I think that it would be a happy day for him--he is not here to see enacted at least part of what he sought to amend in the original legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para15"></a>I do not intend this evening to be critical of that legislation. Many years have now passed. I am perfectly prepared to accept the findings of the Home Affairs Committee, which had a great influence on the noble Baroness's department--I hope that she will support that view--in bringing about the acceptance in principle that some amendment to the Dangerous Dogs Act was required. The amendments introduced by the Government go at least two-thirds of the way to meet the concerns which prompted the introduction of the Bill which I had the honour to present to your Lordships.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para16"></a>The principal changes wrought by the Commons amendments fall into four groups. First, they limit the courts' discretion--we sought that total discretion should be given back to the courts--in relation to destruction to ensure a presumption in favour of destruction unless exceptional circumstances could be <P>


<a name="column_1140"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>demonstrated. As I said, the Bill as originally drafted gave unlimited discretion. I believe that most noble Lords would agree that that is a fair compromise in the traditions of British parliamentary democracy. I am personally happy with that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para17"></a>Secondly, the court needs to be satisfied that an owner of a pit bull terrier that was born before 30th November 1991 had good reason for not registering the dog originally. The Bill that I introduced in this House did not include a "good reason" test.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para18"></a>The third major amendment lifts the mandatory destruction provisions contained in Section 5(4) of the 1991 Act. The original Bill that I introduced left the mandatory destruction provision intact.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para19"></a>Finally, Clause 3 also provides for cases where a dog is in custody but no further proceedings are envisaged to be considered by the courts. Those cases could not have been addressed by the Bill as originally drafted.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para20"></a>To go into a little more detail, Clause 1 of the Bill as it now stands provides the courts with a limited discretion in favour of destroying a dog for a Section 1 offence--that is, an offence that involves a pit bull terrier to all intents and purposes--or a Section 3 offence, which involves aggravated attack by any dog, unless the court considers it safe not to order destruction. That reflects the recommendation of the Home Affairs Committee that the court shall order the destruction of the dog unless it is satisfied that in the circumstances it would be safe not to do so. Therefore there is a change of emphasis. However, I do not believe that any of us would quarrel with that change of emphasis.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para21"></a>The Bill requires owners of Section 1 dogs born before November 1991 to show that they had good reason for not complying with the registration scheme. In effect, there would be a judgment before they could be registered. The court would need to be satisfied that the dog would not be a danger to the public. For those dogs born before 30th November 1991 there would be a second test. The court would need to be satisfied that there was a good reason why the owner failed to register the dog in 1991. I should have thought that any court in our land, using its discretion, should be able to establish what was a good reason for an owner failing to register a dog.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para22"></a>Clause 2 is essentially a matter of tidying up the drafting of the original Bill. It addresses two unrelated issues concerning, first, unregistered pit bulls and, secondly, dogs of any type which are out of control. The first part of the clause amends the 1991 Act to allow a court to order that an owner of an unexempted pit bull terrier can register the dog. That is an important change.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para23"></a>At present, the Index of Exempted Dogs, as it is known, is closed, and has been since 30th November 1991. This clause is a consequence of Clause 1. Clause 1 allows a court in certain circumstances not to order the destruction of an unregistered pit bull. It follows, therefore, that if ownership of the dog is to be legitimised, the Index of Exempted Dogs must be re-opened in order to allow the dog to be registered.
<P>


<a name="column_1141"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1141</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para24"></a>Owners will have two months to comply with the requirements of registration. They are: that a dog shall be neutered, tattooed and microchipped; that third party insurance shall be obtained; and that the appropriate fee shall be paid to the Index of Exempted Dogs.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para25"></a>Where an owner fails to comply with a court order to register the dog, the court has the power to order the destruction of the dog or, in its discretion, to extend the period of two months to complete the registration process. The second part of this clause relates to any type or breed of dog, not merely to pit bull terriers.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para26"></a>In cases where a person is convicted of an offence under Section 3 of the 1991 Act, which relates to any dog which is dangerously out of control, the court may specify the measures to be taken by the owner for keeping the dog under proper control, such as muzzling, keeping it on a lead or, in some cases, both. If the owner of the dog fails to keep it under control, the court may in future order the destruction of the dog. There is no change to the substance of proposals in the Bill that I introduced into this House. It is essentially a matter of tidying up the drafting.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para27"></a>Clause 3 amends the Bill to address two quite important issues. First, it lifts the mandatory destruction provisions contained in Section 5(4) of the 1991 Act; and, secondly, it provides an opportunity in certain cases where there is an impasse for dogs to be registered.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para28"></a>On the first point, Section 5(4) of the 1991 Act provides that where a Section 1 dog--perhaps I may remind noble Lords that that is a pit bull terrier to all intents and purposes--is seized by the police and no person has been, or is to be, prosecuted for an offence under the Act, either because he or she cannot be found or for any other reason, the court must order the destruction of the dog. The amendment gives the magistrate limited discretion as to whether to order the destruction of the dog, to be consistent with the proposed discretionary provisions contained elsewhere in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para29"></a>The second matter that the clause seeks to address is that of cases where proceedings have been either dismissed or discontinued and the dogs have not been returned to the owners, either because a court has decided that the dog is a pit bull terrier or the police believe it to be an unregistered pit bull terrier. Ownership of such dogs is already an offence under the 1991 Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para30"></a>The amended Bill will ensure that where no person has been convicted of an offence under the 1991 Act but the dog cannot be released to the owner because it is in effect an unregistered pit bull terrier, the court can order, subject to certain safeguards regarding public safety, that the dog be registered. In the case of a dog born before 30th November 1991, the owner would also need to satisfy the court that he had good reason for the dog not being registered in 1991.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para31"></a>Clauses 4, 5 and 6 essentially tidy up the original Bill and no changes of substance have been made. Clause 4 relates to providing a power to make regulations in connection with re-opening the register for pit bull terriers.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "70320-28_para32"></a>I am personally very happy, and I hope that my colleagues who have assisted on the Bill are happy, now that we have improved the dangerous dogs legislation to the extent that it will be less onerous, cause less distress to owners and their pets and, quite importantly, result in less money being wasted unnecessarily in keeping pit bull terriers and other dogs in kennels for long periods of time awaiting appeals and other matters. I congratulate the Government on their prompt action after the findings of the Home Affairs Committee. I, at least, at the end of this Parliament end on a high note. I hope that Lord Houghton of Sowerby, although he might have spoken for somewhat longer than I have to your Lordships this evening, would be as satisfied as I am. I commend the amendment to the House.

<A NAME="70320-29_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Wharton: </B>   My Lords, I wish to pay tribute to my friend in another place, Mr. Roger Gale, who has persevered with this Bill for a number of years. He has never lost faith. This morning, at 2.15, there he was on his feet pushing through these amendments. On that note, I also thank the Minister for her quiet encouragement and support over time and other noble Lords who have also lent us their support.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Harris of Greenwich: </B>   My Lords, I shall be very brief. I merely wish to thank my noble friend Lord Falkland for having persevered with this measure, and for eventually, with Mr. Gale in the House of Commons, having brought it very near to the statute book. That reflects credit on a large number of people, including the Home Office--given the fact that it was faced with the undoubted embarrassment of this excessively foolish Bill, passed in 1991. Belatedly, we now have a significant improvement to the 1991 Act. As I say, that reflects great credit on all concerned.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-29_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, if noble Lords, like me, believe in the life hereafter, then it is possible to believe that the doughty animal-lover, the late Lord Houghton of Sowerby, will be looking down on our proceedings today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-29_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I know that the noble Lord is not a believer in these matters. I speak personally; I did make that point. He may be looking down on our proceedings, perhaps--if I know him well enough--with a characteristic, impish scowl for me, perhaps even for my noble friends Lord Courtown and Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish and for my ministerial colleague, Mr. Timothy Kirkhope, all of whom have represented the Government on this issue over the seven years. <P>


<a name="column_1143"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1143</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I understand, as a result of a whisper in my ear, that it was in fact my noble friend Lord Ferrers who introduced this Bill in the first place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-29_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Before the Minister leaves Lord Houghton of Sowerby, it is not my beliefs that matter; Lord Houghton was to his dying day a devoted atheist.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-29_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   You have spoilt my line, my Lord! He was too saintly to be that. I think something else will have happened since he passed from this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-29_para0"></a>Perhaps I could say to the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, that the Act was passed at that time in rather difficult circumstances with all-party support.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-29_para1"></a>If I may continue my reference to Lord Houghton of Sowerby, I also think that he may be looking down with a rather warmer satisfaction on the Home Affairs Select Committee, on Mr. Roger Gale, of course, and on the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, who have arrived at this happy position.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-29_para2"></a>I should like to congratulate the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, on all his work in relation to the Bill, which will amend the 1991 Act. He set out clearly what the Bill does. I should confirm that, in amending the Bill in another place, the Government sought to follow the key recommendations of the Select Committee on Home Affairs in giving the courts discretion on the outcome of the proceedings about individual dogs, allowing something other than a destruction order to be made. The discretion will apply only when it is clear that the dog would not give rise to a danger to public safety.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-29_para3"></a>The Government have a responsibility for public safety and to take account of public concern about dangerous dogs and dogs that are out of control. Additionally, the Government introduced an amendment to address those cases where no proceedings are contemplated but the dog has not been returned to its owners under current law. The Bill as amended will allow the courts to consider such cases and to make a decision about whether a dog can be released under certain conditions or whether a destruction order should be made.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-29_para4"></a>Those are the two main areas in which the new Bill before us differs from how it left your Lordships' House. Other changes take account of drafting problems, such as lack of a commencement date. With these amendments, the Bill now has the support of the Government and I hope that your Lordships will agree that the Bill is improved by the changes.

It may be that the Committee would prefer it if I make one perhaps longer speech rather than four separate speeches which might, at the end of the day, turn out to be longer.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para6"></a>When we were discussing this matter at Second Reading, the principle of traffic reduction had widespread support in your Lordships' House. The matter before us tonight, however, is whether the Bill, as it now stands, is good legislation and in the best interests of the environment and the economy. The amendments that I have set down will, I believe, improve the Bill by creating clear duties on local authorities to carry out consultation with neighbouring authorities, the Highways Agency and representatives of local business. The amendments will also ensure that any traffic reduction plan is directly related to other land use plans and that, once decisions are made, they are communicated to those who may be affected.

<A NAME = "70320-30_para7"></a>The key issue in this short debate is the obvious tension between what is acceptable as a matter for government guidance and what needs to be included in primary legislation. I believe it is recognised that all the obligations in the Bill could already be covered if <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Government issued the relevant guidance through the local authorities' transportation policy and plans (TPP) system.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para8"></a>That begs the question: why do we need primary legislation if guidance is sufficient? The answer, according to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, when we discussed this last is because,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"One ... needs to legislate to bring those who are dragging their heels up to the mark of the best". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para9"></a>Placing these amendments on the face of the Bill will avoid confusion and ensure that all the local authorities that concern the noble Baroness have a duty to perform to a consistent level. As the Bill now stands, a local authority can drag its feet over matters of consultation and it will be the road users, businesses and residents who will face the inevitable disruption. Indeed, under Clause 5 of the Bill as it now stands those authorities may in fact do nothing whatsoever.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para10"></a>The amendment creates a duty on local highway authorities to consult with neighbouring authorities and the Highways Agency before preparing their reports to set local traffic reduction targets or curtailment of growth targets. That will ensure that any plans that might be developed take full account of circumstances on all parts of the road network. Decisions that affect traffic in one administrative area may well have implications for traffic conditions, business and economic development or indeed road safety in another administrative area.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para11"></a>At Second Reading, my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith gave the example of the City of London's ring of steel, saying that, while it may have improved conditions for those working in the area, it raised concerns among neighbouring boroughs that their networks were having to cope with the additional diverted traffic.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para12"></a>The other amendments provide for similar duties in other subject areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para13"></a>If the Bill is to produce a coherent approach to managing traffic, I suggest that each local plan must be in accord with those being developed around it. The reality for far too many road users is that local authorities have difficulty in ensuring that their road works are adequately co-ordinated. The prospect that area-wide traffic reduction plans could be introduced with little or no consultation is, I suggest to the Committee, far too great a risk to take.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para14"></a>I do not believe that this is a controversial point. I am informed by Friends of the Earth, who have been advising the noble Baroness, that they share this concern and do not disagree with its sentiments or purpose.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para15"></a>The Bill in its various forms has been in existence for around three years. Since the introduction of this Bill, Parliament has spent only a very few hours scrutinising it. While in current circumstances that may not be unusual, I do not believe that it is in the best interests of sound legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para16"></a>I should like to say to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee--with some diffidence but as courteously as I might--that both she and indeed her honourable friend in another place have played in some doubtful <P>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1148</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>company when they rest on the advice of the Friends of the Earth. Friends of the Earth behaved extraordinarily badly. They wrote to one of my advisers and, with the permission of the Committee, I should like to read what the letter said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I would urge you in the strongest possible terms to use whatever influence you have to persuade Lord Lucas to withdraw his amendments. There are quite clearly enormous constitutional issues raised should a Peer frustrate the will of the House of Commons (and the House of Lords) by blocking such an important Bill on the eve of a General Election". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para17"></a>That is a comment which is neither correct in fact, nor complimentary to the manner in which your Lordships undertake their scrutiny role, which is at the heart of our work. However, that is what the letter said. I and others--the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders and the Freight Transport Association--contrary to what the Friends of the Earth say, remain concerned that, unamended, this legislation may not function well in practice. These amendments would ensure that the Bill could help to deliver the environmental and economic improvements we all seek. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, for the way in which he dealt with this matter. In my view the amendment is uncontentious, calling as it does for consultation by councils in drawing up plans of neighbouring councils, the Highways Agency, local businesses and so forth. I find nothing wrong with the spirit of the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para18"></a>I can give the noble Lord a clear undertaking that, in the event of the Labour Party coming to office after the election, we shall be happy to enter into consultations with him about his proposals. I cannot go further than that at this stage. It is necessary for a clear and new look to be taken, but I can give him that clear undertaking.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para19"></a>We say that the Bill is wholly consistent with Labour Party policy. We set it out last year in Consensus for Change. We call for an integrated, balanced, transport strategy and set out our commitment to work with local communities and businesses to find effective, equitable and environmentally sustainable solutions to congestion, pollution and traffic growth. As my noble friend Lord Graham said at Second Reading, we have made it clear that we support the principles of the Bill's aims within existing budgets; namely, to set local targets for traffic reduction or constraint on traffic growth; to consult local people, businesses and environmental and other organisations; to encourage cycling, walking, better public transport provision and speed reduction; and to take account of local plans in government assessment and local transport grant bids.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para20"></a>We believe that the Secretary of State for Transport should be involved in monitoring plans, furthering regional co-ordination and reporting to Parliament. The Bill in its present form advocates consultation with businesses and environmental organisations on drawing up local plans. It is therefore clear beyond peradventure that the Labour Party is supportive of the principle of consultation with regional and local bodies affected by the Bill. We are therefore supportive of the amendments proposed by the noble Lord.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para21"></a>I want to make that absolutely plain so that there is no room for any doubt on that point. The detail of the matter is something about which we shall want to consult with the noble Lord and others concerned in the event of our being able to take office following the general election.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Brabazon of Tara: </B>   I support in principle the amendment moved by my noble friend and in particular Amendment No. 1. Those are precisely the points I raised at Second Reading; that is to say, consultation with neighbouring principal councils and the Highways Agency. In his reply at Second Reading my noble friend the Minister gave me a satisfactory answer in relation to principal councils consultation and has since written to me and given me a satisfactory reply also on the point relating to the Highways Agency. When he replies to this debate I should like him to place that on record, in Hansard.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para22"></a>I am encouraged to hear what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, though that is probably not binding and, any way, is unlikely to happen. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, was also sympathetic to my concerns in relation to the consultation with those two specific bodies. Provided that I receive the reply I hope for, I shall be satisfied. I would not therefore support the amendment if it came to a Division.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para23"></a>My noble friend Lord Lucas showed me the letter sent by the Friends of the Earth. I was somewhat horrified that my noble friend was accused of acting unconstitutionally by tabling the amendments. I have heard it suggested in the past--and in this we have all co-operated--that by not pressing an amendment at Committee stage a Bill does not have to go back to the other place and can therefore go through. But to suggest that one should not even table an amendment because it might spoil the progress of a Bill is taking matters a bit far. If one was in another place--I have never been in the other place though some noble Lords have--the author of that letter might well be summoned to the Bar of the House of Commons to account for his actions. I hope that my noble friend the Leader of the House will take note of what is being said and look into the letter.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-30_para24"></a>Having said that, I support the principle of the amendment and hope to receive a satisfactory reply from my noble friend on the point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Chorley: </B>   I too spoke at Second Reading. I do not want to say any more than was said by the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon. The amendments are not particularly pernicious though I would have thought guidance was sufficient in these circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-31_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Courtown: </B>   Perhaps I can begin by making it clear that I fully understand the concerns that lie behind my noble friend's amendment. The Government agree that local traffic authorities will need to consult widely when undertaking reviews of existing and forecast traffic levels in their area and in taking a decision as to whether it would be appropriate to set targets for reducing those levels or rates of growth.
<P>


<a name="column_1150"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1150</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-31_para0"></a>However, we go further than my noble friend in identifying those bodies with which we expect local authorities to consult. We are clear that in addition to principal councils and the Highways Agency, as envisaged by his amendment, we would also expect other tiers of government such as district councils, as well as local residents and businesses to be consulted. Equally, we would expect local authorities to ensure that any targets they set, together with the measures they envisage implementing to achieve them, were compatible with the relevant structure and local plans for their areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-31_para1"></a>However, we believe that it would be more appropriate to deal with these matters in subsequent guidance for local authorities to be issued by the Secretary of State rather than on the face of the Bill. As my honourable friend the Minister for Railways, Roads and Local Transport made clear in another place at an earlier stage in this Bill's parliamentary progress, the crucial advantage of dealing with these matters in guidance is that it allows time for us to consider with the Local Authority Associations and other relevant bodies the detailed mechanics of how all this might work. The Government's view is that it would be a mistake to be too prescriptive on the face of the Bill only to discover subsequently that the drafting was defective and that we needed further primary legislation to implement its provision. Having said that, we believe that these matters are best dealt with in guidance.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-31_para2"></a>Our legal advice is that there are several technical deficiencies in the drafting of the amendments. For example, the first amendment refers to the Highways Agency when in fact this agency has no legal existence or identity separate from the Secretary of State for Transport. Neither is it made clear what is meant by "neighbouring principal councils". Reference is also made in the third amendment to "other land use plans" when such plans have not previously been mentioned or defined in the Bill. Finally, the first two amendments, which specify the bodies with which principal councils must consult before preparing their reports, would introduce an unwelcome duplication in so far as subsection (6) of Clause 2 enables the Secretary of State to issue guidance to principal councils in regard to who should be consulted in connection with the preparation of reports.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-31_para3"></a>My noble friend Lord Brabazon of Tara referred to the letter I wrote to him--I shall make it available to other noble Lords--concerning the points he raised at Second Reading. The Government agree that such consultation should be undertaken. Any targets and associated measures to achieve them, if not based on the widest possible consultation and broad local consensus, are unlikely to be implemented successfully. Indeed we would go further still and would expect local authorities to consult also with other tiers of local government, including district councils, as well as with local residents and businesses. That will be made absolutely clear in the guidance to be issued to local authorities in due course by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-31_para4"></a>We shall, in turn, want to consult extensively with local authorities and with appropriate national organisations in drawing up this guidance. We believe <P>


<a name="column_1151"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1151</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the crucial advantage of dealing in guidance with issues such as consultation, as well as the linking of targets to bids for capital funding, is that it will allow us time to consider with the local authority associations and with other interested bodies the detailed mechanics of how this might work. We believe that it would be a mistake at this stage to be too prescriptive on the face of the Bill only to discover subsequently that the drafting was defective and that we needed further primary legislation to implement its provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-31_para5"></a>As I made clear at Second Reading, the Government believe that this is a worthwhile Bill whose principles we support strongly. In turn, the guidance we intend issuing will ensure that local authorities take the views of relevant interested parties and local circumstances fully into account in drawing up their reports and, where appropriate, setting targets. However, we believe that the technical deficiencies which I have identified in the amendments would put the laudable aims behind the Bill, and indeed the Bill itself, at risk. With the greatest respect to my noble friend, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-31_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   The amendments seek to provide for full consultation and to provide that the reports of local councils relate to land use plans. These are important matters. I very much agree with the substance of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas of Chilworth. It is because I do so that I want to see these provisions in guidance. They will be in guidance, as we have heard this evening, assuming that the Bill reaches the statute book.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-31_para6"></a>I said at Second Reading that I would not be supportive of guidance which did not include those points. The guidance has a place in the Bill in that Clause 2(6) allows for guidance and councils must have regard to that guidance.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-31_para7"></a>With regard to consultation, your Lordships have heard the assurances given this evening. They echo assurances given by the Minister at the Committee stage in another place. At Second Reading I likened the consultation process to that of Local Agenda 21s where local authorities are successfully working with the bodies identified by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas of Chilworth, in drawing up those plans. That process should be replicated in connection with these traffic reports.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-31_para8"></a>On consultation with neighbouring authorities, the point is well made that no traffic management can work if it merely shunts a problem across a boundary, whether it is to the next street, to the next ward, to the next borough or to the next county. I know that locally from my own experience extremely well. On consultation with the Highways Agency--in other words, the Department of Transport--one must of course relate to roads which are within departmental control. In London, for instance, the traffic director has to be consulted on certain matters. Wherever the roads are in the hierarchy, they are part of the same network. On consultation with local businesses--for instance, chambers of commerce--I have experience <P>


<a name="column_1152"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1152</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the valuable job local chambers of commerce and local businesses individually have done in presenting the concerns of business.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-31_para9"></a>The consultation that has been identified by the noble Lord seems to be part of the growing process of working in partnership, which so many sectors of society are now taking forward very successfully. "Partnership" has become something of a buzzword over the past few years, but partnerships are working well and are growing. I take no issue with the substance of the amendments because the points raised are necessary for the reporting process to work. The organisations and bodies referred to will often have similar aims, although they will sometimes have different priorities. Local business is likely to be concerned with the local economy, local employment and so on. Local councils and businesses are working together to increase regeneration in areas where that is required. They must be consulted, and, as I see it, they will be.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-31_para10"></a>There is also the issue of land use planning. Planning is not about restricting development for the sake of restricting development. There are sometimes arguments about whether a proposed development is appropriate. Those are not necessarily--in fact, not that often--on traffic grounds. There are all kinds of reasons for traffic issues coming into the equation. Local land use plans, to be good plans, refer to environmental considerations, as do transport policies and programmes. Both are part of the responsibility of the same local authority, not of separate departments--again, a holistic approach, if I may put it that way. That is why the reports envisaged must relate to land use plans.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-31_para11"></a>However, as has been said, it is not necessary to put these matters on the face of the Bill. They will be in guidance. If the list of consultees identified in the amendments is to be restricted to those proposed, it will be incomplete, as we have already heard. For instance, there is no reference to local residents or to other tiers of local authority. We have heard about drafting difficulties. I think it is a little tough for the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, to have been bowled that one at this late stage. However, it is an issue which we must take seriously.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-31_para12"></a>Reference has been made to the letter from Friends of the Earth. I have not seen the letter. The noble Lord said it is a letter to his advisers; a letter from what I would describe as one campaigning organisation to--I do not know who the noble Lord's advisers are--possibly another campaigning organisation. Friends of the Earth is a campaigning organisation. I do not share that point with it. But that is not to say that I would in any way deny the valuable work it has done on the substance of this issue. If apology is required I hope the noble Lord will take from me that I mean quite straightforwardly that the amendments put forward and the value of the Bill are for your Lordships to assess. We shall do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-31_para13"></a>I said at Second Reading that the Bill is not anti-car. It is about matching the car to the needs of the community. I hope the noble Lord, Lord Lucas of <P>


<a name="column_1153"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Chilworth, will accept my thanks for raising these important issues. But I hope he will also accept that his amendments are not necessary and, as they are drawn, contain some inherent problems. I hope he will be satisfied with the Government's assurances, which I was glad to hear because they were assurances I wanted too, and that on that basis he will feel able, following this debate and following the placing of all these points on the record, to withdraw his amendment.

I am glad that he and all Members of the Committee who have spoken in this short debate tonight have agreed that the amendments are not contentious. I was also glad to hear the noble Lord opposite give an undertaking to consult with me and others should he be in a position so to do. My noble friend Lord Brabazon of Tara stole the note that I had written down when the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, spoke. I wrote down,

<A NAME = "70320-32_para0"></a>He would expect me to say that, would he not?
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-32_para1"></a>Perhaps I may address one or two remarks to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, whom, I notice, is extraordinarily well supported on the Benches behind her on this occasion. I wonder why? Had she engaged me in some meaningful consultation, it might not even have been necessary for me to have kept the Committee this late tonight. I am glad that she emphasised the matter of partnership. We seem to be moving in that direction. Sometimes they work and sometimes they do not. I am also glad that she spoke about this Bill not being anti-car. We talk so glibly about being anti-car. It is not only the car, as part of the transport system, that does damage; it is the whole of the system, whether it is the private motor car, a truck, a bus, tram or train. In dealing with the matters in the Bill, we are dealing with the transport system--not just one element of it. I say to the noble Baroness so that all her friends can go home; that I shall not divide the Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-32_para2"></a>I now turn to my noble friend the Minister. I am grateful to him for agreeing that there will be full identification of consultees. I hear what he said about guidance being preferable. I do not agree with him, but there it is. He will not be surprised that I was not surprised that his legal advice was that there are technical deficiencies in the amendments. Were there more time, I would take these amendments and trim them for Report stage. I have had my say and I have heard the answers. I am not convinced. I have the feeling that the Committee is not minded to go through the Division Lobby at this time and in that case I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<A NAME = "70320-32_para10"></a>This is a short Bill and will clarify the powers of the Department of the Environment to charge fees for registered sellers of dead wild birds under Section 6 and for the birds registration scheme under Section 7 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The charge was made on registered sellers and keepers by the department when administering both these schemes. However, following a review some doubts arose about the proper statutory basis for charging these fees. The Bill will simply clarify those powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-32_para11"></a>The Bill has three main provisions. First, it will permit future charges to be made for the registration scheme and the registered sellers of the dead wild bird scheme should such a new scheme be reintroduced. Secondly, it will permit the recovery of charges for bird registrations which were made between 21st May 1996, which is the date on which the announcement was made in another place that the requirement for the payment of any fees were suspended, and the date when the Bill comes into force. Thirdly, it will validate all registration charges which have been made under Sections 6 and 7 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-32_para12"></a>The Bill will affect about 1,000 registered keepers of birds. The Bill is an uncontroversial measure. It will simply restore the situation to that which the department and the bird keepers had previously believed to be the case. It will not remove any rights which they expected it to have. The Bill makes no other changes to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. I beg to move.

<P>

<A NAME = "70320-32_para18"></a>The codes have three main aims.

He referred particularly to my noble friend Lord Inglewood and to Dr. Roger Bland of the British Museum. I think that we should all pay tribute to the noble Earl, Lord Perth, who has worked for seven years to get such provisions on to the statute book and to have the code of practice approved. This result is a great and patient achievement on his part.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-32_para20"></a>The noble Earl asked me to make two other points. The first is that the Act and the code of practice combined will be of great value in bringing about a better understanding of our history through archaeology. Secondly, the noble Earl wished to point out that by regularly reporting their finds, metal detectorists have a great contribution to make. It is a contribution to our heritage that they are proud to make. We wish them well in doing so and we have good reason to believe that they will be conscientious.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "70320-32_para25"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I am conscious not only of the late hour of the day--although this is not necessarily an unusually late hour at which to take Northern Ireland business--but also of the fact that this is a late hour in the life of this Parliament. I shall attempt to be brief, but I stress that that does not mean that these are not important issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-32_para26"></a>This order would withdraw from effect the statutory provisions that set up last year a forum for discussion of issues relevant to promoting dialogue and understanding within Northern Ireland. The Secretary of State is obliged, subject to parliamentary approval, to make such an order, if it appears to him that the multi-party talks that have been proceeding in Northern Ireland since last June are suspended. At the meeting of the open plenary session of the talks on 5th March there was a general recognition that further progress in the talks was impossible before the election. Accordingly, the plenary agreed to meet next on 3rd June. The Secretary of State has concluded that, in the terms of the Act, this constitutes suspension of the talks.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-32_para27"></a>This order reflects the important principle that the two institutions--talks and forum--are parallel, and that the forum should not continue to meet when the talks are no longer in process. In any event, that accords with the realities: it is unlikely in an atmosphere increasingly dominated by electoral considerations that the forum could go properly about its remit of discussion of issues relevant to promoting dialogue and understanding. The practical difficulties of meeting during an election period have in any event now led the forum to adjourn itself over the period.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-32_para28"></a>The work that the forum has undertaken, chaired with much effort and commitment by Mr. John Gorman, has been valued by some. Others have doubted that it has taken significant steps in the promotion of dialogue and understanding that were seen as the essence of the forum's remit. But evidently the parties at the forum have come to a greater understanding of one another's views. I should say that we firmly believe that the forum would have been a better institution had the Social Democratic and Labour Party continued to attend it rather than withdrawing from it as it did last summer. I hope that its position may be open to reconsideration.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-32_para29"></a>Even without this order, the forum's initial lifespan would in any event have expired at the end of May this year. But the Secretary of State is empowered to revive it, <P>


<a name="column_1157"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1157</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with parliamentary approval, for a further period, or periods, until the end of May 1998. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has said that it would be the intention of a Conservative Government to revive the forum as early as practicable in the life of a new Parliament; and the Opposition have spoken in similar terms of the intentions of a future Labour Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-32_para30"></a>The forum should, in conformity with the scheme which your Lordships approved last year, cease to meet because the talks have finished. That is right in principle and is a recognition of the practicalities as we approach a succession of elections. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="70320-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>   My Lords, the Act is entitled the Northern Ireland (Entry to Negotiations, etc.) Act. We know that "etc" can mean many things in Northern Ireland. I recall vividly that when the legislation to establish both the talks and the forum first went through the House, many of us had misgivings about the setting up of the forum and the conditions under which the election to that forum was held. There was the added impetus of a deliberately rigged set of election laws to ensure that certain people would get seats. Although 10 parties were represented, the rules ensured that some of those people who were originally to have a seat at the forum and at the peace talks got only a derisory number of votes in the election. That was the Government's intention.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-33_para0"></a>I expressed reservations about the circumstances surrounding the election to the forum. Indeed, I recall that my noble friend Lord Merlyn-Rees, a former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, expressed similar reservations and said that it would be hard to get those who had been elected to the forum to give up their seats at any given time. I think that our reservations have been proved correct. No sooner had the forum been elected, than the members of the SDLP--the party which I had the honour to bring into being and which I represented for many years--and of Sinn Fein said that, although they had been elected, they were not going to take their seats but would withdraw from the forum. That meant, in effect, that those members who remained in the forum could be charged with representing only one section of the community in Northern Ireland. As such, the forum was not guaranteed any success or longevity.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-33_para1"></a>I bitterly regret the fact that the forum did not have more success. I have never believed in abstention. I believe that if you go to the electorate and receive their mandate in votes, you should use that mandate to take part in whatever institution or whatever forum may exist and that you should put forward your point of view. I do not believe--I have never believed--in abstention, but unfortunately the party which I formed and which I led for many years seems to have changed and, wherever it may not be in a winning position, now seems to absent itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-33_para2"></a>I am sorry that the Forum has ceased to exist. I agree with the noble Baroness that John Gorman has proved to be an admirable chairman. He has done everything to <P>


<a name="column_1158"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>prove that the Forum is an institution that would in time have gained the respect of the whole community in Northern Ireland. I only hope that whatever may be the next Parliament, the Forum will be re-created. I make a heartfelt plea that those who are elected to the Forum should attend it, sometimes in a minority. In a democratic society one cannot have a situation where at all times one's views are paramount. I appeal to the SDLP, if and when the Forum is reconstituted, to attend it. I do not appeal to Sinn Fein because I do not believe that it is amenable to any kind of reason.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-33_para3"></a>The noble Baroness has said that this is the last occasion in this Parliament on which we shall be able to discuss Northern Ireland. As I have said many times before, I believe that she has carried out the functions of all her offices in Northern Ireland with admirable rectitude. She has gained the support and affection of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland. It is on this issue that I should like to put a specific question. I understand that following a controversy that has arisen over the past few weeks in relation to employment activities within her department an inquiry has been set up into the circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-33_para4"></a>I do not believe that an inquiry is necessary. I believe that the Northern Ireland Office was wrong to set it up. What is much more disturbing is that the person who is to chair the inquiry is a retired civil servant who has relations with those who are still civil servants in the Northern Ireland Office. I believe that he has been given the task of inquiring into an office which was within the remit of the noble Baroness.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-33_para5"></a>I have heard very disquieting rumours circulating in Northern Ireland to the effect that, having been given this remit, he is to report back to a civil servant who has been central to the whole dispute in Northern Ireland. That appears to me to be a matter of "Ask my brother if I am a liar". I believe that if there is to be an inquiry it should report back, not to a civil servant, but to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. It would be disgraceful if that inquiry took place--I do not believe that it should have been set up in the first place--and reported back to an ex-civil servant or anyone within the Civil Service in Northern Ireland who had been central to the whole dispute.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-33_para6"></a>I ask the noble Baroness: with what terms of reference has this inquiry been set up? To whom and when will it report? I believe that it would be totally unconstitutional if the inquiry reported back to a civil servant who had been central to the whole dispute within her office.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Cooke of Islandreagh: </B>   My Lords, I support all that the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, has said about labour relations within the noble Baroness's office. It is causing great concern, upset and annoyance. As the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, said in a debate last week, this matter has been misreported and misrepresented. It is total nonsense. The noble Baroness has done nothing at all to interfere in any way with good relations in her office. The way that this matter has been taken up is causing great annoyance throughout Northern Ireland. The investigation is quite unnecessary and, I believe, out of order. I also believe that it is out of order that &#163;10,000 compensation has been paid to one complainant. I hope that the noble Baroness can <P>


<a name="column_1159"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>soon forget about it. In no way is she at fault. I also hope that the Forum will be restored as soon as possible. Even without the SDLP it has performed a valuable function, in that boys and girls with no previous experience of politics have learnt to debate and discuss. I believe that this is the start of the education of young people to get them involved in politics. There has not been such an opportunity in Northern Ireland for 25 years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-33_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, I too should like to add my very strong support not only for this Order but for what has just been said by both noble Lords. My noble friend has played and is playing a vital part in the work of bringing inward investment and development to the Province, despite all the uncertainties arising from the end of the ceasefire. She has shown great courage, persistence and address in visiting many parts of the Province despite the dangers. She tirelessly advances the cause of the people of Northern Ireland in the US and elsewhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-33_para7"></a>It would be disgraceful if Sinn Fein/IRA and certain others, who have not scrupled to undermine her as far as they can, were able to use an incident in which my noble friend had behaved with absolute propriety and thus deprive Northern Ireland of one of its best assets. I do not like to see assets wasted. I see from the Irish News that Mr. Mitchell McLoughlin intends to try to make capital of all this and continue the campaign of vilification with his friends in Congress when he visits the US. That shows how much Sinn Fein/IRA care about the future prosperity of Northern Ireland that my noble friend has done so much to advance. For us to allow that to happen would be disgraceful; and it would also demonstrate political ineptitude.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-33_para8"></a>I still believe that the talks have a future, but sadly at present my noble friend represents the only area of our future strategy in a troubled land which can be seen to be working well. I know that she has been privately sustained and encouraged by many of her colleagues in Government; but what is needed urgently is strong public support of the kind that Ministers are usually quick to give their colleagues under attack. So far I hear a loud silence and, behind that, the rustlings in the local undergrowth--the unworthy manoeuvrings of certain small animals (perhaps weasels and ferrets) who wish that my noble friend would go away and leave them to run their comfortable sub-culture in their own way. Fortunately, my noble friend is brave as well as committed. I do not believe that she will go away.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-33_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McConnell: </B>   My Lords, I also support what has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Fitt. The noble Baroness has gained great respect in Northern Ireland. She has worked extremely hard and produced very good results. It is outrageous that she should be attacked in this way. We support her in this House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-33_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Denton of Wakefield: </B>   My Lords, I thank noble Lords for their very generous and kind comments. I believe that there are others who share the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, about the constitutional implications of the inquiry. I shall ensure that I draw these matters to the attention of my right honourable friend the <P>


<a name="column_1160"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1160</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Secretary of State. But we come here this evening to discuss the suspension of the Forum. The noble Lord, Lord Fitt, was right to say that abstention was not the way to move anything forward. I hope that people will not be elected to Westminster with the avowed intention of not taking their seats. I believe that participation in Westminster and Parliament is a great privilege and one that is not to be ignored.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-33_para9"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Cooke and Lord Fitt, drew attention to the fact that dialogue in Northern Ireland was the way forward. Despite the abstentions, there has been successful dialogue and much understanding of, but not agreement with, alternative views. The committees of the Forum with which I have dealt on specific subject matters have been industrious and demonstrated a commitment that is to be admired.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-33_para10"></a>My noble friend Lady Park shares my concerns that the personal attacks have been used by Sinn Fein in Washington to create hazards in relation to the bringing of jobs to Northern Ireland.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-33_para11"></a>I should like to share with your Lordships the fact that yesterday I was able to announce that there are now more people in work in Northern Ireland than ever before. That is something in which we should take pride. It is something we have achieved. This is merely a suspension. I am pleased to say that with the commitment of both leading contenders in the election the Forum can look forward to doing more good work. I commend the order to the House.

<P>

<A NAME = "70320-34_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the draft order before your Lordships' House this evening would continue in force for a further 12 months from 16th June the temporary provisions of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-34_para1"></a>Since the first Emergency Provisions Act was passed in 1973 it has been an annual duty falling upon your Lordships' House to consider whether the provisions remain necessary and should be renewed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-34_para2"></a>Your Lordships are familiar with the issues which underlie this evening's debate. Each year we must consider the Act against the background of the prevailing security situation in Northern Ireland, and against the report of the independent reviewer of the Act, Mr. John Rowe QC.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-34_para3"></a>I shall describe the change in the security situation since the predecessor Act, the 1991 Emergency Provisions Act, was last reviewed in June last year.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-34_para4"></a>At that time we had already experienced the horror of the terrorists' renewed campaign; and my right honourable friend the Home Secretary had introduced, <P>


<a name="column_1161"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1161</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and Parliament had passed, new powers under the Prevention of Terrorism Act to give the police in England and Wales the same range of responses to terrorism as the police and the Army have under the Emergency Provisions Act in Northern Ireland. There has been no terrorist attack on the mainland since Manchester in June last year. There is no room for complacency, however, and we know that the absence of attacks on the mainland since June has in part been down to security force successes in tracking down the terrorists and their caches of arms, ammunition and explosives.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-34_para5"></a>Tonight, however, we are concerned with Northern Ireland and the use of the Emergency Provisions Act to counter the renewed terrorist threat there.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-34_para6"></a>Such has been the intensification of the Provisional IRA's campaign since the Lisburn bombs in October that, excluding attacks aborted or thwarted by security forces, serious terrorist attacks are currently occurring at the rate of one every three or four days. And it is with great sorrow that we are reminded of the cruel and untimely deaths of Warrant Officer James Bradwell and Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick. Those brave men have paid the ultimate sacrifice. They are representative of the courage and the dedication of the men and women of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Armed Forces whose professionalism and effectiveness is reflected in the significant catalogue of successes achieved against the terrorists over recent months.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-34_para7"></a>There can be little doubt that such successes have been assisted in some cases by the powers available to the security forces by virtue of the Emergency Provisions Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-34_para8"></a>There is no doubt that the powers contained in the Act are still needed. Independent reports have shown that they have been used properly in the past year. Mr. John Rowe recommends the renewal of the powers. I urge your Lordships to renew them for a further year, thus ensuring that the range of measures available to combat terrorism is kept intact. In the meantime, I ask that we all work towards and pray for a peaceful solution. Until that arrives, the Act is important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-34_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McConnell: </B>   My Lords, I have spoken a few times on this Act, and so I intend to be brief on this occasion. I want merely to say that I still support it, because I believe that the vast majority of decent people in Northern Ireland deserve to be protected from terrorism. As the Minister told us, murder and intimidation continue. There is not just murder and maiming, but the kind of intimidation in which people are told that if they do not get out onto the streets and protest they will be dealt with. That is more insidious even than the straight terrorist attack.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-34_para10"></a>I am pleased that the Minister referred to the Report of Mr. John Rowe QC who strongly recommended that:
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-34_para11"></a>So, as I have said, I support the Act. I congratulate the RUC and the military on the way in which they have stood up for the ordinary people of Northern Ireland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-34_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>   My Lords, I wish that I could put my hand on my heart and oppose the order. I was a Member of another place when the Bill was put through. As one who believes in civil liberties, I resisted many of its proposals. But as the years have advanced and my understanding of the events in Northern Ireland has increased, it would be in total contradiction of my own conscience were I to register a vote against the order.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-34_para12"></a>However, I want to put on record, and I am sure that the Minister will not object, that although she said the order was needed in Northern Ireland--she referred to the deaths of the warrant officer and the soldier--intimidation is taking place there from both sides of the community. All the intimidation, murders and mayhem that have taken place are not restricted to the IRA.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-34_para13"></a>Only a few days ago, a father in Northern Ireland who was making up a bottle for his young child was murdered. We suspect it was by those engaged in Loyalist violence. Every effort must be used to try to apprehend the murderous criminals on both sides of the religious and political divide, because many people in Northern Ireland believe that there is too much concentration on the activities of the IRA. There are two murderous elements in Northern Ireland. Both of them should be treated with the same concern.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-34_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Cooke of Islandreagh: </B>   My Lords, I support the order, because under the present conditions with IRA/Sinn Fein making every effort to bomb and murder people, it is absolutely necessary. I wish particularly to acknowledge the debt which all of us in Northern Ireland owe to the security forces, the police and the Armed Forces. Their expertise and devotion to duty in recent months have prevented or interfered with probably three out of four of the attempts of the IRA to kill and maim people.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-34_para14"></a>The police have been greatly helped by the stream of timely information they have received from all quarters, often from people who put themselves at risk in passing the information. That support for the police is a hopeful sign for the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-34_para15"></a>We spoke earlier of the Minister's problem in relation to employment, but I have not had an opportunity to acknowledge the remarkable work she has done in Northern Ireland in the past three or four years. She has been the Minister responsible for the economy and for agriculture. That was previously full-time work for two men. She has been responsible for almost all the wealth-creating sectors of the Province. In addition to demolishing a vast mountain of work, she has visited countless factories and farms throughout the Province. She has listened. She has explained. She has commended, and she has been helpful where appropriate. Community barriers have meant nothing to her during her visits. She has boosted morale and helped people to feel that government are not remote, which has generally been the case in recent years. The consistently improving employment figures, which are the lowest ever, show that she has not worked in vain. Whenever the noble Baroness <P>


<a name="column_1163"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1163</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>leaves Northern Ireland--and I hope that it will not be for a very long time--she will be much missed and remembered with affection.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-34_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Denton of Wakefield: </B>   My Lords, again, your kindness excels. I believe that I almost heard the noble Lord, Lord Cooke, say that one woman can do the work of two men. That perhaps is not in dispute between my colleagues and I on the Front Bench.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-34_para16"></a>There is no greater product than Northern Ireland to sell to the world. I am delighted that business--after all, government facilitates but business creates employment--has played a magnificent and increasing role during my years there. That has given us all much pleasure.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-34_para17"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, that killing people is wrong in any community. The death of the father of seven children is much to be condemned. Extreme sympathy is offered to the families. There will be no greater celebration than in your Lordships' House when we do not have to bring this order forward. I hope that one day the intellect of those indulging in violence will suddenly wake up to the fact that it will not work. In the meantime, we must again bring forward the emergency provisions order and I commend it to the House.

At the same time, the Government are consulting interested parties on wider decision-making and related powers which the report has recommended for a parades commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-35_para1"></a>The measures which are being introduced now will implement recommendations which do not hinge on the outcome of the wider consultation. We consider it important that these measures should be in place for this year's main marching season.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-35_para2"></a>The proposed order will make a number of amendments to the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987. These include measures relating to the requirements to notify the police of a public procession or parade. The current seven days' notice has been clearly shown to be insufficient time to reach agreement at local level, particularly in respect of contentious marches. We are therefore increasing the period of notice from seven to 21 days in line with the review team's recommendation. Where it is not reasonably practicable for the organiser of a parade to give 21 days' notice--for example, a march arranged in support of an industrial dispute--the organisers will have to explain to the police the reason for the short notice.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-35_para3"></a>The draft order will give the police power to confiscate alcohol where it is being consumed at or in the vicinity of any place along the route of a parade or in the possession of persons travelling to a parade. These measures will therefore apply to those taking part in a parade, to others not directly involved in a parade and to those demonstrating against a parade. The powers are discretionary and implementation of them by the RUC will depend on the situation at the time. I beg to move.

<A NAME="70320-35_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, there is an elegiac tone to our discussions tonight. When the Minister and I were both young, which hardly seems a day ago, the Rolling Stones were in their full prime. I always thought that one of their better offerings was "This could be the last time".
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-35_para5"></a>There are familiar friends here tonight, not least the noble Viscount, Lord Long, and the noble Lords, Lord McConnell, Lord Fitt and Lord Cooke of Islandreagh. We have been together on so many occasions discussing Northern Ireland business. We all agree that we have always been dealing with a Minister of very high quality. She has dealt with all the issues with candour and decency. She has the respect of all who deal with her and, rather more rare among political figures, liking and trust. She has another very great virtue. When she speaks of a draft order she pronounces it correctly as draft, and not in that rather effete, southern way of--dare I try it?--dra-aft. It is definitely draft, not dra-aft.

<A NAME = "70320-35_para6"></a>She spoke about an appalling slur which appeared in Hansard in another place. I have to say that it is a corrupt Hansard because when the Member for Lewisham said that he thought it was a money-making scheme for lawyers, what he intended to say was that he was sure it was not a money-making scheme for lawyers. Curiously, the Hansard reporter omitted the word "not".
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-35_para7"></a>Noble Lords who spoke earlier mentioned the assertions made about the Minister's conduct. I do not know the ins and outs of those assertions, but I share with the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, the belief that there are ignoble motives here and hidden hands at work. We cannot leave it there. I turn for the support of all noble Lords and the noble Baroness, and, for the purpose of the record, I see that I have the approval of all of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-35_para8"></a>A report is being carried out. It would not be right, proper or fair if the Minister's position is not properly and scrupulously protected in the way that she is entitled, if necessary by the provision of legal representation and advice at public expense. That is the very least a Minister of the Crown is entitled to look to. The noble Baroness, Lady Park, spoke of the public support which might have been more vociferous. I note that and respectfully concur.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-35_para9"></a>We cannot expect people to do difficult work if they are subject to what may be an insidious attempt at the assassination of a character which does not justify it. The Minister is entitled to the protection to which anyone else would reasonably look and which we would insist upon. I leave that matter there.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-35_para10"></a>Your Lordships know that on this side of the House we have serious doubts about the speed of progress in relation to North. It is graceless and fruitless to repeat those doubts which I still have. But whatever happens in the election, I wish the Minister well in the future.

<P>
<A NAME="70320-35_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Denton of Wakefield: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Williams. There is an enormous comfort in being a Member of your Lordships' House. I would like to take the opportunity to say that I have received enormous courtesy from all noble Lords involved with Northern Ireland business over the past three years. I have also welcomed and enjoyed the bipartisan approach to Northern Ireland issues which has been adopted on the basis that a solution is so necessary. I apologise on behalf of the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, who cannot be here because he could not move the time of the last plane back to the Province, however influential he may now be as a Member of your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-35_para11"></a>On this side of the House, we have moved on from the Rolling Stones to the Spice Girls, but one's LSE tags always pull one back. In this House I have experienced unfailing concern for Northern Ireland and its future. I have indeed been fortunate in the past three years to work with noble Lords who have questioned, sometimes criticised and frequently expressed amazement at the length of time that legislation has been in coming.

<A NAME = "70320-35_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, your Lordships will be aware that the Data Protection Act 1984 gives people a general right to know what information is held about them on computer.

<a name="column_1167"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1167</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>circumstances when it could be damaging, and possibly disastrous. I believe that we need to curb access to this data where it could aid unlawful behaviour. This is especially important when the interests of innocent people are put at risk. That need was recognised in the Data Protection Act. The Act includes, at Section 30, a power which allows the Secretary of State to exempt personal data from this general right of access if it is held for the purposes of discharging statutory functions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-35_para20"></a>Your Lordships will be aware that a number of regulators have been granted such an exemption to enable them to exercise their duties effectively. The draft order now before your Lordships' House seeks to include the new pensions regulator, called the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority but known for short as OPRA. OPRA was set up by the Pensions Act 1995. It has the prime responsibility for ensuring the security of the &#163;500 billion worth of assets which back the rights of members of occupational pension schemes.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-35_para21"></a>OPRA has been given substantial powers to help it carry out this task effectively. These include a power to fine individuals and organisations acting as trustees of schemes, as well as being able to prohibit unsuitable people from being trustees. So OPRA will acquire a great deal of sensitive information.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-35_para22"></a>Your Lordships will recognise the use that "fraudsters" could make of a situation where OPRA was forced to allow anyone suspected of misusing assets to have full knowledge of the information held about them. This knowledge could be used to frustrate an investigation, either by the destruction of records or by suborning people.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-35_para23"></a>The order now before your Lordships' House is designed to ensure that, from the outset, OPRA is able to protect information from premature and damaging subject access.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-35_para24"></a>Your Lordships will wish to know that the Data Protection Registrar has been consulted about the terms of the order, as is required under Section 40 of the Act. She has pronounced herself satisfied with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-35_para25"></a>I believe that this order is essential to enable OPRA to carry out its functions effectively. It forms a small but important part in the overall provisions designed to safeguard the pensions of millions of people. It will thus enable people to invest with confidence in funded pension provision for their retirement. That is something which I hope we can all support. I commend this order to the House.

<P>

<A NAME = "70320-36_para15"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, where I come from in Norfolk, in the days when harvesting was done by binder and the last sheaf of corn was thrown onto the trailer, people used to say, "That is the one we have been looking for". As this Parliament draws to a close and as these regulations are the last of all the business to be transacted, not just in this Session but in this Parliament, one could say that, "This is the one we have been looking for".
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-36_para16"></a>Some of your Lordships may consider it slightly ironic that the distinction of being the last business of Parliament should fall to the Hedgerows Regulations and the distinction of being the last of all the government business which, over the years, I have had the privilege of presenting to your Lordships should be the Hedgerows Regulations. However, as they say, that is the way that the cookie has crumbled.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-36_para17"></a>I should declare an interest in that I am, in the current departmental jargon a "land manager", which, in normal parlance, means a farmer. I should confess, without any regret, that over the years I have removed some hedges which have resulted in the farm for which I have some responsibility both looking and operating better.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-36_para18"></a>Having made such a confession to your Lordships, I have the remarkable privilege of inviting the Houses to approve the Hedgerows Regulations 1997. In seeking the approval of the House for these draft regulations, I should acknowledge at the outset that there is a certain sensitivity on the subject matter of which I am only too well aware. Hedgerow protection is an issue which provokes strong emotions, and very different reactions. This was evident in the variety of views which we received in response to the public consultation which we carried out. We have considered carefully the views which have been expressed and have adjusted our proposals accordingly.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-36_para19"></a>The changes which we have made do not alter the fundamental notification scheme on which we consulted. We have responded to the views which were expressed, increasing the time which was allowed for local planning authorities to give or to refuse consent to the removal of a hedgerow. Authorities will also be required to consult parish councils before giving consent. Moreover, we are requiring local authorities to take into account the reasons which are given for wishing to remove a hedge.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-36_para20"></a>We have also taken some steps to try to simplify the criteria on which a hedge is considered to be important. That may surprise noble Lords when they look at the regulations; nevertheless, we have done so by removing some of the criteria which were generally considered to have been difficult to work. The regulations recognise the importance of hedgerows alongside public rights of way. We have also made clear that the regulations will be subject to review and that they may be amended in the light of practical experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-36_para21"></a>There is clearly a difficult balance to keep between those who wish to see the countryside remain as they know it and those whose life and livelihood depends on the proper tending of the countryside. The countryside cannot be fossilised. It changes; indeed, it always will. It alters--the conditions in which it has to operate change.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-36_para22"></a>The Government think that the draft Hedgerows Regulations now before the House strike a reasonable balance between the wishes of those in favour of widespread protection, and the concerns of those who have regard to some aspects of the tending of the countryside and who consider our proposals to be unnecessarily burdensome.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-36_para23"></a>I shall conclude my introduction to the regulations by reminding your Lordships that among all the brouhaha surrounding hedgerows, some 400 miles more of hedgerows are planted each year than are removed.

<P>
<A NAME="70320-36_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hilton of Eggardon: </B>   My Lords, we are grateful that, at long last, some regulations on hedgerows have been produced. This was a manifesto commitment of the Conservative Party back in 1992 and was a topic which we discussed extensively during the proceedings on the Environment Act. At this very late hour in this Parliament the regulations have been produced; but we are deeply disappointed by the content. It is not only my party that is deeply disappointed; English Nature, which is an emanation of the Government, has also expressed its disappointment at the weakness of the regulations. Moreover, the Council for the Protection of Rural England is also deeply disappointed with the content of the regulations and, indeed, has said that it is as bad as having no regulations at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-36_para25"></a>One of the great problems about hedgerows--and under these regulations only 10 per cent. will be protected--is the deterioration in their quality. There is no support for farmers to keep hedgerows up and, as they decline, they no longer fall within the definition of <P>


<a name="column_1171"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1171</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>important hedgerows. Similarly, there is no protection for young hedgerows. There is no opportunity for up-to-date research on hedgerows. The regulations only provide that their status at the time when the regulations are passed will count. Therefore, no future research can be allowed. Only four weeks is allowed for local authorities to designate hedges. Almost inevitably farmers will apply for planning permission to have their hedges rooted up during the winter when it is much harder to show the considerable bio- diversity of plants, birds, animals, and so on, which are preserved by hedgerows. As I said, we are deeply disappointed with the regulations. The Labour Party has a long standing commitment to give proper protection to hedgerows. We shall, therefore, bring forward at the earliest possible moment in the new Parliament effective measures to protect hedgerows in future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-36_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Stanley of Alderney: </B>   My Lords, I do not know whether my noble friend Lord Ferrers will remember it, but he was the government Minister when, on the 16th January 1974, he had to congratulate me on my maiden speech which dealt with fencing and hedgerows. I do not think that he will do the same this evening. Indeed, I am sorry to say that I cannot recall my noble friend ever congratulating me again since that time. Nevertheless, hope springs eternal.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-36_para26"></a>I hope that I will not embarrass my noble friend and I also hope that he will not be too irate with me but, as your Lordships may realise, this is his last appearance on the Front Bench. After all these years--and, as noble Lords know, I have known him for quite a time--perhaps I may say how much I shall miss him. In fact, more than that, I should stress how much all of us will miss him. Apart from being an excellent Minister who listens, my noble friend has a very strong sense of humour; indeed, I have often cried with laughter at his replies to stupid questions, some of which I fear may have come from me.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-36_para27"></a>I have but three questions to ask my noble friend the Minister before he giggles again. First, will the guidance notes which are to accompany the regulations be consulted on very soon and be in place by 1st June? Secondly, will those who apply to remove a hedgerow have to pay a fee? Thirdly, if a hedgerow becomes an important hedgerow, does it incur a land charge?
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-36_para28"></a>As my noble friend said, I know about the struggle that the Government experience when trying to get any form of agreement between the various parties. There is little love lost between certain so-called "countryside organisations", many farmers and landowners--that, of course, includes me. Therefore I congratulate the Government on managing to issue the regulations and for bringing the organisations, farmers and landowners together. I also congratulate them on meeting the guidelines laid down by Parliament in the Environment Act 1995, much as I wish they had not been laid down.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-36_para29"></a>I take the view that we should have the absolute minimum of regulation in the countryside. I also take the view that those who live and work in the countryside should be allowed as free a hand as possible. However, these regulations do the opposite. Sadly the majority do not have the privilege of working in the country. As we <P>

I wish my noble friend well.

However, it is my understanding that the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, is proposing to retire from the Front Bench, whatever the result of the election. As one who has faced him across the Table from the other Dispatch Box on many occasions, I wish to pay tribute to him for all the work he has done for his party but even more for the House as a whole.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-37_para0"></a>I was going to say that the noble Earl has always been courteous, but he has not actually; he is quite capable of being very rude indeed, and indeed being personally rude on occasion. However, he gets away with it because he has a wonderful aura of authority which he carries around with him and which is the subject of great admiration on all sides of the House. He has been a most distinguished servant of the House and of his party. We wish him well in whatever he chooses to do.

<A NAME="70320-37_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, I associate myself totally with everything that has been said about my noble friend, who is also almost my neighbour. However, I wish to say a few words about hedgerows. I declare two interests: one as chairman of the Council for the Protection of Rural England, and, secondly, as a Suffolk farmer.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-37_para1"></a>I suppose in declaring the second interest I should also say one or two things about hedgerows. First, in my early days of farming I behaved in rather a vandalistic way and took out hedgerows. I now much regret having done that. That was 25 years ago. Since that time I have tried to replace them. I have planted a large number of them and they have done extremely well. The only reason for saying that is that I think it shows that sinners can be brought to repentance in these matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-37_para2"></a>I know the difficulties which my noble friend and my right honourable friend have had in bringing forward this legislation, which has been controversial. However, I believe that much of the controversy which inhibited my noble friend and our right honourable friend from bringing forward legislation which I should have liked to have been able to welcome wholeheartedly has been the idea that the conflicts between farming and the land-owning interests, on the one side, and the conservation interests, on the other, cannot be reconciled. I think that is a misapprehension. I believe that it is perfectly possible to farm economically, profitably, sensibly and in an environmentally acceptable way. Furthermore, I believe there are increasing numbers of farmers who are farming in that way, so the trend is in the right direction.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-37_para3"></a>In fact most of the damage that has been done to our landscape in the past has not been done by ordinary working farmers. In the early 1970s it became <P>


<a name="column_1173"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1173</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>fashionable for institutional investors to buy land for which they paid absurd prices. They did so because it was fashionable to have land in their portfolios. They would then set targets for a rate of return on the land which meant that the managers they employed to achieve the rate of return massacred the landscape. That was tragic and it is much regretted by all of us.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-37_para4"></a>Of course I welcome the fact that there are some regulations because there is a big difference between having some and having none, but I cannot say that they make an awful lot of sense as they are drafted at the moment. They have some good aspects. I shall mention first the good aspects. The fact that parish councils are to be consulted is a big plus. I hope very much that active parish councils will take a close interest--using this legislation and their right to be consulted--in urging local authorities to scrutinise the applications, which in general there will have to be, for the destruction of hedgerows.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-37_para5"></a>However, as has been pointed out by the noble Baroness opposite, unfortunately only a small proportion of hedgerows are covered by the legislation. It astonishes me that the regulations refer to hedgerows which have existed for 30 years or more. However, young hedgerows are every bit as important and often--as my own newly planted hedgerows have been--have been planted with public money. It seems to me quite wrong to frame regulations for the protection of hedgerows which do not prevent the destruction of hedgerows, for which the taxpayer has helped to pay. That does not make sense to me.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-37_para6"></a>I do not understand the penalties for illegally pulling up hedgerows. The maximum fine for defying a pre-preservation order is &#163;20,000. The maximum fine for illegally and wilfully taking out a hedgerow which is protected is only &#163;5,000. I simply do not understand that. The important point is that hedgerows are a crucial part of the landscape of this country. We cannot afford to make the landscape less attractive for our children and our children's children. Although the intention behind these regulations is moving in the right direction--and I would even go as far as to say that my right honourable friend's heart is in the right place, although I suspect I risk a tremendous reproof for saying that, and perhaps my noble friend's heart is also in the right place--the regulations are disappointing. I hope that whoever wins the election--obviously I hope very much it will be my party--will have another look at these regulations and will ensure that they are made much more satisfactory in terms of achieving the objectives which I believe we all share.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-37_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   My Lords, at the outset I had no intention of making any comment on these regulations, which I welcome. However, having heard today that my noble friend Lord Ferrers will no longer speak from the Front Bench, I wish to add to the tribute which has already been paid to him. I describe myself as an ordinary Conservative Back-Bencher who has been involved with environmental matters, and thus I am closely connected with the interests of my noble friend. I wish to pay tribute to the enormous care he has taken in listening to <P>


<a name="column_1174"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1174</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what those on his Back-Benches have said to him over the years. I am sure he would be the first to agree that he has not always listened as closely as perhaps we would have liked, but he has always shown a great deal of interest in what we have had to say--sometimes that has been fruitful and sometimes it has not. I am extremely grateful to my noble friend for the considerable interest that he has shown in the concerns that have been expressed from these Benches.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-37_para7"></a>I suppose I had to look for an excuse to comment on the regulations. My excuse runs something along these lines. Whereas I broadly welcome the regulations, hedgerows in themselves are not necessarily a conduit for wildlife. Hedgerows must be properly managed. I wonder whether there will be guidelines or some sort of encouragement for people to look after hedgerows in a constructive fashion. I hope this question is not a "fast ball" because I would not wish our relationship to end on that note. But what sort of assurances can he give the House that hedgerows will not only exist-- I welcome that--but will be managed properly?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-37_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am deeply grateful for what your Lordships have said about these regulations, and for the kind remarks by my noble friend Lord Peel and the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, and I crossed swords periodically on a number of occasions when I had the privilege of being in the Home Office. I always enjoyed those occasions. If I may say so, the noble Lord always treated me totally fairly, straightforwardly and courteously, even if at times it was savagely. I am grateful to him for that. I look forward to seeing him sitting on those Benches again--and having the same problems as he has had recently. I watched the noble Lord deal with my noble friend Lady Blatch. I have never forgotten the courtesy that he displayed to me. I am grateful to him for that and for his kind words.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-37_para8"></a>The noble Lord said that I had an air of authority. I did not know that. One does not know these things. I sometimes think that if one brought a skunk into the room, everyone would know it because a skunk gives off an awful smell; but the skunk does not know that because it is natural to him. All I can say is that I am not aware of all these wonderful things that the noble Lord said. I think that it is a figment of his imagination. I am sure that he would not say it at two o'clock in the afternoon.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-37_para9"></a>Dare I come to the noble Baroness, Lady Hilton? The noble Baroness was deeply disappointed. My goodness, my Lords! She does not realise how lucky she is to have these regulations. They appeared like a whale out of the water yesterday afternoon. No one thought that they would appear. It was thought that they were lost down the pipe as a result of the forthcoming general election. But they have come. And what does the noble Baroness say? She says, "We are deeply disappointed. They only cover 10 per cent.". The noble Baroness has not done her homework properly: the regulations will cover 20 per cent. She said, "There is no encouragement for maintaining the hedges". My goodness me, my Lords--what does the noble Baroness want? Does she want to pay people grants to maintain the hedges?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-37_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said that there is no support for young hedgerows. As I explained to her, 400 more miles of hedgerows are planted than are grubbed up. I do not see why we have to encourage that support. Then she said that there are only four weeks for the local authorities to give their views. The noble Baroness is wrong on that: there are six weeks. If she cared to read all 25 pages of the regulations she would understand a little more about them.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-37_para11"></a>My noble friend Lord Stanley did not declare an interest! He is a farmer. I bet that he has grubbed out some hedges in his time; but he did not say anything about that.

<A NAME="70320-38_spnew0"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-38_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, he said that I had congratulated him on his maiden speech. But we all make errors of judgment. The noble Lord has never stopped talking since, and after some of the comments he has made subsequently, I might have been more modest in my congratulations. However, he has been a great and loyal supporter of the Conservative Party and in your Lordships' House that is a good thing. He, too, said some nice words to which I listened with pleasure. He said--I regarded it as a great compliment--that sometimes he had listened to my answers to some of the stupid questions that I was asked and cried with laughter. And then he asked me three stupid questions. He might just as well start crying with laughter now because I shall give him the answers to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para0"></a>The noble Lord kindly let me know the questions that he would ask. First, will the guidance notes accompany the regulations and will they be consulted on very soon? The answer is yes, that is the intention. Secondly, will those who apply to remove the hedgerow have to pay a fee? The answer is no. Thirdly, if a hedgerow becomes an important hedgerow does it incur a land charge? The answer to that is no.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para1"></a>My noble friend Lord Peel said that he did not want to end a relationship on a sour note. But no relationship is ended. Nothing from my noble friend would ever be on a sour note. I have forgotten the question that he asked. All I have written down is "hedgerows". I presume that he asked a question on hedgerows. I shall read Hansard and ensure that he has a reply.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para2"></a>My noble friend Lord Marlesford is sitting there, the chairman of the Council for the Protection of Rural England. I was not quite certain whether he welcomed the regulations. He said that my heart was in the right place. Of course it is in the right place--he should know that. He said that he had made some mistakes when he was young. The only trouble is that he continues to make them and he has no regrets. Then he made an absurd suggestion. He asked why on earth should hedgerows be allowed to be pulled out after having been planted only 30 years because they had been planted with public money. Of course they have not been planted with public money. Farmers who have planted hedgerows have had the benefit of grants, as they have had for a number of things. If my noble friend suggests that any hedge ever planted must stay there sacrosanct, he has much to consider and understand.

<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para3"></a>But the thing that really distresses me about my noble friend is that there he is, the head of this great institution, badgering on that we must have hedgerow regulations. He has been running around like a headless chicken asking, "When are we going to have these regulations?" Now we have produced them. And what does the Council for the Protection of Rural England say? I shall tell your Lordships. The council issued a press release. And what was the press release headed? It is headed,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"CPRE slates hedgerows S.I.". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para4"></a>I quote the council's own press release. It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"CPRE has slammed the statutory instrument ... for protecting 'important' hedgerows which the Government laid before Parliament today...Sir Angus Stirling, Chairman of CPRE's Policy Committee said: </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>'These regulations are almost worse than having no regulations at all'." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para5"></a>Yet my noble friend Lord Marlesford runs around saying, "We must have these regulations". And when we produce them that is all that his council can say. I just wish that his council and his chairman spoke with a single tongue. My noble friend has some odd ideas. He said that he would rather have nuclear reactors in the countryside than wind farms. Whether that represents the views of the CPRE, I do not know. But the CPRE and my noble friend seem to walk out of step with each other. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has gone out of his way to meet the views of the CPRE and others. I think that they might have given him more acclamation than that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para6"></a>Having said that, my noble friend lives close to me. I know him well. I am delighted to see him smiling away. I hope that he will talk to me after this. But I think he talks a lot of rubbish sometimes and this evening was one such time.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para7"></a>I am grateful for the enthusiastic welcome that your Lordships have given to these hedgerow regulations. I commend the regulations.

<P>
<A NAME="70320-38_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, in moving the adjournment of the House I wish to say the customary word of thanks to all those who have worked so hard to ensure the efficient running of your Lordships' House throughout this Session, and indeed throughout this Parliament. It has been only a few weeks since Christmas and this Session has been shorter than a normal Session. However, I am sure that your Lordships will agree with me that everyone has worked extremely hard, particularly in the past few weeks, to ensure the orderly completion of business in this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para9"></a>As always, I do not wish to draw particular attention to any specific individuals or groups of staff since to do so would run the risk of failing to name some key individual or group. My thanks are to all the staff of this House. Seen and unseen, they do so much to make your Lordships' lives as bearable and pleasant as possible in <P>


<a name="column_1177"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>and around the House. I am sure that the Whole House will join with me in wishing all of the staff a peaceful and happy Prorogation and Dissolution Recess.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para10"></a>I also wish to use this opportunity to thank the other members of the usual channels for the spirit of co-operation which has, almost without exception, been the rule throughout this Session. It is an extraordinary tribute to this House that we can, even under conditions of great political excitement, continue to proceed by way of agreement in arranging our business. The result is that your Lordships' House is able to scrutinise legislation in a calm and efficient atmosphere--and long may that continue!
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para11"></a>Perhaps I may say just one word which may break all sorts of conventions and refer to my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor. The House will have seen that he has announced his retirement at the general election. On behalf of the Government at this Dispatch Box I should like to thank him for the tremendous years of service and for the hours that he has sat on the Woolsack, always patient, always clear in his instructions and always kind and generous to his colleagues on the Front Bench.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para12"></a>Tributes have already been paid to my noble friend Lord Ferrers. However, while I am on my feet and seeing that they are in the Chamber, perhaps I may also mention my noble friends Lady Trumpington and Lord Goschen, who have also announced their retirement at the general election.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para13"></a>As for the Opposition, they have had plenty of practice over the course of the past 18 years to become good at it. I hope that the Whole House agrees that in the course of the past few years they have become extremely good at it. It is my wish that, when we return in May, they shall remain practising that art of Opposition while we remain in government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-38_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Morris of Castle Morris: </B>   My Lords, in the unavoidable absence of my noble friend the Opposition Chief Whip, it falls to his very inadequate substitute to say that we on these Benches wish to associate ourselves most warmly with all the remarks made by the Government Chief Whip--

<A NAME="70320-38_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Morris of Castle Morris:  </B>  --except the last ones! Like him, I should find it invidious to name any names because I, too, know from bitter experience that, however many individuals are thanked, there is always that one who is inadvertently omitted and who will never, ever forgive the omitter for the rest of his life.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para14"></a>Even though I am a substitute for the Government Chief Whip--

<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para15"></a>When I received the order that I should carry out this agreeable task, I did not realise that I was in for one of the greatest comic performances I have ever heard at the Dispatch Box by that master of comic performances, the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers. I mean this quite sincerely. For a short time in my past I was a professional actor. However, I have never heard anybody time the remarks that he makes better than the noble Earl. I have sat in admiration on many occasions and wished that he could teach me how he does it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para16"></a>I shall make one small change to what I just said about not mentioning anybody in particular. Perhaps I may thank and pay special tribute to all the attendants in your Lordships' Chamber, the Doorkeepers, who want your notes when you have finished with them and fail to see you waving vital communications when they are looking straight at you, and who rebuke with a terrible severity any noble Lord who trespasses unbeknown on some arcane rule, convention or practice of this House. They can be at times a terrifying group. John Donne, in one of his satires, refers to, "the great eight-foot high iron-bound serving men"--which fits nearly all of them since "Jumper" Collins retired. They all look like and resemble in so many ways regimental sergeant majors in the Brigade of Guards. However, as they get to know you, and if you behave yourself in a proper fashion and do pass their test, you become a sort of "persona grata", rather like the young second lieutenant who is looked on in a grandfatherly way by the regimental sergeant major as a young fellow who might one of these days make something of himself.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para17"></a>I agree with the Government Chief Whip that the usual channels have, fortunately, flowed unblocked in this Parliament. I say nothing of what has passed through those channels--but it has been of great assistance to organic farming and we should have a bumper crop next year!
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-38_para18"></a>Finally, and bearing in mind the verbal punch-up which seems to have taken place earlier today in another place and which surprised me, I thank all noble Lords on behalf of all of us on these Benches for the good relationships, good taste and good humour that has almost always characterised our debates and deliberations.

<A NAME="70320-39_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   My Lords, briefly, on behalf of these crowded Benches behind me, I wish to associate myself with the words of the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris. I know nothing about the usual channels, and never have, either in another place or here. They remain a total mystery to me. However, what I do know is that, mysterious as they are, they certainly have wonders to perform, and particularly in this House. We owe a great debt to the usual channels for the way in which on all sides of the House they manage to serve the House so well.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-39_para0"></a>I join also in the tributes to all the servants of the House in every possible capacity.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320-39_para1"></a>Perhaps I might also be allowed a personal word of admiration and respect for the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. I have perhaps some particular personal reasons to value his very high qualities. But <P>


<a name="column_1179"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column 1179</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what has impressed me about him is that, as a senior member of the Government, he has managed to steer some major legislation through from the Woolsack--sometimes rather controversial legislation--and has always managed to do it in a serene and calm way. I can only pay him what I always regard as the great Scottish compliment: in all the troubles of the work and the duties he has had to undertake, he has continually maintained a calm sough.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-39_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, if my noble friend the Chief Whip can suspect himself of breaking the unwritten rules of your Lordships' House, surely I as a humble Back-Bencher can do the same. I believe that my fellow Deputy Speakers and Deputy Chairmen would, like me, wish to pay a tribute, on this last occasion when it is possible for any of us to speak in this Parliament, to my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor. Noble Lords will remember that the law is the true embodiment of everything that is excellent. He has embodied the law for a number of years, both in his distinguished position as Lord Chancellor and before that as Lord Advocate, when he will remember that he dug me out of a personal hole on an energy Bill, which I think was the first Bill that I had the honour to put before your Lordships. He has honoured us, the Deputy Speakers and Deputy Chairmen, in an extremely generous way, from whichever party, or none, from which we have emerged, and we are all extremely grateful to him personally.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320-39_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Wharton: </B>   We on these Benches also wish to be associated with the expressions of gratitude to the staff who look after us so well, not only those whom we see on a daily basis and who are so unfailingly helpful to us, but also those behind the scenes whom we seldom see and without whom the place would probably grind to a halt. On behalf of the Cross-Benchers, we thank them all.

<A NAME = "70320w01_sbhd0"></A><H4><center>Arms Embargoes</center></H4>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320w01_wqn0"></A><B> Earl Attlee </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will detail all arms embargoes currently implemented by the United Kingdom.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Chalker of Wallasey): </B>  The United Kingdom currently enforces 17 arms embargoes. Under the United Nations Charter, we have a legally binding obligation to enforce arms embargoes imposed by the Security Council under Article 41 of the Charter. Other embargoes are imposed on a national basis or following agreement within the European Union (EU) or the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (formerly CSCE).
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w01_para0"></a>Under UK law, binding UN embargoes are implemented by prohibiting the export of goods and technology on the Military List which forms Part III to Schedule 1 of the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, as amended by the Export of Goods (Control) (Amendment No. 2) Order 1996. In addition, the supply of such items from the UK or supply abroad by UK registered companies and nationals is prohibited by Orders in Council under the United Nations Act (1946). From time to time, the contents of the Military List may change--for example, to reflect technological advances or continuing international efforts to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Orders in Council extend such embargoes to the Crown Dependencies and the Dependent Territories. A licence is required for each export or supply from the UK or abroad by a UK registered company or national.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w01_para1"></a>National embargoes and those agreed in the EU and the OSCE prohibit only the export of goods covered by the embargo. With the exception of the embargoes on China and Iran, the UK interprets the scope of all such embargoes to cover goods and technology on the Military List as defined above.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w01_para2"></a>Companies are free to submit applications to export goods to any embargoed destinations. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), as the licensing authority, normally refuses such applications where the goods come within the scope of the embargo. But in exceptional circumstances, the DTI might decide, after consultation with advisory departments, to grant a licence to export such goods to an embargoed destination, for example for humanitarian purposes.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w01_para3"></a>The UK has an end-use (or catch-all) control under which any goods may be brought under control if there is knowledge or grounds for suspicion that they might be used for activities linked to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or missiles for their delivery. But other goods, which are not normally controlled, do not become subject to control solely because they are to be used by the military, whether or not the destination concerned is subject to an embargo.

All entry clearance staff are expected to read the report. My officials in the UK examine Dame Elizabeth's recommendations in detail, and change procedures where necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w01_para38"></a>The independent monitor rightly considers that improved training will contribute significantly to improvements in our entry clearance operations. Acting in response to her reports, we have significantly broadened the scope of our training of entry clearance staff.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320w02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   We are a strong advocate of improved practical co-operation on defence among European countries. The decisions of the Berlin North Atlantic Council in June 1996 to support the development of the European Security and Defence Identity within NATO provide a sound framework for such co-operation, permitting the creation of militarily coherent and effective forces capable of operating under the political control and strategic direction of the Western European Union using NATO assets and capabilities when appropriate. We remain opposed to proposals to change the situation set out in the Maastricht Treaty whereby the Western European Union elaborates and implements decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications, and to proposals to subordinate the Western European Union to the European Union and to introduce a commitment to the eventual merger of the Western European Union and the European Union. We are firmly committed to the principle that decisions with defence implications taken by the European Union shall be taken by unanimity. We are opposed to flexibility arrangements within the European Union which could lead to a group of countries taking on collective defence commitments within a European Union framework which would undermine collective defence within NATO. Proposals along these lines, such as those put forward by the French and Germans, would undermine the development of the European Security and Defence Identity within NATO.

It has not in the event proved possible to use this money for the purpose originally intended. We have instead agreed a proposal from the Hungarians that these funds (approximately &#163;2 million including interest accrued) should be applied to extend and refurbish an existing Institute building in return for substantial benefits for UK citizens. These benefits include guaranteed numbers of places for British children receiving conductive education at the Institute and for British students receiving professional training, reductions in fees for British children, and access on a cost basis to a guaranteed proportion of new family and student accommodation. The Institute will continue to assist with the development of conductive education in the UK. A new Inter-Governmental Agreement incorporating these benefits and appropriate safeguards for the implementation of the project will be signed later this month by the British Ambassador in Budapest and a representative of the Hungarian Government.

<A NAME="70320w02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   The United Kingdom is fully committed to a strong and effective United Nations in pursuit of the objectives set out in the Charter. The United Nations plays a vital role in helping maintain international peace and security, and in promoting democracy, human rights, international law and economic and social progress around the world. As we approach the 21st century, we shall want to use the United Nations increasingly to help achieve that partnership for sustainable human development about which I addressed the General Assembly last September. The new global challenges such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, and threats to the environment and to natural resources because of population pressures on present patterns of production and consumption, will require the international community to agree policies and to work out practical solutions through international co-operation. The United Nations has some unique advantages for this.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w02_para0"></a>We welcome the commitment of the new United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, in setting the United Nations on the path of reform, so that it can better measure up to these challenges. When he visited London last month the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary were impressed by his determination to give reform a high priority. We support him in his plans to secure tighter budgeting, greater management efficiency and the elimination of overlap between different UN bodies.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w02_para1"></a>But, to succeed, the United Nations needs not only to reform, but also to be able to rely on the financial resources which member states have voted to it. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary raised with a number of US Congressmen during his visit to Washington on 9-10 March our concerns on this score. At the end of 1996 the United States owed the United Nations some US $1.3 billion, which is approximately two-thirds of total arrears due. This backlog of unpaid obligatory financial contributions is severely disabling the United Nations from working properly and from carrying out the policies voted by the member states. It also means that countries contributing to UN peacekeeping operations such as India, Bangladesh and the United Kingdom (which is currently owed &#163;40 million) do not get their debts paid. The Foreign Secretary made it clear in Washington that this failure to honour financial obligations under the UN Charter does the cause of UN reform no good causes resentment among friends and allies. I know that President Clinton is committed to solving this problem. We need a new and fairer system of UN financing based more closely on the principle of capacity to pay and on the assurances that all member states will in future pay in full, unconditionally and on time. Once the problem of arrears has been dealt with, we hope it will be possible speedily to complete the process of UN reform and thus to relaunch the United Nations on its urgent new agenda.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320w04_spmin5"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  The reforms set out in the White Paper will take four to five years to implement in full. But once they are completed the Government will be able to decide in advance how much to spend on legal aid. Until then, a substantial (but decreasing) proportion of the budget will remain demand-led. Meanwhile, however, the Government are introducing a number of measures to restrain growth in the short term.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w04_para0"></a>The cost of legal aid increased by just under 15 per cent. in the last three years. Forecast expenditure over the next three years is &#163;1,561/1,602/1,518 million. This represents an increase of 3.2 per cent. in 1997-98 and 2.5 per cent. in 1998-99. However, legal aid expenditure is set to fall back in 1999-2000 by 5 per cent., to a figure just 0.4 per cent. higher than this year's. This reflects the Government's determination to bring legal aid spending under control, and the impact of sustained tough action and the implementation of the wider reform agenda.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320w04_spmin7"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  The general issue of legal aid for foreign nationals was addressed in the December 1994 consultation paper, Legal Aid for the Apparently Wealthy. The overwhelming weight of the responses supported the view expressed in the consultation paper that it would not be right to impose nationality restrictions on the availability of either criminal or civil legal aid.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w04_para1"></a>Last year's White Paper raised a narrower question in the context of targeting legal aid on the most deserving civil cases.

<P>
<A NAME="70320w05_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Emplyoment   (Lord Henley): </B>  It would not be cost effective to distribute the Code of Practice to every employer.

On what grounds they have filed a claim against Iraq for environmental damage caused during the Gulf War, and what agreement within NATO precludes them from the claiming against the United States for the environmental damage from toxic wastes left behind in Holy Loch by the US Forces based there.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320w05_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   Under UN Security Council Resolution 687, Iraq is liable in international law for any environmental damage which resulted from its illegal invasion and occupation of Kuwait. In accordance with Decision 7 of the Governing Council of the UN Compensation Commission, the Government submitted a claim for compensation in respect of:
(a) the UK's contribution to the expenditure by International Maritime Organisation in tackling oil pollution in the Gulf;
(b) expenditure on the provision of oil skimmers to assist the Government of Bahrain in defending ecologically sensitive areas against the threat of oil; and
(c) expenditure on a survey of bird life in the Gulf.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w05_para3"></a>There is no specific agreement within NATO which precludes claiming against the United States for environmental damage from toxic material. However, the overall volume of such material which has been found at Holy Loch, in the latest survey work, is very small. Only a certain amount of this could be attributed to the United States activities. The debris in the Loch comprises mainly scrap metal and other accumulated rubbish. In addition, a number of wrecks have been identified.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320w06_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   The analysis has been completed, from which it is clear that, although close attention has been paid to the need to balance military training demands against the avoidance of undue disturbance to the public, variations in the intensity of such activity across the country still exist. Although this is, in part, unavoidable because of operational and geographic factors such as the location of aircraft operating bases, aircraft range, avoidance areas, controlled airspace and weather conditions, we concluded that even within these constraints, further efforts should be made to manage the activity as equitably as possible.

<A NAME = "70320w06_para0"></a>We therefore intend to improve the way in which the overall amount of low flying activity is managed and the methods by which detailed statistics are recorded. This latter initiative will be a valuable tool in monitoring the effectiveness of the measures to try to redistribute this activity more equitably. In addition, the three Services, individually and collectively, will pay greater attention to the areas they choose in the UK for military exercises in an effort to spread the low flying training aspects of them as evenly as practicable. Last summer we announced measures to spread operational low flying (that beneath 250 feet) more evenly between the three tactical training areas. Efforts will continue to reduce still further the amount of operational low flying training. The scope for increasing the amount of low flying training carried out overseas will be actively pursued. A statement on the distribution of military low flying in the UKLFS will be published annually.

<A NAME = "70320w06_para6"></a>We accept the broad thrust of the report.

<P>

<A NAME = "70320w07_para0"></a>The Council reached unanimous agreement on important proposals on cattle identification and beef labelling on a basis of Article 43 of the Treaty. The identification proposal requires the establishment of computerised systems for tracing cattle movements throughout their lives, improved cattle tagging, and a system of cattle passports similar to the one introduced in Great Britain last summer. Adoption of this proposal will facilitate the implementation of plans to develop a fully computerised database of cattle movements in Great Britain. The arrangements agreed on labelling provide for member states to decide whether or not to require the compulsory labelling of beef from the year 2000, and for the details of what information should be provided on labels under a compulsory system to be decided by the Council in the light of member states' experience between now and 1999.

The United Kingdom had strongly opposed the original proposal on the grounds that it discriminated against United Kingdom farmers faced with significant revaluations of the agricultural conversion rate for sterling. As a result, the proposal was substantially modified in the course of negotiation and the discriminatory elements removed on terms which fully met United Kingdom requirements.

<A NAME = "70320w07_para3"></a>The Council had a first discussion of the Commission's proposals on agricultural prices for 1997/98, which include a long-standing proposal to reduce arable aid and set-aside payments. The United Kingdom endorsed the Commission's intention to achieve budgetary savings, but regretted the absence of moves to reduce agricultural support prices generally, or of proposals for the early reform of sectors such as milk, beef and cereals.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w07_para4"></a>In a third structured dialogue with the countries of central and eastern Europe, the Council considered with those countries how to assist in the implementation of the EU's veterinary and phytosanitary regulations. There was agreement on the need for a better exchange of information on EU policy and legislation in this area, and for help from the PHARE programme to establish the required control and inspection facilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w07_para5"></a>The Council discussed, at the request of France, the need for changes in the operation of the early marketing scheme for veal and the calf processing scheme. It was agreed that the beef management committee would address these issues as a matter of urgency on 21 March, and would consider inter alia a possible reduction in the rate of calf processing premium in response to a long standing UK request.

<A NAME = "70320w07_para6"></a>The Council agreed some changes to the mandate of the European Commission in its negotiations with the USA on a veterinary equivalence agreement, and adopted by qualified majority (Spain, Portugal and Italy voting against) a proposal to open a malting barley quota for the USA in order to fulfil the EU's obligations under the World Trade Organisation.

<A NAME = "70320w07_para7"></a>The United Kingdom raised in the Council the need for an urgent report and proposals from the Commission on the welfare of battery hens, on which the Commissioner promised early action.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320w08_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The North Sea Fisheries and Environment Ministers and the responsible Members of the European Commission were able to reach political agreement on the principles, objectives and strategies which should guide fisheries and environmental management in the North Sea. Within this framework, they invited the competent authorities to consider a wide range of actions which are set out in the Statement of Conclusions which they adopted. I have arranged for a copy of the statement to be placed in the Library of each House.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w08_para1"></a>The conclusions call for the development of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management and environmental conservation and protection; and recognise that the same principles of sustainable management should apply to industrial fisheries as to human consumption fisheries. The detailed measures put forward include:
--the introduction of new target and limit reference points as a basis for stock management, underpinned by recovery plans for specific stocks;
--measures to protect juvenile fish, notably by minimising discards;
--measures to protect species and habitats, notably by adjusting fishing practices;
<P>


<a name="column_WA105"></a>

--measures to protect North Sea ecosystems, notably to safeguard spawning grounds and nursery areas for fisheries resources;
--measures to improve enforcement, including the extension to Norway of the European Community's new system of satellite monitoring;
--additional research to strengthen the implementation of effective measures; and
--greater involvement of fishermen and other interested parties in management decisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w08_para2"></a>The Government believe that the conclusions make a major contribution towards achieving sustainable management of North Sea fisheries. They will be drawn on by the European Commission in developing measures under the Common Fisheries Policy, and will also guide wider environmental policy in the North Sea. The United Kingdom and Germany indicated that they would take steps to review follow-up action within the European Community during their EU Presidencies in 1998 and 1999 respectively.

<A NAME="70320w09_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My right honourable friend the Minister for Construction, Planning and Energy Efficiency is publishing today the Action Plan which forms part of our strategy for fulfilling the commitment, which was made by the United Kingdom at the Third North Sea Conference at The Hague in 1990, to phase <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>out and destroy identifiable PCBs. It is also the first step towards meeting the requirements of EC Directive 96/59/EC, which will be implemented by regulations in due course.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w09_para0"></a>It has long been recognised that PCBs pose an environmental threat, particularly to marine life. That is why, in 1986, we banned their sale and most uses. There are many organisations, including factories, offices, schools and hospitals, which may have equipment containing PCBs.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w09_para1"></a>A key element of the action plan is that there should be co-operation between the competent authorities, companies who destroy PCBs and those who may have equipment containing them. Our proposals are designed to ensure an orderly phase-out and the most effective use of destruction capacity, in the interests of industry and the environment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w09_para2"></a>A copy of the action plan has been sent to all local authorities, education authorities, health authorities and universities throughout the United Kingdom as well as the relevant trade associations. Copies of the action plan have also been placed in the Library of the House.

<P>

<A NAME = "70320w09_para3"></a>The then Chief Inspector of Prisons, in his inspection in 1995, found that conditions and facilities for immigration detainees at Haslar were good. These good standards have been maintained. The water supply is checked on a regular basis and has been found to be satisfactory. Detainees are fully aware of the avenues of complaint available to them but no complaints have been received.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w09_para4"></a>Detention is used only as a last resort and every effort is made to keep periods of detention to an absolute minimum.

The Government are satisfied that adequate procedures exist for detention to be reviewed both internally and independently and see no need for a review of their detention policy and procedures.

<A NAME = "70320w09_para6"></a>The Inmates Information System installed in Prison Service establishments and headquarters in England and Wales supports a wide variety of functions of which prisoner location is only one aspect. The original design of the system started some 10 years ago and aimed to deal with the detailed procedures used in England and Wales.

This will give the service greater flexibility in its use of the contractually-managed estate and help to meet its requirement for additional young offender places.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320w09_wqn6"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>If he will make a statement on the present position on the availability of information from the Prison Service mandatory drug testing programme.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320w09_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   As part of the programme of mandatory drug testing in prison establishments the Prison Service collect a range of statistical information, including information about the percentage of prisoners who test positive for drugs in the tests which are carried out at random. Since April 1996 the number of random tests that prove positive, expressed as a percentage of the total number of random tests carried out, has been one of the Prison Service's key performance indicators.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w09_para8"></a>As a result of internal checking, a number of errors have been found in the information held centrally. The main problems are thought to relate to the recording of results of confirmation tests (carried out where a prisoner pleads not guilty at adjudication in response to an initial positive result) and to cases where an initial positive result should subsequently have been discounted because the prisoner concerned was on a course of prescribed medication.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w09_para9"></a>The Prison Service have commissioned the National Addiction Centre to carry out an independent validation of a sample of the available statistical information on mandatory drug testing covering the period April 1996 to June 1996. This involves a detailed scrutiny of the information held in prison establishments and <P>


<a name="column_WA110"></a>

<B>20 Mar 1997 : Column WA110</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>comparison with the information held centrally. The validation exercise should provide a measure of the extent of the errors, the possible implications for performance against the key indicator, and more generally, of the reliability of data on mandatory drug testing held by the Prison Service. There is no reason to suppose, from the work completed so far, that the statistical information for the period from April 1996 is other than broadly accurate.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w09_para10"></a>Once the exercise is complete, the Prison Service expect to be in a position to provide reliable information on performance against the key indicator for the period April 1996. However, until such information is available, all previously published figures relating to the percentage of prisoners who test positive for drugs should be regarded as provisional.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w09_para11"></a>In addition, no firm conclusions, including conclusions on any apparent trends on the use of drugs in prison, should be drawn from data relating to the first phase of the mandatory drugs testing programme (February 1995 to March 1996), since not all establishments were involved and some differences in testing protocols were in place. We are not yet in a position to say whether the use of cannabis has declined since mandatory drug testing was introduced. It remains the case that there is no clear evidence of switching from cannabis to opiates or vice versa.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w09_para12"></a>This Answer should be taken as correcting any inadvertently misleading statements which may have been made in relation to mandatory drug testing statistics.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<UL>Whether they are satisfied that the Highways Agency is fulfilling its obligation under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to keep its road network clean, in respect of the A.11, A.12 and A.14 trunk roads and M.11 motorway respectively; when these roads were last cleared of litter; and when they are next due to be cleared of litter.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320w10_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   Under the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 responsibility for litter clearance on motorways and a small number of all purpose trunk roads lies with the Highways Agency. Responsibility for litter clearance on the rest of the all purpose trunk road network, including the A.11, A.12 and A.14, lies with district councils.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w10_para27"></a>The funding available for the Highways Agency's routine maintenance work this year has been extremely tight. In these circumstances the agency have taken the view that their prime concern must be to maintain the safety of the motorway and trunk road network. Consequently, those activities directly related to safety have first call on their funds.
<P>

<A NAME = "70320w10_para28"></a>This means that the normal programme of routine maintenance work carried out by their agent authorities, including regular proactive litter clearance on the motorways and the all-purpose trunk roads for which they have responsibility for litter, has had to be curtailed. The Highways Agency have instructed their agent authorities to clear litter only after it has built up to the intervention levels illustrated in the Environmental Protection Act 1990 Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse. We are satisfied that this fulfils the Highways Agency's obligations under the Act.

<P>
<A NAME="70320w11_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   The total cost (including works, land and preparation costs) of all the schemes which were withdrawn on 26 November 1996 from the English Trunk Road programme was about &#163;8 billion. This represents about 49 per cent. of the total cost of the road programme as detailed in Managing the Trunk Road Programme November 1995, on the same basis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70320w11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   The Department of Trade and Industry has consulted interested parties on several occasions about the possibility of amending copyright law, as set out in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, to give specific protection to a scheme or plan for a series of programmes. In the absence of any consensus among interested parties on the issue and in view of concerns about the anti-competitive effects of any changes, the Government decided that legislation in this area should not be introduced or supported. It is in any case widely believed that sufficiently elaborated schemes or plans for programmes will attract copyright protection without any legislative change. Other laws such as the laws of confidentiality and passing off may provide programme makers with protection against theft and plagiarism of their ideas, as can equivalent laws in other countries. Granting copyright protection to ideas as such would be contrary to the basic principles of copyright law in this and other countries, and no other countries have been identified which give specific protection to schemes or plans for programmes.

1. Net maximum capacity is defined as the sum of net maximum capacities of all stations taken individually at a given period of operation. It is the maximum power assumed to be solely active power that can be supplied, continuously, with all plants running, at the point of outlet to the network. The capacity is net in the sense that it is the output capacity measured at the station busbars, i.e. after deducting the power consumed by station auxiliaries and losses in station transformers.
