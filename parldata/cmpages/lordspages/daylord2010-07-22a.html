The ICC review conference in Kampala was a major milestone in the international community's fight to combat impunity for the most serious crimes of international concern. The stocktaking of international criminal justice will help shape the future development of the court. The UK will now consider whether to ratify the amendment on the use of certain weaponry in a non-international armed conflict. The conference agreed a package, including the definition of the crime of aggression and the conditions for exercise of jurisdiction, to be put forward for discussion and possible adoption in 2017.</p>

Perhaps I may ask him a specific question about sexual violence, which is such a major and horrible aspect of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Government pledged to the review conference to do more for victims, particularly victims of sexual violence. Can he tell us what the Government plan to do specifically to help victims of this deeply appalling crime?</p>

The conference at Kampala adopted a resolution on the victims issue which recognised the rights of victims to have access to justice and to participate in judicial proceedings. That applied to victims generally. For our part, the United Kingdom is committed to tackling the problem of violence against women. We will continue to promote programmes in support of this agenda, including measures that will address the special needs of women and children in areas of conflict.</p>

The Kampala conference addressed these issues but did not reach any final conclusions. A great deal of the conference was simply carrying forward and firming up the work of the ICC in the light of its experience, of which my noble friend has just mentioned one example.

The UK has a principled position: that the UN Security Council has primary responsibility for dealing with aggression. We maintain that that is right. If in the discussion the complexities of developing a further definition can be overcome, then the general purpose-all are agreed -is the right one. However, there are some obvious

The LRA has been responsible for some of the worst violations against women, such as those described by my noble friend Lady Stern a few moments ago, especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Uganda, where it is estimated that the LRA has killed over 1 million people. Will he confirm that a letter was received by the Prime Minister only a week ago from a young woman called Juliet, who is here in London and  who was herself raped by the LRA when she was just 12 years old?</p>

It is significant that this meeting was held in Kampala, and of course it is in Uganda that these arrest warrants are currently out for a number of people. It is also where some particularly horrific crimes appear to have occurred, including crimes against women, about which we were talking a moment ago. That is the position and I can only reaffirm what the noble Lord has said: this is a good example of where the ICC really can carry forward the causes of peace and justice together in what we hope is an effective way.</p>

Would he therefore tell us whether the Kampala conference has advanced at all the prospect of the United States committing to the International Criminal Court, and will the Government-both parts of the Government-encourage the United States to join?</p>

The United States sent 23 delegates to the Kampala conference; they all turned up and discussed these issues in detail. I asked those at the conference whether that will lead to a better prospect of the United States signing up to this but they were not sure of an answer. They say that the United States is involved in the discussions and interested in carrying matters forward, but the signs that it will actually put its signature to it are, I am afraid, still a bit fuzzy and remote.</p>

Many countries have eradicated TB using a test and slaughter approach. In England, evidence suggests that without addressing the disease in badgers, it will be impossible to eradicate TB in cattle. The department has committed to developing affordable options for a carefully managed and science-led policy of badger control in areas with high and persistent levels of bovine TB.</p>

There is evidence that the present testing regime correctly identifies the presence of tuberculosis within a herd, but no longer identifies all the infected animals so that after a series of tests, a residue of infection is left within the herd which can continue to spread the disease despite the removal of the identified animals. Will the noble Lord ask the Government to conduct a thorough review of the implications of this? The existing regime is not satisfactory and there are managerial consequences for biosecurity on the farm. Although this programme was very successful half a century ago, it is not working now. We are effectively burning pound notes.</p>

If we move to another test, known as the single test, there is a possibility of a greater number of what are described as false positives, which again would not be satisfactory. A further test is used, a blood test which is known as the gamma test, and we can look at it. I can give my noble friend an assurance that we will look at all three, but for the moment we think that the comparative test is the best one to use.</p>

Does my noble friend agree that blood testing is a good alternative or addition to skin testing and reveals more reactors? Will he consider a Defra policy of blood testing as well as skin testing in bovine TB hot spots, particularly where the badger population is considerable?</p>

I shall certainly look at whether it is possible to use that test solely, but, as I said earlier, for the moment, we believe that the comparative tests that we are using are possibly the best.</p>

Addressing bovine TB still involves great expense, in compensation, testing, research and surveillance. Something of the order of £63 million was spent on it in 2009-10.

Will the Minister ensure that, in the process that he has described, he will consult the Manifesto Club and talk personally to the arts community, which has a great concern about this? Will he include also the issue of academic visiting visas, which is a matter of concern to the academic community?</p>

It has since transpired that the Deputy Prime Minister was aware that the company was in fact prepared to dilute its equity share. Why will the Deputy Prime Minister not apologise to Parliament for misleading it? Why have the Government taken such a crass decision to withdraw the loan from the company, which could have provided a massive foundation to the development of a nuclear supply chain industry in this country?</p>

Our decision not to proceed with the loan was a matter of affordability and that only. The shareholder structure of SFIL did not influence any assessment. I have no knowledge of any privy discussions between the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister. The Government's decision has absolutely nothing to do with this issue. We regard Mr Honeyman and his team as having produced an excellent project with no criticism of him or of the company. Perhaps the Opposition should apologise for the necessity of cuts based on the state of the economy that we inherited.</p>

The Minister is aware-it has already been stated by my noble friend-that this was a loan, not a grant. Therefore, it is difficult to understand the attitude of the coalition Government. As my noble friend said, two companies make this product for the nuclear industry: Sheffield Forgemasters and a plant in Korea. Is it not the case that this loan should be provided to save jobs in the community in Sheffield and to help manufacturing?</p>

Nobody would argue that Sheffield Forgemasters is not an excellent example of a successful British manufacturing company. The Government wholeheartedly support what the company does and I place on the record our recognition of its excellent work. Once again, I tell noble Lords that the only reason why we took the decision was affordability and we had to take that decision because of the condition that the previous Government left us in financially.</p>

I know that the Government are concerned about this, but I urge renewed efforts to persuade the banks to address this issue.

<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="10072235000073"></a>Crime is an issue that is never far from the news headlines. Policing and crime affect all our lives. Television and films depict criminal enterprises as entertainment-and that is fine; I love a good detective or gangster film myself. It is important, however, that when politicians engage in debate on these vital issues, they do so on the basis of fact and evidence, not pure invention for the purpose of political advantage.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="10072235000074"></a>One of the first duties of any state is to safeguard its people from both within and outside its territory. Citizens from inside our borders need to be protected by those seeking wealth, advantage or gratification through the commission of crime against innocent victims.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="10072235000075"></a>I intend to touch on three main issues today: to expose the myth asserted recently by the Prime Minister that violent crime rose under the previous Government;  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1073"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1073</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to voice the fears of many citizens that serious crime will grow over the coming years because of cuts in front-line policing caused by the slashing of police budgets, the review of security cameras and the reduction in the DNA database; and to express the concern that the coalition Government, against all advice by respected chief officers and others, intend to politicise the police by introducing elected police commissioners, thereby risking for the first time the political independence of a police service that is respected throughout the world.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="10072235000076"></a>First of all, on the crime figures, at Prime Minister's Questions on 7 July in another place, the right honourable David Cameron said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="10072235000396"></a>"The point is that under the last Government violent crime and gun crime went through the roof".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 7/7/10; col. 364.]</p>

<p><a name="10072235000376"></a>Not true; the latest annual update on national crime statistics for England and Wales, released last week on 15 July, demonstrates that the Government are misleading the public about levels of crime.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="10072235000077"></a>Both the British Crime Survey and police recorded crime figures show that overall crime is down on last year by 9 per cent. I will cite the British Crime Survey, which is accepted as the most accurate measure of trends. Vehicle-related crime is down on last year by 17 per cent. Domestic burglary is down on last year by 9 per cent. Violent crime is down on last year by 1 per cent. Police recorded crime shows that firearms offences are down by 22 per cent since 2002-03 and knife crime is down on last year by 7 per cent. Since 1997, when the previous Government took office, the British Crime Survey shows that overall crime is down by 43 per cent; overall crime against the person is down by 41 per cent; overall household crime is down by 44 per cent; burglary is down by 59 per cent; and violent crime is down by 42 per cent. I could go on but by any standard these figures demonstrate how impressively the police and the criminal justice system have tackled crime under the policies of the previous Administration.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="10072235000078"></a>The Prime Minister has since been rebuked by the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir Michael Scholar, for misusing violent crime figures. He confirms that the authority remains of the view that the British Crime Survey provides the most reliable measure of the trends in violent crime. Any attempt to suggest otherwise by misquoting or disbelieving the British Crime Survey, which is accepted as a gold standard by most British academics and internationally, is beneath contempt. It deserves to be exposed as a scaremongering propaganda effort of which Joseph Goebbels would have been proud. I know that the facts get in the way of a good story but I ask the Minister, in replying, to apologise on behalf of his right honourable friend the Prime Minister for recent utterances on these important matters. It is accepted by most informed commentators that the fear of crime is far worse than the risk of crime. By stoking the fear of crime the coalition Government create unnecessary concerns, particularly among the elderly.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="10072235000079"></a>While dealing with Ministers and their statements, I will comment on the Justice Secretary, Kenneth Clarke. He said last week in his Mansion House speech:</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1074"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1074</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="10072235000397"></a>"Crime has fallen in Britain throughout a period of both rising prison populations ... and economic growth, with strong employment levels and rising living standards. No one can prove cause and effect. The crime rate fell".</p>

<p><a name="10072235000377"></a>He went on to claim credit for his improved economic legacy, which by implication he suggested caused the drop in crime. Again, this is a travesty of the truth. Last year's crime figures which I have just quoted are from a period of recession, which refutes the Justice Secretary's argument that falls in crime are solely down to greater prosperity. He also omitted to say that when crime was remorselessly rising in the early 1990s, Ken Clarke was the Home Secretary. I know because I was the vice-president of the Police Superintendents' Association at that time. While Home Secretary, like a bull in china shop, Ken Clarke took on the police service head-on. He had a history of belligerence in dealing with other public services and appointed the chairman of British American Tobacco, Sir Patrick Sheehy, to bring private sector efficiency and values to the police. How about that? It is just what our respected police service wanted: the moral and ethical values of an international tobacco company.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="10072235000080"></a>In the summer of 1993, a mass rally of 20,000 police officers gathered in Wembley Arena to protest about the Sheehy proposals, such as performance-related pay-presumably based on the number of arrests made by each officer. It was a truly historic occasion. I remember the star political speaker against Sheehy being the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, who I see in his seat today as part of the Government on the coalition Benches. The point is that Kenneth Clarke totally demoralised the police service; under his stewardship crime really did go through the roof.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="10072235000081"></a>Fortunately for the police, the economic crisis at that time, when Britain crashed out of the ERM, led to the resignation in 1992 of the then Chancellor, the noble Lord, Lord Lamont. He was succeeded by Kenneth Clarke-you've guessed it-whose legacy left the police service in total disarray. The new Home Secretary at that time, Michael Howard, is well known to your Lordships and has just been introduced into this House. He immediately scrapped the controversial Sheehy reforms and declared famously that "prison works". I spoke yesterday with the noble Lord, Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington, who cannot be here because he is in France. He said to me, in terms, "Michael Howard, put it right". The noble Lord, Lord Howard, demonstrated that prison works because crime fell dramatically under his stewardship as prison numbers rose. Ken Clarke now talks of bringing the same private sector values and profiteering to community service in place of short prison sentences. He says that he will empty prisons to save money, thereby putting decent people at risk of becoming victims of crime. Does the Minister agree with the Justice Secretary, Mr Ken Clarke, or with his noble friend Lord Howard, the previous Tory leader, who said yesterday that Ken Clarke is totally "misguided" on this?</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="10072235000082"></a>There are also rumours in the press that the Sheehy report is being dusted down and revisited. Will the Minister give us an assurance today that this report, with its private sector values, is dead and buried, because the police service is very concerned that it is being revisited? The police are a public service, not a  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1075"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1075</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>private company. The last thing that is required, on top of all the planned cuts and upheaval on the scale of what appears to be being planned for the National Health Service, is a similar operation for the police. Is this really what Liberal Democrat voters expected when they placed their cross on the ballet paper? It certainly was not in the manifesto.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="10072235000083"></a>What has brought crime down over the past decade has been record numbers of police and uniformed support officers on the streets, and the willingness to use prison as a deterrent against people who simply refuse to comply with the courts. The police service increased by 16,000 to 143,000 officers under the previous Administration-record numbers-plus 16,000 uniformed police community support officers. This is what the public want. Only this week, Sir Denis O'Connor, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, said that only 10 per cent of police officers were available at any one time on the front line to help the public and respond to calls. This is because of specialist posts, shift rotas, leave and the like. Is it not time for a royal commission to examine the police to see how they should be organised? It is estimated by the House of Commons Library that the £125 million of cuts proposed by the coalition would result in a reduction of some 4,100 police officers. This is on top of the 25 per cent reduction in the Home Office budget.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="10072235000084"></a>Another bright idea of the Tory wing of the coalition is the election of so-called police commissioners. It is said to make the police more accountable. Whatever else is wrong with the police, it is not a lack of accountability. They are accountable to the Home Secretary and to police authorities, which have elected members among their number. They are accountable locally to district and parish councils, which have regular meetings with local officers. Most importantly, of course, they are accountable to the law in the courts. I spent some time with the FBI in the United States and saw at first hand how the police were dragged into the political arena through the election of sheriffs. Judges and district attorneys are also elected in some areas.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="10072235000085"></a>The system we have has stood the test of time. Police are accountable and the last thing we want is a commissioner standing on a party ticket or on a single issue. I remember talking to a deputy sheriff in America who was a crony of the sheriff, of course, because he appoints them. He was canvassing on behalf of his boss, as his job depended on it. Is this really what we want in this country? The criminal justice system should be above party politics and independent of political pressure. Can you imagine a British National Party member standing on a tough law-and-order and anti-immigration ticket being elected a commissioner of police? Once we allow this poisonous genie out of the bottle, it will be very difficult to put it back in.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="10072235000086"></a>Parliament must scrutinise all this very carefully and any planned legislation to take our cherished police service kicking and screaming down this road should be rejected. The police service is totally against such changes and Sir Hugh Orde, the respected president of ACPO, has said that there could be senior resignations if such a policy were to be implemented. Similar caution has been expressed by Sir Paul Stephenson,  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1076"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1076</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, when he stated that regional and national gangs would be allowed to flourish because of a lack of national co-ordination, as local commissioners would stand, quite understandably, on local issues, and we do not have a federal system of law enforcement, as in the United States.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="10072235000087"></a>Caution is the watchword. Let us not destroy the good simply for the sake of change. I leave the Minister with the following questions to answer. I hope that he answers, because there is a tendency in this House for Ministers not to answer the questions that they are asked in debates. Does he accept that it is not true that violent crime increased under the previous Administration? Can he assure the House that front-line policing will not be reduced by the proposed cuts in policing budgets? Is he prepared to accept the risk of rising crime and more crime victims by preventing the courts from using prison as a final deterrent and introducing community sentences for profit in their place? Can he reassure the police that the discredited Sheehy report will not be revisited? Finally, does he accept the very real dangers of the politicisation of the police by the introduction of elected commissioners?</p>

We also have the benefit of a very balanced report, produced jointly by the Chief Inspector of Constabulary and the two audit bodies for England and Wales.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="10072235000089"></a>I should like to add my support to the Government's intention to consult-I repeat, consult-on plans for the election of police commissioners. This strikes a balance between the practice in, for instance, the United States-on which the noble Lord gave us a valuable insight-where chief police officers are elected on a political basis, and the United Kingdom. The former is quite rightly anathema to senior police officers in this country, since it would remove the ultimate operational independence from the chief police officer, while the Government's proposal would make the commissioner accountable to his electorate.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="10072235000090"></a>However, this is a sensitive subject on which there are differing views from within the police forces and outside, as the noble Lord articulated. The Government are wise to consult on this. A factor to be considered will not least be the actual control that a commissioner would have over the selection and employment of chief and senior police officers in the respective forces. I should be very interested to hear the contribution of my noble friend Lady Harris from the Benches of our coalition partners.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="10072235000091"></a>I turn to SOCA. At a recent conference of the Police Foundation, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson left his audience in no doubt on the resourcefulness of the masters of organised crime, not only in the sophistication of their methods, but in the ever widening geographical scope of their operations. For instance, I understand that SOCA keeps closely in touch with the US Coast Guard. I believe that SOCA in its short life has made a promising start, but it must be resourced to enable it to have multifocused vision, as it were, on its global activities, while being able to  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1077"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1077</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>address domestic considerations in the United Kingdom. It is in the latter environment that more co-operation between forces would be beneficial to SOCA's effectiveness.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="10072235000092"></a>That leads me on to the subject of amalgamation of forces. I entirely support the Government in their view that this can be only on a voluntary basis with mutual agreement between forces. We saw a few years ago the tensions that arose from what was perceived by certain forces as attempted shotgun marriages, if your Lordships will pardon the metaphor.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="10072235000093"></a>Where there is real scope for co-operation is in relatively non-contentious areas, such as IT and the back office in general, in forensics and in motorway policing, where a regional or even a national unit might be considered. In many of these areas, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire have taken the initiative and that could provide a good example nationally.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="10072235000094"></a>Let us not forget the main thrust in this debate. The police community in England and Wales is understandably concerned at the impact of the cuts that will inevitably be required to be made. It has been well said that every country has the police it deserves. We are proud and well served by our police forces, and it is incumbent on the coalition Government that these unpalatable measures are handled as sensibly and sensitively as possible.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="10072235000096"></a>According to the British Crime Survey, whose statistics, as we heard, were released last week, crime is at its lowest level for three decades. It dipped below 10 million offences to fall by 9 per cent last year to the lowest level since comparable records began in 1981-the year in which I became a member of a then police committee. Crime recorded by the police also fell by 8 per cent to 4.3 million crimes in the 12 months to April this year.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="10072235000097"></a>These statistics do not, however, include some of the more serious violent and sexual crimes, such as homicide and rape, but these are covered by police figures, and event-accounting for these gaps does not shift the overall downward trend in crime statistics, as the noble Lord, Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate, has told us. However, the figures still mean that 26,000 people fall victim to a crime every day, and the one area that proves resistant to such welcome falls in crime rates is sexual offences. This rise may represent the implementation of new guidelines to improve the recording of rape; nevertheless, it is extremely worrying. However, we should all be very happy and congratulate those who have contributed to these considerable falls in crime. I am sure that your Lordships will wish such gains to be maintained, and indeed built on, because 26,000 people rendered as victims of crime every day is far too many.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="10072235000098"></a>We recognise that to wish for continued falls in crime in our present economic context is perhaps to place hope over experience, as previous periods of economic downturn have generally been followed by  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1078"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1078</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>upwardly mobile crime figures. Let us hope that that will not be so this time. I believe that we all have a part to play in helping to ensure that it does not happen. We know that proposals to come before Parliament would fundamentally alter the form and nature of police accountability in England and Wales. I should have thought that the recent crime figures might have persuaded the Home Secretary that police accountability, through the police authorities, had finally come good and that the structures put in place to ensure that police forces focused on providing police services to the satisfaction of their communities was working.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="10072235000099"></a>The arguments around this proposal will be brought out when we shortly see the consultation document. I understand that it will not be in the form of a White Paper, which is a little disappointing, but I hope that my noble friend will reflect on the success of police authorities and not consider putting in their place untested and potentially expensive experiments which will deflect politicians and professionals alike from the core policing tasks.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="10072235000100"></a>We have been reminded about the Sheehy proposals, which were indeed disastrous, but I also well remember the last time that we were engulfed in proposals to alter police structures and accountability, between 2005 and 2006. Then, we saw considerable falls in police performance in serving the most fundamental of the public's needs, to which the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, referred. I am talking, of course, about the proposed mergers of police forces which, thankfully, were dropped because of massive opposition across the country. I hope that we learn from that mistaken proposal.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="10072235000101"></a>The present system has since 1995 delivered success, huge falls in crime and year-on-year efficiency savings-more than 30 per cent over 10 years. There are welcome signs that the service and national agencies are increasingly making inroads into the terrible threats posed to every neighbourhood by both serious organised crime and terrorism. All those developments are to be applauded and we would be foolish to throw away a system that has delivered such results.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="10072235000102"></a>Within the statistics that I spoke of earlier there are others that are more insidious and below the radar. So I now move on, briefly, to voice a very real concern about how victims of crime are treated. Last weekend I attended a meeting of the National Victims' Association, of which I am a patron. This amazing organisation, led by its chair David Hines, supports families of those who have lost loved ones through murder or manslaughter. On another occasion I will bring to the attention of noble Lords much more detail about how both policing and the criminal justice system as a whole have so grievously and badly let down those who have to turn to this charitable organisation for help. It exists from hand to mouth and almost certainly will not be able to continue unless core funding for its services is provided in the very near future. Those families are the lost survivors who receive barely any help or recognition and it is a national shame that that is so.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="10072235000103"></a>We heard the most chilling and horrendous stories of how relatives of murder victims were treated. I will, if I may, quote two instances which illustrate areas

We were told about Hughie and Betty, whose son was drugged and then beaten to death. The people responsible put his body in the boot of a car, drove it on to the Derbyshire moors and set fire to it. They were caught but because they simply blamed each other, the police did not know which one to charge with delivering the fatal blow and no one was ever charged with George's murder. On top of that, to this day, Hughie and Betty are regularly intimidated by the families of the murderers.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="10072235000104"></a>Then there were Carla and Rachel, two young women. Their father, a retired police officer, was beaten to death in the kitchen of his home and his blood covered the floor, walls and ceiling. The police said that there was no funding to pay for a professional clean-up team, so those two young ladies had to do it themselves. On their hands and knees they cleaned up their murdered father's blood, and years later they are still deeply traumatised by the experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="10072235000105"></a>I met all these relatives and was struck by their dignity and bravery, so I determined to tell noble Lords their stories. I have many more, sadly, to remind us that policing also needs to focus on those many, many victims of crime who are not helped sufficiently by either the police or the criminal justice system. I will most certainly be speaking about the National Victims' Association on other occasions.</p>

It is also a pleasure to participate on what we should term "Mackenzie" day in your Lordships' House, with two successive debates-albeit with slightly different spellings-inspired by a Lord Mackenzie. I, too, regret that the noble Lord, Lord Wills, is not able to make his maiden speech in today's debate.

Individual officers deal routinely with bad or extreme behaviour, and we have just heard some vivid examples of that. They

They do so with courage and without complaint.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="10072235000109"></a>There are many agencies in the criminal justice system, and all have made a contribution to the long-term decline in offending-and there can be no doubt that there has been a long-term decline. However, no one can doubt that the police, alongside those other agencies, have played their part in these important advances too. Yet there can be no room whatever for complacency. Offending in the UK is still high by global standards. Crime is still responsible for enormous individual harms and for massive social and economic costs. Therefore, we need new policies and ever more effective agencies that can bear down on crime, and can reduce it yet more substantially. This needs to happen now against the grim backdrop of deficit reduction, from which no public sector organisation can be immune. This is, then, an opportune moment for a fresh and fundamental look at policing in the UK-a good moment to scrutinise the model that in all its essentials is now 50 years old, a model which was left relatively untouched by the previous Government.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="10072235000110"></a>The first challenge is to create a structure that focuses on different categories of crime. It is not self-evident that 43 forces structured around metropolitan areas and old county lines is an appropriate model for dealing with crime and disorder today. SOCA is a real advance, as is the regional focus on counterterrorism. However, many policing functions in the 43 forces may be better provided at local, regional or national level.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="10072235000111"></a>At grassroots level, in the immediate locality with which we can all identify, we need an intense and accountable focus on anti-social behaviour and locally generated volume crime. There are issues, too, at regional level. I recently saw an excellent programme on television about a truly impressive and innovative specialist police unit for rape set up by Hampshire police. At the end of the programme, the rape unit was closed down. That was because serious sexual crime in Hampshire was infrequent and its incidence unpredictable, so the utilisation of officers was uneven. The obvious answer, perhaps, was that this very real centre of excellence should have extended its geographic focus to a more appropriate regional level, but structural impediments stood in the way. On the other hand, some crime has a more national or global focus. Cyber crime costs our economy literally billions of pounds, but the police's focus on online fraud is simply lamentable. Here I declare an interest as chairman of PayPal Europe.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="10072235000112"></a>At all those different levels, not just at the most local level, the police need to be more accountable for the outcomes that we want them to deliver. At national level, we should also re-evaluate the architecture of the oversight institutions, including ACPO, to ensure that there is a challenging, strategic and performance-enhancing centre at the very heart of British policing.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="10072235000113"></a>Secondly, the police need to bring their workforce practices into line with the world around them, which has changed massively over recent decades. Frankly, Governments have, for perfectly understandable reasons, dodged that issue for too long. As with MI5 and SOCA, policing at every level needs to focus more on the offender and less on cleaning up after the offence.  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1081"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1081</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>That points to more intelligence-based policing, greater analysis and a smarter use of technology. Modern policing needs greater flexibility and a wider range of capabilities than a single point of entry currently allows, with different kinds of specialists and front-line officers focusing on different kinds of crime. Moreover, police pay should relate to achievement, not to tenure. Weak performance should also be addressed, as in other organisations, and pensions should be portable, offering greater workforce mobility.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="10072235000114"></a>There are operational issues as well. Shift patterns should be more flexible, allowing commanders more easily to match resource to operational need. There is more crime and disorder on a Saturday night than on a Monday morning. Police productivity can be increased in other ways. Procurement of helicopters and the like should be centralised, not localised. Back-office services inefficiently duplicated across multiple forces can be outsourced, and all core policing processes should be re-examined and made fit for purpose and cost-effective-a common call.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="10072235000115"></a>I note, as did a previous speaker, the joint report released this week by the Audit Commission and HMIC suggesting that only 12 per cent of police costs could be saved through greater efficiency. From my experience, I would say that, for a mature bureaucracy, that is a very modest target indeed.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="10072235000116"></a>The third challenge is one for Ministers, not for the police. Much public and, indeed, political rhetoric connects the notion of reducing crime exclusively with uniformed front-line policing. In truth, we will not bear down on crime as we could and should unless and until policymakers, and all the multiple agencies in and around the criminal justice system, work harmoniously together with matching and complementary objectives and focus hard on the offender. Together, they must aim to prevent individuals entering the pathway to offending and to address the causes of the offending behaviour in those who do, particularly in relation to drugs. Finally, they must strive at all costs to prevent repeat offending.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="10072235000117"></a>Only when we have effective multiagency working in democratically accountable structures with high-quality information and performance reporting have we any hope of achieving the massive further reduction in crime which I am sure is possible, and which I am also sure all here desire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="10072235000119"></a>The expectations of the police among the public are very high. For one thing, the public expect to see a lot of them and to see almost instant results and success. In this television age we have become accustomed to seeing cases solved within an hour, minus seven minutes for commercials, and often using cutting-edge forensic techniques-would that life were quite so simple.  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1082"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1082</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Whenever I have raised this issue directly with senior officers, they have been keen to acknowledge the public's wish for highly visible police on the streets and have played down the problems of competing calls on the funds of expensive forensics, but I cannot help thinking-the noble Lord, Lord Birt, touched on this-that there is a major tension here of which we will see more in the next few months.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="10072235000120"></a>Public trust and confidence are among the building blocks of successful policing. Without them it must be difficult to achieve policing by consensus. I am afraid that it is inevitable that statistics will be bandied about regarding police numbers, crime rates, detection rates and so on. I was interested to see in the report published a few days ago from the Audit Commission and HMIC, to which several noble Lords have referred, that the forces that achieved the highest cashable efficiencies do not have lower levels of public confidence, which may be something to take on board.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="10072235000121"></a>The British Crime Survey tells us that there is a disparity between perceptions about crime rates nationally, which are thought to be constantly on the rise, and people's perceptions in local areas, which are closer to reality. The issue of public trust in crime statistics behoves us all to use them responsibly. If the figures are to give a realistic picture, it is important to understand that in the case of some crimes an apparent increase in the rate may be a sign of success because the victim has been able to report the crime.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="10072235000122"></a>I had expected the noble Lord, Lord Mackenzie, to talk about prevention-he is nodding and I think that he has anticipated what I am going to say-which is an important role of the police.</p>

That in itself is a preventive measure.</p>

<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="10072235000124"></a><b><a name="100722-0001.htm_spnew76"></a><a name="10072235000552"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> Indeed. The rollout of Safer Neighbourhoods teams has been welcome in that connection, as well as in others, which is why local authorities have invested heavily in them. It will not be easy for local authorities buying that service or for the police to weigh up the competing calls on money. Policing is a particularly people-heavy activity. I understand that it accounts for about 80 per cent of the budget. There are not the same powers to make employees redundant as in other areas of employment. I am not trying to encourage noble Lords to leap up and say that we are predicting massive redundancies. I am pointing out that there is an issue.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="10072235000125"></a>A number of ways of working are perhaps a bit out of date, to which the noble Lord, Lord Birt, referred. There will be outcomes from cutting down on recruitment, and not just in the numbers. It is still a struggle to get our police forces to look like the public they serve. Recruiting from BME communities and promoting those officers to higher ranks has long been an issue and has an impact on the trust of the different communities.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="10072235000126"></a>The numbers game has meant that, over a long period, there has been something of a misrepresentation about the numbers in operational roles, at any rate as I  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1083"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1083</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have seen them. It does not seem necessarily to be better to have a warranted officer dealing with, for instance, human resources problems. I suspect that this is likely to become more of an issue because of the matters to which I have referred. Police officers cost considerably more on average than police staff members. I understand that not only have the headline figures for spending on the police increased, but within those, overtime payments have increased by over 90 per cent. It has long seemed to me that overtime needs to be addressed. Furthermore, officer numbers have increased over the past 10 years by 12 per cent while civilian staff numbers have risen by 46 per cent. That in itself has been a move in the right direction and I hope it does not row back.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="10072235000127"></a>Although I hate the term, I was interested to see that a new key performance indicator has been introduced in London regarding the front line: to maximise the use of warranted officers deployed into operational policing in order to produce an annual 2 per cent improvement. This is not wholly new. Something similar has been used in the Met for eight or nine years, with an operational policing measure to accurately reflect the number of police officers and police staff who provide a visible uniform presence, but it has become a performance indicator.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="10072235000128"></a>If I may say so, the noble Lord, Lord Mackenzie, did not serve his cause well by rejecting wholesale, as I heard it, the lessons that might be learnt from the private sector. I do not support transferring every private sector approach into the public sector, but some can work well. Indeed, the private sector can also sometimes learn from the public sector. One of the findings of Sir Ronnie Flanagan's review of policing was the negative impact of risk aversion on decision-making, something which the private sector is better at tackling. I was interested to read Jan Berry's comments, in her recent report, that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="10072235000398"></a>"Over-reliance on compliance with set rules and targets has reduced the ability of many officers to use their professional judgement".</p>

<p><a name="10072235000378"></a>She said also that there are,</p>
<ul><a name="10072235000411"></a>"strong links between a predisposition to avoid taking risks and levels of professional knowledge, skills and experience in the use of discretion".</ul>
<p><a name="10072235000379"></a>Those are important points.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="10072235000129"></a>Just before the election, the CBI published a paper on what in its view the private sector has to offer the police by way of smarter working and different working in order to increase productivity and reduce costs. It talks about the need for,</p>
<ul><a name="10072235000412"></a>"the right people with the right skills doing the right things at the right times-the fundamentals of a modern workplace. But too often the debate about crime at a national and local level has tended to focus on overall officer numbers and has avoided questions about how these officers are deployed and their overall effectiveness".</ul>
<p><a name="10072235000380"></a>It also makes the point that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="10072235000399"></a>"Success has frequently been measured by inputs-the overall number of officers-rather than outcomes-reducing crime and dealing with the consequences of crime".</p>

<p><a name="10072235000381"></a>I share the focus on practical measures contained in the report, and while I do not support everything it says, there is a lot that is sensible. There is also a focus  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1084"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1084</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on practical measures, which characterises much of the coalition's programme for government on crime and policing. They range from the use of technology to make policing more effective at lower cost and with fewer time-consuming activities that give bureaucracy a bad name-bureaucracy does have a place-to requiring hospitals to share non-confidential information so that the police can target work on gun and knife crime hot spots.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="10072235000130"></a>In the short time that we have today, and without the consultation paper, one can only scratch the surface of what is to be said about crime and policing.

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="10072235000132"></a>I have long been concerned about the relationship between crime rates and the incidence of repeat offending among those released from custodial sentences, particularly among young offenders. I have been impressed by the way in which education initiatives in prison, together with a focus on training for skills for employment, can make a huge impact on reoffending rates. So I was particularly proud of the way in which the Labour Government focused laser-like attention on this issue, developing nationwide schemes through the offenders' learning and skills scheme, the Learning and Skills Council and FE colleges, as well as hugely successful collaborations with the Open University. These were accompanied by the encouragement of a range of initiatives, including many employer-led schemes such as the National Grid Transco young offenders' scheme, which I have long supported. While I was chief executive of Universities UK I encouraged the scheme to find places in the university sector for the employment of young offenders.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="10072235000133"></a>Like other noble Lords, I shall refer to the crime statistics published last week which show that the Labour Government's commitment over more than 10 years has paid off. The British Crime Survey showed a 9 per cent drop, the lowest since the survey began in 1981, and crimes recorded by police forces across England and Wales fell by 8 per cent. The statistics show-other noble Lords have referred to this, as did the <I>Daily Telegraph</I>-that crime is at its lowest level on record. Indeed, the <I>Independent</I> newspaper said that the figures,</p>
<ul><a name="10072235000413"></a>"paint an impressive picture of the [Labour] party's record on crime during its 13 years in power".</ul>
<p><a name="10072235000382"></a>Although I entirely agree with the Home Secretary in another place that figures for offences are still far too high, I hope the Minister, when responding to the debate, will pay tribute to the impressive way in which the police and other agencies have tackled crime over  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1085"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1085</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the past 10 years and that he will not be churlish in acknowledging the previous Government's commitment to reducing these figures.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="10072235000134"></a>Governments often have difficulty in seeing beyond the short term and there are many pressures which dissuade them from doing so, including the media. I hope the coalition Government will be just as determined as my party was in government to stick with policies that work in the longer term. That is why focusing on reoffending pays such dividends in cutting crime rates. There are a huge number of social, economic and other issues that cause first offences, and these have been explored in many debates in your Lordships' House. For many offenders, a prison sentence is a wake-up call and can provide a chance for greater self-awareness and true rehabilitation, largely through education and the prospect of developing skills that most prisoners did not even begin to think they had.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="10072235000135"></a>In a Question earlier this year in the House, the noble Baroness, Lady Garden of Frognal, who was a moment ago in her place, I was glad to see, said that,</p>
<ul><a name="10072235000414"></a>"education in prison is a proven pathway to reducing reoffending".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 8/2/10; col. 471.],</ul>
<p><a name="10072235000383"></a>and the noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington, emphasised the importance of all-round education for mature prisoners who can neither read nor write. My Government increased investment in education for all offenders threefold and increased spending on education for young people in custody more than sevenfold. Will the Minister commit to similar levels of investment in this hugely important area at a time when, because of greater economic challenges, ex-prisoners will find it even harder to be accepted as good citizens and potentially good employees?</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="10072235000136"></a>I hope the coalition Government do not throw away the huge strides that have been made. Only a few days ago, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, Anne Owers, in her valedictory address, emphasised the considerable progress that had been made in prisons. On education, she said that in 2003, 78 per cent of prison education was assessed as inadequate by the education inspectorate; in 2009 it was 6 per cent. That is not to deny her criticisms in other areas-including a lack of action on the Corston report and the Bradley report, both produced by Members of this House-but there is no doubt that there has been a sea change in emphasis on education and skills development as the key to reducing reoffending.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="10072235000137"></a>I hope the Minister will acknowledge the importance of this in delivering the aim of the Justice Secretary, Kenneth Clarke,</p>
<ul><a name="10072235000415"></a>"to end the revolving door of crime and reoffending".</ul>
<p><a name="10072235000384"></a>He reminded us that prisoners not given access to education in custody are three times more likely to reoffend.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="10072235000138"></a>This should be an entirely non-partisan issue and, although it is important to acknowledge the strides made by the Labour Government, there is no room for complacency. There is a huge challenge ahead. In a recent factsheet on education in prisons, Civitas, the Institute for the Study of Civil Society, found that  76 per cent of prisoners do not have paid employment to go to after release; almost 90 per cent of prisoners under the age of 21 reoffend within two years; and  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1086"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1086</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>almost two-thirds of adult prisoners reoffend within two years. Employment is said to reduce reoffending by between a third and a half. If that were not compelling enough, the total cost of recorded crime committed by reoffenders is estimated at around £11 billion per year.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="10072235000139"></a>The key to much of this is that half of all prisoners do not have the skills required by 96 per cent of jobs That is what the Offender Learning and Skills Service is working hard to address, along with the heartening number of education and training programmes produced by other bodies at national and regional level.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="10072235000140"></a>I conclude with a further reference to the young offenders' programme led by National Grid Transco. This scheme now involves scores of employers and has demonstrated dramatic achievements for the hundreds of offenders who have gone on to rebuild their lives and the 80 companies that employ them. The reoffending rate of young people through this programme is less than 6 per cent, as opposed to the national average of 70 per cent. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary in another place has, like his predecessor in the previous Government, commended the scheme as demonstrating what can be achieved by sustained effort and commitment.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="10072235000141"></a>The coalition Government are committed to the values of the big society. Reducing reoffending is a key area where these values are most relevant and will be tested. Will the Minister confirm that they will continue to support these programmes and the important programmes and initiatives delivered via public funding?</p>

I go further in congratulating him because, with the authority of the experience and knowledge that he brings to policing issues, he has presented a devastating case to the House and made my task much easier. I totally endorse his case and associate myself with the pertinent and crucial questions he has put to the Minister. I look forward to the Minister's reply with great interest. I recognise that sometimes we tend to overburden Ministers with questions-when I was on the other side of the Chamber I counted 43 on one occasion, but I do not think there are 43 questions today-and, if he is unable to answer all the questions, I trust that he will, in his usual courteous manner, provide written answers to those who have taken part in the debate.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="10072235000143"></a>The admirably brief contribution of the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, touched on two issues. He referred to the resourcing of SOCA. Several noble Lords said that SOCA is an innovative step forward in co-ordination, both nationally and internationally. That begs the question of whether the resourcing of SOCA will remain adequate. Are there plans to maintain funding of that very important element?</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="10072235000144"></a>The noble Viscount's second point was on elected police commissioners and the balance, as he put it, between the United Kingdom and the United States. In my experience of the United States, it is not the case that police commissioners are elected in major cities. In New York, Los Angeles and Chicago they are appointed by the mayor. There is quite an interchange  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1087"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1087</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>between city chiefs of police moving from one major city to another. In each case, once they are appointed, they are answerable to the mayor and the authority-be that the city council or city management committee. Therefore, they are accountable to the public of the city of which they are chief of police. It is true that in the county system, the sheriff or deputy sheriff in many cases is elected, with all the dangers that my noble friend Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate set out.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="10072235000145"></a>It may have been Winston Churchill who said that truth was the first casualty of war. I sometimes feel that language and its meaning are the first casualties of political exchange. That is certainly the case at the present time with many of the political exchanges that we have had between the Government, the opposition parties, the public, within the coalition and beyond. For example, the Government talk of the millions of pounds to be saved by efficiency savings when in truth that means cuts, as the noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond, said in her very thoughtful and wise contribution. The Government would do themselves a great service by reading it with interest, taking her experience and knowledge into account. She made the point that efficiency savings had been with us for a decade. They have been achieved, but to pretend that they can continue and to multiply that achievement and call it efficiency savings is a misuse of that phrase.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="10072235000146"></a>Statistics have been given by a number of noble Lords and the facts are simple. Crime has gone down, according to the BCS on 15 July 2010. But the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister have said that crime has gone up. The Home Secretary said that on 7 June. The truth is that violent crime as recorded has fallen by 50 per cent since 1995 according to the BCS. The British Crime Survey was endorsed, as has been said by my noble friend, by Sir Michael Scholar and the ONS as the best and most authoritative survey to tell us what crime is doing within the country in which we live. The BCS was introduced by the Conservatives in 1991, but now, when its figures produce an inconvenient truth, the Government seek to question them.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="10072235000147"></a>Accountability is another word that is strangely abused and misused. My noble friend Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate spelt out the accountability currently falling to the police and the people and representatives to whom they are accountable-everything from courts at one level to the Home Secretary at the other level, through police authorities and so forth. For the life of me, I fail to see how accountability or transparency is improved by taking the accountability currently afforded to the police through the policing pledge and elected and independent members of police authorities and investing that in a single individual-leaving aside the fears and warnings my noble friend spelt out. The Government would do well to consider that when the consultation comes. I am sure the opinion that will be voiced will be that accountability is hardly likely to be increased by such a move.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="10072235000148"></a>Another misuse of the language is the word "targets". The Government tell us that they have removed targets in the health service and in the police service. The target of seeing a cancer specialist within 14 days in the health service and the scrapping of the police pledge were described as the removal of targets. I get  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1088"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1088</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>off the train on a Monday morning at Euston Station and for the past couple of weeks have been bombarded everywhere by big posters promising me that the National Westminster Bank will do a whole series of things about answering phone calls and dealing with my complaints. They rightly call them commitments because they are committed. They are promises. They are something that they would give me were I a NatWest customer, in return for being such a customer.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="10072235000149"></a>In that sense, I look to the police pledge as being precisely that-a pledge and a commitment. It was not a target. What did it promise the public? There were a series of 10 pledges that covered treating people fairly with dignity and respect and ensuring fair access at a time reasonable and suitable to them. Others included responding to messages within 24 hours, answering 999 calls within 10 seconds and going to a whole series of regular public meetings. If you were a victim of crime, they would see how often you would like to be informed of progress. You had the right to be kept informed at least every month if you wished for as long as was reasonable. Those were not targets: they were levels of service that we promised the public as part of our commitment in government.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="10072235000150"></a>Therefore, my question is a relatively simple one. What are the real reasons for that being scrapped, as it is not a target but a commitment? Has the policing pledge been scrapped because the Government believe that the public do not require the promised levels of service that were being delivered via the pledge? Or is it that, as they know, the intention is to cut policing budgets by 25 per cent, which would guarantee that there would be fewer police and fewer resources, thereby rendering the pledge impossible to meet? That, it seems to me, is the central question and one that I would be grateful if the Minister could address.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="10072235000151"></a>The Minister was asked a series of other questions that arise from the commitment to substantially cut funding. Several noble Lords referred to the Audit Commission and HMRC report published on 20 July. Do the Government accept the report of the commission that a funding cut of 12 per cent will negatively affect and impact on front-line police numbers? The simple translation of that question is, do the Government expect police numbers on the front line to be as great at the end of the exercise-perhaps the life of this coalition in four years' time-as it is now? Or, are the Government for the first time prepared to admit that there have to be substantial cuts, if only because we know that some 90 per cent of the budget goes on policing and police support finances and only 10 per cent is spent on other issues. Taking 25 from 100 does not leave 90. You have to get something substantially less, which can only mean a loss of numbers. Central to that is whether the Government will continue to fund centrally police salaries. Will that be maintained? Given that the Home Secretary seems to be in denial regarding the record falling crime numbers over a period, and to echo the question asked by my noble friend Lord Mackenzie, do the Government accept the view of the Lord Chancellor, who said that the crime rate had fallen under Labour?</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="10072235000152"></a>All of the contributions to this debate have been valuable. A number, including those of my noble friend Lady Warwick and the noble Lord, Lord Birt,

All point to the difficulty of maintaining anything like the level of service that we provide to the community, which people expect. They will hold to account very closely a Government who reduce that level. They will be even less impressed with a Government who are not honest enough to tell them what they are doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="10072235000154"></a>Perhaps I may start by agreeing with the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, and paying tribute to the police for their tireless work on all of our behalves. They work under extreme pressure, often risking their lives, and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="10072235000155"></a>I have listened carefully to the contributions of all noble Lords today, and take note of what they have all said. I was very much looking forward to the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Wills, whose former constituency is very near my home, on his maiden performance in this House. Perhaps his noble friends will pass him my best wishes for a speedy recovery.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="10072235000156"></a>Tackling crime and anti-social behaviour is a priority for this Government. We believe that the best way to achieve this is with a democratically accountable police service that adopts a commonsense approach to policing and is free to tackle local priorities. We need to move away from a centrally micromanaged police service, shackled with unnecessary bureaucracy. The public expects, quite rightly, that police officers should be on the streets, tackling crime, criminal behaviour and helping communities to feel safer, not stuck behind desks, away from the public, completing unnecessary forms. Regrettably, that is what we find-a police service tied up in red tape and denied the discretion to do its job properly.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="10072235000157"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mackenzie, points, among other things, to a 9 per cent drop in crime levels, reported by the British Crime Survey, as a measure of the previous Government's success. Of course, any fall in crime is very welcome, but this does not show the whole picture. Crime, by any measure, remains too high. As my noble friend Lady Harris said, 26,000 crimes take place every day in our country. The police continue to record more than 1,000 incidents of grievous or aggravated bodily harm each day and perhaps even more worryingly, around 100 incidents of serious knife crime. Muggings and violence against strangers remain stubbornly high, with more than 1 million offences last year, according to the British Crime Survey. The noble Lord, Lord Birt, referred to the fact that we are still a country, in the international context, with a high relative rate of crime. Levels of victimisation are much higher in the UK than in many other countries. The latest International Crime Victimisation Survey in 2004-admittedly that is some years ago now, but it is still important-found that over 20 per cent of the population of England and Wales had been the victim of a household crime that year, compared with just 12 per cent in France and 13 per cent in Germany.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="10072235000158"></a>My noble friend Lady Harris asked about victim support. We provide funding of £30 million to Victim Support, an organisation that works alongside the National Victims' Association. I assure my noble friend that we will ensure that victims are at the centre of the criminal justice system, and a new victims' commission has been appointed to help this. We will not lose sight of the awful anguish that victims feel, and we are reviewing the services provided.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="10072235000159"></a>The British Crime Survey is an important survey, but it does not cover all victims or all crimes. It omits rape, sexual assault, drug offences, fraud, forgery, crime against businesses, and even murder. We have long argued the need for it to capture the experience of young people, and only now, for the first time, is there an experimental element to it which reveals, depending on your definition, anything between several hundred thousand and 2 million crimes against those under 16. The Government share the UK Statistics Authority's desire to have crime statistics that are robust and generate public trust. This is a complex issue and we are considering how this should be achieved in consultation with the UK Statistics Authority and others.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="10072235000160"></a>The police service needs more freedom from central control, with fewer centrally driven targets and less intervention and interference from Government. That is why we have abolished the centrally imposed target on police forces to improve public confidence and have scrapped the policing pledge. We want the police to be crime fighters, not form fillers. And yet the police have been spending more time on paperwork than on patrol. That is unacceptable. We will be ruthless in identifying and eradicating processes and procedures that are unnecessarily time-consuming for police officers and support staff, including in the wider criminal justice system. For example, by November we will scrap the stop form in its entirety and reduce the burden of the stop and search procedures. We will also consider how we can maximise the use of technology to reduce the paper work in policing.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="10072235000161"></a>To cut crime, policing relies on the consent and co-operation of the public that it serves, but conditions that support this, such as trust in the police, confidence that the police and councils deal effectively with crime and anti-social behaviour and confidence in the wider criminal justice system are still too low. The bond between the police and local people is too weak. This is because the police have been focusing on the issues that national politicians have told them are important rather than their local communities. The police have been reporting their performance to civil servants in Whitehall rather than giving information to their local communities, so they can judge how well they are doing. I respectfully remind the noble Lord, Lord Mackenzie, that only 7 per cent of the public are aware that they can go to their police authority if they are unhappy with their policing. As his noble friend Lord Rooker wisely noted during the passage of the Police Reform Bill in 2002:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="10072235000400"></a>"The fact is that if one person in three knows the name of his Member of Parliament, I doubt whether more than one person in a thousand knows the name of any member of the police authority in his area".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 16/4/2002; col. 828.]</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="10072235000162"></a>Effective democratic accountability of the police is the bedrock of the policing model in this country. Robert Peel set this out as long ago as 1829, when he said that,</p>
<ul><a name="10072235000416"></a>"the police are the public, and the public are the police",</ul>
<p><a name="10072235000385"></a>which continues to be our guiding principle today. The fact is that the existing accountability model is not working. Police authorities are too invisible and in cases ineffective. People still do not know how to influence how their streets are policed, let along how to get involved. Only 8 per cent of local councillors are police authority members, and there is no simple way for the public to change them if they feel they are not doing a good job. We need to replace bureaucracy with democratic accountability.</p>

I live in a small village with a parish council. The local police officer attends the parish council at least every three months and has made everybody aware of the policing pledge, which is printed in a newsletter that goes to everybody in the village. I am not on the parish council and do not take any active part in it, but it seems to me that that would belie the black picture being painted. I do not think that there is any particular peculiarity about Irthington or Brampton in the county of Cumbria compared to other parts of the country.</p>

He is very lucky to live in a small village. I am assured that the same case that he has portrayed is not the same everywhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="10072235000165"></a>We need to replace bureaucracy with democratic accountability, which is why we proposed introducing directed elected individuals, elected by and accountable to the public. They will ensure that the police are held to account by the public that they serve, rather than bureaucrats based in Whitehall who cannot fully appreciate local concerns. As my noble friend Lord Bridgeman said, later this month the Home Office will publish a consultation document, with the final policy to be announced in the autumn. We are very keen to hear the views of the public and policing professionals on how this model should work. As the Home Secretary announced at the APA/ACPO conference earlier in the summer, we will soon be bringing forward detailed proposals and introducing the necessary legislation to be implemented in this Session of Parliament.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="10072235000166"></a>On the subject of ACPO, the noble Lord, Lord Birt, asked about its role. The Government's position is that ACPO has an important part to play in the effective delivery of policy and we are working with it to focus its role as the organisation responsible for the professional leadership of the police service and we will do so by ensuring that it is properly accountable and transparent in fulfilling that function and spend public money. We also want to see a return to common-sense policing. We must trust the police service and treat the police as professionals, with the discretion to make key decisions. That is why we will be taking action to return more charging decisions to officers for minor offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="10072235000167"></a>We believe that the police are only part of the solution. Lasting success in tackling crime and anti-social behaviour will lie in the response of local services and communities to the problems they face, and the Government are committed to empowering that response. That is why we will make sure that crime data are published at a level that allows the public to see what is happening on their streets.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="10072235000168"></a>We will also support the police to be available and accessible to their communities through regular police beat meetings, giving residents the opportunity to put forward their concerns and hold the police to account for how they are dealing with problems in their area. We would like to see all adults being part of an active neighbourhood group and playing a role in tackling crime in their communities. We want the voluntary and community sector to play an enhanced role, contributing its expertise and innovation.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="10072235000169"></a>Engaging other local services and building a culture of local co-operation is vital. These partnerships need to drive joint action, not further bureaucracy, and be more accountable to communities. As we reduce the ring-fences on central programmes, streamline funding and allow autonomy for local agencies to set priorities, we will want them to answer for outcomes, not inputs or processes.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="10072235000170"></a>I turn to funding. I have heard the concerns expressed today by noble Lords about this issue. We have made it clear that value for money must be a key driver of everything we do as a Government. The Government's priority is to cut the budget deficit and get the economy moving in the right direction.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="10072235000171"></a>The Budget on 22 June set out our plans to reduce the deficit, including £32 billion per year in spending reductions by 2014-15. The police, along with everyone else, will have to bear a share of that burden. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Birt, for his helpful recommendations, which we will consider carefully.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="10072235000172"></a>There has been some speculation-the noble Lords, Lord Mackenzie and Lord Brett, asked about this-that this could lead to a reduction in the number of police officers. All government departments are subject to the comprehensive spending review, which is due to be completed in October. Before then, it would be misleading and unhelpful to speculate about the outcome.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="10072235000173"></a>In any case, policing is not a numbers game. The test of an effective police force is not how much it costs or the number of officers it employs but how it protects the public it serves. Our challenge is to use our resources most effectively by freeing up officer time to deal with crime. My noble friend Lady Hamwee made some useful suggestions about certain back-office functions.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="10072235000174"></a>I turn to some specific questions. The noble Lord, Lord Birt, raised a point about co-ordination of effort across the piece, from crime to arrest to documentation and through the criminal justice system. That is why the Minister of State for Policing and Criminal Justice, Nick Herbert, has a combined role to enable him to bring together the reform of policy within the wider reform of the criminal justice system. This includes making sure that processes elsewhere in the criminal justice system do not generate excessive bureaucracy for the police.</p>

We agree that we need to ensure that the police and agencies have the capacity and structures to fight serious organised crime. Our proposals will enhance the local accountability of police and create stronger arrangements to tackle crimes that cross force borders, include serious organised crime. For example, we are looking at steps that can be taken to strengthen and further develop collaboration between forces.

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="10072235000176"></a>My noble friend Lady Hamwee asked about risk aversion. We agree with her and with Jan Berry that police officers need to be less risk-averse. That is why the Government's approach to reducing bureaucracy has at its centre the need to return discretion to police officers. Examples of this, as I mentioned earlier, are returning charging decisions to the police for more minor offences and taking action to amend some of the health and safety practices that get in the way of common-sense policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="10072235000178"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, asked about rehabilitation, a subject that we consider very important. We are conducting a full assessment of sentencing and rehabilitation policy to ensure that it is effective in deterring crime, protecting the public, punishing offenders and cutting reoffending, something that she specifically referred to. We will take time to get this right, and we will consult widely before bringing forward coherent plans for reform. We intend to publish proposals for reform in the autumn that will then be subject to public consultation.</p>

The changes to policing that I have outlined today will play an important part in giving the public the police service that they deserve-one that is democratically accountable, effective and free to tackle local priorities.</p>

I look forward to hearing maiden speeches from four new Members of your Lordships' House. I also thank the number of organisations that have offered us briefings for this debate. The consistency of their analysis and the intensity of their concerns are startling.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="10072235000184"></a>Poverty has many faces, none of them attractive. There are many in our world who live in abject, absolute poverty without sufficient nourishment and with no access to clean water, shelter, simple life-saving medicines or rudimentary education. Defeating such poverty remains, quite properly, a supreme cause of our time. There are, however, issues closer to home that should also command our attention and commitment. These might be described as matters of relative poverty, which, for families, was characterised by the founder of the Child Poverty Action Group in this way:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="10072235000401"></a>"Their resources are so seriously below those commanded by the average ... family that they are, in effect, excluded from ordinary living patterns, customs and activities".</p>

<p><a name="10072235000386"></a>It is from this perspective that I would like us to consider the impact of the recent Budget, which cut spending beyond inherited plans by £32 billion a year, as well as raising net taxes by a further £8 billion. Eleven billion pounds of spending cuts will come from specific welfare measures.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="10072235000185"></a>In analysing these issues, let me anticipate and deal with the complaint that the state of the public finances gave no room for any other Budget judgment. Our borrowing has risen because the global financial crisis caused tax receipts to fall and spending to rise. The fiscal stimulus led to more borrowing, but it was the right choice to stop recession turning into depression. We had set out our clear deficit reduction plan, which would have brought the deficit down to 5 per cent of GDP in 2013-14. The coalition Budget goes faster, cuts deeper and adopts a different set of priorities. Let us be clear: the Government chose to do this; they did not need to do it.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1095"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1095</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100722-0001.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="10072235000186"></a>In March, George Osborne declared that we are all in this together and said that he would not balance the Budget on the backs of the poor. It is by that statement that we will judge him and the coalition Government of which he is part. The Chancellor of the Exchequer claimed his Budget as a progressive Budget, saying that it was tough but fair. Tough it was; progressive and fair it most certainly was not. The Budget Red Book presents various charts to justify the claim of being progressive, but the truth has been laid bare, in particular by the IFS. Only by overlaying the Budget measures with the progressive measures inherited from Labour's March Budget can the net result be seen as progressive, even taking account of the personal allowance change. Even this must be treated with some caution, as the analysis does not fully factor in all the draconian consequences of the housing benefit measures. It also cannot as yet take account of what is coming down the track from the cuts that will pour from the expenditure review-cuts that will inevitably impact most on the poor.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="10072235000187"></a>When we hear that the Budget is grounded in fairness and that we are all in it together, frankly, we beg to differ. We do so because of what the Budget contains in rises in VAT; in reductions in tax credits; in the freezing of child benefit; in restricted benefit and pension uprating; in narrowing the gateway to disability living allowance; and in illogical and spiteful cuts in housing benefit.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="10072235000188"></a>I start with the impact of the changes to housing benefit. These changes include taking a reduced level of local rents for the housing allowance; capping rent levels for each type of property; increasing the non-dependant deduction; uprating the local housing allowance rates by CPI, rather than actual rent levels; and docking 10 per cent from the long-term unemployed. These amount to a net cut of £1.7 billion a year-a cut to be met by the poor and those on low incomes. Penalising working-age people who are unemployed is a particularly savage act. The need for reform of housing benefit to improve work incentives is accepted, but a 10 per cent deduction in housing benefit is entirely arbitrary, will cause incredible hardship to those who seek to make up the shortfall from their jobseeker's allowance and will exacerbate poverty in those very communities where jobs are hardest to come by.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="10072235000189"></a>As Shelter points out, the reforms adopting the 30 per cent level rather than the median level of rents for housing allowance will lead to a significant reduction in the amount received by many claimants across the country. Citizens Advice calculates that an average allowance for a two-bedroom property in England will fall by nearly £10 a week, and for a three-bedroom property by £13, worsening existing rent shortfalls. Shelter says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="10072235000402"></a>"We expect that many households will try to remain in their home and be forced to make financial sacrifices in order to do so. For those households already struggling to balance very tight budgets, a reduction in local housing allowance will ... push ... them over the edge, triggering a spiral of debt, eviction and homelessness".</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="10072235000190"></a>This will be made even worse by the uprating over time of local housing allowances by CPI, rather than actual rents, so that the allowance will be increasingly disconnected from rent levels.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1096"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1096</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100722-0001.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="10072235000191"></a>The National Housing Federation has warned that these cuts will put more than 200,000 people across Britain at risk of homelessness. It says that they will force families to move, for some away from social and family networks, undermining well-being, employment and childcare opportunities. It will amount, in effect, to the expulsion of low-income families from some communities. These consequences are not difficult to predict. There is no massive affordable housing programme to rely on to take the pressure off private sector rents. If the expectation is that there will be downward pressure on private sector rents, this is a huge gamble being taken with the lives of some of our most vulnerable families. From the Government there seems to be no recognition of the consequences, no compassion and no understanding of the devastation that this will cause to so many who need our help.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="10072235000192"></a>I turn now to issues of indexation. Until now, most benefits have been uprated by the RPI, with means-tested benefits by the Rossi index, a variant that excludes certain housing-related costs. Moving to uprating all benefits by CPI will mean that the real-terms value of benefits will continue to fall compared to average earnings and will fall at least 1 per cent faster-although the IFS suggests that this would be closer to 2 per cent-than under previous uprating rules. Without countervailing measures, uprating benefits by RPI was anyway at risk of driving inequality as the cumulative gap with earnings widened. Uprating by CPI will, in the terms of CPAG, cause the downward escalator to move even faster. This is a cut to benefits of nearly £6 billion annually-this when research shows that, because of their spending patterns, people on low incomes face much higher inflation rates than CPI. How does the Minister justify this? What rationale underpins this change, other than reducing the costs of benefits?</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="10072235000193"></a>The use of CPI does not relate only to benefits; it has a profound effect on pensions and pensioners. More than 10 million people get a state second pension, including 6 million women. The reforms to S2P in recent years have been particularly focused on improving outcomes for the low-paid. The average state second pension is now £36 a week. The switch to uprating this by CPI rather than RPI means a loss on average of more than £2 a week by 2015, with growing losses thereafter. There was no mention of that when boasting about the triple lock. There are also ramifications for public sector pensions and for many private sector occupational pensions because uprating is linked to S2P uprating. This comes at a time when pensioners are faced with the burdens of the VAT increase and no benefit from the increased personal tax allowance. As the Public Service Pensioners' Council points out, it was assured by all three parties that any changes to public sector pensions would have a long lead-in time and be the subject of consultation. Where was the consultation? It may be fashionable to attack public sector pensions, but many who gave public service are on low or modest pensions and the uprating changes affect them, too. What evidence is adduced to support the Government's intention that CPI is a better measure of inflation for pensioners than RPI? Given that the coalition agreement specifically recognises that work is needed to amend the CPI index, can the Minister advise us of progress?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="10072235000194"></a>We should give credit where credit is due. We welcome the increases in the child tax credit announced for April 2011, even though-as Save the Children pointed out-those on housing benefit will see a reduction in housing support of up to 65 per cent of this increase. However, these increases in child tax credits are dwarfed by a plethora of reductions to the tax credit regime. CPAG calculates that only 20 per cent of the £3.2 billion of cuts will come from reducing entitlement for families on higher incomes. The rest will have a direct impact on low-income families. The increased rate at which tax credits are withdrawn would lose someone earning £16,420 a year £200. Introducing the £2,500 income disregard for households facing a drop in income- a novel invention, I am bound to say-could mean a reduction in tax credits of £1,000, particularly affecting people who take maternity leave or long-term sick leave.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="10072235000195"></a>Families with babies seem to have been especially targeted by this Budget, despite the rhetoric around family values. They lose the health in pregnancy grant, the £545 baby element of the child tax credit and the £500 Sure Start maternity grant, other than for the first child. Then there is the demise of child trust funds. The increase in the child tax credit is not enough to compensate for these. Freezing child benefit for three years will have a disproportionate effect on the poor, because child benefit contributes a larger proportion to their household income than it does for more affluent households. Notwithstanding all this, the Government assert that increasing the child element of the child tax credit above inflation to ameliorate the freezing of child benefit will cause no measurable impact on child poverty in the next two years. Will the Minister please confirm that this assessment is made on the basis of all the measures set out in the latest Budget, rather than just those two items? We welcome the Government's commitment to the child poverty targets but, frankly, this Budget takes us in the wrong direction.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="10072235000196"></a>Time does not permit a detailed analysis of how different households might be affected by different combinations of Budget measures, but the Citizens Advice briefing is recommended reading. However, we know that one group will particularly bear the brunt of this Budget-women. This was covered extensively in yesterday's debate on the role of women. The analysis shows that, of the £8 billion net revenue to be raised in 2014-15, some £6 million will be from women-and this at a time when women still lag behind men in earnings and wealth.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="10072235000197"></a>That is just one more manifestation of a regressive Budget judgment. If we needed proof, the choice of a VAT increase as a revenue-raising measure is it. The 2.5 per cent increase in VAT is the biggest single item in the Budget, raising some £13.4 billion. Both the Prime Minister and his deputy are on record as acknowledging that it is a regressive tax, hitting the poorest hardest. The IFS analysis shows percentage income losses for the poorest to be more than twice those for the richest. The Government know that the VAT hike will have a significant adverse impact on the incomes of poor families but chose it in preference to targeted taxes on the assets and income of the wealthiest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="10072235000198"></a>On proper scrutiny, it is clear that the 2010 coalition Budget is deeply regressive. It cuts benefits, reduces tax credits for families on low and moderate incomes, short-changes pensions and pensioners, exacerbates homelessness and chooses regressive taxes. These choices did not have to be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="10072235000199"></a>We came into politics through a variety of influences. Many of us wanted to bring about social justice, combat poverty and promote equality. The improvement in our own material well-being and our inculcation into grand institutions such as your Lordships' House may have dimmed or deflected that commitment. However, if that cause needed a catalyst-a call to action-it is writ large in this unfair, regressive and ill judged Budget. We have work to do to expose its excesses and we must use our energies to protect those whose lives will be scarred by its ideology.</p>

That trepidation is in no way engendered by the kindness and warmth shown to me and my fellow newcomers to this House by all Members, officers and staff, but by the requirement to be both brief and uncontroversial. That does not come naturally to me. Given the rather rueful faces of some of my noble friends, I think that they probably share that view. Nevertheless, one will do one's best. I am encouraged in that by the traditions of this House. I first encountered those traditions on the very first occasion that I came to the Palace of Westminster many years ago. I came here wearing flares and with an Afro-when one had hair and wore flares-which tells noble Lords just how long ago that was; it was 14 December 1978.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="10072235000201"></a>I came here as a young lawyer accompanying a group of black women from the London Borough of Lewisham. They were concerned about what was happening to their children and other young people in Lewisham-black and white, but largely black-in relation to a piece of legislation known as the sus laws. These women had attempted to initiate a debate about the sus laws in the other place. They had a great deal of support for that from their then local MP, Chris Price, but they did not succeed. The then Labour Government did not want to debate the sus laws or to hear from this group of black women in Lewisham. It was your Lordships' House that found the time and the space to discuss this matter in a debate on a Private Member's Bill on the sus laws initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. I will never forget it, nor will I will forget the respect that was shown to these women and their concerns by the noble Lord and by the late Lord Pitt, who was one of the first Afro-Caribbeans-my race-to find a place and a welcome in your Lordships' House. He was an inspiration to many of us.</p>

However, it was this House, with its tradition of being responsive to the needs of those who might otherwise not get a hearing-the poor and the dispossessed-which showed the way. That taught me something which I have not forgotten in the course of my subsequent career in the law and in politics, and which strengthens my resolve to put before your Lordships a concern that those women in Lewisham would have wanted this House to hear, were they here today. It is a concern about the impact of the Budget, and a number of its proposals, on a group of young people who all too often are not heard in our society-young people at risk and young people in care. These are some of the most vulnerable young people in our society. They do not have much of a chance because they tend to go into care, having been subjected to abuse and disadvantage in myriad ways. When they are in care, I fear that the state does not prove to be a very good parent.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="10072235000203"></a>This Budget was introduced in the context of the notion of the big society. It seems to me that if the big society is to live up to its name, it has to find a place within it for young people at risk and young people in care. I learned, in the course of putting together the Green Paper <I>Every Child Matters</I>, way back in 2003, that young people at risk and young people in care are to be found not just in the inner cities of our in country, but in rural areas too, because poverty and deprivation can be found all over our land. Young people-young people at risk and young people in care-tend to be the least advantaged of all.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="10072235000204"></a>The big society is often juxtaposed with the big state. That is a false dichotomy. It is not a question of whether or not you have a big society or a big state; it must surely be a question as to whether or not the state empowers and enables citizens to make a contribution, to come together to care, and to form sustainable and cohesive communities. I fear that aspects of this Budget work against that. The removal of ring-fencing in terms of local authority grants will, I fear-I am not alone in this; it is a fear shared by many in local government, many social workers and many who run voluntary organisations-lead to a collapse in funding for voluntary organisations, cutbacks in the special support services provided to children in care and children at risk. That would be damaging.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="10072235000205"></a>I ask the noble Lord who will reply for the Government in this debate: please, please, in the course of the spending review that must take place, and is taking place, make sure that there is a stream of work that looks at the impact of the budgetary provisions that we are debating on those children in care and children at risk, and the voluntary organisations that serve them, who will inevitably be affected by the increase in VAT and who do not have a rebate system upon which they can rely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="10072235000206"></a>I ask the noble Lord to think also about how the office of the Children's Commissioner, which is being reviewed, can be strengthened in such a way that it is answerable to Parliament. The Children's Commissioner should be appointed by Parliament and have a specific remit to examine the implications of all Budgets,

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="10072235000209"></a>Poverty is a cause which the noble Lord has spoken passionately about for years. In fact, in his maiden speech in the other place in 1987 he spoke of poverty in his constituency of Brent South. He played a leading role in establishing and launching the £450 million children's fund designed to tackle child poverty-of which he has just spoken. In his young life-the noble Lord is still young; he has not yet reached 60 and middle age will come next year-he has achieved much as a passionate campaigner and activist, as a lawyer who is both a solicitor and a barrister, and he has achieved many firsts, including being the first black Cabinet Minister, as Chief Secretary to the Treasury in May 2002. During his victory speech as an MP in 1987, he famously said, "Today Brent South, tomorrow Soweto!" Of course, he was talking about South Africa being freed from apartheid, but he was also presciently talking about his future appointment as British High Commissioner in South Africa from 2005 to 2009, a role in which he excelled. He has made his mark throughout his career, and we are fortunate that he will continue to make his mark here in this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="10072235000210"></a>Soon in my role as president of the UK India Business Council I will accompany the Prime Minister on his visit to India, following up on what was said in the gracious Speech. I quote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="10072235000403"></a>"My Government looks forward to enhanced partnership with India".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="10072235000211"></a>Although I was born and brought up in India throughout my childhood, although I visit India several times a year, and although India is today a global emerging economic superpower with amazing capabilities in IT, aerospace and even in space, every time that I get off that plane I am hit by the dire, abject poverty. Sadly, 300 million people there live on less than a dollar a day, and many of those are not living, but merely existing. This poverty exists now as much as it did during my childhood in India and I console myself about the enormity of the problem and the challenges that this most diverse and complex country in the world, with a population of over 1 billion, faces.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para125"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="10072235000212"></a>Then I think about us here in the UK, one of the largest absolute economies in the world. Whichever way you measure it-absolute GDP or GDP per capita-we are one of the wealthiest countries in the world. We are relatively small, with 60 million people, yet it saddens me that we have such high levels of poverty and child poverty. According to Save the Children, 3.9 million children are living in poverty.  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1101"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1101</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>There is no excuse at all for poverty in this country. After all, we have one of the most generous welfare states in the world. We have free education; people are entitled to free housing; those without work get an income to live on; and we have free healthcare from cradle to grave-all funded by the state. So surely poverty should not exist at all. And when I say poverty, I mean poverty of any sort, let alone the scale of the dire poverty in India.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="10072235000213"></a>Where are we going wrong and what should we do about it? One answer is that the welfare state is meant to address it and the Government are spending massive amounts on it. Public expenditure has reached 54 per cent of GDP, when it should be at around 40 per cent. This has led us to enter an age of austerity, as the Prime Minister put it. How can we maintain a safety net and at the same time work towards eradicating poverty? I am afraid that increasing taxes in the Budget, maintaining the 50 per cent higher rate tax, maintaining the non-dom levy, increasing VAT, and increasing capital gains tax, will not solve the problem. The Government are not meant to be Robin Hood-taking from the rich to give to the poor. We have seen that this does not work and that even in the boom time, with massive levels of public expenditure, poverty increased. The Gini coefficient that measures wealth and equality is the highest that it has been in 30 years, and over the past decade there has been no increase in the average income of the poorest tenth in our society.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="10072235000214"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, recently asked a Question in this House: what proportion of wealth is held by the richest 10 per cent of the population? The Answer given by the Minister was 54 per cent. This was shown not to be out of line with other countries, with France on 61 per cent and the US on 69.8 per cent. I hope that the noble Lord will forgive me if I say that I strongly believe that the answer is not, as he suggested, to take action to reduce the level of wealth of the top 10 per cent. It is wealth generation that should generate opportunities for wealth creation. I have said it before and I will say it again that the job of the Government is to create an environment for business-in particular SMEs-to flourish and create the jobs that pay the taxes, that pay for the public services, that pay for the welfare that pays for those who genuinely need our help.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para128"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="10072235000215"></a>However, in my eight years on the New Deal task force and then the National Employment Panel, it became very apparent to me that work was the best way out of poverty. Yet, sadly, millions in this country are in a benefits trap where generations in certain areas have not worked, because work often does not pay. The difference between welfare support and a 40-hour week on a minimum wage is £37 a week-hardly enough to inspire people in difficult times to seek jobs. For this reason, the welfare reform Bill is welcome in its efforts to simplify the benefits systems, remove barriers to work and attempt to lessen the hold of the awful benefits trap that exists in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="10072235000216"></a>However, it is even more challenging when our schools are letting our children and our country down, where over a third of 11 year-olds leaving primary school have difficulty reading, and a fifth leave their

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="10072235000217"></a>In my role at Cambridge University as a visiting entrepreneur and a member of the advisory board, I was presented with a paper from Professor Radjou, Jaideep Prabhu and their colleagues on whether the UK can win in an age of scarcity. Their theory is: "more for less for more"-an approach that places emphasis on delivering more value for less cost for more people. If necessity is the mother of invention, as they say, scarcity is the grandmother of innovation. This is where a developed economy such as ours can learn from some of the amazing innovative models that have been pioneered in emerging markets such as India, Brazil and China.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="10072235000218"></a>We have such advantages in this country. We have the finest higher education in the world and cutting-edge research. One university, Cambridge, has produced almost 90 Nobel Prize-winners. Our greatest strength is our people. The Government alone cannot eradicate poverty, even with the best of intentions; we have to work together, and this is where NGOs working together can really help, as we have heard. The coalition Government's answer of promoting the big society and getting communities to work together is fabulous. However, is it not ironic that a big society goes hand in hand with smaller government? It is about people coming together to care, share, help each other and prosper together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="10072235000219"></a>This country used to have a glass ceiling. As recently as three decades ago, it was not a meritocracy. However, today this country is a true meritocracy. It enabled me 21 years ago, with £20,000 of student debt to pay off, to start up a business from scratch. This is a country with opportunity for all, and the poorest person is given hope by that opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="10072235000220"></a>Earlier this week, we in Parliament had a visit from Bill Gates, one of the wealthiest men in the world. He addressed Parliament on development. How inspirational that here is an individual giving away tens of billions of dollars. He changed the world through his business; now he is going to change it through his development work on the alleviation of poverty. I have a saying that achievement leads to inspiration; inspiration leads to aspiration; aspiration leads to achievement-and a virtuous circle follows. We can just imagine that if only we had that virtuous circle in every corner of this country, we would obliterate poverty and genuinely make it history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="10072235000221"></a>Recently, I met those running a charity in India called the Akshaya Patra Foundation. The foundation has a vision that:</p>

<p><a name="10072235000387"></a>Today, it reaches 1.2 million children every day, giving them lunchtime school meals. However, the sad reality is that it has had to adjust its practices. On Monday, after the day off on Sunday, it has to provide double the amount of food for the children because they have not eaten on the Sunday. That is true poverty, and it depresses me that this wealthy nation of ours has poverty in the 21st century. We should be ashamed of ourselves. Our people need to come together, helping one another to succeed. We need to raise the water

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="10072235000224"></a>As a former chair of ACAS, my first instincts are to form a consensus based on bringing the parties together. I am not sure whether those skills will be useful in this House.

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="10072235000225"></a>ACAS's contribution to the modernisation of public services was to recognise that the world of work was not just about collective bargaining but about the millions of individuals, both employers and employees, needing advice. Radical changes were achieved with the involvement and consent of the staff and trade unions in ACAS, and without the demotivating effect of so many pronouncements about public service workers. Calls to the ACAS helpline amounted to 1.2 million last year, and the website is much praised by employers and employees because of its quality and impartiality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="10072235000226"></a>The subject of poverty has been a theme that has threaded throughout my life. On the day of my introduction to this House, one of my cousins gave me a copy of a payslip belonging to our late grandfather, Arthur Howard. It was for £1.53, dated 11 November 1933, and came from New Monckton Collieries near Barnsley, where he worked for most of his life. He brought up four daughters on that wage, played the cello and built the first television in Worsbrough Common. He had no money but a wealth of talent and unfulfilled promise. My own parents taught me the value of work, education and caring for others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="10072235000227"></a>After university, I worked at the Institute of Education in London for 33 years. I had become an assistant registrar at a very early age and was probably destined

I was fortunate to work for the great Lionel Elvin, our director, who had been a member of both the Robbins and McNair committees, and then with Sir William Taylor. Both instilled in me the importance of teacher training and education. So what happened to change me from going in the direction of a potentially glittering university career?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="10072235000228"></a>The institute took a decision in 1969 not to give a pay rise to its clerical and library staff on the ground of affordability. Academics were given a pay rise. I decided that it was patently unfair to pick on the lower paid and helped to form a union branch of NALGO. No one had ever been in a union before. We lobbied the institute and were awarded our pay rise, backdated. I carried on recruiting members and for 16 years was privileged to represent all clerical and related staff in universities in their pay negotiations, and set up national pay scales for the first time. Ninety per cent of the members were women and 90 per cent were first-generation trade union members. I spent most of my career boxing and coxing between my paid employment and my unpaid trade union activity. I moved within the institute to become permanent secretary of the students' union and was licensee of the union bar for 16 years. I am aware that some noble Lords on different sides of the House have owned breweries, and it is possible that some of them have been their occasional customers, but I suspect that very few have actually been licensees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="10072235000229"></a>After 13 years on the TUC General Council, I became its president.

Such were the contrasts in my dual life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="10072235000230"></a>In 1997, the continuing theme of poverty arose when I was appointed a founding member of the Low Pay Commission. This was an absolutely wonderful experience, and I like to think that my practical experience of wage structures and the impact of low wages helped to set up a framework that is virtually intact today. We learnt that poverty is complex-a single mother in the south-east would have to earn over £17 an hour to make up any loss in benefits-yet we fixed on £3.60 an hour because the minimum wage cannot solve everything. We learnt that poverty is not a north/south or even a regional phenomenon. The largest proportion of low-paid workers, in terms of population, live in London and the south-east. We also learnt that the low paid need no lessons in hard work or the ability to calculate their earnings. Observing textile workers calculate their complex piece-rate earnings in their heads to the nearest penny would impress any mathematician.</p>

<p><a name="10072235000389"></a>Those criteria were established at the start of the Low Pay Commission's work, and it is gratifying to see that this evidence-based work continues and is appreciated by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="10072235000232"></a>I am aware of the recent short debate on poverty on 15 June, initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope, and of the excellent contributions that were made. It is not my intention to go over the same ground. I am aware that the measure for poverty might seem like a dry academic debate to some, but if an official poverty measure is changed, it can be used as a respectable excuse for taking away support systems from those who do not fit the new criteria. The Government have promised to maintain the target of ending child poverty in the UK by 2020, and I shall watch this with interest.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para145"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="10072235000233"></a>There are people now seeking work who are healthy and motivated and have a good employment history, but they cannot find work, so how will those with disabilities, language and literacy barriers or no work record find work? Joblessness is a scourge on any society and the Government will be judged on how many people are unemployed. The margin between poverty and just about managing is perilously narrow. Cutting pennies here and there from benefits, VAT costs, pay and pensions may not seem a lot to those who are privileged to lead society, but together they will have a catastrophic outcome for individual families.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para146"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="10072235000234"></a>We are a country of extremes in income and no Government have solved that particular inequality. I make a plea to this Government that more work should be done on why we are a relatively low-wage society. Average earnings of £24,000 a year include paid overtime-mainly done by men-and City bonuses. That completely distorts the real situation. Just as we on the Low Pay Commission discovered, women who earned too little to pay national insurance did not appear on any statistics and could not therefore be counted as a group that might benefit from a national minimum wage. Clearly, steps were taken to rectify the Alice in Wonderland situation, but it shows that statistics without common sense and grounded reality can be used to hold back progress, sometimes unintentionally and sometimes not.</p>

Finally, lest anyone might think that her skills are on the soft side, she also served on the Committee on Standards in Public Life for seven years before becoming its interim chair.

I, therefore, have some direct experience of the fine line walked by some of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in our society, for whom managing a weekly budget and staying out of debt is a constant trial and burden. It takes only one trigger-perhaps a partner leaves, someone falls ill or an employer closes down-for an individual or family to fall behind with their rent and face homelessness. When you are already living in poverty the financial margins are tight and the consequences of default can be devastating. I say that in the confident knowledge that the previous Government-my Government-both understood this fear and acted on it. They understood that you could be working but still poor and they introduced the working families tax credit to make work pay. They understood that a child brought up in poverty would bear the scars for life and so they increased child benefit and set a goal of ending child poverty completely by 2020. They invested in jobs and training to give people the skills to get secure and rewarding work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="10072235000242"></a>That brings me to this Government's Budget and what it tells us about their values and beliefs. First, they seem to have abandoned the post-war Keynesian analysis that government fiscal and monetary measures can mitigate against economic recession. Instead, we appear to be returning to a rather alarming 1930s free market programme, which became discredited first time round and now risks driving the recession into a deeper and longer trough. Of course, there is a need for a clear deficit reduction plan and part of that will

But in the current fragile world economy, there is a particular imperative to prioritise growth as a precondition for economic recovery. That remains Labour's strategy. It is based on sound economic modelling and was already proving to be successful in stopping our economy sliding into a recession. Therefore, the question remains: do the current Government have an alternative growth strategy or are they happy to let high unemployment and increased poverty act as the drivers for future economic policy?</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para154"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="10072235000243"></a>Secondly, despite their election promises, they are intent on squeezing public services and cutting front-line staff. It is obvious to everyone that departmental cuts of 25 per cent or even more can be achieved only by wholesale services being abandoned. Those public servants who are lucky enough to remain will have their income and, therefore, their spending power reduced as a result of the freeze in public sector pay, while those who are made redundant will cost the country billions in lost tax revenues and increased benefit bills. The consequence of this policy is bound to have a further depressing effect and will, of course, particularly impact on the poorest regions where public services play a particularly valuable role.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para155"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="10072235000244"></a>Thirdly, they appear to be abandoning the goal of ending child poverty by 2020. At present nearly 4 million children are living in poverty in the UK. We know from previous research that child benefit has proved to be one of the most effective and popular ways of cutting child poverty so freezing it for three years will hit the very families who need it the most. Again, this will prove to be a false economy because respected research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has estimated that £17 billion every year could be saved from public spending if child poverty was eradicated.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para156"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="10072235000245"></a>Finally, to return to a subject particularly close to my heart, the cuts in housing benefit will cause hardship to many and may well push families in high-priced areas on to the streets. There has of course been a need to reform housing benefit for some time, but the cuts proposed in the Budget are not the solution. There is a myth developing that housing benefit claimants are wayward families bent on living the highlife. In truth, as Shelter research has confirmed, the vast majority are pensioners, those with disability, people caring for a relative, or hardworking families on low incomes, while only one in eight is unemployed. At the same time, nearly half of local housing allowance claimants are already making up a shortfall of almost £100 a month to meet their rent, so further cuts to this benefit could trigger a spiral of debt, eviction and homelessness.</p>

<a name="100722-0001.htm_para157"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="10072235000246"></a>Of course, at the heart of this problem is a critical shortage of affordable housing, which means that more and more families are forced into the private rented sector, often into inferior, poorly maintained properties with rents that are almost double those in the social housing sector. It is this lack of affordable housing that the Budget could have, and failed, to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="10072235000247"></a>This coalition Government have made the misuse of the English language into an art form. The use of words such as "fair" and "progressive" to describe a

As the weeks go by and the consequences of the Budget are spelt out, it is becoming clear that the government agenda has at its heart an ideological drive to promote the free market, close down public services and hand over the remaining services to private multi-nationals. It is a policy that is increasingly saying to the poorest and most vulnerable, "You're on your own. If you're lucky, a charity or a private philanthropist will come to your rescue, but don't expect anything from us".</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="10072235000248"></a>Interestingly, this attitude was notably absent in the election campaign. Prior to that, there was lots of talk of compassionate conservatism, but now there appears to be a view that compassion is for wimps. Budgets are inevitably about global statistics and calculations running into billions of pounds and affecting millions of people. But behind those statistics are real people, like the ones I work with at The Passage whose lives are on the margins of success and failure, for whom small shifts in their fortunes make the difference between a job start or staring at a wall all day, between paying their rent or being on the streets. These are the people I fear for with this Government's policies, so I hope that the Minister is able to reassure me that my fears are groundless and that those at the bottom of the economy really will be protected in the years to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="10072235000250"></a>We have of course many experts in the Chamber today, but perhaps the biggest experts of all on the subject of this debate are not present. They are the poor themselves. I believe that they should be here in the Chamber somehow, for the simple reason-and it seems common sense to me-that the views of the poor should be heard in a debate on the poor. It is a question of representation, since those who are poor and on the margins of the mainstream are effectively denied a voice. This is the reason, I think, why we still have something called "poverty" in our sophisticated western society.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="10072235000251"></a>I was once a little closer to this form of expertise; I was on benefits myself, specifically income support. This was in Sheffield in the 1980s at a time when unemployment was less reviled than it is now, partly because of the sympathy for those working in the coal-mining and steel industries who had been put out of work.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="10072235000252"></a>I suggest that poverty as an experience is actually very simple, even if the bureaucracy that has accumulated to deal with it, including the benefits system, is complicated and public attitudes themselves are convoluted. I think that over a period of decades we have become, with a larger middle class, more aware at least of the idea of poverty, but perhaps less tolerant of those who remain unemployed, in the sense, of course, of not having paid work.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1109"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1109</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100722-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="10072235000253"></a>I believe that there are really just two things that a Government should bear in mind about poverty. The first is money. This Government are freezing benefits and capping the housing benefit. Sheffield was then, and still is, cheaper than London, but income support was impossible to live on then; today, with a personal allowance rate of £51.85 per week for the under-25s, who have been hit the hardest by this recession, I would say that it is absolutely impossible to survive on. Whatever you read in the newspapers, it is difficult to survive on most benefits.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="10072235000254"></a>The second and related issue is the stigma of being unemployed, by which I mean not having paid work, which is not necessarily the same as not working. For everyone on basic benefits, this stigma is less now connected with unemployment; it is more about being off the map and unvalued as a citizen. I believe passionately that one should be regarded as a citizen whether one is in paid work or not-indeed, whatever one's status. That means that if you do not have an income, or have a low income, the state should pay you a decent rate on which to live.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="10072235000255"></a>The very language that the new Government use perpetuates the stigma. For example, <I>The Coalition:</I><I> Our Programme for Government</I> says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="10072235000407"></a>"The Government believes that we need to encourage responsibility and fairness in the welfare system. That means providing help for those who cannot work, training and targeted support for those looking for work, but sanctions for those who turn down reasonable offers of work or training".</p>

<p><a name="10072235000391"></a>Carrot and stick, carrot or stick, it does not matter-this is still, in an old-fashioned sense, a perpetuation of an "us and them" situation for the poor who, in comparison with the poor in Victorian times, are highly articulate and educated and have expectations.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="10072235000256"></a>If we were not so wedded to the entirely constricting idea of paid work being the measure of all things, we would solve poverty overnight. However, by these restrictions on benefits, this Government are saying that we cannot afford to do so. Like others, I believe that this Budget owes its inspiration much more to political philosophy than to national need. The Green Party for one, now represented in Parliament at last, believes that we should not be having these cuts at all and that we should be doing quite the opposite and creating jobs in the public sector.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="10072235000257"></a>Another example of this same stigmatisation are the powerful television adverts which are supposed to target, in their words, "benefit thieves" but which in fact, I believe, help to criminalise people who are claiming benefits. Just as bad is the fact that no Government yet have run TV adverts advertising unclaimed benefits, which is a little bit like the "finders keepers" rule. Why do a Government who would claim to lift people out of poverty not chase down as assiduously the poor who do not know how to claim benefits as ferociously as they do those who may be claiming too much? It is easy to build up a head of righteous indignation over those who it is said are abusing the system, but are we not truly abusing the system if we do not reach out to those who are so caught in the poverty trap that they do not even know that help exists, let alone how to claim? I would like an answer from the Minister as to whether the new Government would consider running such TV adverts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="10072235000258"></a>Where should we be looking for answers? Is it appropriate for charities to fill the gap? I notice this week from the <I>Evening Standard</I> that the Government, in a supposed time of national austerity, are providing £1 million of matching-funds to a newspaper editor's project to dispense largesse to the poor, piecemeal via a number of charities. This is David Cameron's big philanthropic society in action, turning the clock back to a Victorian society in an age when the poor do not want to be, and should not be, patronised. I am not saying that individuals might not be helped by this, or that charities are not fine, but the proper purpose of charities is, in my view, that they do-yes-a significant job of stepping into the breach when a Government fail to do the appropriate and long-term job that they should do. I would support a Government who said, "We will make all the charities that cater to poverty redundant by such and such a date".</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="10072235000259"></a>I can give one example of a government policy that seemed to address the twin evils of money and stigma. From income support, I went on to the original enterprise allowance scheme as an artist. Of course, the scheme did not suit everyone at the time-those who had worked in traditional industries in and around Sheffield just wanted their old jobs back-but a number of things made the enterprise allowance scheme unique.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="10072235000260"></a>First, you were instantly destigmatised, because as soon as you were self-employed, you were considered to be working, although-this is the significant point-you might not yet have had any income from your work except for the small weekly grant that you received. Secondly, there was no bureaucracy. The business plan was easy for anyone to fill in. You did not have to be a businessperson to do that and you were not judged according to how the business might do, although some people later became highly successful commercially as a result of being on the scheme. Thirdly, they left you alone-a mark of respect and trust. Fourthly, you followed your dream, or simply continued with your work, for which one might say that the state was paying, although not very much.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="10072235000261"></a>Unfortunately, the enterprise allowance scheme did not last. It was watered down and then scrapped as the big stick once more came out, but it is being looked at again. It features in the recent Arts Council England report, <I>Creative Survival in Hard Times</I>. I understand that the Government are taking an interest in the original scheme and I would like to know whether they are thinking about reintroducing it.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="10072235000262"></a>I believe that the only way to cure poverty is finally to accept that there will never be full employment in terms of paid work unless the state itself fills that gap and assumes and respects people's contribution to society irrespective of their income.</p>

I was born and brought up on the Yorkshire coast, in Whitby, but have been an adopted Geordie for the past 40 years in Newcastle upon Tyne, where I worked for many years for the Open University and where I have been a councillor for more than 30 years. I would like to concentrate on that latter connection in this debate.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="10072235000265"></a>Last year, Newcastle City Council was appointed as one of three beacon councils, along with Cornwall and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, in addressing child poverty. Forty per cent of Newcastle residents are in the lowest national deprivation quintile-twice the average England figure. Men in that quintile have a 10-year lower life expectancy than men in the least deprived quintile, while women have a seven-year lower life expectancy, so reducing child poverty could have a major impact later in life in terms of life expectancy.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="10072235000266"></a>One in three children in Newcastle lives in poverty, according to official definitions, compared to just over one in five in England as a whole, so the need for us locally to take action to mitigate child poverty has been stark. In Newcastle, we have learnt a number of things. The first is that it is important to understand the diverse needs of local communities and to empower all of our partners to go much further than just engagement.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="10072235000267"></a>Although child poverty is closely related to financial deprivation, deprivation of experience and of aspiration can both have a massive impact on a child's future opportunities. Teachers have to work hard to help children in deprived neighbourhoods to reach their age-expected levels of attainment. Imagine, for example, the hurdles that children have to get over in comprehension exercises when what is being described bears no relationship to their experience. That is why personal enrichment through education remains the key to social mobility and it is why a pupil premium proposed for children in disadvantaged areas could be so important. Educational achievement grows from raised aspiration, which in turn results from enriching the experiences of all our children.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="10072235000268"></a>Addressing child poverty is not just about the level of benefits or a fairer tax system. Although both of those are crucial, neither is designed as a measure to abolish child poverty on its own. For example, measures to combat fuel poverty and making our homes more energy efficient are of great importance to families on low incomes. In Newcastle, we have had great success with our Warm Zone initiative in cutting fuel costs by more than £3 million a year.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="10072235000269"></a>Abolishing child poverty by 2020 is a commitment. That is why employment and skills matter so much and why we in Newcastle have decided that reducing child poverty is the not just the business of children's services but our core business across the whole of the council and the whole of the local strategic partnership. We have introduced projects to promote intensive multi-agency support to individual families. For example, there has been the Barnardo's young dads' project,  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1112"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which engages young men in developing their skills as fathers and promotes their literacy and numeracy and their skills for work. There is family learning in schools, which gives parents the chance to learn new skills and to help their own children to learn. Parents can spend up to a day a week in school with their child.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="10072235000270"></a>In Newcastle, Moorside Community Primary School is one example of a school that does not allow deprivation to be an excuse for low expectation. A majority of Moorside's pupils live in areas within the 10 per cent most deprived nationally, but the school has raised attainment and aspirations of children and has increased opportunities for parents to enter employment, education and training, which has had the effect of reducing benefit claimant rates. Key to that has been the appointment of parent link workers to enhance relationships between school and home. Through family learning at Moorside, several hundred parents have obtained accreditation from courses that they have taken, with awards being presented in front of their children, which has a big influence on raising aspirations of both child and parent. Parents are then supported to progress further through link agencies such as Newcastle Futures, which we set up in partnership with the Government to find solutions to worklessness and which has helped more than 1,000 long-term jobless people into work.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="10072235000271"></a>However, research by Barnardo's has shown that, although work is often seen as the best route out of poverty, low pay can still keep families in financial poverty. That is why taking low-income families out of income tax altogether, as proposed in this Budget and future Budgets, matters so much.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="10072235000272"></a>In conclusion, children who grow up in poverty are less likely to attend school regularly, to stay on at school, to obtain qualifications, to go on to higher education or to aspire to well paid employment. The gap in attainment between children receiving free school meals and other children is marked. The obvious follows. Reducing the number of children who grow up in poverty will increase the number of young people with chances to succeed as adults. That success will increase the life chances of their children and in turn promote a cycle of aspiration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="10072235000276"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, very much for introducing this debate. He has drawn attention, among other aspects of the ways in which the Budget impacts on people in poverty, to the problems that will be created by reductions in housing benefit. I want to share with your Lordships some thoughts on the ways in which the housing benefit cuts may have an effect.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="10072235000277"></a>The intention is that the Budget will see a reduction of some £2 billion each year in the amount paid in housing benefit, which means that a hit has to be taken either by the landlords or by the tenants. There are no other sources from which we can draw that £2 billion of savings each year. In other contexts, I will explore with your Lordships some of the impacts on landlords in facing a situation in which their rental income is likely to reduce but today I want to concentrate on the impact on tenants.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="10072235000278"></a>The cuts that are to face tenants who receive housing benefit, or in the case of those in the private rented sector the local housing allowance, are in several different forms. The first is the cap on rents in the London area. Although we may hear shock-horror stories of a handful of families with many children who have received as much as £2,000 a week for their accommodation, these are very few and far between. The new cap is to be set for the largest families at £400 per week. One would think that that is quite a large sum, but it is not so in inner London where that is the amount required to house families. Indeed, it is impossible to find accommodation in many parts of inner London at that price.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="10072235000279"></a>This will mean that the families whose rent is currently well in excess of this figure will have to move away from inner London to accommodation elsewhere, which is likely to be incredibly disruptive of family life. For example, there may be children at school, carers close at hand, people with disabilities who know a particular area and have no desire to leave it, people who go to a hospital locally and wish to remain there, and people in a range of circumstances who will find it very difficult to relocate to other parts of the country in order to avoid the gap which could be, in the case of inner London, several hundred pounds a week between the rent that will be paid in the future and the actual costs of their accommodation. We need to think ahead to how we will handle the exodus of the lowest income households from the high-priced areas of inner London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="10072235000280"></a>There is also the cap that comes from using the  30th decile instead of the 50th decile in determining the housing benefit for a household, which is a complicated  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1114"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1114</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>business. It means that in a lot of cases people will again, all across the country and not just in London, find that there is a gap between what they receive in housing benefit and the market rent in the area in which they are located.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="10072235000281"></a>Other reductions follow on top of those. If you are living in accommodation deemed to be too large for your needs, there will be a housing benefit cap relating to the size of accommodation in which you are living. If, for example, you are in a three-bedroom council property but it is deemed that you could well do with only a two-bedroom or a one-bedroom place to live, you will be required to move or you will not receive the full rent to continue where you are. The problem with that is that councils have built over the years five times as many three-bedroom homes as they have built of any other size. The actual opportunities to move to the smaller accommodation, until we build more homes, may be rather complicated. If you are living in a tower block, it is likely that you are a single person. Local authorities have been reluctant to put children into the three-bedroom accommodation in towers because of the impact on family life. These are restrictions that families will face.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="10072235000282"></a>There is a further restriction if you are on jobseekers' allowance and are unemployed. Whatever efforts you are making to secure employment, if you fail to do so your housing benefit will be cut by 10 per cent after a year of looking for a job, even if you are in an area of high unemployment. Even if you have been demonstrating that you have been trying your very best to get employment, you will still see a deduction from your housing benefit.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="10072235000283"></a>I accept that in some cases landlords will be willing to cut the rents and take a lower rent than they have in the past. That is particularly the case in those low-value areas where a large proportion of those tenants coming to them are on housing benefit. That is not the case in London and in the high-value areas where there will be plenty of choice of other people to accept. Frankly, landlords would be ill advised very often to take anyone who was in receipt of housing benefit. Those people will have to move on and it is not at all certain to where they will move.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="10072235000284"></a>We heard about the spiral of arrears, followed by evictions, followed by homelessness, which seems to be a likely outcome in far too many cases. For other people, there will be attempts to struggle on and find the full rent to stay in the accommodation or to move into accommodation elsewhere even though there is a gap between the housing benefit received and the rent that must be paid. That gap would have to be filled from the income support or other benefit being received by-let us remember-some of the poorest people in society. It will be extremely difficult for people to meet that gap out of the income they receive from the state on benefits calculated specifically to exclude any housing costs. They are benefits paid in order to cover food, heating and other costs, but not housing. To fill that gap from within their benefits will be extremely problematic for the poorest households.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="10072235000285"></a>Perhaps I may suggest four ways in which the Government might need to respond to the position in which they find themselves. Few people doubt that  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1115"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1115</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>housing benefit requires an overhaul. It is a very complex arrangement which could do with changes. First, I suggest that we need to phase the cap for those London households which will have to move to the edges of London or beyond. We will need to take that more gently and slowly than at the moment-at the anniversary of your rent coming up-and suddenly finding a colossal cut in what you can pay to your landlord.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="10072235000286"></a>Secondly, the discretion for local authorities to make up the difference requires a larger fund than the one that the Government have set aside. They have said that £60 million is available to councils to top up those families and individuals for whom there is that gap. The £60 million is against a backdrop of a £20 billion a year housing benefit expenditure. That £60 million will not go very far. It would go towards two to three families in each local authority area for a year. The sum for local authorities and the discretion that they have needs to be increased.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="10072235000287"></a>Thirdly, it would be wise if job centres could certify that people had done their very best to get jobs and they should not have their housing benefit cut by 10 per cent. Finally, I would ask the Minister to ensure that there is now dialogue with Citizens Advice, Shelter, the Chartered Institute of Housing and others who have ideas on how one can make the most of a very difficult situation.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, has done the House a service in securing this debate because I firmly believe that the poorest in society should not bear the burden of rebalancing the current fiscal deficit. As a result of the Budget announced last month, that is precisely what will happen.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="10072235000289"></a>Today, 3.9 million children are living in poverty in the UK-that is, in a household with an income of less than 60 per cent of the median household income, which in 2008 was £404 a week. Households in poverty therefore have a net income equal to or below 60 per cent of that, which amounts to a weekly income of £244 or less. After housing costs, that figure falls to just £206 a week for a family. It should be stressed that more than half the children whose family income is less than £206 a week after housing costs live in households where at least one of the adults is in paid work, so this is not just a question of worklessness. In this context, the changes to tax credits and other in-work benefits for the low paid are particularly important.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="10072235000290"></a>A number of changes in the Budget will result in a reduction in the income of the poorest-for instance, changing the basis for calculating the uprating of benefits from the retail prices index to the consumer prices index. The main difference between them is that  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1116"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the CPI does not include housing costs. The effect of the change will be a 1 to 2 per cent reduction in the benefits paid to families. Housing benefit-a subject to which I shall return-will also be affected by the change in the basis for uprating. The increase in the rate of VAT to 20 per cent will have a disproportionately large impact on the poorest families, because the poorest 10 per cent spend 14 per cent of their disposable income on VAT compared to the most affluent 10 per cent, who spend just 5 per cent of their income  on VAT.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="10072235000291"></a>The Budget did include measures aimed at helping low-income families. The increase in child tax credit is welcome, although if a family also receives housing benefit, that allocation will be cut in recognition of the increased family income from the child tax credit. This occurs because the child tax credit is taken into account when the household income is calculated. For the housing benefit to remain unchanged by the increase in child tax credit, the regulations would need to change so there was a disregard for child tax credit, and I will be interested if the Minister will give the House the benefit of his views on this point.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="10072235000292"></a>This Budget is deeply regressive. People in the bottom half of the population are heavy users of services and benefits and there are more children and elderly people in the bottom half of the population than the top half. Public service cuts therefore fall disproportionately on the bottom half. The problem is not just that cuts risk tipping us back into recession and will hit the worst-off hardest. It is that by taking demand out of the economy and undermining a fragile recovery in the process, the coalition could actually increase the size of the deficit as has happened in Greece and Ireland, as we know all too well. The extent of these measures amounts to a Budget of ideological choice, not of necessity. There was nothing unavoidable about adding £40 billion to the previous Government's already swingeing plans  to halve the deficit in four years. The effect of this Budget will be to shrink the state below 40 per cent, which even the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, never attempted during her time as Prime Minister.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="10072235000293"></a>I say to those on the Liberal Democrat Benches that I wonder what those old Liberal heroes Beveridge and Keynes would make of such draconian deficit cutting or of £11 billion of welfare cuts. Most of that comes from slicing 2 per cent off every benefit by cutting inflation indexing. You simply cannot cut a quarter of social care for the old, children's services or child protection without doing dangerous harm to millions of vulnerable people. To take only 23 per cent from taxes with 77 per cent in cuts means that the pain will fall on the poorest people in the poorest regions most dependent on public spending.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="10072235000294"></a>The coalition has opted for cuts far beyond anything the markets expected or demanded and the reasoning can only be ideological. The Budget's key objective-reducing the deficit-is not premised on economic logic. You do not require a degree in economics to understand that cutting spending and raising taxes reduces demand-someone who has just been made redundant will not be spending much-and could choke off recovery before it has begun. Indeed, the Chancellor is ignoring the cautionary voice from his  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1117"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1117</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>own recent creation, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which has revised down its growth forecast for the next year by 0.3 per cent-£5 billion-as a direct result of the Budget, so even his own experts believe that the Budget will have an immediate, negative effect on growth. Both Barclays Wealth and Ernst &amp; Young-not organisations that I am normally given to quoting-have produced analyses suggesting that the Government are, in the latter's words,</p>
<ul><a name="10072235000419"></a>"underestimating the impact of this significant fiscal tightening". </ul>
<p><a name="10072235000392"></a>The International Monetary Fund is equally unimpressed, because it has cut its growth forecast for the UK both this year and next in the light of this austerity Budget. For all Mr Osborne's protestations that the measures in his Budget were "unavoidable", there is every reason to believe that cutting fast and deep could, and indeed should, have been avoided.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="10072235000295"></a>Many charities have warned that drastic changes to the housing benefit system outlined in the Budget will lead to overcrowded homes and a surge in evictions. They fear the changes will make central London unaffordable to anyone on a low income, ghettoising the city by pushing the poor to the outer boroughs. I welcomed the contribution by the noble Lord, Lord Best, who spoke very knowledgably on this subject and in greater depth than I can. As he said, the changes will see housing benefit capped at £400 from next April. Thousands of people renting from private landlords in London and other high-rent cities will find that that will no longer cover their weekly rent, forcing them to move to a cheaper area. From April 2013, people who have been on jobseeker's allowance for 12 months or more will also see a 10 per cent reduction in their housing benefit. The coalition has said that it wants to make sure that when you work you are better off. That is not unreasonable, but the suggestion that the system is being changed to encourage people to go into work is based on a popular misconception about those who claim housing benefit: only one in eight people receiving that benefit is unemployed. The changes will be very serious for London and other inner-city areas and could result in thousands of people becoming homeless. The policy would force people on low incomes out of central London. In fact, it could replicate what has become of Paris, where the well-off have annexed the city centre, while the poor form a ring around the outskirts.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="10072235000296"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, said, the situation in London is currently so grave that the <I>Evening Standard</I> has begun an appeal, which it has named the dispossessed fund, to help those who it has identified as being in distress. Yesterday's edition highlighted a cleaner working at the Treasury, who the newspaper claimed was paid so little that her children have to live on soup. The homelessness charity Shelter estimates that some people currently claiming housing benefit could lose up to 40 per cent of their total rent, which will force people out of their accommodation with nowhere for them to go. Shelter expects to see debt and evictions rise as a result of this change. Any savings to the Government would be more than offset by the cost of rehousing families unable to afford their rent. The coalition needs to answer the question: where are people on low incomes meant to live? Even the Mayor of London has forsaken party loyalty to

Simon Hughes has urged the coalition to slow down changes to housing benefit, saying:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="10072235000408"></a>"We need a system that is flexible and ties in to areas of different need".</p>

<p><a name="10072235000393"></a>Indeed we do, and that begs the question as to how long Liberal Democrats will adhere to the Tory agenda when the Budget has shown that it is the poor who will be hit hardest. During the general election, the Liberal Democrats actively campaigned against much of what is now being implemented. Even excluding the effect of wider spending and benefit cuts, the squeeze on the worst-off 10th of the population will, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, be five times the impact on the richest 10 per cent by 2015.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="10072235000297"></a>The Chancellor insisted that his Budget was progressive, fair and unavoidable. In fact, it was the precise opposite on all counts. Raising the regressive value added tax while cutting housing, disability and child benefits contrasts starkly with plans to cut corporation tax year after year and let banks off with a levy that is inconsequential when compared to the huge amounts they pay out in bonuses. Even the boost to child tax credit will be more than offset by the housing benefit squeeze and the ending of maternity and pregnancy grants, along with other benefits targeted at women and children.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="10072235000298"></a>Lib Dem voters backed a party which stood against early cutbacks, in support of a ratio of cuts to tax increases of 2.5:1 and fiercely opposed the threat of what it called a "Tory tax bombshell" of increased VAT. Now, sadly, I have to say that it has binned all three commitments in the name of coalition compromise and signed up to a Budget which must be alien to much of what it has hitherto stood for.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="10072235000299"></a>This unnecessary and dangerous Budget is very likely to push the economy back into recession, and the big worry is that it will lead to what the Nobel economist Paul Krugman has called the long depression: zero growth and high unemployment for years. There are no prizes for guessing who that will hit the hardest.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Watson, asked where Alcluith is. It is the Gaelic name for Dumbarton and goes back to the dark ages of the fifth century. I was unable to obtain the name "Dumbarton", so Alcluith was the name I focused on. Alcluith literally means "the rock on the Clyde". The rock refers to Dumbarton castle, which is associated with historical figures such as Robert the Bruce and the infant Mary, Queen of Scots before she was taken to France for her safety. Merlin is supposed to have stayed there, too. The earliest reference to Alcluith is recorded in a letter from St Patrick to King Ceretic of Alcluith in which he complains about the raids the Britons were making on his Irish converts. I can tell noble Lords that complaints and warring factions are still a feature of my area, and over the years I have been asked to mediate in them, but that is part of a healthy society. The primary school I attended was named St Patrick's, as was my secondary school. In fact, my first teaching post was in St Patrick's secondary school. As one of my friends said the other day, "John, if Alcluith is good enough for St Patrick, then it's good enough for you". I take the point well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="10072235000303"></a>The other part of the name refers to the River Clyde, which has dominated my area because it has been a site of shipbuilding dating back to the days of Robert the Bruce when he set up shipbuilding on the River Leven and the River Clyde. The area has an historic industrial heritage, with shipyards lining the Clyde. As far back as 1963, there were 33 shipyards on the Clyde. In my area, we had the mooring where the Cutty Sark was built, and we had the QE2, for which I was privileged to represent the Clydebank area, and the former John Brown's Shipyard. In my home town of Dumbarton we had Denny's Shipyard, which closed in the 1960s but which was able to develop the hovercraft. So there is a proud shipbuilding history in the area, and I have been privileged to chair two regeneration companies in my constituency, Clydebank re-built and the Strathleven Regeneration Company, both of which are dealing with the consequences of our industrial heritage and hoping to formulate a new age. I have included the Strathleven Regeneration Company in my interests in this House, and I also declare an interest, which is recorded in the register of interests, in a company that has aspirations to be a bank.</p>

One of the achievements of which I am most proud is that in the teeth of very divisive debate between the political parties as to the source and responsibility for the crisis, the Treasury committee kept its focus and delivered unanimous reports throughout the period which, in the words of the then Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England, pioneered

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="10072235000305"></a>This week, the Treasury committee came out with its report on the June 2010 Budget. It is pertinent to the debate today because it warns of the increasing risk that Britain will slide back into recession, and of the coming austerity hurting the poor disproportionately. Robert Chote, the distinguished head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, gave evidence to the committee that the Budget is regressive, contradicting what the Treasury said, which was that it was progressive. Robert Chote pointed out that when you dig deeper, you find that the Chancellor's statements have been focused only on the next two years, to 2012-13, but beyond that, experts say that the cuts in housing benefit, disability living allowance and the in-year changes to tax credits will hit the poorer half of households harder than they will the rich. The Chancellor is on record as saying that the Budget will not increase poverty according to measured child poverty targets over the next two years, but given that many welfare cuts will not take effect until after 2012-13, one can understand the concerns of experts and groups such as Save the Children and the Child Poverty Action Group about the future, particularly for poorer people.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="10072235000306"></a>The Chancellor has made promises that have to be set against the provisions in the Child Poverty Act 2010, which will guide him. The Government have signed up to this Act and, as previous speakers in the debate have said, it makes meeting the 2020 target of eradicating child poverty legally binding. The 2010 Act has four targets. An assurance has been given by the Chancellor on what he declares is "measured child poverty", but that is limited to a two-year timeframe. No assurances have been given on the other three targets set out in the Act. If this Budget is indeed to be worthy of the description "progressive", it demands detailed and continuous scrutiny in order that the Government's ambitious rhetoric and their solemn legislative undertakings serve the interests of all, but especially the poorer and most needy members of our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="10072235000309"></a>The two poorest and most disadvantaged groups in our society are at the extreme end of the age spectrum: children and pensioners. During the past 12 years, a Labour Government did much to redress this with the record increase in child benefit, family tax credits and the child trust fund, all aimed at helping families with young children. We also saw the introduction of pension credits, free bus travel, free television licences, all improving the quality of life of pensioners. But these significant advances may now be reversed by what Paul Krugman has called "ideologically fixed deficit hawks". Only on Monday, we saw this Conservative/Liberal Democrat Government begin their assault on child trust funds. We know that they will freeze child benefit and, with massive cuts in public services predicted, every family with children and every pensioner needs to be concerned about the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="10072235000310"></a>The Conservative/Liberal Democrat Budget of a few weeks ago heralds a major attack on public services which support the most disadvantaged in Britain-public services that we have built up over years and make us a civilised society. What this Government have forgotten is that public service is labour intensive. We cannot sack police officers and put CCTV cameras on every street corner and call it policing; we cannot sack teachers and sit every child in front of a computer screen and call it teaching; and we cannot sack social workers, give every pensioner a microwave and call it home care. I have no doubt that we on these Labour Benches will need to be vigilant in these coming months if we are to defend public services on which so many of our vulnerable citizens depend and which the two parties opposite seem determined to put to the sword.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="10072235000311"></a>I shall confine the rest of my remarks to the plight of disabled people in general and those with autism in particular. Research conducted by Leonard Cheshire Disability found that 30 per cent of disabled people live below the poverty line. That is one in three and a terrible indictment of Britain in the 21st century. The National Autistic Society says that the lack of support  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1122"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that people with autism receive means that they and their families experience extreme financial difficulties. Some people with autism are able to live independent and fulfilling lives with very little support, but we all know that others will need support throughout their lives. The vast majority of people with autism want to work, and we need to do more to help them to do that. But as a dear friend of mine, a now retired GP, Dr Dipak Ray, said to me only last week: "Suddenly, creating jobs is out; inflicting pain is in". That seems to be the message that we have had from this Budget.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="10072235000312"></a>Only 15 per cent of adults with autism are in full employment. Some 66 per cent of adults with autism are not in any kind of employment. Almost 80 per cent of those are on incapacity benefit. Six out of 10 adults with autism survive only with family and parental financial support. Caring for a child with autism is a full-time job. According to the National Autistic Society, 68 per cent of carers it surveyed said that their caring responsibilities exceeded 70 hours a week. The same survey revealed that only 41 per cent of carers had jobs, while almost 70 per cent gave up work to carry out their caring responsibilities.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="10072235000313"></a>More than half of families with disabled children borrowed money from family and friends to pay for essentials. According to a recent Contact a Family survey, one in four families is going without heating in their homes, one in seven is going without food and nine out of 10 said that financial worries are having severe impact on family life.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="10072235000314"></a>I believe that noble Lords on all sides of the House will find these circumstances unacceptable and will want to challenge any Government who plan to introduce cuts in public services for the disabled. Disabled people, especially those with autism and their families, will be forced into greater poverty and financial dependence on family and friends if we do not take steps to protect them.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="10072235000315"></a>The Prime Minister said recently that the third sector was really the first sector. He was right in that we esteem that sector, but I hope that his remarks were not code for plans to offload the responsibilities of the state on the voluntary sector. The voluntary sector in Britain makes a huge contribution to the quality of life of millions of our citizens. Many voluntary groups are hard pressed. With massive public spending cuts in the offing, this will cascade into the voluntary sector.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="10072235000316"></a>The government programme states that the main burden of the deficit reduction will be borne by reduced spending rather than increased taxes. It also states that people needing care deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. I hope that the Government recognise that, without funding for services for the disabled, there can be no respect and certainly no dignity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="10072235000318"></a>In 2007-08, 13.5 million people in this country were living in households below the low income threshold of 60 per cent or less of the average income. This is about a fifth of the population and an increase of 1.5 million compared with three years previously. We know that the UK has a higher proportion of its population in relative low income than most other EU countries. Of the 27 EU countries, only four have a higher rate than the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="10072235000319"></a>We know that health inequalities associated with socio-economic status are pervasive and can be found in all aspects of health, from infant death to the risk of mental ill health. We also know that life expectancy is closely related to this. The difference in life expectancy between the leafy suburbs of the south-east and the inner-city deprived areas of the far north can be as much as 17 years. This is a death sentence and is totally unacceptable.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="10072235000320"></a>I turn to disabled people, who were movingly described by the noble Lord, Lord Touhig. About a third of working-age disabled adults live in low-income households, which is twice the rate of that for non-disabled adults. The gap between the two is markedly higher than a decade ago.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="10072235000321"></a>In the Budget, many entitlements were scaled back. The Work and Pensions Secretary admitted that the decision of the Cabinet to scrap free school meals for working parents' children and reduce the number of people who get tax credits made his own long-term goal to alleviate unacceptable levels of poverty and social exclusion difficult.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="10072235000322"></a>An issue which particularly affects older people-although not exclusively-is that of excess winter deaths. In 2008-09 the number of winter deaths increased by 36,700 compared with the average for the non-winter period-a 49 per cent increase compared with the number in the previous winter of 2007-08. The elderly population experiences the greatest increase in deaths each winter. In 2008-09 there were 29,400 more  deaths among people aged 75 and over as compared with those in the non-winter period. In contrast there 7,300 among those under the age of 75. That is a terrible differential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="10072235000323"></a>On fuel poverty, in 2007, 2.8 million households in England alone were classified as being in fuel poverty. In 2004, 5.9 per cent of households were considered to be fuel poor, but that rose to 7.2 per cent in 2005; 11.5 per cent in 2006; and it went up to 13.2 per cent in 2007. Fuel poverty is increasing mostly because of the continued significant increases in fuel prices, and VAT increases will be passed on directly to the consumer, making the situation of people suffering fuel poverty even worse.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="10072235000324"></a>The Fuel Poverty Advisory Group has estimated that 4.6 million homes across England could now be in fuel poverty. It added that investment in energy infrastructure and measures to reduce greenhouse gases were essential but that the cost of these was largely passed on to consumers and that bills could soar by a further 50 per cent. Both overall and among those in low-income, single-person households, many people are more likely to be in fuel poverty than other household types by 2020.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="10072235000325"></a>On the issue of decent homes, in 2008 about 7.4 million homes were described as non-decent-that is one-third of our homes. Overall, homes in the social sector were in a better condition than those in the private sector, where most poor older people live; 27 per cent are non-decent compared to 34 per cent previously. For vulnerable groups, 24 per cent of private homes had at least one category 1 hazard; 13 per cent in social rented homes; and 31 per cent in private rented homes. The National Audit Office examination of the decent homes programme concluded that while good progress has been made there are risks in terms of completing the target to eliminate non-decent social rented homes-originally by 2010-and of a new build-up of a repairs backlog if a new programme is not put into place. Such a new programme seems remote in the current circumstances.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="10072235000326"></a>By capping housing benefit nationally, the Budget creates real issues in London and the south-east particularly. That, together with the regressive nature of VAT, means that the Chancellor has got his work cut out to prove that he is putting fairness first, particularly in the longer term. I hope the Government will consider these issues.</p>

Whatever it is, we have had it today and I congratulate all noble Lords who have made maiden speeches. They have demonstrated the genuine concern in your Lordships' House for the poor and the vulnerable.

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="10072235000328"></a>The coalition Government are in a hurry. They are hurrying to change the nature of education, they  are hurrying to have fewer public services delivered by the state and they are hurrying to change the economy. However, when you hurry, one thing stays the same: the law of unintended consequences remains alive, well and flourishing. As my noble friend indicated in his authoritative speech moving the Motion, it is the poor who are the victims.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="10072235000329"></a>Let me give some examples arising from the increase in VAT-a rise that has caused concern to many noble Lords. Some of the examples that I consider important have been mentioned by other noble Lords. Was it really the Government's intention to take away half the surplus of the housing associations? Many speakers are concerned about the effect of the Budget on affordable housing but, according to Mr David Montague, chief executive of the London &amp; Quadrant Housing Trust, the increase in VAT will cost the housing association sector £125 million, which is half its surplus. The Minister knows that it is the poorer households that are increasingly concentrated in social housing. If you want to eliminate poverty and enhance life chances, social housing is essential. Amid all their talk of fairness, did the Government in their Budget really want to make life more difficult for the housing associations? The noble Lord, Lord Best, reminded us that housing benefit is a third of the income of the housing associations, so their work will be doubly more difficult-more VAT and less housing benefit. Was this really the Government's intention?</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1125"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100722-0002.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="10072235000330"></a>Was it really the Government's intention to victimise poor women more than men? As my noble friend Lord McKenzie told us, women have lower incomes, so the VAT increase will hit them harder. This effect on poorer women is supported by a recent paper from the House of Commons Library that shows that the extra VAT raised will come disproportionately from women. In addition, because of their lower incomes and their greater caring responsibilities, women are bigger users of public services, both for themselves and for those for whom they care. They will have to fill the gaps left. Do the Government really intend to victimise women more than men-or is this the law of unintended consequences at work?</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="10072235000331"></a>Was it really the Government's intention to penalise charities? According to the Charities Aid Foundation, charities will pay £140 million a year more in tax. Therefore, charities are going to be hit in two ways: they will have to pay more VAT and their income will be reduced because of the hard times. Yet, as the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, reminded us, the Government and society look to the charities to help the poor, the unfortunate and those who cannot cope. Indeed, a third of their income comes from the Government because the Government look to charities to provide services that many of us consider essential. I cannot believe that it was the intention of the Budget to penalise them-or, again, is this the law of unintended consequences at work?</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="10072235000332"></a>The only way to deal with the law of unintended consequences is to legislate, not through dogma or political belief, for what works-for what gives the intended consequence. Like other noble Lords who have spoken, this forces me to the conclusion that this Budget is more driven by politics and less driven by the need to deal with our deficit. Perhaps there are no speakers from the Conservative Back Benches because it is impossible to defend ideology triumphing over common sense. If it were otherwise, the housing associations, women and charities would be compensated with increased benefits for the rise in VAT. Surely that is right, because VAT is a tax that does not take into account your ability to pay. That is why it is regressive.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="10072235000333"></a>On average, the rise in VAT will cost every household £500 per year, irrespective of ability to pay. That is why it hits the poor hardest. Before the election, the Liberal Democrats often spoke of raising a similar amount through taxing unearned income or through carbon taxes. Since the election, they have been silent. I join my noble friend Lord Watson in asking whether the Liberal Democrats have deserted the poor by having to defend a Conservative Budget-or is this another unintended consequence?</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="10072235000334"></a>The stated aim of the Budget was to protect the vulnerable. My noble friend Lord McFall told us that that was shown to be misleading by the IFS. It was shown the following day when the IFS helpfully disaggregated George Osborne's June Budget alongside Alistair Darling's March Budget. They were shown separately and are dramatically different. The bias towards those on lower incomes that characterised the Labour years has more or less been inverted in the first coalition Budget.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="10072235000335"></a>This unfairness to the poor is further emphasised by the inconsistencies in the Budget architecture, as Chris Wales pointed out in a recent Smith Institute seminar. The Chancellor won praise for his commitment to the triple lock for uprating the state pension, but people on welfare benefits live in the same world as pensioners, often with higher demands placed on them and even less to live on. Unless the Government believe that they are all scroungers living off the state when they should be working, it would be logical to assume that, in the interests of fairness, the poor on benefits should have the same uprating guarantees. Is that unintended neglect or just plain right-wing politics?</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="10072235000336"></a>Of course, other aspects of the Budget will hit the poor unfairly and other noble Lords have mentioned them. What concerns many of us is the gigantic gamble that the Government are taking with people's jobs and livelihoods. The Government are convinced that we are spending too much on the workless and at the same time that work has to be transferred from  the public to the private sector. It is not rocket science to identify some of the unintended consequences of that on poor people's jobs. It is a gamble, because there are so many uncertainties. Business will not invest without demand, yet the economy is being starved of the money necessary to create the demand.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="10072235000337"></a>Also, a high proportion of people depend on benefits because of low pay. One third of households have state benefits. If, as we are told, there is to be a high number of unemployed people, pay will stay low. Will that low pay be subsidised by tax credits? If so, jobs will be transferred to the private sector to save money, but they will be subsidised with public money. That seems curious economics to me. Surely if the jobs are going to the private sector to reduce the burden on the taxpayer, it makes sense for private sector employees to get a living wage and not the minimum wage mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Donaghy, which has to be subsidised by the taxpayer. Are these more unintended consequences or just crazy economics?</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="10072235000338"></a>Surely the right question to ask is why people are in low-paid jobs and what can be done about it. I agree with Iain Duncan Smith that you have to make sure that there is enough financial gain for people to benefit from work. You have to support poor people in work for a short time until they get to work longer hours or are promoted. Do the Government have a plan B? Is there a plan to delay the rise in VAT until the cuts  in public sector jobs are in balance with the rise in private sector jobs? Is there a plan to think through all the unintended consequences? Is there a plan to protect the poor as things go wrong?</p>

In the lead-up to the general election, in response to questions about fairness from the Child Poverty Action Group, the Deputy Prime Minister, as he now is, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="10072235000409"></a>"The Liberal Democrats want to make sure that the burden of controlling spending falls on those who can afford it... so that closing the gap doesn't bear down on those who already have too little".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="10072235000343"></a>I welcome the coalition's commitment to continuing the work undertaken by my party to eradicate child poverty by 2020 but, taking on board the findings of numerous non-governmental studies, I believe that this Government's economic policy risks not only delaying that target but plunging further families into poverty. Cuts in allowances, the VAT hike, decreased incomes and increased outgoings-the right honourable Chancellor is going to hit the poorest hardest. As my noble friend Lord McKenzie said, it was his choice. As the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, reminded us, that was the choice made in the 1930s, when the then coalition Government, encouraged by business, pursued austerity and then took us into the great depression. From that situation, Keynes developed his great economic theories, now abandoned by the Liberal Democrats. As the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, reminded us in the context of disabled children, if we want to raise children out of poverty, we need to raise their household incomes, and this Budget promises anything  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1128"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but. While the Chancellor may claim that his cuts are not expected to raise measured child poverty, there is little of any comfort in it to those families already below the poverty line. I share the fears of Save the Children that, as a result this Government's regressive approach to tackling the deficit,</p>
<ul><a name="10072235000420"></a>"those families living in poverty will have less income and fewer or less effective services to mitigate the worst affects of poverty".</ul>
<a name="100722-0002.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="10072235000344"></a>Despite the welcome, if menial, increase in personal tax allowance and child tax credits, the Work and Pensions Secretary's mangling of the benefits system and the axe-wielding of the Chancellor will undoubtedly cost lower-income families more than they can hope to gain. As the noble Lord, Lord Watson, reminded us, more than half of those 3.9 million children whose families live in poverty come from households where at least one of the adults is in paid work. For these families, child tax credits, which many noble Lords have spoken about, are vital. Yet many will see that lifeline disappear in the immediate future. A family with one child on as little as £15,000 will see their tax credits fall next year. The following year, a one-child family earning just £30,000 will lose all their tax credit. Meanwhile, the promise of a £210 increase in that benefit for those eligible over the next two years is, of course, when isolated, a great step forward-but not if that increase ultimately leaves lower-income families worse off than they were previously. Failure to correspondingly amend the way in which housing benefits are calculated will have exactly that effect. At present, the child tax credit is not disregarded in calculations for housing benefits. Resultantly, the coalition's proposed rise in child tax credits, increasing the family income, will lead to cuts in that family's housing benefits.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="10072235000345"></a>Other conflicting and confusing measures have been discussed by noble Lords, including the proposed 10 per cent cut to housing benefit for those who have been on jobseeker's allowance for 12 months or more, which the Child Poverty Action Group have called a stealth cut on JSA. The Chartered Institute of Housing has calculated that the cumulative outcome of the coalition's proposals means that by 2020 every tenant's housing benefit will be too low to cover their rent. The net outcome of this is clear: debt, overcrowding and homelessness. There are already 1 million children living in overcrowded households. Such living conditions affect children's mental and physical health, their education and, ultimately, their life chances. As we have heard from speakers such as the noble Lord, Lord Best, reductions, restrictions and caps on the housing benefit that families can claim will force some of them  to move, often into accommodation inappropriate to their needs. In addition, that might unnecessarily fracture the family unit and leave families out of reach of the services that they rely on. So much for being the party of the family. The Child Poverty Action Group warns that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="10072235000410"></a>"There may be, in effect, an expulsion of low income families from some communities and a tendency for greater ghettoisation of poverty where there are concentrations of substandard housing stock".</p>

<p><a name="10072235000394"></a>The coalition could go some way towards remedying this simply by altering the status of child tax credits so that they were disregarded in benefit calculations.  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1129"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1129</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Furthermore, the proposed cuts in public services present a severe indictment against the fairness of the emergency Budget.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="10072235000346"></a>Poorer households are higher users of public services. Thus, cuts to these services disproportionately hit lower-income families compared with those that are more affluent, owing to the larger contributions that they make to such a family's income. One study projects that public spending cuts will be equivalent to 20.5 per cent of the poorest 10th of households' regular income, but equivalent to only 1.6 per cent of the richest 10th. These measures reverse any positive impact that direct taxation or government-provided subsidies and services might have for the poorest in society.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="10072235000347"></a>As my noble friend Lord Haskel has just argued so forcefully, the unfairness in the Budget manifests itself most significantly in the VAT rise. This will, as Save The Children has identified, simply widen inequalities and entrench existing unfairness. Not only does a rise in VAT, so nobly campaigned against by the Liberal Democrats at the election, risk economic recovery at such a fragile time but it disproportionately hits the pockets of low-income families. The VAT rise impacts on the entire population, regardless of earnings or income level. In that respect, it does what the Chancellor says it should-we all share in the pain.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="10072235000348"></a>There are exemptions, of course, and it is argued that these equalise such measures, assuming that lower-income families spend the majority of their income on exempted items like food, children's clothing and household bills. But do poorer people not need beds to sleep in, clean clothes to wear or hot food in their stomachs? There are no exemptions on furniture, toiletries or household appliances like cookers and washing machines. Increasing VAT simply makes these items even more difficult to afford, making it harder for low-income families to stretch their budgets even further. Simply because the Budget does not discriminate, that does not make it non-discriminatory. These rising costs are likely to increase the number of households that fall below the poverty line.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="10072235000349"></a>There is much more to say but I do not want to delay your Lordships. The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, reminded us of the health consequences of the Budget, especially for the elderly. On Tuesday I set out some of my concerns about unemployment rising due to cutting too fast and due to cutting employment programmes such as the Future Jobs Fund and the six-month allowance. As the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, said, work is the best route out of poverty, but the Government are pulling up that ladder.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="10072235000350"></a>Similarly, the free-market schools policy and allowing outstanding schools to be academies risks allowing the best schools to advance at the expense of the poorest, widening the gap and making it harder for poorer families to use education as a route out of poverty-as, again, the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, said. Mention has been made of ending free school meals and breakfast clubs, both fundamental to alleviating poverty. I will just argue with the noble Lord about  the Labour Government's record on schools; to take reading as an example, we ended a 30-year standstill

<p><a name="10072235000395"></a>of average families. Accordingly, the Budget elevates the risk of negative life outcomes. These measures condemn to poverty those kids from lower-income households-families looking not for a handout but for a foot up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="10072235000352"></a>One of the key measures of the success of this Government and their Budget will be how they tackle poverty. Like so many others, I am worried that they will fail miserably.</p>

I enjoyed all of them. The noble Lord, Lord Boateng, pointed out the importance of young people at risk and in care, with all the passion that we would have expected from him. The noble Baroness, Lady Donaghy, reminded us that poverty is a complex set of issues. My noble friend Lord Shipley's focus was on reducing the number of children in poverty and trying to reinforce the cycle of aspiration. Finally but certainly not least, the noble Lord, Lord McFall, with his deserved reputation for calling the Government to account, gave us, and me in particular, fair warning of continuous scrutiny in the years to come. I await that with some trepidation.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="10072235000354"></a>I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in this debate. I thank the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, in particular for giving us the opportunity to tackle the issue of poverty in Britain today. It is an issue close to my heart, and I know that that is shared widely in this Chamber.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="10072235000355"></a>The issue, as I have mentioned, is complex, so it is worth putting the impact of the Budget in context. Many of the measures in the emergency Budget were taken in the face of a potential eurozone economic crisis. This was a legacy that we inherited from the previous Administration, with borrowing forecast at a stunning £149 billion this year, the second largest in Europe. The Budget simply had to tackle borrowing and get that deficit down.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="10072235000356"></a>We are now on track to cut debt. The figure is £116 billion for next year and £89 billion for the year after. We will get the structural current deficit into balance by 2015-16, when borrowing will be down to £20 billion. Undoubtedly, reducing the national debt to stabilise our finances and get the economy back on track left us with some extremely tough choices. Those choices were made with some key principles in mind. We wanted to align efficiency and value for money with long overdue and much needed strategic reform. We wanted to protect the vulnerable and ensure that our reforms were made with fairness and responsibility  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1131"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1131</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>uppermost in our minds. In this context, it is worth raising something that always puzzles me and puzzled me today when the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, excoriated the measures. The previous Administration were also planning very large cuts. They were a little smaller than the ones that we have put through but they were large nevertheless. I am always puzzled by what exactly they would be, since every single measure that we have taken is wrong. However, the Opposition would have had to take at least three-quarters of them in their own programme.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="10072235000357"></a>The Budget measures revolve around three key objectives: to make work pay and reinforce responsible behaviour; to reform the welfare system to make it fairer, improve targeting and reinforce conditionality; and to protect the most vulnerable while tackling the deficit. As I said, underpinning the approach is a commitment to fairness. That is why we increased the personal allowance to boost rewards for work for low and middle-income people. As a result, around 23 million basic rate taxpayers will pay up to £170 a year less in tax in 2011-12 and 880,000 people will be taken out of income tax altogether. Wherever possible we have made sure that this is a fair and progressive Budget, tackling the deficit while maintaining the right balance between taxation and spending. Even though we had to make a tough choice on VAT to avoid even greater spending cuts, VAT on such everyday essentials as food and children's clothing remains zero-rated.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="10072235000358"></a>At the same time, we wanted to use the Budget to reform our welfare system and make it fit for the 21st century. My right honourable colleague Iain Duncan Smith has talked extensively about the need for radical welfare reform. I know he will be grateful for the support of the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, for that today. Iain Duncan Smith has pointed out that reform is so urgently needed because so many people are left without incentives to work and abandoned on long-term benefits. That was a point also made by the noble Baroness, Lady Donaghy. Iain Duncan Smith is looking at how we can implement reforms through a far simpler benefits system, and concentrating absolutely on the huge social and economic advantages we will gain as a society if we can move to a more dynamic system that gets this right once and for all.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="10072235000359"></a>The case for urgent reform is clear. The welfare budget has spiralled out of control in recent years, rising in real terms from £63 billion in 1996-97 to £87 billion in 2009-10. That includes tax credits. The true cost of our welfare system is not measured purely by the increasing burden on the taxpayer, great though that is. The price of worklessness and welfare dependency is paid by the individual, their families and their children, who get trapped in a cycle of inter-generational poverty. To change that, we need a fundamental reappraisal of the benefits system. As the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, said, we need to support those who genuinely need help, but we do not need to put them in a benefits trap. We have already announced our proposals for a new work programme, and in the near future we will introduce key measures to reform and simplify the benefit system to make it fit for the 21st century.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1132"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1132</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100722-0002.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="10072235000360"></a>Housing benefit was mentioned by several noble Lords, particularly the noble Lords, Lord McKenzie and Lord Knight. The housing benefit reforms are an excellent example of how we have aimed to balance much needed and long overdue reform with fairness and value for money. In real terms, the cost of working age housing benefit has jumped by £5 billion in five years, and was projected to reach £21 billion in 2014-15. In his excellent speech, the noble Lord, Lord Best, talked about the cuts in housing benefit. I emphasise that we are not talking about absolute cuts in housing benefit, even in real terms. We have put brakes on the sledge as we go down the run. All we are doing in practice is reducing the £21 billion figure by £1.8 billion. According to the projected forecast, it will still go up by £3 billion in the next four years. However, cost is not the only problem. The scale of these payments has meant that housing benefit has become a disincentive to move into work and has created distortions in the social rented market.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="10072235000361"></a>The figures show that 75,000 people get more than £10,000 a year in housing benefit and that some-admittedly, a small number-get more than £100,000 a year, which means that housing benefit is often unfair as some hardworking people could not hope to afford the properties available to some people on housing benefit. It is interesting to note that recent reports in the press indicate that many people agree that the system needs a major shake-up. That is why we have capped local housing allowance levels to the rate for four-bedroom properties, introduced size restrictions to the social rented sector, and changed the percentile of market rents for local housing allowance rates from 50 per cent to 30 per cent. These changes are vital and will reset the balance, making housing benefit fairer and creating reasonable incentives for people to move into work. Tomorrow we will publish the impact assessment on housing benefit so that everyone can see exactly how these reforms will work in practice. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Best, for his recommendations, which we will take back and consider.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="10072235000362"></a>As I said, we have had to make very tough choices in order to tackle the deficit, but at the same time our overarching concern is to protect the most vulnerable. That is why many of the measures are progressive, including tax credit reforms that target support away from the better-off and towards lower-income families by increasing the child tax credit.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="10072235000363"></a>I pick up the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, on the freezing of child benefit. That impact is redressed for the poorest by the move on child tax credit. The Budget package recycles £1.2 billion of savings back into child tax credit next year, and £1.84 billion in 2012-13, offering enhanced support to poorer children and families. As a result, the child element of the child tax credit will be increased by £150 next year and by £60 in 2012-13, above the level of indexation. I should also point out that the Budget package has no statistically significant impact on child poverty over the next two years.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="10072235000364"></a>I should add something on which I assured the House on 15 June; we are committed to our goal of eradicating child poverty by 2020, and the Prime Minister   


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1133"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has asked Frank Field to lead a review on poverty.  I hope that that addresses the concerns raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, and the noble Lord,  Lord McFall.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="10072235000365"></a>The reforms to disability living allowance rebalance our support for the most severely disabled people to ensure that their needs are better met. We remain absolutely committed to supporting those with severe disabilities so that they can live with dignity and independence in their own homes. However, costs have ballooned to £12.1 billion, with the number of claimants increasing by more than half a million in just five years. This suggests that some laxity has crept into the system, which is why we have taken the decision to introduce a new DLA assessment from 2013. This will ensure that the system is fair and that properly targeted support is available for those who need it.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="10072235000366"></a>We are applying the same principled approach to reform to benefit pensioners, too, so that older people can enjoy dignity and security in old age. The legacy that we have inherited includes 1.8 million pensioners living in poverty-nearly one in six. We aim to remedy that situation in the long term and encourage people to save responsibly for their future. That is one of our key goals for long-term reform, but we have to be fair and sensitive to the needs of those already in or nearing retirement. This is important, because while we have the levers to tackle dependency and poverty at working age and in an intelligent way, we have to recognise that tackling poverty beyond retirement age is an entirely different proposition. That is why we are doing more to protect pensioners, and why the Government have committed to restoring the earnings link with the basic state pension from April next year with a triple guarantee. This means that pensions will be raised in line with earnings, prices, or by 2.5 per cent-whichever is higher. That is a good start. In reality it is rather better, because we have paid for the unfounded 1.5 per cent clawback that the previous Government left for us when we arrived-a £300 million hole in this year's DWP budget.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="10072235000367"></a>I appreciate the issue raised about using the CPI rather than the RPI, but, as has been pointed out, the CPI is the standard measure used by government and in many cases most accurately reflects the costs borne by pensioners. Let us not forget that pensioners can continue to rely on housing benefit and council tax benefit, as well as benefit from our decision to keep winter fuel payments, bus passes and TV licences. However, the Government are well aware of the need to keep driving reform to ensure that we have a simple, coherent and sustainable pension system.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="10072235000368"></a>I have very little time to deal with the many interesting questions asked, although I think that I have dealt with the majority. However, perhaps I may pick up the point about the economy and the pace of fiscal consolidation, which was raised by, among others, the noble Lords, Lord Haskel and Lord Watson. The fiscal challenge in the UK is, by some measures, more serious than in any other advanced economy. That is why consolidation will support recovery, underpinning private sector confidence and creating the space for   


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1134"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column 1134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>business to grow. In particular, it will reduce the burden of public sector debt and the effect of interest payments, which, if they get out of hand and we lose the confidence of the markets, will tend to have a significant depressive effect. It is almost a race between those two factors.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="10072235000369"></a>The noble Lords, Lord McKenzie and Lord Haskel, talked about the VAT rise, saying that it was regressive. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, which has been much quoted today, has said that total expenditure is arguably a better guide to lifetime living standards, as households smooth their expenditure over their lifetime. Therefore, analysis by expenditure, rather than income level, is a better measure of the impact of the VAT increase and, on this basis at least, the VAT increase is progressive.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="10072235000370"></a>A number of noble Lords argued that the poorest families will bear the biggest burden. The noble Lords, Lord Watson and Lord Boateng, and the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, made that point. This is a progressive Budget, with every part of society contributing to dealing with the deficit, but the rich are paying more than the poorest. There is a handful of questions that I do not have time to deal with, but I shall of course write to noble Lords to pick up those points.</p>

<a name="100722-0002.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="10072235000371"></a>In conclusion, we live in a wealthy country, yet more than one in four working-age adults do not work, 5 million people are trapped on benefits, 1.4 million people have been receiving out-of-work benefits for nine out of the past 10 years, and a higher proportion of children-2 million of them-grow up in workless households than in almost any other country in Europe. That is why the measures that we introduced in the Budget could not just be about getting the deficit down; they also had to form an integral part of the long-term reforms that Britain needs to reinvigorate the economy and tackle poverty-not just the symptoms of poverty but the causes, too. Our welfare and pension measures, combined with our plans to support private sector job creation and reduce the impact of the proposed jobs tax, will allow this country to move forward from the recession stronger, fitter and more resilient to take on the challenges of the future.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="10072236000004"></a>As required under the Animal Health Act 1981 (as amended by the Animal Health Act 2002) the Government will publish today a review of controls on the import of animal products for the financial year 2009-10. As the new Minister of State for Agriculture and Food, I welcome the opportunity to report on the efforts of Defra and other government departments and agencies during the past year to reduce the risk of disease entering the country via imports of animal products.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="10072236000005"></a>Imports of animal products from outside the European Union (EU) bring with them the risk of animal diseases which, as we know, could introduce disease to our livestock and crops and to the environment. The risk can also be to public health-diseases such as highly pathogenic avian influenza type H5N1 can infect humans and is of serious public concern-and also be of high economic cost, as we know from the outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in 2001, which is estimated to have cost £3 billion relating to agriculture and the food chain.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="10072236000006"></a>Effective enforcement and raising public awareness are therefore key to ensuring that we meet our objective.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="10072236000007"></a>Controls are already in place to carry out veterinary checks on legally imported animal products from non-EU countries. The UK Border Agency (UKBA) delivers a flexible, risk-based enforcement strategy to prevent illegal imports including using information from Defra on the entry routes that pose the greatest threat of introducing animal disease.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="10072236000008"></a>Defra, with UKBA and the Food Standards Agency (FSA), has undertaken a focused publicity campaign as part of the overall communications strategy-inland within GB, at the border and overseas. During this last year we have seen the relaunch of the personal food imports campaigns for general travellers in October 2009 and for the black and minority-ethnic (BME) communities in November 2009.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="10072236000009"></a>The changes to the EU personal import rules in May 2009, in particular an increase to the personal concession amount allowed for fish, has enabled UKBA to refocus deployments to target the high-risk routes for illegal meat and dairy products carried by incoming travellers more effectively. The number of seizures of illegal imports of animal products has therefore shown a 3 per cent increase this year with seizures of meat and dairy products up by 14 per cent and 45 per cent respectively.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="10072236000010"></a>We can never have a zero risk but we monitor and assess the changing threats from around the world (such as the evolving FMD situation in south-east

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="10072236000012"></a><b><a name="100722-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="10072236000238"></a>The Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Jonathan Djanogly), has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="10072236000013"></a>My honourable friend the Minister for the Armed Forces and I think it right that we continue the previous Government's practice of issuing quarterly Statements to the House detailing inquests of service personnel who have died overseas. There was, however, no Written Ministerial Statement in late April because of the general election. This is the first of these Statements that we have made.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="10072236000014"></a>Like our predecessors, we too cannot express enough how highly we regard all of our service personnel who are or have been involved in the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. We send our deepest condolences to the families of those personnel who have been killed serving their country. It is also with particular sadness that we note that, since the previous Government gave their last Statement on 2 February, 71 further service men and women have died.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="10072236000015"></a>Today we are announcing the current status of inquests conducted by the Wiltshire and Swindon and other coroners. This Statement gives the position at  16 July.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="10072236000016"></a>The tables which accompany this Statement include information about those cases which involve a board of inquiry or a service inquiry. It is encouraging to see that steps are being taken to reduce the average period of time from the date of death to the inquest. We very much hope that this trend will continue, as it greatly benefits the bereaved families primarily, but also other parties to the inquests. In some cases a coroner may choose not to hold their inquest until the completion of a service inquiry, or it may be delayed for other logistical reasons. It is important that the coroner has all possible information about the death, and that all witnesses are able to attend the hearing.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="10072236000018"></a>Since the last Statement a further 71 inquests have been held into the deaths of service personnel in operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. This makes a total of 325 inquests held into deaths of service personnel in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan since June 2006, when additional resources were first provided to the Oxfordshire coroner.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="10072236000019"></a>Since operations commenced in 2001 there have been a total of 376 inquests into the deaths of service personnel who have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, including six service personnel who died in the UK of their injuries. In two further cases, no formal inquest was held, but the deaths were taken into consideration during inquest proceedings for those who died in the same incident.</p>

The coroner, David Ridley, transfers inquests for service personnel to a coroner closer to the bereaved family, where possible.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="10072236000026"></a>There are, at present, 101 open inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel who died in Iraq and Afghanistan whose bodies were repatriated after 1 April 2007 (56 involving deaths in the past six months). Of these, Mr Ridley has retained 34 inquests, whilst 67 inquests are being conducted by coroners closer to the next-of-kin. At 16 July two recent fatalities had been repatriated but the inquests were yet to be opened. Six recent fatalities awaited repatriation and inquest opening. Hearing dates have been set in 13 cases.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="10072236000031"></a>I wish to inform the House about the new arrangements that we shall be setting in place for rest and recuperation for service personnel on operations.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS80"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column WS80</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="10072236000032"></a>This Government are dedicated to the care and welfare of the men and women of our Armed Forces, particularly those on operations in Afghanistan. This is reflected in the commitments within the coalition programme for government, including that we would rebuild the military covenant. One step in doing so is to optimise the rest and recuperation periods for those deployed to Afghanistan. We recognise that rest and recuperation is a key part of the morale and welfare of our people and their families, so it is important that we get it right.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="10072236000033"></a>But this is not an easy issue. There are very real limits in terms of the airbridge in and out of Afghanistan. In making any adjustments to rest and recuperation policy, we must remain mindful of these constraints because, above all, any changes must not compromise the operational effectiveness of our forces deployed in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="10072236000034"></a>I am delighted to announce today, however, that we are making changes so that in future no service men and women serving tours in Afghanistan (and on other qualifying deployed operations) will lose out on their two weeks' rest and recuperation. Where flights home are delayed or circumstances dictate that they cannot take all that rest and recuperation during their tour, as occurred, for instance, when flights were suspended because of the volcanic ash cloud, personnel will in future receive additional post-operational leave in compensation. So in future no one will lose out on rest and recuperation that they would otherwise have received because of disruption to the airbridge.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="10072236000035"></a>We will also increase the resilience of the airbridge and prioritise the needs of those who serve the longest-six months or more-in Afghanistan. The Chiefs of Staff have recommended that the best way to achieve this improved resilience is to deploy those posted for short tours for less than four months so that they will no longer receive a week's rest and recuperation in the middle of their tour. This will affect a minority of the force, primarily from the RAF, but improved airbridge resilience will significantly benefit the 85 per cent of the force, drawn from all services, who are serving on longer tours. Our feedback from families and personnel themselves also suggests that one week of rest and recuperation in a short tour does not allow time to transit, adjust, rest, prepare and return. I have therefore agreed the Chiefs of Staffs' recommendation, which will come into effect for those deploying on or after 1 January 2011.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="10072236000036"></a>Together, these two measures will strengthen our operational effectiveness in Afghanistan and ensure that those serving the longest tours receive the rest and recuperation that they so richly deserve.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="10072236000040"></a>I am today confirming arrangements for closing down the ContactPoint children's database, in line with the Government's long-standing commitment. Instead of a database containing millions of children's details, accessed by hundreds of thousands of practitioners, we are examining the case for a more proportionate approach to supporting front-line professionals to help protect vulnerable children from harm.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="10072236000041"></a>I recognise the problem that the previous Government were trying to solve in establishing ContactPoint, and the well intended efforts that many hard working practitioners and managers have put into improving the quality and use of data on vulnerable children. Front-line practitioners need to be able to provide support for our most vulnerable children when they move across local authority boundaries or access services in more than one area. Experience shows the potential value of a quick and reliable means of discovering whether another professional has worked with such a child. It is worth considering a national approach to that issue.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="10072236000042"></a>However, we have never agreed that ContactPoint was the answer. It has always been our view that it was disproportionate and unjustifiable to hold records on every child in the country, making them accessible to large numbers of people. Accordingly, we are exploring the practicality of a new national signposting service which would focus on helping practitioners find out whether another practitioner is working, or has previously worked, in another authority area with the same vulnerable child. Social workers in particular, and potentially other key services like the police or accident and emergency departments, may need this information very quickly. Such a service must aim to ensure that these children are not "lost" to social care services when they move. We are working closely with our partners to assess the feasibility and affordability of such an approach.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="10072236000043"></a>In the mean time, we have considered carefully whether it is necessary to keep the existing ContactPoint database operating in order to move towards a more targeted approach. It is now clear that it is not and in the light of the coalition Government's clear pledge to end ContactPoint as soon as practicable we will now proceed to shut it down. On 6 August, we will switch the database off and we will subsequently decommission it, safely removing and destroying the existing data.</p>

A copy of this letter will be placed in the House Libraries. As we do so, we shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the investment made to date in developing ContactPoint can so far as possible contribute to the task of protecting our most vulnerable children from harm. We will continue to draw on views, experience and expertise of front-line staff and managers. Critical to the success of any service must be that it provides a modern, effective tool that supports the front line and that it supports the broader aims of Eileen Munro's review to improve child protection and social work practice. It is also important that we keep any development and implementation costs to a minimum and that the service can demonstrate value for money. We shall provide a further update in due course.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="10072236000047"></a>DSDA was established as an agency in 1999 to store, maintain, issue, process and distribute materiel for the MoD and other designated users. In April 2006, DSDA launched a major efficiency programme under the future defence supply chain initiative (FDSCi). This completed in 2008, having successfully delivered savings of 35 per cent in annual operating costs, reductions in staff levels of 37 per cent and fundamental improvements in service levels.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="10072236000048"></a>Subsequently, the operational efficiency programme (OEP) has been considering potential future operating models for DSDA post-FDSCi.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="10072236000055"></a>On sustainability, together with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, we are determined to play the lead role across the whole of government. We will mainstream sustainability, strengthen the Government's performance in this area and put processes in place to join up activity across government much more effectively. I am not willing simply to delegate this responsibility to an external body. I have accordingly decided that I will withdraw Defra funding from the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC) at the end of the current financial year and instead take a personal lead, with an enhanced departmental capability and presence.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="10072236000056"></a>I also fully support the role of the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee in this area-powerful scrutiny within the democratic process.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="10072236000057"></a>The SDC was founded in October 2000 and recently became an executive non-departmental public body (NDPB). It is jointly owned with the devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each of them has to decide on the best future arrangements to meet their needs and, over the next few months, my department will work very closely with them to ensure a smooth transition.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="10072236000058"></a>The SDC has made a positive contribution to sustainable development across government and society over the past 10 years and I pay tribute to its work and to its current and previous chairs, Will Day and Jonathon Porritt.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="10072236000059"></a>I am also announcing today that I intend to abolish the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution in 2011, subject to the necessary processes and ongoing discussions with devolved Administration Ministers. When the RCEP was set up in 1970, there was very little awareness of environmental issues, with few organisations capable of offering relevant advice. The situation now is very different and the Government have many such sources of expert, independent advice and challenge. Protecting the environment remains a

In making this decision, I pay tribute to the work of the royal commission and its current chair, Sir John Lawton. Over the past 40 years, the commissioners have made a significant contribution to raising the profile of environmental issues in the UK.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="10072236000060"></a>A range of public bodies affiliated to Defra was established by the 1948 Agricultural Wages Act. Over time, this piece of legislation has become outdated, inflexible and burdensome for farmers and workers. So today I am announcing that we will be seeking agreement with the Welsh Assembly Government to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board. In England, we will be taking measures to bring agricultural workers within the scope of the National Minimum Wage Act and my department will be working closely with BIS to make the necessary amendments to the Act itself. We are discussing with the Welsh Assembly Government the arrangements that they wish to propose in respect of Wales and will agree with them measures for the abolition of the Committee on Agricultural Valuation and, separately, the Commons Commissioners. The 15 agricultural wages committees and the 16 agricultural dwelling house advisory committees will also be abolished. Appropriate measures for effecting these changes will be brought forward as part of the Public Bodies (Reform) Bill. The cumulative effect of these changes will allow the agricultural industry to adopt flexible and modern employment practices in order to help to ensure a vibrant and sustainable industry for the future.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="10072236000061"></a>I have decided that Defra should have a stronger role in developing policy for inland waterways and have already signalled our preference for moving British Waterways to a civil society model. Today I am announcing that I also intend to abolish the Inland Waterways Advisory Council. Defra will lead on developing future policy in this area by consulting all interests directly, by making full use of the evidence that can be provided by the navigation authorities and by forming a closer relationship with stakeholders. This decision highlights the importance that I attach to the effective management of inland waterways and my determination to place them on a more sustainable long-term footing.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="10072236000062"></a>The changes that I am announcing today will help to streamline and modernise Defra's network of  arm's-length bodies and enhance accountability and transparency. I am continuing to look closely at Defra's other arm's-length bodies and will make further announcements at the appropriate time.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="10072236000079"></a>Balanced and sustainable economic growth can only be driven by business and enterprise. Business in the UK cannot prosper while the risk of a debt crisis hangs over the economy. This Government have therefore put decisive action on the fiscal deficit at the centre of their agenda. Equally though, it is vital we recognise strong and continuing growth as a key route to getting this country back on track, including reducing our debts. Skills and training are a central component of this, contributing to employment, productivity and economic growth.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="10072236000081"></a>I am inviting employers, individuals, colleges and training organisations to share their ideas on how they would like skills policy to be set out in future.</p>

provide a respected, credible vocational training offer that will provide people with a route into employment, help them progress in their careers or support them in starting their own business;tackle the needs of those who have poor work prospects or a high chance of spending long periods out of work;give learners and employers access to high-quality, impartial information so they will be able to choose the learning that best suits their needs;realise the best returns on both government investment and the increasing amount of learner and employer investment in the skills system;give greater freedom to colleges and training organisations to respond flexibly to employer and learner demand;empower communities to develop the informal lifelong learning opportunities in which they want to participate; and

<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a><a name="10072236000087"></a>My honourable friend the Minister for Agriculture and Food (Jim Paice) represented the United Kingdom at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 12 July, the first under the Belgian presidency.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_73"></a><a name="10072236000088"></a>Belgium's Federal Agriculture Minister (Laruelle) and Flemish Minister-President (Peeters-who will chair fisheries items at council) gave an overview of their priorities for the next six months. On agriculture, there will be a continuation of discussions of future CAP in advance of the forthcoming communication; and legislative proposals on dairy, food for the needy and quality policy. There would also be other discussions on the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) road map, animal health strategy and the regulatory framework on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). On fisheries there would be the annual cycle of decisions on total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas, but also discussion on CFP reform, in particular on the link between science and fisheries.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_74"></a><a name="10072236000089"></a>Commissioner Ciolos introduced the dairy high-level group recommendations as a means to enable the EU to achieve market stability for the milk sector and pave the way for a future without quotas. There will be a legislative package at the end of the year concentrating on the first three recommendations on contractual relations, bargaining power of producers and the role of producers (POs) and interbranch organisations (IBOs).</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_75"></a><a name="10072236000090"></a>Council was divided between those calling for more regulatory and market management intervention, and those urging more competitive responses, using the full scope of existing provisions. Some called for mandatory contracts between producers and milk purchasers, but others, led by the UK, wanted these kept voluntary.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a><a name="10072236000091"></a>The UK and the Netherlands argued that no changes were needed to competition law to allow better functioning of the milk supply chain, but a number of others urged relaxations of competition rules to allow producers more scope to manage sales.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"></a><a name="10072236000092"></a>Origin labelling also featured, with a number of member states against compulsory labelling, while others preferred voluntary labelling, especially for imitation products. On market measures there was broad consensus that reform should continue, but still a need for some form of safety net.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_78"></a><a name="10072236000093"></a>There was a mixed response on POs and IBOs, with France and most southern Europeans wanting their powers extended in the milk sector. Northern member states urged caution around changes to role of POs and IBOs, warning against the risk of creating an IBO monopoly.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_79"></a><a name="10072236000094"></a>The UK stressed the need for rebalancing producer power, but noted that there was already scope to do so under current rules and that we should not interfere with free market principles. The UK also underlined the clear differences in market organisation between member states-one-size solutions would not fit all, and any legislation would have to minimise burdens.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para80"></a>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_81"></a><a name="10072236000096"></a>Next, Ciolos noted the derogation from the state aid rules which allowed the German alcohol monopoly to buy spirits from certain distillers at guaranteed prices. The German authorities accepted that the derogation could not continue and therefore it was proposed that this be phased out by 2013, although Germany would be able to continue paying state aid to the sector up to 2017. Germany concurred and, in order to allay concerns about distortion to the market, highlighted that the monopoly only represented less than 1 per cent of the EU market of ethyl alcohol and that there was free access to its market for spirits produced elsewhere in the EU. The Special Committee on Agriculture (SCA) would continue discussions on the proposal in September.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"></a><a name="10072236000097"></a>Under any other business, Lithuania (with some support) requested that it be allowed to make advance direct payments (from 16 October rather than 1 December) to farmers due to the exceptionally harsh winter, which had led to the loss of winter crops in many areas. The commissioner said his services would deal with any individual request made, but stressed that member states must demonstrate that the circumstances were truly exceptional.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a><a name="10072236000100"></a>The first day of the industry session focused on future EU industrial policy. EU Industry Commissioner Antonio Tajani emphasised the importance of SMEs, a well run EU single market, the external dimension of EU industrial policy and a strong better regulation agenda. He also highlighted the importance of the EU space sector and tourism to European economies. The UK called for a step change in the better regulation agenda and more efficient use of natural resources. He stressed that the EU single market was the EU's most effective industrial policy, but also that open trade on a global scale could create new opportunities for European companies. The Belgian presidency concluded that overall member states preferred a horizontal (rather than sectoral) approach to EU industry policy.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a><a name="10072236000101"></a>In discussion of the external dimension of EU industry policy, the UK and a few other member states focused on the importance of free trade, while a few other member states favoured the introduction of protectionist measures. At a morning session on the second day of the industry session, measures to help the integration of innovation by small to medium-sized companies (SMEs) were discussed. The UK stressed the importance to SMEs of the single market, access to finance and making EU innovation programmes easier to use.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_86"></a><a name="10072236000102"></a>In the first research session on the afternoon of the second day, the EU Research and Innovation Commissioner Máire Geoghegan-Quinn outlined her plans for an EU innovation union, one of the flagship initiatives under the Commission's Europe 2020 long-term economic strategy. She stated that she wanted the EU innovation strategy to address major societal challenges such as healthy ageing and creating carbon-neutral cities. She stressed the need for the EU to broaden its approach to include innovation in services, business models, design, marketing and society. The UK welcomed the Commission's approach of looking beyond technological innovation and considering how innovation policy could address major societal challenges, stressing the need to ensure framework conditions for innovation were right in Europe.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_87"></a><a name="10072236000103"></a>The second research session on the final day focused on the simplification of the EU research and development (R&amp;D) funding programme. There was general agreement that the current rules for applying for funding were too complicated, inconsistent and too slow. The UK stressed the importance of the simplification agenda but said that moves away from a cost-based funding regime to one more focused on results and outputs needed to be treated with caution, as any new system would need to recognise the actual costs of the research and offer applicants a choice of funding methods. EU Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn said that the Commission intended to address these concerns through a radical overhaul of existing rules.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_88"></a><a name="10072236000105"></a>The General Affairs Council and Foreign Affairs Council will be held on 26 July in Brussels. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (William Hague) will represent the UK. I will also attend.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_89"></a><a name="10072236000106"></a>The agenda items are as follows:</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para90"></a>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_92"></a><a name="10072236000109"></a>Chairing his first GAC under the new Belgian presidency, Foreign Minister Vanackere will present the presidency's programme for the next six-month programme. Other Ministers will have an opportunity to question him on Belgium's priorities. We believe there are number of areas in which we can work well with the Belgian presidency including on trade and free trade agreements (FTAs), particularly with countries such as India and Korea.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_93"></a><a name="10072236000110"></a><I>European External Action Service (EEAS)</I></p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_94"></a><a name="10072236000111"></a>Ministers will discuss the EEAS decision, which was passed by the European Parliament on 8 July, and has been scrutinised by both Houses of Parliament. The decision provides a framework for the establishment of the EEAS, as provided for in the treaty of Lisbon. It sets out a framework for the nature and scope of the service, its functions, its central administration, and the management of its staffing, budget and programming.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_95"></a><a name="10072236000112"></a>There remain a number of implementation-related issues to be worked through over the coming months. We shall support the Baroness Ashton in establishing the EEAS as a body which enables the EU to pursue agreed common positions in a cohesive and effective way. We shall be both vigilant and determined to ensure that the EEAS respects the competences of member states for foreign and security policy as set out in the treaty, and that it provides value for money. We will keep Parliament updated regularly on progress.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_97"></a><a name="10072236000114"></a>The GAC will agree the EU's general position on the negotiating framework for Iceland's accession negotiations. Official opening of the negotiations will take place on 27 July. The negotiating framework reflects UK objectives that stipulate that Iceland implements its EEA obligations, including those identified by the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ie, Iceland's breach of the deposit guarantee directive).</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_99"></a><a name="10072236000116"></a>We expect there to be a short review of the key conclusions from the June European Council: Europe 2020 strategy, the G20 summit, millennium development goals (MDGs), and climate change. There may also be a discussion about the frequency of European Councils and the role of the GAC in preparing for them.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_101"></a><a name="10072236000118"></a>Ministers will discuss the forthcoming September European Council (16 September), which will be themed around foreign policy and attended by both leaders and Foreign Ministers. Baroness Ashton or Herman Van Rompuy may outline their understanding of the scope of discussion in September, and solicit views. Ministers may seek to debate the EU's strategic relations with emerging powers.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_105"></a><a name="10072236000122"></a>On Brazil, Ministers will discuss the recent EU-Brazil summit, and the longer-term vision of the high-representative/vice-president for this important strategic partnership. Ministers are likely to discuss the relaunch of EU-Mercosur free trade agreement negotiations, and the potential benefits of increasing trade with this large and dynamic region.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_106"></a><a name="10072236000123"></a>On India, Ministers will assess the prospects for delivering more from the EU's relationship with this emerging power. We would like to see the EU-India free trade agreement finalised this year, though this will not be easy given some of the difficult issues to overcome, particularly on migration and EU political clauses. Ministers may also discuss other areas highlighted by the November 2009 EU-India summit, including counterterrorism. Ministers will look ahead to the 2010 EU-India summit, on 21 October in Brussels.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_108"></a><a name="10072236000125"></a>Ministers will discuss the challenges facing Sudan over the coming months as the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) reaches its conclusion. We expect Ministers to agree conclusions that support:</p>
the upcoming referenda processes in south Sudan and Abyei through substantial technical and financial assistance; peaceful implementation of the CPA, reaching an agreement on post-referendum issues and working towards long-term regional stability; the work of the African Union high-level implementation panel;capacity building and assistance to meet the challenges faced by south Sudan;efforts to address insecurity and reach a lasting peace settlement for Darfur;the work of the International Criminal Court; and,continued development and humanitarian assistance across Sudan.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_109"></a><a name="10072236000126"></a>On international co-ordination, we expect Ministers to agree to co-ordinate closely with the Sudanese parties, the African Union (AU), the United Nations (UN), IGAD, the United States and other national, regional and international partners.</p>

Foreign Ministers Kouchner and Westerwelle visited Kyrgyzstan on 16 July and tabled a joint paper at the OSCE informal Foreign Ministers' meeting in Almaty, which we understand they are likely to raise at the FAC.</p>

The council will not have to take any decisions and discussion is likely to focus on a debriefing by EUHR Catherine Ashton on her recent visit to Georgia. If time allows, Ministers might discuss Georgia's relations with the EU following the launch of negotiations on an association agreement on 15 July and the recent signature of a visa facilitation agreement. There may also be discussion of the Georgian Government's action plan for engagement with Abkhazia and South Ossetia.</p>

The Government firmly support Kosovo's independence and believe that both Kosovo and Serbia should use the ICJ outcome to reinforce and not undermine stability in the western Balkans region. Ministers will also discuss the EU's policy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The Government strongly support BiH's ambition for future EU membership but is very concerned about the current reform blockage and nationalist rhetoric. We believe that the EU military force, EUFOR Operation Althea, continues to play an important role in underpinning stability in BiH.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_122"></a><a name="10072236000140"></a>Discussions on the interior day centred on two themes: how to reach a common European asylum system by 2012 and crime prevention.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS93"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column WS93</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_123"></a><a name="10072236000141"></a>During the first session, the presidency posed a couple of questions asking whether priority should be given to the negotiations on the Dublin and Eurodac regulations and qualification and long-term residence directives while allowing additional time to consider the appropriate way forward on the procedures and reception conditions directives and whether Ministers supported the inclusion of a temporary suspension clause in the Dublin regulation for countries under pressure.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para124"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_124"></a><a name="10072236000142"></a>James Brokenshire underlined that asylum required an international response and that the UK had taken in the highest number of individuals in Europe last year. However the UK did not believe the directives resolved the challenges facing member states: they increased the rights of asylum seekers, at the expense of providing protection quickly for those in need and return for those who were not in need. James Brokenshire underlined the need for practical co-operation to build the capacity of member states' asylum systems including via the European Asylum System Office and FRONTEX. On Dublin James Brokenshire said that the UK remained very sceptical of a suspension mechanism, which would address the symptoms not the cause of the problems and risked making them worse.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para125"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_125"></a><a name="10072236000143"></a>During the second session, the presidency posed a number of questions on crime prevention calling for implementation of the EU internal security strategy to focus on practical co-operation and prevention, identification of a methodology for prioritising threats and identified two areas where work might begin on firearms trafficking and itinerant groups.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_126"></a><a name="10072236000144"></a>James Brokenshire welcomed the presidency priority given to the internal security strategy and the Commission's analysis of the link between organised crime and local crime, particularly efforts to tackle illegal firearms, but would want more information on how itinerant groups were to be defined. James Brokenshire noted the role of passenger name records in fighting organised crime and expressed disappointment at the Commission's recent information that the directive would not be published until next year. Other delegations also called on the Commission to bring forward plans to publish an EU passenger name records directive.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_127"></a><a name="10072236000145"></a>Discussions on the justice day centred on the role of Eurojust and the launch of the e-justice portal. The Justice Secretary stated that the UK valued Eurojust and felt that the EU should wait until the Eurojust council decision had been fully implemented and evaluated before looking to legislate in this area again. The Justice Secretary reinforced the UK's position that it would not be participating in the European Public Prosecutor Office.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_128"></a><a name="10072236000146"></a>The European e-justice portal was launched by the Belgian Justice Minister with Commissioner Reding. The portal is a website that functions as a point of access to a range of information on justice matters across the EU. This first release of the portal concentrates on the provision of information-for example, how the legal systems in each member state work and links to websites of most relevant interest to citizens and lawyers.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_129"></a><a name="10072236000149"></a>I want to place on record the Government's support for the work of the Hillsborough Independent Panel under the chairmanship of the Right Reverend James Jones, Bishop of Liverpool.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_130"></a><a name="10072236000150"></a>What happened at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 was a tragedy of national and international significance. The Government recognise that despite the various examinations of the circumstances which have taken place over the years, important questions remain to be resolved. With this in mind, the Hillsborough Independent Panel has been created to oversee the disclosure of the records relating to Hillsborough; to report on how  the disclosed material adds to public understanding  of the tragedy and its aftermath; and to make recommendations for a permanent archive.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_131"></a><a name="10072236000151"></a>The panel has the Government's full support in achieving maximum possible disclosure of the records, initially to the Hillsborough families and then publicly. No changes are to be made either to the panel's terms of reference or to its membership, which both remain as previously published.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para132"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_132"></a><a name="10072236000152"></a>I am well aware of the significance of the Hillsborough disaster, which had a profound impact on Liverpool as well as people in Sheffield, Nottingham and beyond. My meetings with the Bishop of Liverpool have confirmed to me both the importance of the panel's work and the diligence and professionalism with which it is carrying out its duty, and I am happy to confirm it will continue with our full support.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_134"></a><a name="10072236000155"></a>However, on two particular points successful legal challenges have been brought to the extent to which requirements must be set out in the Immigration Rules rather than UK Border Agency guidance. The first is the minimum levels of courses that may be studied under tier 4 (general). The second is the periods of time that applicants must have held available funds for.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para135"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_135"></a><a name="10072236000156"></a>In light of the court judgments I am bringing the detail of these requirements within the Immigration Rules. The requirements themselves are not changing, although in the case of English language courses, I am using this as an opportunity to reintroduce the minimum level for such courses which was in place before the judgement was handed down. By doing this, if the requirements do change in future, those changes will need to be laid before Parliament.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para136"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_136"></a><a name="10072236000157"></a>I am also making a further change to the tier 4 (general) category today to make it a requirement for some students studying below degree level to provide evidence of having passed a UK Border Agency-approved secure English language test at a minimum of B1 level on the Common European Framework of Reference for languages. This change builds on the previous position where the sponsors of such students were required to make their own assessment of the English language level of the student. The use of an independent test is an advance on this as it should help ensure that sponsors are not duped by students offering false or fake documents to prove their English language ability.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para137"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_137"></a><a name="10072236000158"></a>It is right that under the points-based system, all students now need to apply to the UK Border Agency to vary their leave before being able to change institutions. This is essential so that the UK Border Agency can maintain accurate records of where migrants are studying and check that the institutions to which they wish to move are bona fide and are willing to take on the sponsorship of their new students under tier 4. Consequently, tier 4 students are unable to start studying at their new sponsor institution until they have received a positive decision on their application.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para138"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_138"></a><a name="10072236000159"></a>The principle of sponsorship-whereby those who benefit most directly from the contributions migrants make to the United Kingdom (employers and education institutions) are expected to play their part in ensuring the UK's migration system is not abused-is an integral part of the points-based system. The new highly trusted sponsor licence introduced for tier 4 sponsors on 6 April 2010 provides a further segmentation of the existing sponsor rating system designed to identify those sponsors who are achieving the highest levels of compliance with their sponsor obligations and whose students are showing the greatest compliance with the terms of their visa or leave. Those holding a highly trusted sponsor licence are granted additional freedoms and offered new services to recognise their previous track record of good compliance.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_139"></a><a name="10072236000160"></a>In recognition of the high levels of student compliance among highly trusted sponsors I have agreed an additional freedom for their students which is being introduced by the change to the Immigration Rules for tier 4

<p><a name="wms_stpa_143"></a><a name="10072236000166"></a>The United Kingdom has asserted universal jurisdiction over war crimes under the Geneva Conventions Act, and over a few other offences of exceptional gravity, because of our international obligations and our commitment to ensuring that there is no impunity for those accused of such crimes. That commitment is unwavering.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_145"></a><a name="10072236000168"></a>The Government have concluded, after careful consideration, that it would be appropriate to require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions before an arrest warrant can be issued to a private prosecutor in respect of an offence of universal jurisdiction.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_149"></a><a name="10072236000173"></a>One of the central features of the proposals in the White Paper is to devolve commissioning responsibilities and budgets as far as possible to those who are best placed to act as patients' advocates and support them in their healthcare choices. <I>Commissioning for Patients</I> sets out my intended arrangements for general practitioner (GP) commissioning and the role of the NHS Commissioning Board.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_150"></a><a name="10072236000174"></a>Through our world-renowned system of general practice, GPs and other primary care professionals are already supporting patients in managing their health, promoting continuity and co-ordination of care, and making referrals to more specialist services. In empowering GP practices to come together in wider groupings, or consortia, to commission care on their patients' behalf and manage NHS resources, we are building on these foundations. We are also empowering primary care clinicians to work more effectively alongside the full range of other health and care professionals and, where appropriate, to work collaboratively to combine their commissioning power and influence. The NHS Commissioning Board will provide overall leadership on commissioning for quality improvement. It will have a duty to ensure comprehensive coverage of consortia and hold them to account for the outcomes they achieve and for their financial performance.</p>

It sets out proposals to increase local democratic legitimacy in a way that is consistent with national accountability for a national health service. Local authorities will become responsible for local public health improvement functions. They will have a new role in shaping NHS commissioning activities and a new role promoting integration. Local authorities will lead in assessing the needs of their populations and co-ordinate local strategies to address these needs. This will promote integration and partnership across the NHS, social care, public health and wider services such as housing and disability services. Local HealthWatch organisations, acting as independent consumer champions, will also be funded by and accountable to local authorities. To reinforce local accountability, local authorities will be responsible for ensuring that local HealthWatch are operating effectively, and for putting in place better arrangements if they are not.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_162"></a><a name="10072236000189"></a>In our first two months in government we  have demonstrated our commitment to localism, decentralisation and rolling back regional government in England.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_163"></a><a name="10072236000190"></a>We have taken these steps because they are right in principle and as part of a fundamental transfer of power from central government down to local councils and down further to local communities.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_166"></a><a name="10072236000193"></a>I am announcing today the Government's intention in principle to abolish the remaining eight Government Offices, subject to the satisfactory resolution of consequential issues through the Spending Review.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para167"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_167"></a><a name="10072236000194"></a>The final decisions on the future of the Government Offices, including arrangements for closure and for the transfer of on-going functions, will be made at the end of the Spending Review in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_168"></a><a name="10072236000195"></a>The Government Offices are not a legal entity. They act on behalf of 13 government departments and are staffed by civil servants from these departments. Communities and Local Government is the biggest contributor to Government Offices providing 41 per cent and 33 per cent of funds and staff respectively in 2010-11. The Home Office; Departments for Education; Business, Innovation and Skills; Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Transport are also employers of Government Office staff.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para169"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_169"></a><a name="10072236000196"></a>We are making good progress with our programme of radical reform to reduce the burden of bureaucracy on local authorities and businesses, including removing the inflated local government performance regime and doing away with the unnecessary regional tier. Consequently many of the functions Government Offices undertook are no longer necessary. By announcing our intention in principle now, we will further progress our programme of reform, allow staff, councils and departments to take account of this, and make an earlier start in the Spending Review on securing savings for the public purse.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para170"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_170"></a><a name="10072236000197"></a>I believe that the original intentions behind the establishment of the Government Offices for the Regions (to join up different departmental teams outside London into a one-stop shop) have been lost. Such functions are no longer necessary in an internet age and given the coalition Government's commitment to genuine decentralisation and devolution of power.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para171"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_171"></a><a name="10072236000198"></a>There are, however, some Government Office functions, such as arrangements for resilience and civil contingencies, which will need to continue. The Spending Review process will be used to test which activities currently carried out by the Government Offices should continue, and to decide the most cost-effective ongoing arrangements.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para172"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_172"></a><a name="10072236000199"></a>The Spending Review will also consider arrangements for the redeployment or release of Government Office staff, and for sharing as appropriate the savings, costs, assets and liabilities arising from the decision.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para173"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_173"></a><a name="10072236000200"></a>We should be clear: the Government Offices are not voices of the region in Whitehall. They have become agents of Whitehall to intervene and interfere in localities, and are a fundamental part of the command and control apparatus of England's over-centralised state.</p>

<a name="10072236000204"></a><b><a name="100722-wms0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10072236000262"></a>Baroness Verma:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Andrew Mitchell) has made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para176"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_176"></a><a name="10072236000205"></a>The Government recognise their special responsibilities and international obligations towards their overseas territories, and are committed to supporting their economic development. We want to provide a permanent, economically viable solution to the problem of access to St Helena. This is in the long-term interest of both the British taxpayer and the citizens of this overseas territory.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para177"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_177"></a><a name="10072236000206"></a>St Helena is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world and is currently accessible only by sea. In 2005, the previous Government committed themselves to building an airport. They put the project out to tender in 2007. In October 2008, they appointed a preferred bidder and commenced contract negotiations. Two months later they paused the project. In 2009 the Government set up a further consultation on "whether an airport is the most appropriate option for access to St Helena in the current economic climate".</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para178"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_178"></a><a name="10072236000207"></a>Should an airport not be built, HMG would have to spend an estimated £64 million on a new ship, because the current vessel is reaching the end of its economic life, and continue to subsidise its operating costs. St Helena would stand little chance of becoming financially independent, meaning it would permanently rely on substantial annual budgetary and other support from HMG (currently in excess of £20 million every year). A new ship would provide a costly service but not a solution to St Helena's stagnation and perpetual dependence on UK aid support.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para179"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_179"></a><a name="10072236000208"></a>It also appears that airport cost reductions can be achieved by reducing the length of the runway run-on using an engineered material arresting system (EMAS). This shorter run-on still allows planes to stop safely after reaching the end of the runway itself. This is a technological advance in air safety, which is already in use in airports around the world but which has yet to be approved by Air Safety Support International, the regulator for the UK overseas territories.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS102"></a><b>22 July 2010 : Column WS102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_180"></a><a name="10072236000209"></a>Since taking office, the Government have reviewed the economic costs and benefits of a new ship compared to the construction of an airport. Further independent analysis has concluded that, provided certain conditions are met, the best long-term solution from an economic and financial perspective for both HMG and St Helena is to construct an airport. This would allow us over time to eliminate the cost to HMG of servicing access to the island, to create the potential for St Helena to develop a self-sustaining economy (hence eliminating the need for budgetary support from HMG) and to provide a permanent solution to economic isolation.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para181"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_181"></a><a name="10072236000210"></a>I have therefore reached the provisional conclusion, following careful discussion with Her Majesty's Treasury and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, that the additional short-term costs of constructing an airport are outweighed by the long-term benefits. So I believe that this option is likely to represent the best value for money for the British taxpayer.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para182"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_182"></a><a name="10072236000211"></a>We would therefore be willing to finance an airport for St Helena on condition that:</p>
 an acceptable contract price is achieved;the risk of cost and time overruns after the award of the contract is addressed;the airport design using EMAS is approved by Air Safety Support International; andthe St Helena Government undertake to implement the reforms needed to open the island's economy to inward investment and increased tourism.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_187"></a><a name="10072236000218"></a>e-Borders is the electronic collection and checking of individual passenger details against UK police, security and immigration watchlists. It is a key element of our strategy to deliver robust border controls and it supports our national counterterrorism strategy. It helps to reduce the threat of terrorist attacks, to disrupt cross-border crime and to prevent abuses of the immigration system. That is why we made it clear in the coalition programme that we support the idea of e-Borders.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para188"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_188"></a><a name="10072236000219"></a>It has been clear for some time that the way the existing programme was developing gave rise to serious concern. Over recent weeks we have been examining the progress of the programme and it has been extremely disappointing. While some elements have been delivered, they have not been delivered on time. Delivery of the next critical parts of the programme are already running at least 12 months late. On top of this there remain risks of further delays, and there is no confidence in the current prime supplier-Raytheon Systems Limited-being able to address this situation.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para189"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_189"></a><a name="10072236000220"></a>The Efficiency Reform Group has looked at the project as part of its major project assessment review and its view was that the history of the programme was a succession of missed milestones coupled with issues of quality. Since July 2009 the supplier has been in breach of contract and there have been extensive negotiations about a remedial plan; no agreement has been reached.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para190"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_190"></a><a name="10072236000221"></a>The supplier's performance to date has not been compliant with its contractual obligations. As a consequence I have taken the decision to terminate the e-Borders contract. The supplier is required to ensure a smooth handover of services to a new supplier.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para191"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_191"></a><a name="10072236000222"></a>The decision has not been taken lightly, but after much consideration. We will now seek alternative providers to secure the key benefits that the contract has so far been unable to deliver. This work will be undertaken as a matter of urgency.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para192"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_192"></a><a name="10072236000223"></a>To date and since the project was started in 2007, the Government have spent £188 million on supplier costs against a total contract cost of around £750 million.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para193"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_193"></a><a name="10072236000224"></a>What we currently have in place is the software for the collection of data in advance of travel and its subsequent storage; the technology to enable carriers to feed information into a central hub, and a National Border Targeting Centre which opened earlier this year and where the information is checked against watchlists and reviewed by the police and border force officers.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para194"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_194"></a><a name="10072236000225"></a>Going forward, the e-Borders programme remains a priority. The termination of this contract does not change this. The Government are determined to get value for money from their major contracts, and require the highest standard of performance to be delivered.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para195"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_195"></a><a name="10072236000226"></a>e-Borders is part of a wider activity with our partners to check passengers against watchlists before they travel. Security and immigration checks carried out by the UK Border Agency will continue as normal before individuals travel and at the UK border.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_196"></a><a name="10072236000227"></a>The Government are committed to enhancing e-Borders capabilities and to ensuring that we can progress this project in a timely and cost-effective way.

That is why we have taken this decision, and why we will ensure that the benefits of e-Borders are delivered through a programme that meets its targets, so that everyone in this country is made safer.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_28"></a>
<a name="10072236000229"></a><b><a name="100722-wms0001.htm_spmin24"></a><a name="10072236000265"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Henley):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State (Caroline Spelman) has today made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para198"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_198"></a><a name="10072236000230"></a>The House will be aware that the first six months of 2010 have been the driest since 1929-this is partly attributable to more of our winter and spring wind coming more from the north than is usual (bringing with them the ash cloud earlier in the year), rather than the usual winds from the west which bring us much of our winter/spring rain. This has had a broad impact on the availability of water in rivers, reservoirs and canals, and on the environment and agriculture, with the lack of rain reducing grass growth and stressing other crops.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para199"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_199"></a><a name="10072236000231"></a>The problem has been particularly acute in the North West which has received only 60 per cent of its average rainfall in the first half of this year. Public water supplies in this region are more reliant than most on reservoirs which are quick to replenish when it rains but also quick to empty when there is a long dry period as now. As a consequence United Utilities, the water company in the region, has encouraged consumers to be careful how they use water and  on 9 July they imposed a hosepipe ban to reduce consumption.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para200"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_200"></a><a name="10072236000232"></a>I have been following developments closely and receive full briefing weekly from the Environment Agency, which has responsibility for managing our water resources. In addition, I recently met Philip Green, CEO at United Utilities, who updated me on the actions the company is taking to help protect supplies of water to its customers. Since the last drought in the North West in 1995-96, leakage has halved and is now operating at its economic level of leakage; this has contributed to a drop of almost a quarter in the total demand for water over the same period; United Utilities is increasing resilience of supplies through a new west-to-east link that is nearing completion. Other water companies are also taking positive action, as I saw for myself in a recent visit to Yorkshire Water; this company has improved resilience of its water supply since 1995-96 through creation of a network to redistribute water taken from rivers, reservoirs and groundwater across its supply area.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para201"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_201"></a><a name="10072236000233"></a>All water companies plan for secure supplies through their 25-year water resources management plans. These set out how a company will provide for a sustainable

But that does not mean that they can avoid introducing restrictions in times of water shortage: typically they plan for restrictions once every 20 years. To plan for resources that would meet demand in any circumstances would build in significant additional costs, which would fall to their customers, and would have impacts on the environment too. And so all companies take a risk-based approach, balancing a planned level of service, to include measures such as hosepipe bans, against the costs customers are willing to pay for a secure supply.</p>

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para202"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_202"></a><a name="10072236000234"></a>None of us can predict what the weather will bring over the coming year and, while I am advised by the Environment Agency that no other part of England is anticipating imposing hosepipe bans at present, after such a dry six months we should all take care to protect the resources available for essential uses and not let it run to waste unnecessarily.

<a name="100722-wms0001.htm_para203"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_203"></a><a name="10072236000235"></a>Looking more broadly at the UK situation we must recognise that the United Kingdom has finite water resources, with some parts of England having less water per person than many hotter and drier countries. Using our water supplies wisely so that we have what we need for essential domestic and industrial purposes, while minimising the impact on the natural environment at a time of climate change and population growth is the challenge for the future. It is now 20 years since the current regulatory regime was put in place and the White Paper I plan to publish next summer will examine the options for reforming the industry to drive greater efficiency and improving the way we value and use our water resources.</p>

If they are unable or unwilling to do so, the international community should assist, using humanitarian, diplomatic and all other peaceful means at its disposal. As a last resort, the concept envisages the consideration of more coercive international intervention through the Security Council in accordance with the UN Charter.</p>

With such action we aim to highlight the situation in the country, rally international pressure on the regime, and thereby curtail further human rights abuses.
