<a name="40706-01_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Patient Information Advisory Group</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What is the likely duration of the Patient Information Advisory Group; and what plans are in place to enable the transfer of information about National Health Service patients in the absence of informed consent when the group ceases to exist.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My Lords, the national programme for NHS IT is currently developing improved anonymisation services to support activities that rely on NHS patient information. We expect that by 2007 the Patient Information Advisory Group will have evaluated these services, advised the Government on where anonymised information must be used as an alternative to disclosing confidential patient information without consent, and indicated whether there is a need for continuing legislative support for key work. Consideration can then be given to whether there is a continuing need for an advisory group.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. I should like to   quote him back to himself. He said in a debate on 7 January,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;it remains to be seen whether the wonders of IT will ultimately remove the need for identifiable data for the purposes of epidemiology&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 7/1/04; cols. 209&#150;10.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>He shared the scepticism of the noble Lord, Lord   Turnberg, about whether that was achievable. I have to add my scepticism to theirs.
</p>

<a name="40706-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>We have the most comprehensive cancer registry in the world, from which there has never been a breach of confidentiality. Would it not be safer to continue registration at present, ensuring through public information that everyone understands why such data are so crucial to ensure equity of treatment, detection of carcinogens and so that research findings can be rolled out to the public?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I pay tribute to the work of the cancer registries. I, as always, retain a healthy scepticism about all sorts of things, but in this particular instance, the Government are ensuring that nothing is changed from the present arrangements <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_656"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 656</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

until PIAG has seen that the new secondary uses services that will be introduced under the new IT programmes are working satisfactorily.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hayman: </b>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware how much the Government&#039;s change of view on some issues in the Human Tissue Bill has been welcomed by the medical research community? I remind the House of my interest, as chairman of Cancer Research UK. On informed consent and the transfer of information, will my noble friend do all he can to make sure that the Government take an equally practical and pragmatic approach in order to safeguard life-saving research?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, as I was trying to indicate, the Government will, through their new IT programme, be setting up a secondary uses service, which is for the people who do not deal with direct patient care, such as researchers and public health communities. They will have that service, which will protect their research interest. Taking a belt and braces approach, we are keeping the PIAG system in place to ensure that everything is satisfactory and the best interests of researchers and patients are served.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My Lords, the setting up of PIAG&#151;for which my noble friend Lady Northover must take a great deal of credit&#151;was a very important step in allowing the transfer of information to cancer disease registries, as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, pointed out. When we debated this in January, the Minister said that decisions were imminent, yet we still seem very slow in giving certainty to the disease registries. Has the Minister considered making cancer notifiable so that the information can be passed without recourse to PIAG?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, we keep those issues under review. However, I thought that I was giving certainty in my Answer. I said that by 2007 PIAG would be able to evaluate the new services and see whether changes are necessary.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew6"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that there is quite a deal of concern in the medical community about the national patient record system and the effect on patient confidentiality that it may have? Can he assure me that this is being looked at closely and that the department is taking it seriously?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, Professor Aidan Halligan, one of the deputy chief medical officers in the department, has been given the job of making sure that the needs and concerns of clinicians are fully met as the NHS IT national programme is rolled out.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </b>   My Lords, will this information be held centrally, because there are many health bodies, and nobody quite knows what each does? Will the information be available to universities and those people who want it for research?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the NHS programme for IT will create a new national patient record system in <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 657</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

England. There will be a range of abilities to access it, based on people&#039;s need to know and the confidentiality and security arrangements that are appropriate. Researchers in universities and elsewhere who are involved in this area will be regarded as secondary users and will have the services that I have described.

<a name="40706-01_time0"></a><h5></h5>


<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Sharples: </b>   My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. In doing so, I should declare that over 30 years ago, I was diagnosed with anorexia.
</p>

<a name="40706-01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>The Question was as follows:


</p>

<a name="40706-01_para3"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>To ask Her Majesty&#039;s Government what progress has been made in implementing the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidelines for the treatment of eating disorders, published in January.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, implementation of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidelines on eating disorders is a matter for primary care trusts, with strategic health authorities and the Healthcare Commission maintaining an oversight role.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Sharples: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Is he aware that more than 1.1 million people, most of them young people, are suffering from those illnesses? Their access to treatment is, at best, patchy and, in many places, inadequate. Surely GPs and practice nurses should receive advice on how they can recognise those illnesses so that they can prevent possible death.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, services for people with eating disorders are available throughout the country, in both primary and secondary care, but we recognise that expertise and services are unequally distributed around the country. That is precisely why the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidelines were published in January as part of a programme to improve services.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My Lords, one of the problems with eating disorders and their treatment is, to a large extent, the lack of a clinical evidence base on the most effective treatments. There has been some concern about the impact of regulations made under EU Clinical Trials Directive on the ability of those trials to be carried out. What can the Minister say on that subject?
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, we have been over the ground of the EU Clinical Trials Directive many times   and no doubt we will go over it again. The Government&#039;s position is clear. We have implemented the EU directive. I am not aware that it is going to have any adverse effect on research in that particular area.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the recommendations and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_658"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 658</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

guidelines from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in this field are extremely welcome? Nevertheless, does he accept that many patients who suffer from eating disorders are very difficult indeed for doctors to identify because they often have a remarkable expertise in concealing the nature of their condition from their doctors, their parents and others who care for them? Does he feel that the guidance from the national institute is good enough to help doctors to identify patients with those conditions?
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40706-01_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, that guidance was the result of a great deal of discussion and consultation with a wide range of interests. It recommends the best practice that is available in this country.
</p>

<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </b>   My Lords, do those patients come under mental health as a specialty?
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the issue of eating disorders was covered in the National Service Framework for Mental Health. The National Director for Mental Health, Professor Louis Appleby, is conducting a review of the provision of all specialised mental healthcare to provide advice to the commissioner. That review will cover eating disorders as well.

<a name="time_1"></a>
<a name="40706-02_time0"></a><h5></h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Willoughby de Broke </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>Whether wind power requires a conventional power back-up.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My Lords, all forms of generation require some degree of back-up to cater for unexpected interruptions. The fact that wind power is intermittent has implications for the level of back-up required, but work undertaken by the National Grid Company following the energy White Paper indicates that the electricity system could manage with the increasing reliance on wind generation implied by our renewable targets and aspirations. The back-up could be provided either by conventional or non-intermittent sources of renewable energy such as hydro or biomass.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Willoughby de Broke: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. Are the costs of that full-time fossil fuel back-up currently factored into the costs of wind farms? Does he agree that having full-time fossil fuel back-up generation in place for wind farms means that no matter how many wind farms we build, we will still not attain our emissions target?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   Yes, my Lords, that is factored into the cost. Where wind power provides up to 10 per cent of the renewable target, that back-up has little effect on the cost. If one reached the probably <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_659"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 659</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

extreme position of 20 per cent of the renewable target being met by wind, one would begin to need to factor in the cost of the back-up, but that would probably come to about 0.5p per kilowatt hour. I see no reason why that should prevent us meeting our emissions targets.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Tanlaw: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister advise us once more about the situation in south-west Scotland? That is the best area for wind generation, yet the Ministry of Defence consistently opposes any form of wind farm being sited there. Therefore, how are the Government going to meet their target for renewable energy if the ministry continues to cause delay in planning applications for wind generators?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, the answer is exactly the same as it was on the previous occasion. The MoD and the Civil Aviation Authority, via the wind energy and civil and military aviation working groups, are working to resolve the planning issues to make certain that wind turbines are properly sited.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Ezra: </b>   My Lords, in view of the relatively small contribution that wind power is making to electricity generation and to the back-up required, is it not time for the Government to reconsider extending the same kind of incentives to other ways in which emissions can be reduced, such as combined heat and power&#151;the Minister will not be surprised to hear that from me&#151;clean coal technology and the recovery of methane from coal mines?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   No, my Lords, if that were the right course of action, the Government would have taken it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Lang of Monkton: </b>   My Lords, is it the case that wind power is inefficient and unreliable, having only a   30   per cent load factor, and that it is also environmentally unattractive, intrusive, noisy, harmful to wildlife and ruinous of our countryside? Against that background, would it not be more sensible to place more reliance on the more efficient, reliable and durable source of nuclear power?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, I repeat what I said previously. It is quite extraordinary to refer to wind turbines as environmentally unattractive and promptly suggest that the environmental solution is to have nuclear power. Whatever one&#039;s view is about nuclear power, there are considerable and very real environmental issues involved. As far as the cost is concerned, the load factor is taken into account in the calculations, which still show that the market is making the right judgment, which is that, as of today, the cheapest source of renewable energy is almost certainly wind power.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Williams of Elvel: </b>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware of academic studies which tend to show that when fossil fuel power stations are ramped up&#151;to use <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_660"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 660</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the current expression&#151;when the wind does not blow, that almost entirely negates the benefits of wind power when the wind blows? Does he agree with those studies or not?
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, I am not aware of those studies. I would be very surprised if that is the case. As far as I am aware, it is quite clear that you can have back-up, particularly if it is gas-fired conventional generation, which very quickly can provide the necessary back-up. That in no way negates the benefits. I find it hard to see how it can, given that it is intermittent, negate the benefits of the renewable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   My Lords, have the Government made any calculation of the point at which the expansion of wind power will require the expansion of stand-by generating capacity to deal with the fluctuations which might arise from that wind power?
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, it depends on making judgments about a whole series of issues, such as the geographical dispersal of wind farms, and so on. But as I indicated, up to about 10 per cent of energy from wind turbines has very little impact. If 20 per cent of energy comes from wind turbines, a significant amount of plant margin is needed. But, as I explained, it is only about 0.5p per kilowatt hour that increases the cost.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, is there not a real danger to security of supply by relying on wind turbines as part of the spare capacity? Unless we are going to waste power station output by keeping them running&#151;but not feeding to the grid because there are windmills&#151;we are in fact saving nothing, but also putting security of supply at risk. Will the Minister not listen to the growing dissent about the construction of wind farms as being unacceptable environmentally and useless so far as productivity is concerned?
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, I think the noble Lord is unaware that one can turn the back-up on and off as required.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew16"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that tidal power is constant and reliable? Is he confident that his department is doing all it can to bring tidal power forward?
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, clearly tidal power is another very useful source of energy, but it remains very expensive. Research is under way on how to bring that into an area in which it will make economic sense.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew18"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that his right honourable friend <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_661"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 661</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the   Prime Minister said this morning in a Select Committee that one of the reasons for not committing to nuclear at this stage was because it was more costly than other sources of energy?

</p>

<a name="40706-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>Does the Minister therefore disagree with all the authoritative reports that say practically the opposite? They include, for example, the Royal Academy of Engineering, which mentioned that when you consider even the decommissioning costs of nuclear it is less expensive than wind power, because with wind power one has to pay not only for the installations and the subsidies but also for what the Minister referred to in response to the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke.
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew19"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, of course the Prime Minister was right. That is an article of faith for all junior Ministers. I shall explain why he is right. He is right because at the moment there are very few data which give the cost of nuclear power to date&#151;there are practically no up-to-date nuclear power stations being built in the West, although there have been some in South-East Asia. There are very few data about which one can confidently say that they give the current costs of nuclear power.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew20"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, have the Government taken any steps to arrest the anticipated reduction in electricity generation from nuclear and fossil fuel sources?
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="40706-02_spnew21"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, that is what the whole renewal programme is about. It is to provide alternative sources to fill the requirements as we go forward.

Does the Minister acknowledge that the sheer volume of questions on this and similar subjects which has arisen in this House over the past year indicates quite a widespread anxiety about the combination of reliance upon intermittent sources and increasing quantities of gas imported over very large distances? It indicates an underlying concern about security of energy supplies in the future.
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="40706-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, that is entirely right. There clearly is anxiety in this House about this question of energy security. That is an important area for this country as we move into a world where we are an importer of energy. It is right that this House should consider this matter very seriously. Equally, it is for the Government to point out what action we are taking.

<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_3"></a>What progress they are making in the reduction of corruption in Africa by use of powers under Part 12 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="40706-03_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, the Government are determined to tackle corruption globally, including in Africa. Corruption is a complex phenomenon and the Government are engaged in a range of measures to tackle corruption in Africa, as well as in other regions of the world&#151;for example, by raising governance standards in African countries. Part 12 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 makes a small contribution to that. It gives the UK courts extra-territorial jurisdiction over offences of bribery committed overseas by UK companies or nationals.
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="40706-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for that Answer. Given the last point she made&#151;that the whole purpose of Part 12 was to enable us to prosecute UK companies here, where their corruption or bribery had been in states incapable or unwilling to enforce it there&#151;why is it that extra resources have not been made available to the prosecuting authorities here so that they can do the job? I would ask her particularly about the Democratic Republic of the Congo where, according to a recent United Nations report, British companies were identified as being exploiters of its mineral wealth and yet nothing has happened so far. Why is that? Will the Minister not accept that unless there is prosecution here under the Act, the Act is pointless?
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="40706-03_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, we are well aware of the strong interest of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, in the possibility of progress in the DRC. I will come to the UN panel issue that he raised on the DRC in a moment. Part 12 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act allows for the prosecution of offences of bribery committed by UK nationals and incorporated bodies abroad. It does not, as the noble Lord knows, apply to other criminal offences.
</p>

<a name="40706-03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>We take allegations against UK-based companies and individuals extremely seriously, but dealing with allegations is simply not just a matter of resources. However, the noble Lord will know that police funding since 2000&#150;01 has increased by 30 per cent, or &#163;2.3 billion. The UK Customs and Excise assessment of the UN panel report, to which the noble Lord referred in his supplementary question, is that information thus far processed by the UK for the OECD guidelines is not sufficient yet to mount a criminal investigation.
</p>

<a name="40706-03_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>However, I am pleased to tell the noble Lord that the UN has now released additional material collected by the panel in regard to UK-based companies and individuals. The UK, as he knows, has been requesting that material for some time. That means that the <br>&nbsp;<br>

Can she tell me how our Government&#039;s plans are progressing for our legislation, including the legislation that we need to ratify the United Nation&#039;s convention against corruption? We do not want to lag behind the African Union, do we?
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="40706-03_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, I certainly agree with my noble friend that we congratulate the African Union   on its preparations for the convention against corruption. Indeed, we welcome such regional initiatives, which are designed to complement the aims of the convention.
</p>

<a name="40706-03_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>My noble friend asked me when the UK Government aim to ratify the UN Convention against Corruption. We intend to do that as soon as we are satisfied that the UK can comply fully with the obligations under it. We want the UK to be among the first 30 ratifying countries.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="40706-03_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Marsh: </b>   My Lords, could the Minister give an example of our ability to influence those other countries, with the aid of our African friends who are on the same side&#151;perhaps starting with Mr Mugabe as a specimen?
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="40706-03_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, on the issue of Zimbabwe and corruption, under the Cotonou agreement between the European Community and the African, Caribbean and Pacific states, consultations have led to the application of appropriate measures against Zimbabwe, as the noble Lord will know, under Article 96, which deals with breaches of essential elements of democracy, human rights and rule of law.
</p>

<a name="40706-03_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>The noble Lord asked me about other examples. We provide a wide range of assistance, depending on the particular needs of each country. Anti-corruption strategies in Uganda would be an example.
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="40706-03_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   My Lords, the Minister began by referring to good governance in Africa, and I am sure that we would all agree with her. However, may I suggest that we should start with better governance in the United Kingdom?
</p>

<a name="40706-03_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>The Minister will be aware that I have been in correspondence now for three years with all the financial agencies and the Home Office with regard to the laundering of some 2 billion to 3 billion dollars-worth of Nigerian state funds. Is she aware of some 15   banks found to be involved in that trade, four were fined and no others were either named or prosecuted? Is she aware that the City of London police decided to prosecute none of them? Is she aware that every other country involved froze the bank accounts held by <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_664"></a>

nominees of the Nigerian state funds, while the United Kingdom froze none of them? Finally, is she aware that after a three-year effort to get the Home Office to make its evidence available to the federal government of Nigeria, a poor and democratic major state in Africa, it is still the case that the Home Office has not sent any of the evidence that the federal government need, although Switzerland and other countries have done so?
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="40706-03_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, perhaps the noble Baroness would allow me to write to her in detail about the disappointment that she has experienced over the correspondence she has had with the Home Office. The UK&#039;s anti-money-laundering regime involves directing primary legislation in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and secondary legislation against the menace presented by money-laundering to the UK and internationally.

<a name="40706-03_spnew11"></a><b> The Earl of Dundee: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the OECD is also examining the position of overseas subsidiaries? What international consensus on methods do the Government favour for dealing with corruption within those subsidiaries?
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="40706-03_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   Yes, my Lords, I am aware of the OECD&#039;s involvement in that matter.

This month we have interviews with officials from the OECD to discuss how our own domestic legislation allows us to conform with the convention. We look forward to those interviews.

Will she further accept that the tackling of corruption internationally and specifically in Africa is extremely difficult in the absence of effective and accountable political structures, as in the Congo; in the absence of the rule of law, as in Zimbabwe; and in the absence of effective and supportive neighbourly community life, as in many parts of Africa?

<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="40706-04_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Lamont of Lerwick: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply so far as it goes. Were not the most reverend Primates absolutely right to state that the happenings in Abu Ghraib prison severely undermined the moral authority of the West? Is it not therefore very important that the forthcoming trials of former members of the Iraqi regime are not also a political own goal? Was it not therefore disappointing that in the court proceedings last week Americans ran the proceedings, the only civilians in the court were American soldiers dressed as civilians, the defendants had no legal representation, and most astonishingly of all, the transcript of the court proceedings was censored by the American military? Is it not essential that these trials should be credible and not just a staged event?
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="40706-04_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, of course, we understand the concern that has been expressed, including by senior clergy in the Church of England, about the alleged abuses of detainees in Iraq. The House will know that we take extremely seriously any allegations that are made against United Kingdom Armed Forces, and we investigate them. Eighteen investigations have been initiated relating to individuals detained by our Armed Forces, but only one of those relates to an incident at a formal detention facility. I want to make it clear that there is absolutely no evidence of systematic human rights abuses by UK forces either at detention centres or elsewhere.

Senior people from Guantanamo went to Iraq. Is there a similar list of interrogation techniques published by this country, or available to be published by this country, and, if so, will the Government kindly publish it? It will be appreciated that Mr Rumsfeld admitted that four of the interrogation techniques employed were not in accordance with international standards or with the Geneva Convention.

<a name="40706-04_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, Guantanamo is rather wide of the Question, which specifically concerns the letter from the Archbishops of Canterbury and of York. I am not in a position today to comment in any detail on Guantanamo. However, the investigative methods used by UK troops and police are absolutely in accordance with the Geneva Convention. There is absolutely no question that any of those proceedings are carried out in a way that would be unacceptable to the noble Lord.

The more important part of the right reverend Prelate&#039;s question concerns the issues of moral authority that he raises.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

&quot;(   )   For the purposes of subsection (4)(d), inducement includes situations where the person may not be aware of what he is being encouraged to do.&quot;

<p><a name="st_78"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I have tabled Amendment No. 1 to give the Government the opportunity to put on the record their reconsidered response to earlier amendments that I tabled in Committee and on Report. Those amendments reflected the concern that had been raised with Members of this House by the Refugee Children&#039;s Consortium.
</p>

<a name="40706-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>The concern can be simply stated. Is Clause 4 sufficiently broad to cover all cases involving children? Does the clause, which deals with trafficking, cover the situation where a request or inducement, force, threat or deception, is made to person A, an adult, but person <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_670"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 670</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

B, a child, is exploited? Does it cover situations where the child may not be conscious of what is happening to them?
</p>

<a name="40706-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>To be guilty of trafficking under this clause, a person must arrange or facilitate the arrival of another person in the United Kingdom and intend to exploit that person, or believe that another person intends to do so.   Thus the definition of &quot;exploitation&quot; is central to proving the offence.

</p>

<a name="40706-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>I have always accepted that the Government do not intend that there should be any lacuna. We have been working as one on this matter. However, it appeared that the gap was as follows. Children may not be subject to treatment amounting to slavery or forced labour. They could therefore not satisfy the definition of exploitation in Clause 4(4)(a). Children may not be trafficked for their organs; thus they may not satisfy the definition in subsection 4(b). As for subsection 4(c), the threat of violence may not be made to the child: the parent may be told that the child will be harmed. The parent may be asked to agree that the child become involved in an activity, and no one may ask the child anything at all. Thus it would appear that those who traffick in children may escape prosecution under this clause.
</p>

<a name="40706-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Following our debates on Report on 18 May, I understand that the Government have had further discussions behind the scenes with the Refugee Children&#039;s Consortium. I understand that the Minister may now be in a position to put on record the Government&#039;s further statement on their understanding of the term &quot;inducement&quot; in the context of this clause.
</p>

<a name="40706-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>If the Minister is able to do so and can demonstrate that the clause makes it clear that children do not need to be conscious of what is happening to them, then I anticipate that I shall most certainly, and with great pleasure, be able to withdraw this amendment. For the time being, however, I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="40706-05_spmin2"></a><b>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Lord Rooker): </b>  My Lords, I certainly hope that I can satisfy the points made by the noble Baroness. As she said, Amendment No. 1 relates to the circumstances in which a person is exploited for the purposes of Clause   4 and, in particular, the meaning of the words &quot;induced&quot; and &quot;inducement&quot; in subsection (4)(d).
</p>

<a name="40706-05_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>The definition of &quot;exploitation&quot; in subsection (4) is crucial to these offences. We have already had substantial debate on the drafting of this subsection, to ensure that the clause captures all the cases where a person is truly exploited.
</p>

<a name="40706-05_para17"></a>

I did not participate in them but, before assisting my noble friend, I was fully updated and briefed on what was happening to the Bill.

<a name="40706-05_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>Amendment No. 1 seeks to ensure that the terms &quot;induced&quot; and &quot;inducement&quot; in subsection (4)(d) are broad enough to cover the circumstances where the victim is not aware of what he is being encouraged to do. This is very important in the case of young children, who may not understand what they are being encouraged to do but who may nevertheless be susceptible to persuasion.
</p>

<a name="40706-05_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>We are satisfied that the ordinary meaning of the word &quot;inducement&quot; is such that a person may be induced to do something notwithstanding his not being fully aware of what he is being induced to do. We therefore consider that subsection (4)(d) as drafted can apply in cases involving very young children, who may not be fully aware of the situation, of their actions, and of what it is they are being encouraged to do.
</p>

<a name="40706-05_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>Amendment No. 2 also deals with the rights of victims of trafficking. As we understand it, the concern here is that Clause 4 offences may, as drafted, allow for   the prosecution and conviction of the victims of trafficking in cases where a person arrives in the United Kingdom believing that another person will exploit him, but who none the less, in an attempt to escape his own country, agrees to come.
</p>

<a name="40706-05_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>I am aware that there has been some constructive correspondence on this issue between my noble friend Lady Scotland and the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. I am happy to be able to offer the same explanation and reassurances which my noble friend has given in that correspondence.
</p>

<a name="40706-05_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>We are absolutely in agreement that the offence in Clause 4 should not be used to prosecute those who themselves are victims of trafficking. However, we consider it to be implicit in the drafting of Clause 4 that the accused and the victim must be two different people. The wording of Clause 4 is not appropriate to describe arrangements made by oneself for oneself. Further, it should be borne in mind that criminal offences are strictly constructed in the defendant&#039;s favour. We therefore consider that the clause as drafted is sufficiently clear to ensure that the victims of trafficking will not be prosecuted for or convicted of the offences in the clause. Consequently, we do not consider that Amendment No. 2 is necessary.
</p>

<a name="40706-05_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>I hope that explanation, together with the correspondence which has passed between the Home Office, the concerned bodies, and noble Lords is sufficient for the noble Baroness to feel that I have met the obligations and that she does not need to proceed with this amendment.

</p>

<a name="40706-06_para0"></a>

They do not include the possibility that the person does not understand what they are being induced to do. I  think that it is stretching language a little far to say that the clause actually says that. Is the noble Lord certain of that?

Perhaps I may put on record my thanks to the Bill team for doing that over the weekend. It has meant that we have been able to foreshorten proceedings today.

   &quot;IMMIGRATION DECISION PROCEDURE

<br>
(1)   An independent inspector shall be appointed after consultation with relevant organisations&#151;


<br>
(a)   to report annually on the quality of decision-making in asylum cases;


<br>
(b)   to lay that report before Parliament.

<br>
(2)   Section 26 shall not be enacted until and unless the independent inspector is satisfied that the quality of initial decision-making has been improved.&quot;

<p><a name="st_85"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, if the Government were to accept this amendment, it would mean an extraordinary change of heart and philosophy on their part. The amendment seeks to draw attention to what we have criticised throughout the passage of the Bill as the basic error in its philosophy; namely, that the Government seem to think they can best improve the immigration system by a sanction here and a withdrawal of benefit or of the right to appeal there, and a toughening up further down the process. We on these Benches have continually drawn attention to the quite extraordinary failure at the first stage that has produced these large numbers of often successful appeals.
</p>

<a name="40706-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>In the past we have drawn attention to examples such as Canada, where the issue is approached differently, and there is much better first testing of cases, so that that the subsequent problems that apply in our case do not apply in theirs. We have referred to the junior quality of some of the Home Office officials who appear at first stage, and to the astonishing fact that sometimes there are no such officials at all. We do not have the highest expectations, but we do hope the Minister will use this opportunity to say that the Government recognise that the first stage of asylum applications is a substantial part of the problem this Bill is trying to address. With this amendment we are trying to introduce a suggestion for quality control, which would ensure that the first stage was treated efficiently and properly, and dealt with by a high quality person. We believe if we did, and if we set that as a mark, some of the other measures in this Bill would simply prove unnecessary because the right decisions would be made first time. I beg to move.

<a name="40706-06_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   My Lords, I wonder if we are in the throes of a coup. The Conservatives seem to be intent on running business today. Perhaps the mood will pass eventually, as it may be several decades before they have the opportunity to do so again.

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>I wholeheartedly support Amendment No. 3, because throughout the whole of the proceedings on the previous Bill, at the Second Reading of this one, and at one or two stages since then, I have tried to stress the vital importance of the quality of the first decision in all refugee and asylum cases.

However, I think the atmosphere this afternoon indicates a certain amount of creative agnosticism about the details of much of this Bill and whether it is actually necessary. I know that feeling is not shared by the Government, but none the less it resonates in this House. I hope that the Minister will look sympathetically on the spirit of the amendment, even if we cannot vote on it. The amendment will send out a signal that there is a safeguard and that the Government are not appearing to be too heavy-handed, especially as some of us think that reducing the number of asylum seekers worldwide is not as necessary as people sometimes make it out to be.
</p>




<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="40706-06_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I shall be brief. Of course, like all noble Lords around the House, we have also been concerned about the problem of too low a quality of decision making at first instance. I include the Government in that, because we have all been trying to take the quality further forward; that serves everybody well, and nobody benefits if things go wrong and the whole system gets clogged up as it has done. I was intrigued when I saw the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord McNally, appear yesterday and the approach that it takes. I reflected on our Amendment No. 35, which was published last week and will be moved by my noble friend Lord Kingsland later&#151;I am tempted to say rather much later&#151;today. That amendment adopts a different approach, but with the same objective of trying to ensure that the Home Office is held to account to improve both decision making and the timeframe within which the decisions are made. I am going to reserve our firepower until we get to our preferred mode of approach at Amendment No. 35.
</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="40706-06_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I am not the bringer of joy and good tidings. I was not here before 2001, but I often wonder what the debates were like when I was struggling with my constituency before 1997, when there was no decision at all, let alone a high or low quality decision, and the system was in chaos. I sometimes think there is an underlying resentment of the fact that these days almost 80 per cent of first decisions are made within two months. To have no decision, or to have them dragged out for months and years, served the racketeers and vested interests out there that ran the industry. There has been a dramatic change in the past few years in getting speedy decisions for people. They are not all perfect; nobody denies that. Nor do we resent the fact&#151;indeed, we are quite happy&#151;that at various stages we have external monitors.
</p>

<a name="40706-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>I can go through the training programmes of the people making the decisions, if need be. We do not take them off the streets and put them to work making <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_675"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 675</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

decisions straightaway; far from it. However, we are making decisions. It serves the interests of justice, and of the whole asylum system, to have speedy decisions. In some ways, that little catalogue read out at the beginning by the noble Lord, Lord McNally&#151;&quot;a bit of this, a bit of that&quot;&#151;yes; collectively, that approach has halved asylum applications. I am not saying that is a very sophisticated answer, but the fact of the matter is that it has sent the right signal, the various changes reacting proportionately to events as we found them.
</p>

<a name="40706-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>This is not the first time the matter of decision making has been raised, and I am certainly not claiming that all decisions are perfect. Clearly, the appeals process shows they are not. In terms of seeking the appointment of an independent inspector to assess the quality of initial decision making, I assure the House that we are committed to making high quality decisions.
</p>

<a name="40706-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>We have introduced a range of measures to improve further the quality of the decisions we take. These cover, for example, work on identifying the right candidates for asylum casework&#151;we do not take anyone&#151;looking at additional ways of strengthening our training and development of caseworkers, having samples of asylum decisions quality assured by senior caseworkers and external assessors, extending the feedback we obtain from appeal decisions and doing further work on the country information products and instructions that we issue.
</p>

<a name="40706-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>While we consider the quality of initial decisions to be good, we accept that more could be done and we are taking active steps in this area. In taking forward this work, we are keen to involve outside help as appropriate, as we are doing, for example, with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In some fields of immigration work we have seen the merits of having an independent body or person appointed to provide recommendations to the Secretary of State. For example, we have a monitor for entry clearance work and we recently appointed an independent monitor to see how the non-suspensive appeal powers in the 2002 Act are being used. We have also established the independent Advisory Panel on Country Information to help us to ensure that we produce information of the highest standard about various countries.
</p>

<a name="40706-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>So where appropriate, we will consider appointing external people to oversee that work in the Home Office. On the wider issue of quality decision making, we consider that the work we have in hand to build on the existing good level of decision making is the right way forward. We do not think it necessary or desirable to appoint an inspector as proposed in this amendment.
</p>

<a name="40706-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>I happily re-state the Government&#039;s commitment to high quality decision making. It does not serve anyone if there is poor quality decision making by people who are untrained, unskilled and whose work is not even quality assessed&#151;and that is not the case. The existence of published targets on producing &quot;fully effective&quot; decision letters and the involvement of outside bodies to aid our training programmes and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_676"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 676</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

assist in the assessment of our performance shows that we are not afraid to have an external light shone on what we do. But in this case we do not see that an independent monitor would add any value.
</p>

<a name="40706-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>The second part of the amendment is misconceived&#151;first, because we are satisfied that the quality of decision making is of a good standard already, although it is capable of improvement; and, secondly, because the new appeal structure set out in the Bill will provide an independent robust means for challenging adverse decisions. The implication seems to be that the appeal structure provided for in the Bill will not be suitable for dealing with the current portfolio of asylum appeals coming its way. There is no basis for that implication and it is not one we can accept.
</p>

<a name="40706-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>We have travelled an enormous distance in the past few years in improving the quality of both the people working on asylum casework and the speed of the decisions. That is important. However, they have to be fair and good decisions. Speed is not the over-riding factor, but it was the case when no decisions were being taken. I used to say to my constituents, &quot;Don&#039;t ask me to chase them up. Let sleeping dogs lie&quot;. They could continue for three or four years. The system was in absolute chaos. That is no way to run a fair system and it was exploited and abused, certainly by advisers who had a vested interest in spinning things out. So improving the speed is fine. We can certainly improve the quality, but at this point in time we do not need an external independent assessor on this part of the process. However, I accept that there is independent monitoring in other parts of the immigration and asylum process, so we are not opposed to that <i>per se</i>.

   &quot;LEGAL AID FOR ASYLUM INTERVIEWS

<br>
   The Lord Chancellor shall make a direction under section 6(8) of the Access to Justice Act 1999 (c. 22) (services which may be funded) to require the funding of attendances by solicitors (and other non-solicitor suppliers accredited for the purpose by the legal services commission) and independent interpreters at interviews conducted on behalf of the Secretary of State with a view to his reaching a decision on a claim for asylum (as defined by section 167(1) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (c. 33) (interpretation)) in the circumstances where the supplier has certified that he has a reasonable belief that the asylum applicant to be interviewed&#151;

<br>
(b)   has had inflicted on him serious physical harm; or 


<br>
(c)   has a reasonable fear of being tortured, raped or so harmed if returned to his country of origin.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_94"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am moving again the amendment which was moved at previous stages of   the Bill and hope that on this occasion the Government will have reflected on the need, in terms of justice, effectiveness and efficiency, of allowing the extra categories to be added to those already entitled to legal aid at substantive first interviews. The three extra categories are torture or rape victims, people who have had serious physical harm inflicted on them, or people with,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;a reasonable fear of being tortured, raped or so harmed if returned to . . .  [their] country of origin&quot;.</p>

<a name="40706-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>One has to return to the untenable position of the Government that those categories are not especially vulnerable.

<a name="40706-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Most of the world would find that an astonishing proposition and, with respect, it does not do justice to the standards that this country upholds normally. I shall read noble Lords just one piece of evidence from the Home Office.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;is often a traumatic experience for the victim, who is likely to need to be treated with care and sensitivity&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="40706-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>I shall also refer to another source which I have just   discovered in support of the amendment&#151;the comments made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord   Scott of Foscote, chairman of the European <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_678"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 678</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Union committee that was considering the EU directive on legal aid and assistance. On 21 April he said that the article before the committee,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;has the effect that Member States may decide to provide free legal assistance only for the appeal procedure&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>He was referring to immigration and asylum cases, so I have begun to realise why the Government withdrew legal aid from this class of cases at the end of March. The noble and learned Lord continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;The initial decision-taking process is highly important in getting the correct result in these cases because the asylum seeker in a strange country that he has come to, often not speaking the language of the country, does not know what he needs to say in order to get his case properly considered and in terms of getting a correct result. To underwrite a system under which there is going to be no legal aid at that critical fact-finding stage of the process seems to me to be quite wrong&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>No one in any previous debate on similar amendments has advanced the proposition that such advice was not needed in these limited cases.
</p>

<a name="40706-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>I have consulted a number of adjudicators and senior personnel&#151;including, on the one hand, legal representatives and, on the other hand, those who have to sit on asylum appeals. Everyone engaged in the system believes that there would be a saving of cost and time and an overall increase in effectiveness if the categories of persons mentioned in the amendment could have legal representation at the initial substantive interview. The simple reason is that the interview is the rock on which everything subsequently is built. The asylum officer&#039;s decision is made on the basis of that interview. In so far as it is inadequate, the chances of appeal will be greater and the appeals will be extended with extra costs for all.
</p>

<a name="40706-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>Clause 2 creates criminal offences for asylum applicants who do not act as required under Clause 2 at the asylum interview. Thus we have a new position that adds to the already strong case for allowing legal representation for asylum interviews in the three cases   specified in my amendment. If the Government continue to say that there have been bad cases of poor representation by legal representatives in the field&#151;and I hope that they will not&#151;all I can say is that it is a major objective of the Legal Services Commission to rectify that state of affairs.

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>In response to this amendment on 27 April the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;The Government have chosen to go for excellence and proper representation at a time when that representation makes a difference&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 27/4/04; col. 756.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>It makes a difference in such cases. Justice points clearly in the direction of allowing the amendments and I hope that at this stage the Government will agree to them so that we can have a more effective, efficient and just system. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="40706-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, I rise to support in principle the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury. I do not expect my noble friend to accept the amendment but I would like him to outline the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_679"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 679</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

procedure. I have been much persuaded by what the noble Lord said. In each of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), the people involved are essentially vulnerable. The Government have nothing to fear from approaching the issue with an open mind.
</p>

<a name="40706-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said, the initial interview is vital. As has been acknowledged, it does not always come up to scratch. More pity for that. The case for applying legal aid to such people in the initial interview is made out. I agree that there will be a saving of costs and time. While I do not think that my noble friend will accept what has been said, I hope that he will be benign in welcoming the arguments in principle. In my view, the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, argued unassailably.
</p>




<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="40706-07_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I echo some of the sentiments of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis. We need to be open minded about how we debate these matters. Our views on asylum and immigration applications must change over the years as our communities change and the way in which we manage migration changes.

</p>

<a name="40706-07_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>I have problems with some of the amendment&#039;s drafting. It begins with the word beloved of oppositions and hated by governments: &quot;shall&quot;. It says,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;The Lord Chancellor shall make a direction&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-07_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>A direction is imposed on the Lord Chancellor: whatever he does he must pay his money on particular cases and say that there will be legal aid.
</p>

<a name="40706-07_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>The Minister knows that I use &quot;shall&quot; in amendments on a number of occasions. Whenever I do, I always have at the back of my mind that if the amendment is not probing but concerns a matter I wish to press, anything that I provide in the amendment must be so obviously necessary to all noble Lords that they would stand on their heads if it did not happen.
</p>

<a name="40706-07_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>I do not think that this amendment can justify a &quot;shall&quot;, but it justifies proper considered debate, particularly as we have discussed the issue of whether rape should be included in the list on other Bills. I know that there has been a division of opinion over many years. I am minded of situations in the Congo or in Darfur where rape is an everyday fear, not necessarily because the Government in place are carrying out rape but because they are unable to protect their citizens from rape at the hands of armed militia.
</p>

<a name="40706-07_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>There is a reasonable fear of rape, torture or suffering serious physical harm in too many countries throughout the world. The question is whether our Lord Chancellor has imposed on him the duty to pay legal aid when someone comes to this country to seek either asylum or immigration and claims that he has suffered what is unacceptable.
</p>

<a name="40706-07_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, that for anyone who has suffered under paragraphs (a) or (b), or has reason to believe that he might under paragraph (c), it is unacceptable to him, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_680"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 680</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

but should it then trigger automatic legal aid for the substantive first interview, as the noble Lord said, for immigration and asylum? That is when it becomes more difficult, because nowhere does the new clause say that the suffering the person has endured is as a victim of a crime rooted in political persecution.
</p>

<a name="40706-07_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>If one intended to vote on the amendment and first to take it apart, one then could ask, &quot;What if I were involved in drug running in another country&#151;Afghanistan or wherever around the world&#151;and I upset my drug running compatriots? Should I, because I have a reasonable fear of being bumped off by them, be able to come here and expect automatically to receive legal aid in a claim for asylum?&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40706-07_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>I take an extreme example, but it is simply to show why it was right for the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, to table the amendment to make us keep an open mind and to take forward the debate, but why it would be wrong for the amendment to go in the Bill. I know that what I am saying will be controversial to some members of my party, but the issues raised must not be allowed to go away. We have a responsibility in our community for looking after people who seek refuge here and we need to keep those matters under consideration.

<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="40706-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, the amendment, which the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, has tabled not for the first time on the Bill, seeks to include a number of additional categories in the exceptions listed in the accompanying directive to the Community Legal Service (Scope) Regulations 2004. The essential thrust of the regulations is, as the noble Baroness, Lady   Anelay, said, to place an obligation on the state to provide funding for the attendance of a lawyer and an independent interpreter at substantive IND asylum interviews.
</p>

<a name="40706-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>The issues have recently been before us. While the regulations were made under the Access to Justice Act   1999, it was only on 31 March that the House passed them. Although the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, has been redoubtable in arguing that the regulations are wrong, it is a fact that this House passed them only a matter of weeks ago. Therefore, in procedural terms, the noble Lord is now saying to the House that we should use primary legislation to reverse something that this House passed in secondary legislation only a matter of weeks ago. He is perfectly entitled to do so; I simply mark to the House that it seems slightly strange to go back over this process so soon.
<a name="time_7"></a>
<a name="40706-08_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40706-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>That of course is not a sufficient answer to the challenge that the noble Lord has made, and perhaps I may explain, first, why we introduced the regulations. The previous practice was that funding was available for a representative&#151;usually an agent or an outdoor clerk working for a legally aided organisation&#151;to sit in on the asylum interview. As I and other Ministers said on previous occasions, we could see little evidence that that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_681"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 681</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

added significant value to the process. In most cases, the role played by the person accompanying the asylum seeker was simply that of a note-taker as he was not meant to intervene during the interview. In addition, the interviews are non-adversarial, fact-finding processes, and remedies are available to the client to deal with discrepancies or disputes after the interview.
</p>

<a name="40706-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>When we passed the order a matter of weeks ago, we also explained that there were important exceptions where it was right that an applicant&#039;s representative should be present at the interview. We signalled those as cases involving unaccompanied minors, applicants going through fast-track initial decision processes, and those suffering from a recognised and   verifiable mental incapacity, which would make it   impractical to undertake an interview without support. It also includes applicants interviewed at a police station and those who pose a threat to national security.
</p>

<a name="40706-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>My noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis, in his usual courteous but challenging way, said that surely such a move would make a saving. I do not believe that that is the case. The amendment includes not only people who claim that they have been torture or rape victims (our sympathy must go out to them) or those who are seriously physically harmed (again, wherever that is true, one&#039;s sympathy would be with them) but also those who had a reasonable fear of being tortured, raped or so harmed. I suggest that that includes the vast majority of people who apply for asylum in this country&#151;for obvious reasons because that is the central thrust of the asylum international obligations.
</p>

<a name="40706-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>Therefore, in practice, the effect of the amendment would be that in virtually all cases a lawyer and a second interpreter would be present at the interview. That would not merely be a backward step; it would take us further backwards towards spending relatively scarce legal aid money in areas where there is not a good case to do so.
</p>

<a name="40706-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>Nevertheless, that still leaves the issue, about which the House should be concerned, of whether people who have experienced rape or torture or who have a genuine fear will still receive a fair hearing. My first point is that it may be desirable for some clients to bring a companion to the interview for medical or emotional support. That does not mean a lawyer; it means someone who will give them support. But it is clear that that is the existing IND practice in such cases, and there is absolutely no impediment to people bringing someone along in those circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40706-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>The IND protocol confirms that any other person may be allowed to accompany an applicant to an interview at the discretion of the interviewing officers. The IND policy sets out clearly that that is how applicants who are particularly vulnerable&#151;those whom we are talking about&#151;should be treated.
</p>

<a name="40706-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>Again, in process terms, what is needed is not a lawyer who sits saying nothing during an asylum interview but one who tries to ensure that a vulnerable <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_682"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 682</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

applicant puts before the IND interviewing officer all the written representations with supporting medical evidence to support and bolster his case for why he has been tortured or why he has a genuine fear of torture. It is far better if lawyers spend their time preparing and presenting a case to put to the IND interviewer rather than sitting there saying nothing but taking notes.
</p>

<a name="40706-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>I also draw attention to the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. I am informed that when that organisation interviews alleged victims of torture, it insists that a legal representative should not be present.
</p>

<a name="40706-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>I turn to the argument that the state should fund not one interpreter but two. But what do we do if they disagree with each other? Do we fund three interpreters? That seems to me to be&#151;how can I put this politely?&#151;unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="40706-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>A point was raised about interviewing people who have a genuine fear or who have genuinely experienced torture or rape. We must do our utmost to ensure that that is done with sensitivity and care, but this is not the way to do it.
</p>

<a name="40706-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>As a crumb of comfort to the noble Lord, Lord   Phillips, I draw his attention to our previous debate on these regulations. I think that on that occasion I dealt with this matter, and I was probed on what was meant by &quot;mental incapacity&quot;. We define it as a person lacking capacity if, at a material time, he is unable to make a decision for himself in relation to the matter because of the impairment of, or disturbance to, the functioning of the mind or brain. In other words, if, as part of his professional duties, the solicitor preparing the case for the asylum applicant genuinely thinks that, because of his mental impairment, that person is incapable of making his case, the regulations already allow him an opportunity to do so.
</p>

<a name="40706-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>For those reasons, while I respect the vigour with which the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, put his case, I do not feel that we would be wise to accept it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="40706-08_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for the Minister&#039;s reply. He said that a legal representative would provide little added value. But that was answered by the quotation that I gave from the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, which signals a new regime and one which, by April next year, will see legal representatives accredited by the Legal Services Commission.
</p>

<a name="40706-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>When the Minister said that there would be no saving, he gave no evidence for that proposition. I have discussed this matter with several adjudicators and senior people in the service, and they all say that they are bedevilled by unnecessary appeals and lengthy timescales because of crap first interviews.
</p>

<a name="40706-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>The next point made by the Minister was that the majority of claimants would fall within the exceptions. No evidence is adduced and that argument has not been adduced at previous stages of the Bill.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_683"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 683</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40706-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>I was very disappointed with the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. It was the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, the Front Bench spokesman for the Conservatives, who, when we considered the statutory instrument on 31 March, made clear that if the Government persisted with their proposal, this amendment would be brought forward in this Bill to reverse the withdrawal of legal aid. I am most disappointed that today the Conservatives are not supporting what they supported then. If they had unease about my drafting, which has not altered over the three stages of the Bill, it would have been helpful to have heard about it earlier.
</p>




<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="40706-08_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I may intervene as I have been named. On two occasions at the end of last week, I e-mailed the noble Lord with my comments. Unfortunately, on both occasions I received the message &quot;system unavailable&quot;. I do not know whether the noble Lord&#039;s e-mail address has changed or whether the PDVN has messed things up, but I did make an attempt to notify him of my concerns.
</p>




<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="40706-08_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, but I have a pigeon hole and a telephone.
</p>

<a name="40706-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>I believe that having a friend present at the interview is wholly inadequate when one considers the risk in which this category of persons is placed. No reference was made to the observation of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scott, or to the imposition of criminal sanctions under Clause 2 of the Bill. I add that the Legal Services Commission does not even have discretion to allow legal aid in a particular case. For all those reasons, I wish to test the opinion of the House.

<p><a name="st_102"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in the debate on Report on 18 May, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, said (at col. 711 of the <i>Official Report</i>)<i> </i>that the Government&#039;s position was that it would be inappropriate to return Zimbabwean asylum seekers to Zimbabwe at this time. Earlier, he said that should an appeal fail for that individual,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;return to Zimbabwe would be safe&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 18/5/04; col. 710.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>I refer the Minister to the debate on Zimbabwe in another place on 1 July for a true picture of how dangerous life can be in Zimbabwe today for anyone returning after having sought asylum in the UK. We know of at least one such case where a man was seized by the CIO as he got off the aeroplane having been identified by another Zimbabwean whom he had known while seeking asylum who was a CIO spy.
</p>

<a name="40706-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>I was glad to see in <i>Hansard</i> of 28 June that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;we are committed to offering support under Section 4 to those who cannot maintain themselves and who are not in a position to leave the UK immediately&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 28/6/04; col. 19.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>How can that be squared with the present requirement that those Zimbabweans who have appealed and failed   must, after NASS has withdrawn both accommodation and support, apply for voluntary repatriation and must leave the UK at once? I recognise that there cannot be a blanket provision simply on the grounds of their nationality to exempt all Zimbabwean asylum seekers, but I hope that the noble Lord will recognise that in a number of cases the quality of both the legal advice and the country information on which decisions to refuse asylum have been based in the past have been seriously flawed. According to the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, some well founded claims have been arbitrarily disbelieved.

<a name="40706-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>We are told&#151;I am very glad to hear it&#151;that things will change. That is why I believe it to be necessary in the Bill to provide that Zimbabwean asylum seekers shall be treated as a special case so that the Secretary of State can be expected to exercise his right to offer asylum, whether on the ground of discretionary relief or humanitarian protection. My amendment will, I hope, have that effect. It seems to me that the clear intent of the original Schedule 2(1)(d) and 2(2) is precisely to enable the Secretary of State to disapply the withdrawal of support in certain circumstances.

</p>

<a name="40706-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>There are cogent reasons why the Zimbabwean asylum seekers, like those from Iraq, should be recognised as a special case, warranting special treatment. There is no doubt that Zimbabwe is a country where violence, torture and death are endemic threats for those who are perceived as threats to the regime. Those who have sought asylum here are, for the most part,   people with professional qualifications&#151;teachers, doctors, engineers and computer experts&#151;and some brave political opponents of the regime, who come here, often with great difficulty, believing that Britain, with its long history of giving refuge, will take them in, allow them to maintain their skills and to be useful to the country that has taken them in. They are a vital part of the professional infrastructure that Zimbabwe once had and will need again.
</p>

<a name="40706-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>It is not their fault that they are not allowed to work. I understand that they may not be eligible to do community work either. They cannot go home and here they face destitution under the present law, or they must work illegally. A headmaster is working as a cleaner and a senior civil servant is working as a bus driver. We are talking about a limited number of people, since the visa regime of 2002 was imposed, but they should be a significant group when Zimbabwe has to be rebuilt.
</p>

<a name="40706-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>On 1 July the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, listing what we have done for Zimbabwe, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;We have given asylum to those persecuted by Mugabe and allowed others at risk to remain in the United Kingdom for now&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 1/7/04; col. 456.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>Later he included that in a list of 10 actions designed, he said, to keep Zimbabweans alive. He did not mention that that meant barely alive and in a state of destitution which they cannot remedy because, despite their own wish to do so, they are not allowed to work. Later he spoke of our readiness to help to rebuild Zimbabwe. These are some of the very people who should play a major part in that.
</p>

<a name="40706-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>As it is, once they are evicted from their accommodation they have no address and dare not exist. I know a charity which offered to help some particularly tragic cases, but it could not do so because the people had vanished, at best to sleep on some anonymous floor&#151;genuine asylum seekers do not have mobile phones. It is unworthy of our country that this should happen to courageous men and women who trusted us. When we are told that the Home Office works closely with other departments and when joined-up thinking is the watch word of the Government, I do not understand how the Secretary of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_687"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 687</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs can speak as he did, I am sure in good faith, while the Home Secretary is not prepared to exercise the discretionary right, which a House of Commons committee has urged him to do. We are not talking of thousands of people, but of a significant and potentially valuable group who will be only too glad to serve the country in some way but are instead being driven into destitution.
</p>

<a name="40706-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>HMG are obsessed with their desire not to play into Mugabe&#039;s hands by enabling him to say that we are acting like a former colonial power. They need to remember that the people of Zimbabwe do not think like that. They expect us to behave with decency and humanity and to help them in one of the few areas where we can do so. They look to us to remember them. They fear being forgotten and their instinct has been to turn for help to a country with which they have many natural links through common, educational, sporting and legal systems for a start.
</p>

<a name="40706-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>How do HMG think that the people of Zimbabwe will feel when the present asylum seekers return home to rebuild the country and their experience of us has been enforced destitution? I very much hope that the Government will be able to accept my amendment. It is very small and is designed to meet a specific and unique situation. All that is needed is for the Secretary of State to exercise his power to grant a temporary right to remain in the UK with its concomitant rights to accommodation and support for a relatively small number of people, asylum seekers&#151;not of course the crooks of whom we have recently heard&#151;in a situation which is finite. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="40706-10_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, when the blanket suspension of the removal of Zimbabweans was introduced, it was largely at the behest of my noble friend Lady Williams of Crosby, ably backed by the noble Baroness, Lady Park. It was right that that was done at that time. But I am not sure that setting it in stone, as the noble Baroness advocates, is the right solution and I shall explain why.

</p>

<a name="40706-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>Certainly, there are Zimbabweans going through the system and coming out at the other end whom one considers should have received asylum and did not, when by all accounts they had extremely good reasons for fearing persecution. The noble Baroness has mentioned some of the examples about which we all know and which have come to us via the medical foundation and so on. On the Friday before last I met one such person at a book launch of Andrew Meldrum&#039;s autobiographical account of the situation in Zimbabwe. He was a recognised member of the MDC, who had played a prominent part in its activities and yet somehow the asylum system had failed him.
</p>

<a name="40706-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>The Zimbabweans are the only nationality to whom this peculiar rule applies. When they reach the end of the process they are not forced to return, but they are encouraged to do so, as the noble Baroness has explained, at the expense of the IOM. We have ceased to have blanket suspensions for removals to particular countries. The noble Baroness mentioned Iraq which is one of the countries to which we are now returning <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_688"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 688</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

people, as are Somalia and Afghanistan. Although the conditions in Zimbabwe may be very dreadful, as I am sure they are for anyone who is in the least bit unpopular with the regime, and although matters may be getting worse, I am not at all sure that they are so uniquely dreadful that one would put Zimbabwean failed asylum seekers in a different category from those who come from Somalia, Afghanistan or Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40706-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>In correspondence with Home Office Ministers I have suggested that we take a more distinguishing approach to those who have been through the system. As the noble Baroness is aware, quite a few came as a result of the provision of false documentation and criminal activities by a certain organisation in Birmingham, which I understand is now under investigation by the police. It would be useful if the Minister could say something about the progress being made in trying to stamp out that organisation and dealing with the tens or hundreds of people&#151;I do not know how many&#151;who managed to get through the system as a result of those criminal activities. At the same time, I would be warmly in favour of reviewing the failures of some people who, on every possible ground, we believe should have received asylum and who are fully supported by the MDC, by the Zimbabwe Association and by other organisations that can vouch for them as bone fide refugees who suffered at the hands of Mugabe.
</p>

<a name="40706-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>I hope that the Minister, while not necessarily being able to accept the amendment as proposed by the noble Baroness&#151;I am sure she would not press it to a Division&#151;may be able to say something about a more discriminating approach to the Zimbabweans. Although the noble Baroness says that the numbers are not very large, I worked out that from the beginning of 2002 onwards there might have been a couple of thousand people who had been all the way through the system and had come out the other end but were living on thin air because they were not supported by NASS or in any other way. Only a handful of those had accepted the assistance of IOM to go back to Zimbabwe&#151;I think it was 47 in 2003. We cannot just let a couple of thousand people rot. Many of them, as the noble Baroness, Lady Park, has said, would have a useful contribution to make in our own society as doctors and so on.
<a name="time_10"></a>
<a name="40706-10_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40706-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>I appeal to the Minister to treat Zimbabweans in a special way in one sense: to allow them to have a review where there is solid evidence to show that a mistake was made. That is either because, as the noble Baroness said, they did not have good representation, or because there was very inadequate country information at one time. But we should not have a blanket policy of not repatriating anybody to Zimbabwe, because we know there are many people here who we do not want and who are not legitimate refugees but who obtained their status by false pretences.
</p>




<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="40706-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I say at the outset, by way of a conditional apology, that I do not have any <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_689"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 689</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

information about the current police enquiries. I suspect, however, that if I did, it would be quite inappropriate to set it out on the Floor of the House at the moment because the enquiries are ongoing.

</p>

<a name="40706-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>I do not have any major good news for noble Lords who have raised this issue; I accept this is not the first time that it has been raised. There is, I hope, an acceptance of what I said at an earlier stage: to make sure our language is correct. I think both the noble Baroness, Lady Park, and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, used the term &quot;failed asylum seekers&quot;, but were not referring to the people we are referring to here every time. The effect of the amendment would be that support could not be withdrawn from failed asylum-seeking families under Clause 9, or where they had failed to comply with a removal direction. We discussed the issues involved on Report, and I suspect it was discussed at earlier stages as well. The Government are not currently enforcing the return of failed asylum seekers, other than for people with serious criminal convictions and others whose presence is not conducive to the public good. That is a general statement of policy, which the noble Lord, Lord   Avebury, would agree with: not having a blanket ban.
</p>

<a name="40706-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>We cannot accept the amendment, as we do not believe it is right that families from Zimbabwe should, as a matter of course, continue to receive support indefinitely. As the noble Lord said, the suspension of removals of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe, announced in January 2002&#151;to a large extent in this House, as I had day-to-day responsibility for the matter at the time&#151;was in response to concerns about the then serious deterioration of the situation in Zimbabwe, in the build-up to the presidential election held in March of that year. We did not, at that time, regard it as unsafe to return failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe, but in view of the rapidly changing conditions we considered it would be appropriate not to enforce the returns.

</p>

<a name="40706-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>The Government&#039;s position is as it has been since January 2002: each asylum claim&#151;and, indeed, human rights claims as well&#151;made by a Zimbabwean national will be considered on its individual merits in accordance with our international obligations under the 1951 convention and, of course, the European Convention on Human Rights. Each application is considered against the background of the latest available country information, including that obtained from and through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
</p>

<a name="40706-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>There is no difference between the government departments in the understanding of conditions in Zimbabwe. The Home Office&#039;s Country Information and Policy Unit produces country information materials which are used as the background against which the asylum applications are considered. As I have said, the unit maintains close and regular contact with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and consults it about the country information materials prior to their publication.
</p>

<a name="40706-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>We do, of course, recognise that conditions in Zimbabwe are such that there are individuals who are able to demonstrate a need for international protection. Where they meet the definition of a refugee, under the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_690"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 690</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

1951 UN Convention on Refugees, asylum is granted. There may also be individuals whose circumstances make them particularly vulnerable, and who would engage our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. Where this is the case, these individuals will be granted humanitarian protection or discretionary leave.
</p>

<a name="40706-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>If you come to the end of the line and an application is refused, there is a right of appeal to the independent authorities. Should the claim be refused, and any appeal be unsuccessful, that means that, for that individual, return to Zimbabwe would be safe. That is why we consider it reasonable to expect an individual in that position&#151;where there is no successful claim under asylum or human rights&#151;to leave voluntarily instead of being supported indefinitely at the taxpayers&#039; expense.
</p>

<a name="40706-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>It is worth making a note in respect of the voluntary assisted returns and reintegration programme operated by the International Organisation for Migration. It is open to all failed asylum-seeking families to apply to the International Organization for Migration to take part in this programme, and we would expect families to take up the opportunity to make a return home. People returning under the programme are offered reintegration assistance. An application to the International Organisation for Migration would clearly be a practical way for a family to demonstrate that they were seeking to leave voluntarily. Zimbabwe nationals are in fact leaving in a voluntary manner under this programme. It is not as though people are not returning on a voluntary basis under the agreed programme.
</p>




<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="40706-10_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister say how many are involved? I have a figure from the IOM of 47   people who had accepted their assistance throughout 2003. Have there been any more since the beginning of 2004?
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040706/text/40706-11.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="40706-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I shall get the latest figure. I am not making a point about the numbers. The point is that it is happening. I merely have a figure for the number of applications for refugee status. In terms of those leaving, if there is an up-to-date figure for the current year, I shall get it. If I cannot obtain it before I sit down, I shall give it in a later debate.
</p>

<a name="40706-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>We already promote the assisted returns programme through a variety of means, and have discussions with non-governmental organisations such as the Refugee Council and the International Organisation for Migration. Information is available at reporting centres and in letters sent at various stages of the asylum process. Our view remains that, although it would be safe for failed asylum seekers to return voluntarily to Zimbabwe, in the wider context of the Government&#039;s position on Zimbabwe it would be inappropriate to return them forcibly at this time.
</p>

<a name="40706-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>We will, of course, assess every case on its individual merits before a decision is made to withdraw support. I emphasise that the Secretary of State will not certify under Clause 9, except where a family is failing to take reasonable steps to leave the UK or place itself in a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_691"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 691</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

position where it can do so, and has no reasonable excuse for its failure to do so. That is the current position on Zimbabwe. That is not a Home Office position, or a Foreign Office position. It is the Government position. The departments do not disagree with the policy I have enunciated in answer to this amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="40706-11_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </b>   My Lords, I have listened carefully to the Minister. I find it extraordinarily difficult to understand how it can be right to consign people who have made an assessment for themselves that it would be dangerous to return&#151;an assessment which would be supported by many people&#151;to destitution.
</p>

<a name="40706-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>I would have liked to hear more about the possibility raised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, of the Secretary of State being prepared to consult, or receive advice and recommendations from, skilful and well informed people, who would perhaps be able to make the case better when it has been badly made, as many of them have done in the past. All I am asking is for the Secretary of State to use his powers. As I feel very strongly about it, I wish to test the opinion of the House.

<a name="40706-11_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Avebury </b>   moved Amendment No. 6:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>Page 11, line 16, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_4"></a><br>
&quot;(6)   The Secretary of State shall, before the commencement of this section, and thereafter from time to time as he may decide is necessary, publish detailed guidance on how the provision of this section should be implemented.

<br>
(7)   Guidance published under subsection (6) shall not be made unless a draft of a statutory instrument containing the guidance has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_109"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, if the Government will not agree to leave out Clause 9, the very least there should be is guidance on its implementation, so that the manner in which the removal of support from families when they refuse to comply with removal directions is clearly set out in accordance with the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. In <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_693"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 693</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Schedule 3 to that Act, paragraph 2(1) provides that support shall not be withheld nor withdrawn from children, and paragraph 2(3)(a) provides that the schedule does not prevent the exercise of a power or the performance of a duty to the extent that this is necessary to avoid a breach of a person&#039;s rights under the ECHR or European Community law.
</p>

<a name="40706-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>We are not happy to rely on vague ministerial assurances to ensure that there are proper safeguards here to prevent breaches of Article 3 of the ECHR. Our amendment provides that the section does not commence until this guidance is published and understood by those involved in its implementation, but that is very much a second best.
</p>

<a name="40706-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>We would urge the Government to think again about Clause 9 as a whole, which we have argued all along is inconsistent with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Children Act 1989 and the Children (Scotland) Act 1995. The Government have failed to explain how the clause is to be operated in a way that is compatible with either of those Acts, or the new provisions in the Children Bill to ensure that children are safeguarded and their welfare promoted. The amendment would ensure that the best interests of children are protected and promoted so that they do not face destitution or separation from their families.
</p>

<a name="40706-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>In the Home Affairs Select Committee in another place the then Minister, Beverley Hughes, highlighted the contradiction between Home Office policy in this area and the Children Act 1989 by stating, in relation to the separation of families:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;I hope it will not come to that, and I do not intend [that] it should come to that . . .  I do not think that it is in the best interest of those children, and I hope it would not come to that in any individual circumstance at all&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40706-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>The Government have yet to explain how that hope could be made a reality. They cannot rely on the co-operation of those affected, and when all else has failed, local authorities will have no choice but to separate children from families, because the Government have made them destitute. At the Report stage, in response to questions about how local authorities would be expected to undertake their duties in respect of children, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;They can use Section 17 . . .  but only to support the child, and not the family as a whole. They can . . .  use Section 20 of the Children Act. So options might include . . .  being looked after by a family friend or relative, or the use of foster arrangements. We want to continue the dialogue with the Local Government Association on the workability issues arising from [this] legislation, and we will consider how best guidance could be given to local authorities&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 18/5/04; col. 701.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40706-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>Sections 17 and 20 both rely on the co-operation of parents in agreeing to voluntary separate accommodation of the child. Under both sections, the welfare of the child must be the paramount consideration. Section 17 provides that local authorities must promote the upbringing of the child within the family wherever that is consistent with the child&#039;s safeguarding and welfare. The law in this area recognises the critical importance of the family and parental attachment in children&#039;s welfare and development and provides that children be separated from their parents <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_694"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 694</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

only when being with them is more harmful than not. It was never envisaged at the time Section 17 was drafted that the family might have become destitute as a result of the Government cutting off support so as to coerce them into leaving the country when their asylum appeal rights had been exhausted.
</p>

<a name="40706-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>The Government have relied on the safeguards in Schedule 3 to defend Clause 9, yet in the chaos that ensued in the eastern European accession states cases, NASS ignored the existence of those safeguards, despite the fact that the date was set months in advance. NASS did not assess individual cases and that resulted in many   legal challenges, so that the High Court had to ask it to stay evictions to prevent its being overwhelmed by applications for relief. The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, confirmed in Committee that NASS is to undertake individual assessments retrospectively, and that experience gives us no confidence that, for these provisions, an assessment will be made in advance sufficient to ensure that no breach of our ECHR obligations arises.
</p>

<a name="40706-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>Similarly, the Government have been challenged recently on their policy of refusing support to asylum applicants under Section 55 of the 2002 Act, and have been forced to revise that policy. As a result of the Court of Appeal judgment in the case of Limbuela and others, when it was found that the Home Office had acted unlawfully in refusing accommodation to homeless asylum seekers, the Government have been forced to produce new policy guidance on the implementation of Section 55, to ensure that further breaches of human rights are avoided, and that the courts are no longer the first point of proper decision making on a time consuming and expensive case-by-case basis.
</p>

<a name="40706-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>We noted the resistance of the noble Lord, Lord   Bassam, to the comparison between what happened in those cases and what may now happen in the cases involving people affected by Clause 9, but the implementation of Clause 9 will create a procedure that is even less clear, more complex and ultimately more costly. The test under Clause 9, to establish whether families,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;failed without reasonable excuse to take reasonable steps . . .  to leave the United Kingdom voluntarily&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40706-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>is going to be more difficult to apply than the Section 55 test of whether a person claimed asylum,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;as soon as reasonably practicable&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>which has resulted in so much litigation. We could see no grounds for confidence that the doubts here also may not have to be resolved in the High Court unless there is greater clarity, and we remain apprehensive about the risks to children and that the courts and the local authorities will be left to pick up the pieces.
</p>

<a name="40706-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>We also registered the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, that our amendment giving practical effect to the safeguards in Schedule 3, by ensuring an individual assessment of need before support is withdrawn, was unnecessary because that assessment would be made when the family is interviewed and they have an opportunity to explain why they have not left the country voluntarily and what steps they were <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_695"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 695</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

taking to do so. He said that was precisely what the amendment sought to do, but he must have realised that it was nothing of the kind. That interview would be concerned with persuading the parents to comply with the requirement to leave the country and would be conducted by immigration officers who would have no professional competence to evaluate the situation of the children in the event of their parents&#039; non-compliance.
</p>

<a name="40706-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>Previously, at the Committee stage, in rejecting our amendment to ensure that social workers would not be required to operate outside of their duties under the Children Act 1989, the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;All I can do is create a framework where the effect of what we anticipate is managed in a way that we hope will not inure to the disadvantage of the families&#151;and they will include children&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 5/4/04; col. 1699.]


</p>
</ul>
<a name="40706-11_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>In other words, the clause relies on hope that it will not result in breaches of the Children Act. This is our third   attempt to save the Government from the consequences of leaving such an important matter to chance. Without the safeguards that we propose, Clause 9 is a recipe for chaos, confusion and litigation. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="40706-12_spnew0"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </b>   My Lords, I should like to speak to the amendments which are tabled in my name as well. Amendment No. 6 is second-best, while Amendment No. 7 is what we really want. I am sorry to have missed debates on this matter at previous stages of the Bill, but I have followed them with keen interest, and I promise that I will be brief.
</p>

<a name="40706-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>I have frankly been disappointed that at every stage the Government have not seen fit to accept any amendments to the clause that would have provided increased protection for children. I remind your Lordships that at all stages the aim of those who oppose this clause has been to ensure that children are best protected and that their best interests are safeguarded.
</p>

<a name="40706-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>The clause is not about voluntary departure. It envisages the separation of children from their families. That, it seems to me, is fundamentally wrong, a view shared by my colleagues on these Benches. It is something of an irony that, in the context of the Government bringing forward the Children Bill, this loophole is not closed.

</p>

<a name="40706-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>I accept the Government&#039;s aspirations that people will decide to co-operate voluntarily with removal. At all stages of the Bill, Ministers have sought to assure this House and another place that it is their hope that people will co-operate. Ministers have argued that if they do not, parents will be putting their children at risk by their actions. But it simply cannot be acceptable for this House to pass legislation on the basis only of a leap of faith, in the hope that its worst effects will not be felt by children. It is not acceptable for the Government to argue that if children are affected, the fault lies with the parents. The Government, in my view, must take responsibility for their inadequate legislation.

</p>

<a name="40706-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>In addressing your Lordships, I am grateful to the Children&#039;s Society and the Refugee Children&#039;s Consortium for their continued lobbying on this clause and their commitment to the rights and needs of refugee children. I hope very much that the Minister will be able to provide some further information and assurances that will help to allay some of their fears. If not, and were the opinion of the House to be tested, I fear that I would vote against the clause and invite other noble Lords to do the same.
</p>




<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="40706-12_spnew1"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   My Lords, I support both amendments, Amendment No. 7 being particularly desirable. I should like the Minister to say more about the consultation prior to the implementation of the clause&#151;if it is implemented&#151;on 1 September. I declare an interest as a member, several years ago, of a sponsored visit to Angola by UNICEF to examine the course of the journey of the refugee child. I should also like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister to convey my thanks to his colleague, the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal, for her meeting with me in the past, her correspondence, the meetings she has arranged between officials and the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture and the Refugee Children&#039;s Consortium. They have been very helpful indeed.
</p>

<a name="40706-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>A specific concern has been expressed by the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture that vulnerable families would be caught by these provisions. A reassurance that there will be thorough consultation would be very helpful.
</p>

<a name="40706-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>The timing of the clause seems very strange. Given what the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said earlier, it is admirable that there has been such a reduction in the number of applications for asylum. In a period of months, 80 per cent of asylum claims are processed within two months. That is a grand achievement on the part of the Government. Twice as many failed asylum claimants are now returned to their home country. Good progress is clearly being made. So is this the right time to introduce such a draconian measure, because draconian it certainly is? The clause envisages a situation in which children and families will be put into the street. The Government have made it quite clear that they are also prepared to accept children being taken into care as a result of the clause. This is a very serious matter for these families.
</p>

<a name="40706-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>We still do not know how many children are likely to be affected by this. Any further clarification about the numbers involved would be very welcome.
</p>

<a name="40706-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>I emphasise again that it would be so helpful to have from the Minister some reassurance that there will be thorough consultation before the implementation of the clause, if it is to be implemented. It has been made   very clear in discussions on the Bill that the consultation prior to its being brought before Parliament was not adequate. One understands this&#151;the Home Office has very serious responsibilities. It is often the case with Home Office Bills that there has not been the time to consult properly.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40706-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>When we are dealing with children and families, no matter how irresponsible the parents may be, we have a special duty to consult and think very carefully about what guidance and regulations will determine the behaviour of immigration officers. I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response.
</p>




<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="40706-12_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, let me make it clear, for the avoidance of doubt&#151;as people do take account of our debates in this place&#151;that Clause 9 is headed:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;Failed asylum seekers: withdrawal of support&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>The people we are talking about are failed asylum seekers. They have been through the whole process and have no other avenue open to them because their claim has failed. They have no right to remain in the country, at the taxpayers&#039; expense. That is what we are dealing with, although it does not always appear like that when we use the necessary shorthand in our speeches dealing with individual cases.
</p>

<a name="40706-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>I should like to answer a point raised by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth. He said that he had not been present at the debates but he had followed all the proceedings in detail. Well, he got one thing wrong. The Government have listened on this issue. We amended the Bill&#151;in the Commons, true&#151;to introduce a right of appeal to the asylum support adjudicator. It may have been a fault that the Bill was introduced without the right of appeal, and putting it in was the right thing to do. I want to make that point, because otherwise the folklore gets out that the Government have not been listening, are ramming it through Parliament and are not worried about children.
</p>

<a name="40706-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>The consequence would be an invitation for the very irresponsible parents to whom the noble Earl referred to run this country&#039;s immigration policy. That is what the implication is, if we do nothing about the situation. The noble Earl would not say that, and I would not   expect him to. But the consequence is that notwithstanding the irresponsibility of the parents, we have to look after the children. We would be saying to those irresponsible parents, &quot;You run the country&#039;s immigration policy. If you have failed in your asylum case and you decide not to co-operate and not to return voluntarily, it does not matter. Because of the overwhelming needs of the children, whom you are using as a shield, you can stay for ever and the British taxpayer will pay for you&quot;. That is simply not acceptable.
</p>

<a name="40706-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>This is not an issue that has popped up out of nowhere. I realise that the Government never consult enough&#151;I accept that and apologise for it. They do not introduce all the draft Bills that they should. However, the clause did not appear on a whim of the Home Secretary early this year or late last year, when the Bill was introduced. It is not as though such issues had not been discussed; we looked at the evidence and tried desperately to make a reasoned, proportionate response to the issues that arose at the time, and are with us now&#151;to a lesser extent, I accept. But it is no reason to withdraw the clause and take away the idea <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_698"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 698</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

just because the numbers have gone down. They have done so partly as a result of the series of issues to which the noble Lord, Lord McNally, referred earlier.
</p>

<a name="40706-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>There are two issues involved: first, the prospect of ameliorating the clause through guidance; and, secondly, the proposal to leave the clause out, which is a matter of some principle that I know has been debated previously in the House. I assure noble Lords that detailed guidance will of course be published, but it will not be issued in the form of a statutory instrument of secondary legislation. That would not be the normal process in any event, although I realise that that is one way of securing a debate in this place.
</p>

<a name="40706-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>It is common practice for guidance of that nature to be placed on the website of the Immigration and Nationality Department. We will update the guidance as procedures develop and further issues arise. In that way, we can make sure that the procedures used are transparent. Therefore, we cannot accept the use of secondary legislation as proposed by the amendment, but there will certainly be guidance.

</p>

<a name="40706-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>It would be helpful if I indicated the type of information that would be included in such guidance. It will make clear, for example, that any decision to certify needs to be copied to the family&#039;s representative, if it has one, in line with the undertaking given during the passage of the Bill. It will make clear also that, if support is withdrawn, the local authority will be informed at that time. The guidance will also advise staff about the particular information they will need to ascertain where the family attends an interview. It will set out how staff can assess whether the family has taken reasonable steps or whether it has a reasonable excuse for not having done so.
</p>

<a name="40706-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and others have expressed concern that there may not be an adequate assessment of whether a withdrawal of support would breach the European Convention on Human Rights. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said much the same thing. We do not accept that. The individual circumstances will be assessed in each case. The guidance will set out the need to examine relevant information put   forward by the family about their individual circumstances. That may include, for example, the age of the children and whether there are any special needs in particular cases. Of course, we are willing to receive comments at any time if there are particular concerns and we will assess whether those need to be reflected in the guidance that we issue.
</p>

<a name="40706-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>There has been considerable discussion about Clause 9. I realise that&#151;to put it mildly&#151;it is a highly sensitive issue. It has caused ferocious debate in both Houses. It is an issue on which we have had to take a difficult decision. That is why I said earlier that the clause was not produced on a whim over the course of a weekend. I recall the issue being discussed in the Home Office when I was a Minister there.
</p>

<a name="40706-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>Since the issue was discussed on Report, we have listened carefully to the concerns that have been put to us by the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture and representatives from the Refugee Children&#039;s Consortium. We are very grateful for the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_699"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 699</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

constructive approach that has been taken&#151;notwithstanding the fundamental difference of opinion. There is no sense in trying to sugar-coat the issue.
</p>

<a name="40706-12_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>The clause is not designed to make families destitute. That is not our aim. The clause was never designed to take children into care and to split families. That was never its aim, whatever the original propaganda may have stated. However, we are making it clear that families affected by the clause do not have the option of remaining in the United Kingdom permanently. We have to make that clear, not hint at it by giving families the option of using the children as a shield and sending the wrong signals. That does not help them in any way whatever. We have to make it clear that their appeal against the asylum decision has been rejected. We are not talking about asylum seekers or refugees; we are talking about people who have made a claim for asylum and failed. We have to use that language and not pussy-foot around. Otherwise, we will send the wrong information and the wrong signals to those who are asylum seekers and those whose appeals have succeeded and who have become refugees because their status is different. We have to be absolutely clear about the status of the people to whom Clause 9 refers.

<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="40706-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, the Minister is no doubt trying to be helpful, but will he explain why it is that if a family whose application has failed is not willing to return voluntarily, the Government do not remove that family? Instead, they seem to prefer to leave such families here to starve and possibly to suffer separation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="40706-13_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I shall come to that question as I go through my notes. Without pussy-footing around, I want to make absolutely clear the status of the families that we are talking about. We know that forcibly removing families with children is extremely distressing. However, the question we must answer is whether, if nothing is done, the family should be entitled to indefinite support from the taxpayer regardless of its behaviour. That is the implication.
</p>

<a name="40706-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>We must face up to the reality of those families&#039; position in the country. They are in the country illegally and will not be given permission to stay. Whatever hints may be given, that is the position. They are here illegally and will not be given permission to stay because they have gone through the appeal process. It is not in the children&#039;s best interests to remain for long periods in a country where they have no prospect of being allowed to stay permanently. It is quite wrong for the children to be used as a shield for a family that is behaving irresponsibly in taking no steps to leave or that has no reasonable grounds&#151;that is, the caveats in the legislation&#151;for not taking any steps.
</p>

<a name="40706-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>It may be that we do not agree that families should be encouraged to leave voluntarily, but I hope that we would all agree that in those circumstances, with no prospect of a permanent stay and all appeal rights <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_700"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 700</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

exhausted, that the families should be encouraged to leave the country voluntarily. If they are not, people are selling them a false prospectus. The detailed process, which includes the opportunity for interview and warning letters, makes it clear that that is what we want to achieve&#151;that is, a voluntary leaving of the country&#151;but we do not accept that it is enough simply to leave it at that.
</p>

<a name="40706-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>I do not need to emphasise again that we cannot physically remove a family without the appropriate travel documentation, which is why the clause is so important. If we are dealing with families which do not have the appropriate travel documentation and which want to remain here, the obvious question the family will ask is: &quot;Why should we co-operate with removal, because if we don&#039;t, we can&#039;t be removed and we will be able to stay here, receiving cash and accommodation, indefinitely?&quot; That is bound to be a question at the back of someone&#039;s mind. If it was not in the mind of the families, it would be in the mind of their advisers.

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>Therefore, at some point, we have to draw a line and say, &quot;The process is finished. Some action needs to be taken&quot;. People have to understand that they cannot just ignore our immigration and asylum laws&#151;that is what is happening in these circumstances&#151;and simply expect the British public to pay for them regardless. That is what has been happening and that is what we want to avoid.
</p>

<a name="40706-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>Unless we address these issues, they undermine our efforts to develop better integration packages, which the Government, refugee organisations and other political parties have to sell. They undermine our ability to say why we have a humane immigration policy and why our door is open to genuine refugees. It is much more difficult to do that if the public see another door open at the side where the rules are not followed. That is the consequence of doing nothing. If we do not address these issues, they will undermine our   policies for managed migration and undermine taxpayers&#039; acceptance that we need to help many thousands of people, which we do gladly. However, we are not prepared to see the perception of the system undermined by people who simply flout the rules in a systematic fashion.

</p>

<a name="40706-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>The House is fully aware that we do not want to make families destitute&#151;far from it&#151;and we do not want children to be taken into care by local authorities. We will not certify under Clause 9 where the family is co-operating. Where it is co-operating or where it has reasonable grounds not to co-operate and take steps to move, we will not certify. We want people to return home when they have no basis of stay in the United Kingdom and when their legal position is such that they have no prospect of permanently remaining here. However, that will not work unless there is an end point. Amendment No. 7 would remove that possibility and that is why we cannot accept it. As I said, there will be fundamental differences of opinion in this respect. On the issue of consultation, I should say that I am unfamiliar with the date the noble Earl referred to. There is no agreed date for implementation of this provision, whatever he may have heard. I am not in a position to elaborate on that.

We meet the Local Government Association on a regular ongoing basis. I suspect my department has contact with the association every day and will continue to do so. I agree that my explanation will not satisfy people with a point of principle, but I hope that I have spelled it out in not unsympathetic terms. If you are over sympathetic, you send the wrong signals. We are dealing with people who are being unreasonable&#151;because if they are reasonable no action will be taken. They have failed, they have no prospect of permanent stay in this country whatever. We do not want to make them destitute. It is not a policy objective to separate families from their children.

I have used every trick in the book to exploit the rules and your inefficiency&quot;&#151;which is what it was. There were rooms full of hundreds of unopened mailbags; the system was in total chaos. In the end, it did not help my constituents because they were always in doubt, never having a decision, never knowing whether they could put their roots down and so on. So I fully accept that comment. I am not saying that my experience or my principles are any greater than anybody else&#039;s&#151;far from it.

</p>




<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="40706-13_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness has not rendered the House any wiser about whether she would have supported us if we had pressed this to a Division. We would only have done that if there had been some chance of defeating the Government on the principle of this clause. Despite the fact that the Minister may say he has not considered this matter solely over the weekend but has been at it for months and months, he has still not explained to us how this clause will be implemented.
</p>

<a name="40706-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>He keeps on saying that we are talking about people who have failed all the way through the system. He may be right about the parents, but he is not right about the children. It is not their fault that the parents have not had an adequate claim to asylum. It is not their fault that the parents have been&#151;as he would put it&#151;irresponsible enough to fail to comply with the arrangements for their voluntary departure&#151;but it is difficult to make my speech when there is another one going on just under my nose. It is not the children&#039;s fault that the parents have put them in this position. We are concerned not with the irresponsible parents, but with what happens at the end of the day when the parents have refused to comply with all the injunctions to leave the country voluntarily and to pay attention to the notices which the Minister said will be served upon them, explaining the consequences of their failure.
</p>

<a name="40706-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>I want to know whether the Minister will ultimately take the children into his care. What will the instructions be? We have not seen the guidance, but if he has been at it for all these months then why could we not have seen a draft? Why does not the veil which he lifted to a very slight extent today reveal the substance of the matter? He said only that the detailed guidance would contain instructions on whether the families have taken steps to comply with the need to examine relevant information, but not what happens to the children when that process has reached an end.
</p>

<a name="40706-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>The Minister has not said today how many meetings have been held with the LGA. It is no good telling us that he meets them almost every day. What we want to know is how many discussions have been held on this specific issue, and whether the LGA is satisfied with the instructions it will be given on how to comply with the ECHR, the Children Act and so forth while at the same time support is removed from these families. He has not given a clear process for how potential breaches of Articles 3 and 8 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child will be assessed. He has not told us what involvement there will be from independent experts in assessing the facilities available to the children in the final circumstances, nor about arrangements for the care and welfare of the children to be made prior to the withdrawal of support.

<a name="40706-14_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Sandwich </b>   moved Amendment No. 8:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>After Clause 9, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_5"></a><br>
   &quot;REPEAL OF SECTION 55 OF THE NATIONALITY, IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM ACT 2002

<br>
   Section 55 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act   2002 (c. 41) (late claim for asylum: refusal of support) shall cease to have effect.&quot; </p>



<p><a name="st_121"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I speak to Amendment No. 8 which inserts a new clause. I introduced this amendment in Committee. I did not bring it back on Report in the hope that it would encourage the Home Office to look again at the unfair effects of Section 55 of the 2002 Act on genuine asylum seekers who become destitute when they are unable to make claims &quot;as soon as reasonably practicable&quot; or in any case within three days of arrival.
</p>

<a name="40706-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>Many people, in and outside Parliament, now accept that this clause is a thorn inserted into asylum legislation without proper scrutiny, that it sits uneasily with the European convention, that it lacks credibility as a deterrent, and that it should be removed from the Bill as soon as possible.
</p>

<a name="40706-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>The Court of Appeal judges in the case of <i>Limbuela</i> et al on 21 May&#151;mentioned already by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury&#151;had these points in mind when they upheld a High Court decision in favour of three asylum seekers who had been denied support under Section 55. The majority opinion was that the Secretary of State could deny support only if he,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;has in place realistic arrangements for meeting his responsibilities under the Convention&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>This decision has prompted a welcome, but only provisional, change of policy. That is now visible in the way that NASS interprets the human rights duty under Section 55(5). The latest guidance, which I have in my   hand&#151;a 39-page document&#151;produced only on 25   June, states that NASS must provide support,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;unless it is positively satisfied that the individual does have some alternative source(s) of support available to him/her . . .  Failure by NASS to provide support where no other source of support is available may lead to a breach of the applicant&#039;s rights under Article 3&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>of the ECHR. That is a quote from paragraph 6.2 of the IND policy bulletin 75.
<a name="time_15"></a>
<a name="40706-14_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40706-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>Alternative support is not always there. Local communities, assisted by churches and voluntary agencies, do a remarkable service to the public in looking after destitute people, including asylum seekers. I have no doubt that the Home Office would like that to continue, especially when local authorities are cutting services. I hear that there are threats of those services being cut in cities such as Leicester.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_704"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 704</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40706-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>Research by the Greater London Authority shows that despite the efforts of local communities, which we all applaud, 29 per cent of people denied support under Section 55 in London last November had to sleep rough. That was a rise of more than half on the previous recorded tally of rough sleepers in London. Furthermore, we know that something like half&#151;a disproportionate number&#151;of those rough sleepers are women. Incidentally, it was unfortunate that in Committee the Home Office brief said that the Greater London Authority&#039;s research was based on a very limited sample. In fact, its survey covered 1,999 people in total, of whom 14 per cent, or 283 people, were asylum seekers reporting that they had been denied support under Section 55.
</p>

<a name="40706-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>Under the revised NASS rules, we can assume and hope that only a small number will now be left destitute. The Minister may very well say that we should stop worrying about them. That in itself suggests that the whole purpose of Section 55 has now been undermined and that the Government should recognise that by simply removing the clause. However, we shall have to wait to see what the Minister says now and what the effects of the new guidance will be between now and the Government&#039;s further appeal against the decision. It will not look good on the record if policy is shown to be inconsistent as well as discriminatory.
</p>

<a name="40706-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>Finally, I remind the House of three further points,   in the unfortunate absence of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, whom we all wish were here today. These are points that arose in Committee. First, I am grateful to the Home Office for confirming through a Written Answer to my Question HL 2729 that a claim made after three days is no less genuine than one made on arrival. I do not personally like to use the word &quot;late&quot; because it carries a stigma. That Answer shows to me how arbitrary Section 55 is, although the provision for three days is often described as a concession.
</p>

<a name="40706-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>Secondly, I am reassured by another government Answer to my Question HL 2728, showing that it is impossible to prove statistically that Section 55 of itself has caused a reduction in applications for asylum. That surely weakens the case for Section 55 as an effective deterrent.
</p>

<a name="40706-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>Thirdly, Section 55 escaped parliamentary scrutiny from the outset. I am sure that the Minister knows that it was never even debated in another place, despite the efforts of his honourable friend Mr Neil Gerrard. The   section is still capable of wide interpretation by the Government, even if we leave it alone, through the various non-statutory methods which are open to it. That is why so many people are opposed to the section, are concerned about its use in future and would like it to be repealed. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="40706-14_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   My Lords, I rise briefly to support the noble Earl, and to thank him for his good wishes to my noble friend Lord Russell, which we will pass on.
</p>

<a name="40706-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>In the end, the noble Earl&#039;s analysis is right. As it now applies, the measure is neither a deterrent to asylum application or a saving of public money. What <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_705"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 705</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is left is something that the Minister referred to earlier. It is part of the package of gesture politics that the Government have assembled, although whether it is intended to deter asylum seekers or to appease the <i>Daily Mail</i>, no one is ever quite sure. Whatever it is intended to do, the clause would contain a particularly mean-minded piece of legislation if we were to let it go through. We support the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="40706-14_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I shall speak very briefly, as I have spoken on this matter before and I am sure that noble Lords will remember each and every wonderful syllable that I uttered. It is absolutely right that the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, should introduce this amendment today, because of the timing and the Court of Appeal case. It is right to give the Government the opportunity to make further comment on the opposition to the clause. I appreciate that the Minister may have some difficulties of a procedural nature if the matter is going to appeal, so I do not know how much he will be able to assist us today. However, this was the right parliamentary opportunity for the noble Earl to seize.
</p>

<a name="40706-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>I have told the noble Earl in the past week that I am not able to support his amendment as such. We on these Benches have in the past made it clear that we believe that the policy objective should be achieved, provided that that happens within the legal system. We are concerned to see what has happened in the Court of Appeal. Obviously, we now look forward to seeing a resolution of that question, and would naturally accept whatever the Higher Appellate jurisdiction decides.

<a name="40706-14_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, I support my noble friend&#039;s amendment. Of course we all understand that the Government want people to apply for refugee status when they arrive or, if they cannot do that, within three days. But surely the Government could go a little further than that; surely they could say that cases with merit will be considered, especially if there is some reason for the individual person delaying his application. There should be some little let-out of that kind, should there not?
</p>




<p><a name="st_126"></a>
<a name="40706-14_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, as my noble friend Lord   Russell has been mentioned, I draw attention to the fact that he moved an amendment on the clause in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill on 24 October 2002. The matter was taken up by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which in its 23rd report of Session 2001&#150;02, HL paper 176, concluded that there was a significant risk that the new clause would lead to a violation of Article 11.1 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. There was a threat of violation of Articles 3 and/or 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
</p>

<a name="40706-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>It is worth reminding ourselves of that exchange in October 2002, because we frequently refer to the JCHR. There are always good reasons why the <br>&nbsp;<br>

Minister of the day rejects its findings, but it is our watchdog in the matter of human rights. We should pay a little more attention to what it says, otherwise there will be more cases in which the Government have to answer to the Court of Appeal, like the one that we are discussing at the moment. If we had paid attention to my noble friend Lord Russell and to the JCHR then, we would not be faced with the difficulties that the Government have encountered with Section 55 in the Court of Appeal.

<a name="40706-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, before I start, I reiterate not only on my own behalf but on behalf of others as well that we hope to see the noble Earl, Lord Russell, back in his place as soon as possible.
</p>

<a name="40706-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>I know this is totally out of order, but in this place there are no rules, so you can get away with it. Regarding the earlier debate we had on Zimbabwe, unfortunately we do not collect information on the voluntary returns on a country-specific basis, but I have asked officials to see whether they can obtain a figure from the International Organisation for Migration, and I will naturally follow that up in writing for noble Lords who have been present today.
</p>

<a name="40706-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>Read literally, the noble Lord, Lord McNally, was including me in his term &quot;gesture politics&quot;. First, the package is not gesture politics and, secondly, I assure him that I would have no part in sucking up to the ragbag people who run the <i>Daily Mail</i>. Sincerity is a zero sum on this issue. We cannot prove that any part of the changes in the Immigration Rules and procedures in the past few years has been the only or key part, but we know the total effect of the changes of the package of which Section 55 is a part has been a halving in the number of asylum claims since the autumn of 2002. Therefore, while we cannot be precise about the individual components, we see no justification for disturbing the package that has been put together. We cannot be absolutely certain that the signals sent back down the supply chain of people traffickers on one part of the package are translated to another part of the package to get the right effect. Nevertheless, it is not gesture politics; the package was designed for a purpose. We still claim, and rightly so, that the whole issue is proportional to the situation the country found itself in.
</p>

<a name="40706-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>The central point about Section 55 is that we were not prepared to use taxpayers&#039; money to support people who make speculative asylum claims, or indeed anyone who has some other means of support. I freely admit that not every person who claims asylum also claims financial support, but the number of speculative asylum claims was high. We think Section 55 has been effective in tackling that kind of abuse to send a signal to those who are simply economic migrants: first, that there are other ways and, secondly, that if they use the speculative route they will not be supported at the taxpayer&#039;s expense.
</p>

<a name="40706-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>I am pleased and grateful that the noble Earl has brought these amendments forward. It is the right and proper thing to do. However, I am obviously fairly constrained in what I can say, because this year the Court of Appeal gave its judgment in those three test <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_707"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 707</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

cases concerning the application of Article 3 of the ECHR in cases where support had been refused under Section 55 and dismissed the Government&#039;s appeals in the individual cases. In giving guidance on the issue, the Court of Appeal was divided as to the correct approach, as indeed was the High Court before it. In his minority judgment, Lord Justice Laws points out that the relevant principles in this area are &quot;more than usually elusive&quot;. Clearly, these cases raise issues of general public importance and legal complexity.
</p>

<a name="40706-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The Home Office maintains that Section 55 strikes the right balance between fulfilling our obligations to genuine asylum seekers and protecting the system against abuse. We have therefore sought, and been granted, leave to appeal to the House of Lords against the Court of Appeal judgment of 21 May, although I understand that this will not be heard by the Appellate Committee of your Lordships&#039; House until much later in the year. In the mean time, we have issued new interim policy guidance, to which the noble Lord referred, and we will continue to make decisions in line with the judgment expressed in the Court of Appeal.
</p>

<a name="40706-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>Section 55 is a tough policy. It was designed to be, in order to face a serious issue. The section has been kept under close review since it was introduced, and, where appropriate, has been amended, as demonstrated by the change of approach announced by the Home Secretary on 17 December last year, whereby in general a person who applies within three days of arrival in the UK would be considered to have applied as soon as reasonably practical. Quite why they could not have applied when they reached our shores at the port, heaven only knows, but that is the issue everyone always asks about&#151;&quot;Why not?&quot;. There are good reasons why some people cannot apply immediately, but within three days we think they ought to be able to.

</p>

<a name="40706-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>There are already a number of safeguards built in to protect vulnerable people, and those with care needs continue to be supported by local authorities. Moreover, it is open to anyone who may receive a negative decision under Section 55 to request reconsideration of their case. Emergency accommodation will be provided in what we believe are seriously arguable cases in the small proportion of reconsideration decisions that cannot be made on the same day. Each case is considered on its merits. Where the period is longer than three days, people&#039;s circumstances will be fully taken into account. We fully accept that, in some cases, three days may not be reasonably practicable.
</p>

<a name="40706-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>There is little evidence of a rise in rough sleeping as a result of Section 55. Rough sleeping on the streets of London has been cut by about 70 per cent since the Rough Sleepers Unit&#151;now the Homelessness Directorate of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#151;was set up. A count is taken, but we have no evidence that Section 55 has caused a rise. Both officials and outreach workers are out on the streets on a regular basis, not just on the nights of the counts, and I have spent one night with them&#151;although I cannot really claim that it was a night, as I knocked off just after midnight. I had to be introduced as Jeff, a researcher from Birmingham, because if I had been introduced as the Minister no one would have talked <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_708"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 708</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to me. I did not find any asylum seekers, but that was just one evening for a few hours. The point is that we monitor the situation of rough sleepers because, having achieved a 70 per cent reduction, we want to go the whole hog.
</p>

<a name="40706-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>We accept and freely admit that there were some initial problems with the operation of Section 55, and, where required, we have made changes. The recent Court of Appeal judgment does not alter our view that the policy has been effective or that we have sufficient provisions in place to protect people who are vulnerable. We certainly do not consider that it would be the right to abolish Section 55 altogether, bearing in mind that we have given notice of appeal to the highest court in the land, and that is where it will be decided. In the mean time, we will operate the policy in line with the judgment given down by the Court of Appeal. I hope I have made the position clear. The provision is not totally flexible, but it can be reasonably practicable for the period to be over three days because we judge each case on its merits.

This matter causes a lot of concern outside this House, among voluntary organisations and those working with asylum seekers. I was tempted this morning to press my amendment to a Division, although of course it would be only a protest vote.

<a name="40706-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, these government amendments give me an opportunity to make a special appeal to the noble Lord, Lord Rooker. Would he be so kind as to use his influence in the Home Office on a Northern Ireland matter? What is happening at present is that small numbers of asylum seekers are being imprisoned in Northern Ireland, sometimes for rather long periods. This is something which makes the management of Northern Ireland prisons, which is already extremely difficult, rather more complicated than it need be.
</p>

<a name="40706-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>I suggest to the noble Lord&#151;perhaps he will discuss this with his colleagues both in the Home Office and in the Northern Ireland Office&#151;that there is a fairly simple solution; namely, to commission a housing association in Northern Ireland, of which there is quite a range, to provide accommodation that is semi-secure, under curfew, or under whatever restrictions the Government wish to impose, so that these people can be held in a known place while their cases are considered rather than having them in prison. I hope that that appeals to the noble Lord&#039;s good nature.

I am but their mouthpiece here, but nevertheless it is a matter for which I am answerable as a government spokesman.

&quot;(   )   No such order shall be made unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that the amount of benefits paid to or on behalf of the refugee while his application was under consideration or under appeal was equivalent in total to the amount a person would have received by way of income support and housing benefit for the same period and for accommodation of the same value.&quot;

<p><a name="st_136"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, as the Minister may perhaps have gathered, this amendment is designed to resolve the arguments that we had several times during the course of this Bill, as well as on the asylum support regulations a week ago, on the value of the NASS full support package for asylum seekers waiting for their cases to be decided, and whether or not if it comes to less than they would have received on income support, the Government are in breach of their obligation under Article 23 of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the same treatment with respect to public relief and assistance as is accorded to their nationals&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40706-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>We have said all along that asylum seekers do not get the same treatment as our own citizens, and in 2002 the   Government conceded that the voucher scheme constituted inferior treatment not only because the vouchers could be cashed only in certain shops, but also because, as the then Home Secretary Mr Jack Straw frankly acknowledged that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;the support that we are providing will be equivalent to the 90 per cent. of income support that is otherwise available to asylum seekers&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 16/6/99; col. 472.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>When the vouchers were scrapped in 2002, they were replaced by cash amounting to 70 per cent of income support, and the payment of utility bills and household costs continued, as before. So the value of the total package must have remained at the 90 per cent of income support declared by the then Home Secretary, unless for some unexplained reason the utility and household costs for people on income support had increased from 20 per cent to 30 per cent of their expenditure. That seemed to be the claim of the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, when he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;The calculation has been made that the discount, the 30 per cent&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>that was the first we had ever heard of it&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;is approximate to the value of housing accommodation which is fully furnished and has all the necessary utensils and furniture in place&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 14/3/02; col. 1017.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>But there was never any attempt to justify this astonishing increase from 20 per cent to 30 per cent in a period of less than three years. When the matter came under closer scrutiny on 15 June and again last week, first the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, and then the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, contented themselves with repeating the bare assertion, without giving any of the underlying arithmetic.
</p>

<a name="40706-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>When the Joint Committee on Human Rights examined the matter, it said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;The Government has not provided Parliament with the detailed evidence which demonstrates that the value of the benefits in kind provided to asylum-seekers is equivalent to the value of the back-payments being abolished&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>The Government did not provide any evidence and they still have not done so, though it was not the back payments themselves that were at issue; it was whether the total package was equal to 90 per cent, 100 per cent, or some other percentage of income support.

</p>

<a name="40706-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, has acknowledged at last, in a letter dated 25 June, which I did not receive until the day after the previous debate on this clause, that the package is not worth 100 per cent after all, and that the assertion made on at least three occasions was wrong. The JCHR ought now to consider, in the light of that admission, whether there is a significant risk of a breach of Article 23 of the Refugee Convention or Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights in conjunction with Article 1 Protocol 1. The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, now tells me in this letter that the value of the package is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;on average only 4% lower than income support levels&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>I made it 7 per cent, and I gave the details of the calculation, which the noble Baroness has not done, but whether it is 4 per cent or 7 per cent, asylum seekers are worse off by that amount than British citizens on income support levels.
</p>

<a name="40706-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>Ministers have also stated, incorrectly, that putting asylum seekers on level terms with those on income support means that they should not be eligible for payments other than bare NASS support. The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, did not respond when I pointed out last Tuesday that people on income support have access to other discretionary payments which are not available to asylum seekers.
</p>

<a name="40706-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, in this letter, acknowledges that UNHCR has been critical of the Government&#039;s proposals in Clause 12, but she now advances a novel interpretation of the convention, which she has not discussed with the UNHCR, which is under international law the guardian and interpreter of the convention. She has not discussed it with the JCHR either, and its conclusions on Clause 11 were based on the assumption that the Government&#039;s previous statements about the arithmetic of their proposal were correct. The noble Baroness now says that short-changing asylum seekers by 4 per cent is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;sufficient to meet the requirements of the Refugee Convention&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>I have taken advice on this, and, as I hope the noble Lord will be aware, the UNHCR has explicitly contradicted the noble Baroness&#039;s assertion&#151;a very unusual, if not unprecedented, occurrence. In its letter to me of 2 July it says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;UNHCR does not consider that provisions which have &#039;broadly the same material effect&#039; are sufficient to meet the standards required by the 1951 Convention . . .  UNHCR considers &#039;same treatment&#039; in Article 23 to mean exactly equal material benefits. This accords with the common usage of the word &#039;same&#039; as defined in the Oxford English Dictionary. Equal treatment is fundamental to the spirit of the 1951 Convention, and there can be no degrees of equality&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>Clause 12 puts asylum seekers in a benefits regime inferior to that required by Article 23 of the convention, and the Government must not deliberately enact a measure which makes the UK non-compliant with an important requirement of international law. This would be especially heinous, considering that we are members of the executive committee of the UNHCR, with a responsibility to set an example in upholding the standards set by the convention.

<p><a name="st_137"></a>
<a name="40706-17_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, there was one phrase used by the noble Lord which I wish he had not used. My response to it is this. The British taxpayer is forking out over &#163;1 billion a year for asylum seekers. To say that we are short-changing asylum seekers is just the kind of thing that plays into the hands of those friends at the <i>Daily Mail</i>, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord   McNally&#151;because they will twist it. To say that we are short-changing asylum seekers, when we are spending over &#163;1 billion by way of taxpayers&#039; support, is extravagant language in the extreme and sends out all the wrong signals regarding the policy we are trying to address.
</p>

<a name="40706-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>On the other hand, the noble Lord is right to come back on the issue at Third Reading. I have no complaint about that. However, we are not prepared to accept the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40706-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>In the letter dated 30 June which he wrote to my noble friend Lady Scotland the noble Lord made a number of points, and I am grateful to him for making these known before the debate. He has not yet received a written response from the noble Baroness, and I  do not say that the response is winging its way from the Home Office, but it is being put together. I will now try to answer those points.
</p>

<a name="40706-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>The first point the noble Lord makes is about the arithmetical equivalence or otherwise of the benefits available to asylum seekers in NASS accommodation, as compared with UK nationals. As has been said in the exchange of letters, the Government&#039;s assessment is that the difference is on average 4 per cent. In the   debate on 29 June on the Asylum Support (Amendment)(No.  2) Regulations, the noble Lord set out a calculation which concluded that the difference is 7 per cent for a married couple with no children.
</p>

<a name="40706-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>The Government will happily set out the assumptions by which they have arrived at the figure of 4 per cent. I will not go through them line by line, but the Government do not wish to make a point of disputing the noble Lord&#039;s detailed calculations. It so happens that we have used slightly different assumptions and have come up with a slightly different conclusion.
</p>

<a name="40706-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>At the risk of falling foul of the noble Lord, I have to make the point clear. The fundamental difference between the Government and the noble Lord is not whether the answer is 4 per cent or 7 per cent. The question is whether any difference is acceptable at all. That is implicit in what the noble Lord said, and I see that the noble Lord agrees with me. In the Government&#039;s view, a difference of 7 per cent, such as is estimated by the noble Lord, is acceptable. However, we do not say that the numbers add up <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_713"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 713</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

exactly. Our argument is that the two regimes are broadly the same in material effect. We are not arguing about the percentages.

</p>

<a name="40706-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>I also make the point that access to income support opens up another avenue completely. I said at an earlier stage of this legislation that, in the long run, it might have been cheaper not to have had NASS support in the first place. However, I repeat that we are running a system that is costing over &#163;1 billion in support of asylum seekers.
</p>

<a name="40706-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>The noble Lord also said in his letter that we have ignored asylum seekers who have opted for subsistence-only support, and those denied any support at all by virtue of Section 55 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Neither of these groups will have had   any support in kind from NASS. If those in accommodation are out of pocket to the tune of 7 per cent, those on subsistence only will be out of pocket to the tune of 30 per cent, and those denied support altogether to the tune of 100 per cent. We have not ignored these cases.
</p>

<a name="40706-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>In so far as Article 23 may be relevant, the Government&#039;s view is that it requires only that the   treatment of refugees and nationals be broadly the same in material effect, not identical. Mainstream benefits are intended as a basic safety net to ensure that the poorest have a roof over their heads and sufficient money on which to live. Asylum seekers on subsistence-only support will have this.
</p>

<a name="40706-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>Applicants who do not claim as soon as reasonably practicable after entering the UK are still able to access National Asylum Support Service support in the usual way, if they do not otherwise have means of support available to them.
</p>

<a name="40706-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>In Clause 12 the Government are proposing to abolish a discredited and retrospective system of back payments, which rewarded time spent stringing out the asylum process. I have explained today how advisers sometimes become involved in that process. We are seeking to stop that.
</p>

<a name="40706-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>In Clause 13 we are replacing this with a new, forward-looking system of refugee integration loans. The Government are satisfied that this is within both the spirit and the letter of the Refugee Convention, and we hope that it will result in a better deal for refugees.
</p>

<a name="40706-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>As I have said, a proper response to the letter from the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, will be on its way but I hope that, in the light of these explanations, the noble Lord will not press his amendment.

<a name="40706-17_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, the argument is not one solely between myself and the Minister.

<a name="40706-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>He says that it is okay to short-change the asylum seekers by 4 per cent or 7 per cent and, as he says, we are not arguing about the exact figure because we can attempt to reconcile the arithmetic &quot;off-line&quot;, as it were.

If his calculation comes up with a slightly different figure, we will not argue about that detail. However, the noble Lord is now saying that to be in full compliance with Article 23 it is sufficient to give the asylum seekers something less than equal treatment with British citizens. That is not what the Convention says and not what the UNHCR&#039;s interpretation of the Convention confirms&#151;which the noble Lord has seen.
</p>

<a name="40706-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>Although we will not take this any further this evening on the Floor of the House, I can assure the noble Lord that he has not heard the last of it. It will be necessary for him to satisfy not just the UNHCR representative in the UK but UNHCR headquarters in Geneva.

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>It is a matter of principle.

After reflecting on this matter it seems that we do not yet know the nature of the loan scheme or how much it will cost the taxpayer. It will be fairly expensive. However, it could be, without in any way incommoding a refugee, that much money could be saved if it was possible to pay a certain amount of the loan and then proceed later with other sums by instalments. As my noble friend said, a person&#039;s circumstances may change and we hope that many refugees, having received a loan, will find a job and begin to earn&#151;perhaps well and will not need the further loan instalments.

This is not new, extra money&#151;it is already being paid by the taxpayer. When we discussed this matter on Report I thanked the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, for her helpful suggestion that the loan could be made in instalments. We still consider that to be a suggestion which we should like to see carried through to the operation of the loan scheme.
</p>

<a name="40706-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>We have now had the opportunity to confirm our original impression that we believe it is possible to make provision for the loan to be paid by instalments through the present drafting of the clause by conferring a discretion on the Secretary of State. There is one caveat. If the Secretary of State makes a loan by instalments it should not circumvent either the provision prohibiting the making of two loans to one person or any provision made for a minimum or maximum amount of a loan. We think that is right. If the Secretary of State makes a loan by instalments, it should be one loan that does not exceed any specified maximum amount, made in staged payments over time. It should not be a route that enables more than one loan to be made to any person or a way to enable a loan to be made in excess of the specified maximum amount. That will be in the regulations.
</p>

<a name="40706-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>During the debate at Report stage the noble Baroness explained that paying the loan by instalments would enable payments to be halted if there was a sudden change for the better in the fortunes of the applicant, given that the loans will be based on need and individual circumstances. The provision to confer a discretion on the Secretary of State or the amendment would not by themselves achieve that objective. However, we have considered this again and would suggest that it might be best achieved by making a provision under subsection (3)(d) for the loan to become repayable in full in specified circumstances, of which sudden affluence could be one.
</p>

<a name="40706-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>This matter will return to the House for detailed examination when we have a scheme to present to Parliament. I should like to thank the noble Baroness for her suggestion.

the Government could work the loan proposals into the existing skeleton of Clause 13 with, perhaps, regulations coming later.

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>The explanation that he gave regarding the use of subsection (3) (i), which confers a discretion on the Secretary of State, went a long way to reassuring me about some of the concerns that I expressed on Report on recommitment. I shall look carefully at <i>Hansard</i>, but the Minister seemed to say that the Government would not be trying to obviate or get out of the provisions in the rest of subsection (3)(a) to (h) by using the discretion provided for in subsection (3)(i).

</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_9"></a><br>
   &quot;MARRIAGE NOT A GROUND FOR LEAVE TO REMAIN

<br>
(1)   That a person has married a British citizen in the United Kingdom is not a ground for granting leave to remain under the Immigration Act 1971 (c. 77) if that person&#151;


<br>
(a)   was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom for a period of less than six months, or


<br>
(b)   their period of leave to be in the United Kingdom expires in less than 3 months from the date of their marriage.


<br>
(2)   That a person intends to marry a British citizen in the United Kingdom is not a ground for granting leave to remain under the 1971 Act if that person&#151;


<br>
(a)   was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom for a period of less than six months, or


<br>
(b)   their period of leave to be in the United Kingdom expires in less than 3 months from the date of their application for leave to remain.&quot; </p>



<p><a name="st_145"></a>The noble Countess said: My Lords, when I suggested at Report stage the possible introduction of a measure such as that in the amendment it was because I had a sudden vision of a vast bureaucracy waiting in the wings for the enactment of Clauses 19 to 24. I have been in your Lordships&#039; House long enough to recognise that each time we have a new Act of Parliament we seem to double the number of officials and civil servants. That worries me somewhat.
</p>

<a name="40706-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>Would it not be easier to tell all those single people to whom time-limited visas are issued that, should they wish to extend their stay in the United Kingdom, contracting a marriage here would not provide them with a ground to remain? That would be done at the time the visa was issued. I have limited the scope of the amendment to spouses who are British citizens because I recognise that we must observe the terms of EEA treaties.
</p>

<a name="40706-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, for asking two officials from the immigration and nationality department to contact me last week. I was interested to learn that it is now EEA nationals who are a major source of bogus spouses. As the grounds for remaining on the basis of a marriage contracted with a person present and settled in the UK already are enshrined in rule 284 of the Immigration Rules, can the Minister <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_717"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 717</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

say whether the rule is so ineffective as to require the introduction of Clauses 19 to 24 for all marriages? If not, why are those clauses not restricted to applications for marriages to EEA nationals only? Is there a problem? Would such discrimination go against the terms of the treaty? Is this a problem common throughout the EEA and, if not, why is the UK so disadvantaged?
</p>

<a name="40706-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>I have no intention of pressing the amendment to a Division. I realise that the wording is faulty. However, I still suspect that there may be some less cumbersome way to deal with the problem. I beg to move.

</p>




<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="40706-18_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, I support the amendment. The Minister was good enough to say earlier on that he does not listen to the ragbag of stuff in the <i>Daily Mail</i>. But this gives a completely different impression that this legislation has been pushed forward in the House of Lords and at one time did not have the scrutiny of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which we have now received. This is very much a reaction to the headlines in the <i>Daily Mail, </i>the <i>Express</i> and the <i>Sun</i> about sham marriages. No one condones sham marriages. Even one is unacceptable and the figure that the Minister identified&#151;up to 2,700&#151;is worrying. I have studied his letter to the noble Countess, Lady Mar. He said that the main objective of the clause relates to non-EEA nationals marrying EEA nationals. That is a matter for European Community law. Why are we interfering with UK domestic law in this matter?
</p>

<a name="40706-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>It would be particularly helpful to me if the Minister were to provide some statistics about where this fundamental abuse of marriage takes place. Are we talking about non-EEA nationals or people from Commonwealth countries? So far I have not seen any statistic which confirms that.
</p>

<a name="40706-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Countess, Lady   Mar, is appropriate for two reasons. First, the present immigration legislation provides adequately for entry clearance to be obtained for the purpose of marriage. One has to make the appropriate inquiries in this country regarding the basis of the issue of a certificate. If that certificate is not issued, one cannot come to be married in this country. If the certificate is issued, there is no problem. Why are we not controlling that aspect to ensure that only people who have the right to marry in this country are granted leave to remain?
</p>

<a name="40706-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>Secondly, one is not allowed to change one&#039;s status after entering the UK. A student has to return to his country if he wishes to be married and a visitor has to do the same to obtain the appropriate certificate to enter the UK. Why are those rules not sufficient to deal with this problem?
</p>

<a name="40706-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>Over a period of years the Home Office has moved away from the primary purpose rule, to which the Minister and I did not subscribe, and we have reached a stage where it was initially confirmed that leave to remain would be granted only when someone has had <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_718"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 718</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a stable marriage for a period of one year. That period has been increased to two years. If two years have been completed, leave to remain in the United Kingdom is granted.

</p>

<a name="40706-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>There are ample safeguards in the existing legislation. In February, according to published figures, over 60 arrests were made in relation to sham marriages. If that is the case, why do we not use the existing law? Why can the Minister tell us that over 2,300 sham marriages took place in 2003 and only 60 people were arrested? I would much prefer that anyone who gets involved in a sham marriages is not allowed to stay in this country. I do not think that anyone has a problem with that.
</p>

<a name="40706-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>But what the Minister proposes is not the way to deal with the situation. Why do we have to use marriage registrars as tools for immigration control? The Home Secretary at one time said&#151;I read it in a newspaper&#151;that people who live in this country should marry people who are here. That does not build confidence. It is the right of individuals to marry whom they wish, but that must not in any way evade immigration control.
</p>

<a name="40706-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>The amendment in the names of the noble Countess, Lady Mar, and my noble friend Lord Avebury makes sense. No one can use marriage as grounds to remain in the United Kingdom. The amendment gets rid of the role of registrars and the Home Secretary&#039;s role in determining who should marry whom. There is no need for a separate system of monitoring, because any appeal could be determined under the existing legislation and over 60 arrests have been made, so the present law is adequate to deal with the matter.
</p>

<a name="40706-18_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>There are matters of serious concern, particularly among minority communities. I saw a headline in one of the ethnic papers, which said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;Can we marry, Mr Blunkett?&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-18_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>The article was endorsed by the Labour Peers, the noble Lords, Lord Ahmed and Lord Parekh, by the Conservative Peer, the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, and by myself. We must be careful. The Home Secretary has better things to do than going around saying that he objects to particular marriages.
</p>

<a name="40706-18_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>We have every right to control sham marriages, but it should be done on the basis of the amendment suggested by the noble Countess. If European law needs revision we should consider that rather than interfering with our domestic law.

<p><a name="st_147"></a>
<a name="40706-19_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, we have had two debates on the Government&#039;s new marriage clause, to which the amendment relates, but this is the first time we have considered it, as my noble friend said, with the benefit of the advice of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. I would like to place on the record our extreme gratitude to the committee for the rapidity and thoroughness of its work on all the clauses involved in recommitment as well as on other matters that invariably come before your Lordships that may have human rights implications.
</p>

<a name="40706-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>We fully support the Government&#039;s aim of clamping down on sham marriages and we acknowledge that the increasing number of reports made by registrars under <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_719"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 719</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Section 24 of the 1999 Act indicates that further measures need to be taken to solve the problem. However, we have not been convinced that the existing powers, as my noble friend said, under criminal and immigration law are insufficient to curb the use of marriage as a means of evading immigration controls.
</p>

<a name="40706-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>In that we are greatly reinforced by the discussion in paragraphs 36 to 81 of the JCHR report. The fact that almost half the report is devoted to the issue reflects its importance and the sensitivity of the human rights at issue, as we have sought to persuade your Lordships on two previous occasions.
</p>

<a name="40706-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>For good measure, the JCHR not only enumerates the ECHR rights in Articles 12 and 14 but also the provisions in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the United Kingdom is also a party. The first question the committee asked was whether the requirement in Clause 19(3) that express authorisation must be obtained for a marriage is a breach of Article 12 of ECHR; the right to marry. As it points out, although that right is according to international law, the wording is not interpreted as conferring an unlimited discretion on governments to circumscribe the right because otherwise Article 12 would be redundant.
</p>

<a name="40706-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>Any restrictions on the right to marry have to be for a legitimate aim and must be proportionate. Thus, for instance, it was held that laws preventing prisoners from marrying were not within the scope of Article 12. We have to apply the same tests of legitimacy and proportionality to the proposals before us. In that regard, the JCHR has picked up the point we made in Committee that without knowing more about the Section 24 reports and the &quot;striking discrepancy&quot;, as the report calls it, between the 2,251 reports by registrars and the 37 persons charged with criminal offences, we are not in a position to reach a conclusion.
</p>

<a name="40706-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>As the committee says, we also need to know how many people have been refused leave to remain as spouses on the grounds that their marriages were sham; Amendment No. 15 touches on that point. The JCHR says that there is a significant risk that the proposed restriction on the right to marry may be disproportionate. It gives three substantial reasons, which I shall not attempt to summarise. It concludes that there is a significant risk that the requirement to obtain permission to marry as presently drafted will be incompatible with the right in the ECHR.
</p>

<a name="40706-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>The committee also raised discrimination against persons who belong to a religion other than Church of England, to which I referred in Committee. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said that there was,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;no evidence of sham marriages in the Church of England&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 15/6/04; col. 696.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>However, the committee did not consider that &quot;a sufficiently weighty justification&quot; for treating members of one religion preferentially in a private matter that affects almost everyone.
</p>

<a name="40706-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>Finally, the committee takes up a suggestion I made in Committee that it should consider the application of   Article 14 on non-discrimination together with <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_720"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 720</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Article   12 on marriage since the clause restricts the rights of non-EEA nationals to marry and therefore treats them less favourably because of their nationality. The committee says that in principle a prior authorisation requirement could be justified if it applied only to those in the UK unlawfully and that more generally it is legitimate to regulate the right to marry so as to prevent the exploitation of marriage as a means of circumventing immigration control.

</p>

<a name="40706-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>But as drafted, it considers that there is a significant risk that the proposals will be found to discriminate on grounds of nationality without objective and reasonable justification. It is profoundly unsatisfactory that we should be considering the advice of the JCHR on this important matter at the eleventh hour and without the benefit of a reasoned answer from the Government to the detailed objections that they raise to the clause.
</p>

<a name="40706-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>We regret that decisions are not going to be made on the basis of reasoned argument and that Ministers can   easily cast aside the opinions of a committee established by your Lordships for the purpose of ensuring that we avoid making human rights errors that will land the Government in the courts. In the past the Government have ignored the JCHR&#039;s advice and have good reason to regret it. I hope that that will not happen again.
</p>




<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="40706-19_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I have tabled two amendments in the group, Amendments Nos. 20 and 23 to which it may be convenient for me to speak. Amendment No. 23 is supported by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. In referring to Amendment No. 20, it is a case of putting the cart before the horse. The nature of Third Reading procedure means that I know it is difficult for the Minister to move his amendments until the end when he is responding to everyone else&#039;s.
</p>

<a name="40706-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>Although the Minister has not yet moved his amendments in this group, I shall welcome them when he does so because they more than adequately respond to the concern I reflected in my Amendment No. 20. The difficulty is that all of us start from the position that the noble Lords, Lord Dholakia and Lord Avebury, have so properly enunciated: we are all against the use of sham marriages for the purposes of obtaining residence in this country. That is not what the institution of marriage is about.
</p>

<a name="40706-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>After that we get into difficulties as to how the measure should be applied. I say to the Government that we want to support them if we can but so far we are not convinced that they have properly put in place a mechanism to prevent sham marriages taking place. Therefore, I think that the Government have gone one step further in the right direction. I shall ask the Minister to speak to those amendments rather than simply repeat everything in relation to my Amendment No. 20.

super-league of registrars, it would be very valuable to have some way of reporting back to Parliament on the work that they were doing, and it would be valuable to   know whether or not the Government&#039;s new provisions were having the impact that they intended or whether there were unintended consequences. The Minister had given his reasons for rejecting those amendments.
</p>

<a name="40706-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>Last week, I had a very helpful meeting with the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. I am grateful to its members for taking the time to meet me. They put forward Amendment No. 23, which is before the House today. I hope that the approach that it adopts appeals more to the Government than did my original attempt. It provides for the Secretary of State to appoint an independent monitor, who would report on the refusal of permission to marry. He would report to the Secretary of State and the report would be laid before Parliament. Such an independence of approach could be very valuable indeed.
</p>

<a name="40706-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>Earlier in our debates today&#151;I noted that it was at about 3.40 p.m. when we were debating Amendment No. 3&#151;the Minister seemed to say that he thought that that was a good idea. He referred to the fact that my idea of a monitor has a precedent in the 1999 Act, which creates an entry-clearance monitor. Indeed, he reminded us of other examples. Therefore, I hope that there is an appropriate read-across to this proposal. An independent monitor would be a valuable step forward here as well.
</p>




<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="40706-19_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, government Amendments Nos. 16 to 19, 21 and 22 in this group are a handsome response to my noble friend&#039;s Amendment No. 20 and to the discussion that we had at an earlier stage. When we were debating this matter earlier, I asked what the position would be as regards Clause 21, which relates to Scotland. Looking at that clause, I am not sure whether any party to the purported marriage must appear with the registrar. If no one appears, the safeguard which the noble Lord is building in will not be possible. I wonder whether anyone who has it in mind to perpetrate a sham marriage will flee to Scotland to do so. I am not sure that that would be desirable.
</p>

<a name="40706-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>Did the Government discuss this issue with Scottish Ministers to ascertain the position? Last night, I was lucky enough to be invited to a reception at the Scotland Office in Dover House and the First Minister was present. At that point, I had not realised quite what the position was. If I had, I think that I would have discussed it with him over a glass of wine. Does the Minister know the answer to that now?
</p>

<a name="40706-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>In relation to Amendment No. 23, it seems that it is highly desirable to have some form of monitoring, and   an independent monitor might well be a fairly unbureaucratic and inexpensive way of achieving that. I hope that the Minister will look sympathetically at the proposal.

<a name="column_722"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 722</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I am glad to do so in the presence of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, who, like me, has the great benefit of serving on that all-party, and beyond-party, committee. I shall explain the reason for my intervention.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>Parliament has not been well served by the Home Office in the way in which these human rights issues have been dealt with. At the beginning of our report, which was published yesterday, we say at paragraph 3:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;We have made it clear in a number of reports that we regard it as unacceptable that amendments having significant implications for human rights should be introduced at a late stage in a Bill&#039;s passage through Parliament, without a clear explanation of the Government&#039;s view of the human rights implications. We find it particularly regrettable that we find ourselves once again in the very same position so soon after having made clear that such a practice undermines parliamentary scrutiny of legislation for compatibility with human rights. Such scrutiny is crucial to the democratic legitimacy of the Human Rights Act 1998. We once again draw this to the attention of each House&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>We work very hard; we have an excellent staff; we attend meetings; we consider reports; and we produce them as quickly as possible. The earliest that we could produce a report that could be of any benefit to Parliament and to this debate was yesterday.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>My noble friend Lord Avebury has done the House a great service in summarising, in a way that I do not need to do, some of the main issues that we raised in the context of marriage and sham marriages. However, the situation is wholly unsatisfactory for this reason. Having done all that work and having produced what we consider to be a cogent report, it would be impossible for us to expect the Minister now, although we would like him to do so, to respond properly in this debate and before the end of Third   Reading to the points that my noble friend Lord Avebury summarised. The net result will be that, in a thinly attended House late in the afternoon, the luckless Minister will have the task of responding to a report as best he can and we shall then move on.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>What will be the result of that? There will be no effective parliamentary scrutiny of these human rights issues and, as my noble friend Lord Avebury said, the matter will end up in court. Although I practise at the Bar, I regard it as a misfortune whenever legislation is passed in a form so defective that judges and lawyers have to come to the rescue. That does no one any good&#151;not even the legal profession. It is dispiriting and it is entirely the fault of the Home Office. I am sure that, when he replies, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, for whom I have great respect and whose love of parliamentary democracy and respect for Parliament is beyond reproach, will, in some sense, apologise. I am sure that he will. But, of course, that will not make good what has been done on this occasion.

</p>

<a name="40706-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>This is not an ordinary Bill. It is one that affects the rights of one of the most vulnerable groups of people in this country. I must choose my words carefully&#151;I am tempted to go over the top, but I shall not. I hope that this is the last occasion in the lifetime of this Government, or any future government, that something of this kind happens. When it does, we let down the parliamentary process and, ultimately, we must resort to litigation, which is a great misfortune.

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>Finally, I want to ask one specific question. It is a narrow but important one. In paragraph 46 of our report, we point out that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;The legislation is . . .  silent about the purpose of the open-ended power in the Secretary of State to exempt certain classes of individuals subject to immigration control from the new requirements&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>We point out:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;There is no indication of the sort of differentiations which might be made between different categories of people&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>I am sure that we would be grateful for an answer to that specific point and also for a reply to the various other points that have been made in our report.
</p>




<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="40706-20_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   My Lords, I hesitate to intervene. However, I do so simply on this point because I am a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Like the noble Lord, Lord Lester, I am second to no one in my admiration for my noble friend and the way in which he undertakes his work. Therefore, anything that we say contains no personal criticism of him whatever. But the Joint Committee is an all-party committee and the Government should be under no illusions that the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord   Lester, were strongly expressed by everyone on the committee, whatever their party allegiance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="40706-20_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I am very grateful for, and embarrassed by, some of the things that have just been said, particularly, I freely admit, in view of the fact that, until the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, was on his feet, I did not even know that the report was being published yesterday. Before coming back on the scene, I have obviously tried to get myself briefed on the amendments that we are discussing today and on some of the issues that were not in the recommitted part of the Bill. I wanted to be updated, but I did not know that the report had been published. But I am not hapless; I am angry that I did not know that it had been published. I clearly could not come with a response in 24 hours. I also hope that this is the last time that happens. 


</p>

<a name="40706-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>Draft Bills are published much more frequently; in fact, one is due imminently. If we are serious about the scrutiny of legislation, serious about getting it right and serious about human rights legislation, we cannot later say that we regret putting the Bill on the statute book but we have done it we will slip round it. That is not on.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>I do not know the background and the chronology of events or why the committee did not report. I always   speak at this Dispatch Box on behalf of the Government, unless I am speaking for myself. At the   moment, I am speaking for myself and for the Government in apologising to your Lordships&#039; House. The Government&#039;s treatment of the committee could be bordering on contempt in not allowing sufficient time for scrutiny because I cannot respond.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>The Third Reading is set for today. I do not know what procedures will be used in the other place when its Members get this Bill back. Clearly they must have plenty of time to talk about the recommitted issues as they did not debate them when the Bill was before <br>&nbsp;<br>

them. I hope that there will be sufficient time for the JCHR report to be considered in the other place, and that the Government somehow concoct a response to the report before amendments are discussed. That is the minimal response. I have no knowledge that this is being put together but I certainly hope so.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>If I were in the House of Commons as a Minister&#151;let alone as an Opposition or Back-Bench Member&#151;and there was no response to the JCHR report in the amendments that come from this place, I would have one hell of a row. It will be very substantial block of amendments&#151;almost a Bill on its own.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>That is my view as a Minister, not just as an individual Member of the House. This situation puts me in a position where I cannot do my job of representing the Government to this House. I am critical of the machinery, but my job is to represent and speak for the Government in this House. I cannot do that as I would wish to as I have been placed in this position. The Government therefore lose out and we ask for trouble next time around. That situation has to be corrected in future.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>I would like to say to the noble Baroness, Lady   Carnegy, that she has got it dead right about Scotland. I will come to that point as I will go to my prepared notes in a jiff. In Scotland, there is no requirement to turn up. The situation will be looked at in case there is a problem.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>This comes back to the issue of marriage tourism that I raised in Committee&#151;people from overseas who want to get married, probably not on a bridge but perhaps in a castle or somewhere similar. In those cases, it may not be possible to turn up and give notice. The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, has got it dead right and has not misread the Bill or the amendments.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>I will now proceed with the notes that I have. They were prepared by the Home Office in advance of the Bill and the remarks that I have just made.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>Under Amendment No. 15, a person married in the UK, or intending to marry in the UK, would not be eligible to apply for leave to remain where he, or she, has been granted less than six months&#039; leave or only have three months or less of his current leave remaining.

</p>

<a name="40706-20_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>In April 2003, a similar provision to subsections (1)(a) and (2)(a) of the amendment&#151;the six months&#039; leave point&#151;was included in the immigration rules. Paragraph 284 of the immigration rules requires that persons applying for leave to remain on the grounds of a marriage to a British citizen or person settled here have extant leave to remain in the UK and have been granted over six months&#039; leave since the date that they were admitted to the United Kingdom, or have entered the UK with leave as a fianc&#233;. That is one of the normal routes. Where a person does not meet this criterion, he would be expected to leave the UK and apply for entry clearance as a spouse. Many people do that.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>While subsections (1)(b) and (2)(b) of the amendment&#151;the three month leave point&#151;may have a use in prohibiting persons approaching the end of their leave from entering into a sham marriage, the Government do not feel that it would be appropriate to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_725"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 725</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

consider it at this time. Should evidence arise that such an amendment is necessary, an amendment to the immigration rules could be made in secondary legislation. In any event, the immigration rules would be the appropriate place to make provision of this nature, not primary legislation. I hope that that point is accepted because it is well made.
<a name="time_20"></a>
<a name="40706-20_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40706-20_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>Furthermore, the amendment tabled by the noble Countess, Lady Mar, does not assist us in combating marriage abuse when it is undertaken by a non-European Economic Area national marrying an EEA national. It is the act of marriage that gives a right of residence in these cases rather than the act of the Home Office granting leave to remain. Those marrying an EEA national do not need to obtain leave to remain on the basis of that marriage to have a right of residence through that marriage. This is because the rights of residence obtained through the marriage to an EEA national are the subject of European law rather than UK domestic legislation. Their rights are irrespective of an individual&#039;s immigration status in the UK at the time of the marriage.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>As noble Lords will know, all EEA nationals have the right of free movement throughout the EU. This means that they are not subject to immigration control and do not require leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. In order to ensure that an EEA national can exercise free movement of rights effectively, he is entitled to have his family members accompany or join him when in another member state and exercising a treaty right.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>The family member therefore derives free movement rights through his relationship with the EEA national. This includes a right of residence equivalent to that of his EEA family member. In practice this means that, like the EEA national, he does not have, or need to have, leave to remain when residing in the UK. He is in the UK as a family member of an EEA national exercising a treaty right and is therefore able to obtain a residence document confirming this right. This document is issued for the length of the residence permit his EEA national family member can also obtain. This would normally be for a period of five years.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>Reports from registrars and other intelligence sources suggest that fixers of sham marriages are increasingly favouring this EEA route. As an indication of this, 61 per cent of the Section 24 reports received by the Immigration Service in May involved EEA national spouses.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>While we are not obliged to issue a residence document in the case of sham marriages, the burden of proof in establishing whether the marriage is one of convenience lies with the Secretary of State. This is a very difficult and a resource-intensive activity.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>As such, if we are to stop spouses of EEA nationals abusing immigration law through sham marriages, the most effective option is to stop them from getting married in the UK in first place. Designated register <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_726"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 726</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

offices in addition to the requirement for entry clearance or a Home Office certificate of approval will provide a complementary two-pronged approach to tackling this marriage abuse.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>With this in mind, I hope that the noble Countess, Lady Mar, will withdraw this amendment. She said that she would not proceed with it. I hope that that explains some of the reasons why the amendment cannot be accepted. It is a seductive one until the question of where those rights come from is considered.

</p>

<a name="40706-20_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>As noble Lords will recall, the noble Baroness, Lady   Anelay, tabled an amendment at Report stage that would have required both parties to attend the designated centre together. This was resisted because as drafted it did not meet the policy aim, but I stated that we were considering the policy intention behind the amendment. Since then, she has tabled Amendment No. 20, explicitly requiring both parties to attend the centre together.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>The noble Baroness stated on Report that it was important that registrars at the new designated centres should be able to use the expertise they will build up in detecting sham marriages effectively, and that it was difficult to see how they could do this if under the new measures the parties to the proposed marriage were able to give notice of their intention to marry at separate designated centres. That would be the position under Clause 19 as currently drafted. The Government agree with the noble Baroness, and have tabled Amendments Nos. 16 to 19 in response to her amendment.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>Requiring only non-European economic area nationals to attend designated centres or allowing the couple to attend separately would potentially leave a large loophole in the legislation. The fixers of sham marriages will be able to have participants to the marriage give notice separately which, of course, will deny registrars the opportunity to observe the interaction between couples at the notice stage and reduce the ability of registrars to identify suspicious marriages for the purposes of Section 24 reporting.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>By requiring parties to the marriage to give notice together we shall ensure that registrars have an opportunity to observe interaction between couples, enabling them to form a view on whether an intended marriage should be reported as suspicious under current legislation. They will become familiar with the signs indicating a sham marriage and, therefore, be in a better position to be able to identify potential offenders and, in some cases, repeat offenders. One would think that people would not be so stupid as to return to the same register office, but it is amazing what people do. It happens; people have a forged passport and turn up wanting it renewed, never thinking that someone may be checking on it the other side of the desk. It is amazing and it could arise.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>Where suspicions are aroused, Section 24 reports can be made and the Immigration and Nationality Directorate&#039;s increased commitment to enforcement and intelligence in this area will mean that, where appropriate, action can be taken.

<a name="40706-20_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 will amend subsection (2)(b) of Clause 23 to bring the powers available in Northern Ireland&#039;s enabling clause into line with the amended provisions in Clause 19(2). If there are signs that the problem of sham marriages has been displaced to Northern Ireland, these amendments will give the Secretary of State, after consultation with the Registrar General for Northern Ireland, the power to require that parties to a marriage, involving a European economic area national, give notice together and in person at a designated register office. With that in mind, I would hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, will withdraw her amendment and that noble Lords will agree to the amendments that I shall move in due course.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland, Lord McNally and Lord Avebury, have tabled Amendment No. 23 requiring an independent monitor to be appointed in order to report annually on refusals for permission to marry under subsection (3)(b) of Clause 19. Such a monitor does not exist for any of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate&#039;s other managed migration functions, such as leave to remain applications. At this point, the Government do not believe that it is appropriate to appoint one to report on this function. We believe that it would be adding unnecessary bureaucracy.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>All the Immigration and Nationality Directorate&#039;s practices and procedures are subject to compliance with the Race Relations Act 1976, as amended, and are subject to independent review by the race relations monitor. The current monitor reports annually to Parliament and operations under subsection (3)(b) would be included within that remit. So there would be a mechanism for reporting to Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>As I have stated in each of our debates, the Government appreciate the importance of parliamentary scrutiny of the workings of these clauses, which I would have thought would have included the JCHR points that I made earlier. However, we do not feel that an annual report from an independent monitor would be a suitable vehicle in this instance. As I stated on Report, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate officials are seeking to identify a suitable government publication in which the numbers of applications made for certificates of approval and the numbers of successful and unsuccessful applications could be included. I pointed out that some of the issues probably could not be reported if people were simply making inquiries. This publication, once we have found a suitable one, would then be laid before Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>In Amendment No. 24 the noble Lords, Lord   McNally and Lord Avebury, have requested that a statutory right of appeal be introduced for those persons who are refused a certificate of approval by the Home Secretary under subsection (3)(b) of Clause 19. The Government do not believe that a statutory right of appeal is necessary in relation to such refusals, as a decision to refuse a certificate of approval will be subject to challenge by way of judicial review.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_728"></a>

</p>

<a name="40706-20_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>All applications for certificates of approval will be considered and determined in accordance with published guidance, which will set out the factors to be taken into account by caseworkers when determining such applications. Where an application for a certificate of approval is refused, a person would be free to challenge the decision by judicial review on what are commonly known as Wednesbury grounds&#151;by the way, that is a place in the Black Country in the Midlands&#151;which is that no reasonable person in the same position could reasonably have reached the same conclusion. For example, a person might challenge the decision on the basis that it was not made in accordance with the published guidance, or that the published guidance was itself unreasonable. Therefore, we think that judicial review is a sufficient and appropriate method of challenge to decisions to refuse an application for a certificate of approval.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>In light of that, I would hope that noble Lords will not proceed with those amendments.
</p>

<a name="40706-20_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>Some further points were raised. I shall refer to that raised by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, and my noble friend Lord Judd on the JCHR report.

Does he agree that the advice that he has just conveyed to the House is in itself disturbing? No Minister, of course, would bring any legislation to this House unless there were a statement saying that it was compatible with human rights obligations. Our job in the Joint Committee is to examine that and to see whether it is valid.
</p>




<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="40706-21_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   Yes, my Lords. No Minister would sign the front of the Bill unless he received written advice to the effect that it was compatible. That is the case. I just do not know what the procedure was. The Bill was introduced, it went through Committee stage and Report stage in this House and was recommitted to a Committee so that some amendments could be added. It was not another Bill. I am not sure whether a signature was required because the Bill was that which was presented to Parliament, both to the first House and then to this House. I have never been required to sign to the effect that a particular amendment to a Bill is compatible. On the other hand, the advice that one receives would cover these points. The Committee has a job to do.

</p>

<a name="40706-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>A noble Lord raised the point about people&#039;s changing status once they are in the UK. Persons who have been granted six months&#039; leave or less since entering the UK may not switch into marriage. Those may be people on short-term visas, such as students. Anyone else can switch into marriage if he or she has been granted over six months&#039; leave since entering the UK. However, those provisions apply only to persons marrying British citizens and persons settled here; they do not apply to European economic area nationals exercising treaty rights.
</p>

<a name="40706-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>I was asked about Clause 19(3)(c) and who would be exempt. We envisage that persons with settled status in the UK will be exempt under subsection (3)(c). Thus the clause is being left to secondary legislation under the negative resolution procedure, and will be subject to the usual Parliamentary scrutiny procedure. I am not clear whether that answers the point about paragraph 46, which the noble Lord, Lord Lester, asked me about. A note has not winged its way to me, and I shall see if I can get one before we finish tonight, because I can refer to it on another amendment, as I did in our earlier debate on Zimbabwe. 
</p>

<a name="40706-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>I hope that is a sufficient explanation, that this apology is accepted, that noble Lords will not, therefore, push their amendments to a vote and that, in due course, they will support the amendments I shall move on behalf of the Government.

<a name="40706-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>I can only repeat the point I made about paragraph 294 at the opening of my speech. As I made clear, the amendment of the noble Countess, Lady Mar, does not assist us in combating marriage abuse when it is undertaken by a non-EEA national marrying an EEA national. As I said, Paragraph 284 of the immigration rules requires the persons applying for leave to remain on the grounds of marriage to a British citizen or persons settled here, to have extended leave to remain in the UK and been granted over six months&#039; leave since the date they were admitted to the UK, or have entered the UK with leave as a fianc&#233;. Of course, that happens up and down the country many times a week, I suspect.
</p>

<a name="40706-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>When a person does not meet these criteria, they would be expected to leave.

<p><a name="st_166"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a very short point. The provisions of Clause 26 of the Bill relating to legal aid for reconsideration of the original decision of the appeal at the asylum and immigration tribunal are apparently based on the assumption that the application for reconsideration will be made only by an asylum seeker or immigrant. In fact, an application can be made by the other party to the appeal, the Home Office, which may be unsatisfied with a decision in favour of the asylum seeker or immigrant.
</p>

<a name="40706-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>The provisions are that legal aid can be granted to an asylum seeker or immigrant only retrospectively. In the case where the asylum seeker has been successful before the tribunal and then the Home Office has obtained an order for reconsideration, it does seem unfair that the asylum seeker, or lawyers, should be entitled to the benefit of legal aid only retrospectively. Having won first time, surely the asylum seeker must be entitled to legal aid to defend his or her position. I beg to move.

This is already explicit&#151;or perhaps implicit&#151;in the text of Clause 103D(1) and (3). They use the words &quot;on the application of the appellant&quot; as a prelude to the new provisions conferring new powers on the tribunal and the High Court to order payments out of public funds. In all other circumstances, the usual legal aid scheme will continue to operate, including the means and merit tests and the usual arrangements whereby the court or tribunal can order the losing party to pay the winning party&#039;s costs, without any drain on public expenditure. Nothing, therefore, in Clause 103D applies in relation to cases where the review is instigated by a party to the appeal other than the appellant. I hope that that clarification is helpful to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart.

<a name="40706-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>Clause 26 eliminates the adjudicators and provides for appeals by immigrants or asylum seekers from an adverse decision or an immigration officer direct to the asylum and immigration tribunal.

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 732</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the High Court for an order requiring the tribunal to reconsider its decision on the ground that it may have made an error in law.
</p>

<a name="40706-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>The Bill inserts new Section 103D into the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. That is the provision which deals with costs. Under Clause   103D(1) and (2), the applicant&#039;s costs may be paid out of the Community Legal Service fund if, but only if, the application has succeeded. That is the cost of the application, not of any reconsideration which has been ordered. At the reconsideration stage, the tribunal can order the costs of both the application and the reconsideration to be paid out of the fund under Clause 103D(3) and (4). The reconsideration does not have to be successful in order to get an order, but the result has to be taken into account under these provisions. Clause 103D(6)(a) provides that if payments of legal aid are made, the amount of payments may vary according to the result. That is to enable the Government to provide mark-up success fees for successful applications. Section 103D(6)(c) provides that the power to make an order for the payment of costs,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;may be restricted by reference to the outcome of the appeal&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>The Government have made it clear that they intend to introduce a conditional fee system for both the application and any reconsideration which may result from a successful application. There is an absolute &quot;no win&#151;no fee&quot; system at the application stage because the order under subsection (1) can only be made if the appropriate court has made an order. At the reconsideration stage, the Government have said that they will limit payments out of the fund to winners or near misses, but as with conditional fees under the Access to Justice Act 1999 there will be a mark-up for successful cases.
</p>

<a name="40706-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>Conditional fees were introduced by the 1999 Act for civil cases involving damages or claims to property. Conditional fees have many defects, but we have to accept they are here to stay in civil cases. Up to now, they have not been introduced in public law cases and they cannot, under the 1999 Act, be introduced for criminal cases. If ever the conditional fee system was applied to criminal appeals, I believe there would be an absolute uproar in the legal profession and beyond it. What would the effect of that be? Of course, it would depend on the amount of the &quot;success fee&quot; or mark-up. If we assume that it is 100 per cent&#151;that is, double the standard fee being given if successful; it certainly would not be more than 100 per cent, and could well be less&#151;it would mean that lawyers would not take a case unless the chances of success were greater than 50   per cent, otherwise they would end up being out of pocket.
</p>

<a name="40706-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>People convicted of crime must obviously be allowed to apply for leave to appeal from conviction even if their chance of success is quite small, and if the judge hearing the application for leave thinks the case is strong enough to justify leave to appeal then the appellant will get legal aid for that appeal, win or lose. The consequences of a wrongful rejection of an asylum claim can be just as disastrous as the consequences of a wrongful conviction, so I believe that legal aid for the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_733"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 733</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

application and reconsideration should in principle be treated on the same basis as criminal appeals. It is completely unacceptable if lawyers refuse to take a case because it only has a 40 per cent chance of success, or indeed a 20 or 25 per cent chance of success.
</p>

<a name="40706-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>I am prepared to accept that some modification of the criminal appeal basis is appropriate here. For the application, what I propose is to remove the requirement that the costs of the application can only be paid if the application succeeds. That is the result of Amendment No. 26, which leaves payment in the discretion of the High Court judge who hears the application. This discretion would of course be retrospective, but I believe the court, if left with that discretion, would order payment where it was reasonable to make the application, even though it had not succeeded. Conversely, where there were no reasonable grounds for making the application, costs would be refused. The costs of the application are relatively small, because applications are determined on the basis of written submissions of the applicant, without argument. But the reconsideration stage involves considerably more time and work, because the cases have to be argued and are contested. It is true that they are legal arguments only, but they could be time-consuming, involving a full day or more.
</p>

<a name="40706-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>In principle, I believe that if the application is granted, that shows there must be reasonable grounds for reconsideration and legal aid should be granted before the reconsideration hearing. I put forward an amendment at Report which would have had that effect. I have however decided not to bring that amendment back, and have instead put down Amendment No. 28, which gives the High Court power to grant legal aid in advance where reconsideration is ordered. I do not intend to press that amendment because it is not central to the case that I am making. I recognise that there could be cases in which the grounds on which a successful application has been based are misleading or incomplete. For example, failure of the lawyer making the application to cite an important decision in another case of which the judge is unaware.
<a name="time_22"></a>
<a name="40706-22_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40706-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>I am, therefore, prepared to accept that the order for payment of costs should be retrospective and in the discretion of the tribunal, but I believe strongly that costs should only be refused where there are no reasonable grounds for making that application. That is the effect of Amendment No. 30. If the costs are refused, reasons must be given so that that decision can be reviewed: that is the purpose of Amendment No. 31. I have passed over Amendment No. 27, which is a very minor consequential amendment.
</p>

<a name="40706-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>It follows that reference to the amount of the payments varying according to the results, and to the   order for payments being restricted by reference to the outcome of the appeal should be omitted. That is the effect of Amendments Nos. 32 and 33.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_734"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 734</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40706-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>The Bill as amended will still give protection to the legitimate aims of the Government. Applications will still be dealt with quickly, because there will be no prior applications for legal aid. Hopeless applications will be deterred because the judge or tribunal can dismiss them and refuse, in their discretion, to order costs. Lawyers in the few unreasonable cases which may slip through the filter will be punished by being refused payment out of the Legal Aid Fund.
</p>

<a name="40706-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>If these amendments are not accepted, there is a real risk of injustice to immigrants and asylum seekers. That is the view of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, in a report which was published much longer ago than yesterday. These passages are from its thirteenth report of the present Session. On page 23 the committee says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a>&quot;It seems to us undesirable that the right of access to court for the protection of the most fundamental of rights should be made to depend for its effectiveness on the degree to which lawyers are risk-takers&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>The report continues at paragraph 1.85 to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a>&quot;The evidence of respected bodies with practical experience in the field is that the legal aid proposals will inevitably lead to meritorious cases not proceeding because of the practical impossibility of obtaining representation, and this will in turn lead to individuals being returned in breach of the UK&#039;s ECHR obligations and of the principle of non-refoulement. We remind the Government of its obligation under the ECHR to ensure that there is available a practically effective opportunity to have the substance of any arguable Convention complaint considered, and that this obligation includes a positive obligation to take steps to make sure that there are not practical obstacles to the availability of such an opportunity&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>Then, in paragraph 1.87, the committee says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a>&quot;We agree that the effect of the proposed conditional fee legal aid regime for High Court reviews from the Tribunal will be that meritorious cases do not get brought because of the lack of representation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>I am astonished that the Government are prepared to put into the Bill provisions which will cause such obvious injustice&#151;doubly so when that injustice could be avoided by alterations to the Bill which would protect the legitimate objectives of the Government: the deterrence of unmeritorious appeals. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_172"></a>
<a name="40706-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, the encyclopaedic preamble of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, to these amendments has left me with a relatively modest task. I entirely share his views about conditional fees, as indeed I explained at Report. It seems to me that they are, in principle, wrong in the context of public law matters. Not only are they wrong but also, in my submission, unworkable because the financial affairs of asylum seekers are such that they could never afford the insurance premium necessary to guarantee their legal representatives&#039; fees in circumstances where the case was lost.
</p>

<a name="40706-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>On the other hand, I also share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that is appropriate to award costs at the reconsideration stage, retrospectively, and at the discretion of the tribunal. The test should be a merits test and it should be a robust test without being unfair. There is no amendment which seeks to gauge exactly what the merits test should be. I shall be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_735"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 735</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

interested to hear whether the Government have given any further thought to that matter between Report and Third Reading.
</p>

<a name="40706-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>Some of the amendments carry the name of both the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and myself. Since the noble Lord has already spoken to them, I need add nothing. But there is one amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, which I have been unable to support. I refer to Amendment No. 28. That is not because I disagree with the spirit of the amendment but because it seems unfair that there should be, as it were, two classes of legal aid rules for those who reach the reconsideration stage.
</p>

<a name="40706-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>There are rules which are established by the High Court judge, because Amendment No. 28 says that a High Court judge,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a>&quot;may order that the appellant&#039;s costs in respect of the reconsideration shall be paid out of that Fund&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>and rules that apply to those applicants who have not had such an order made by the High Court judge and therefore have to rely on the discretion of the tribunal. That seems to put the second category in a disadvantageous situation. I would like to see all those who come before the tribunal for reconsideration having their legal aid applications treated on the same basis.
</p>




<p><a name="st_173"></a>
<a name="40706-23_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, I am not entirely persuaded that the Government have alighted on the correct solution to what is undoubtedly a very difficult problem. Nor am I persuaded that the alternatives which have been postulated, notably by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, provide the complete answer, although I think that in theory, they are rather more compelling than the Government&#039;s case.
</p>

<a name="40706-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>I plead guilty to preferring, in our earlier debates, a view different from that of the Government. I shall not   weary the House with a reiteration of all the arguments. Suffice it to say, we are both dealing with situations which, by their very nature, are, at this stage, unproved and, indeed, cannot be verifiable.
</p>

<a name="40706-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>I submit, therefore, that the Government should have an opportunity&#151;two years from the enactment of the Bill, say&#151;to determine whether their preferred way works without having any serious impact on civil liberties or whether we should revisit the matter, giving the Legal Services Commission the task of determining whether there is an arguable case, and that those putting it forward should be in no doubt that their costs will be paid. I ask my noble friend whether this idea is worth contemplating, as I believe it is.
</p>




<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="40706-23_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, in responding to what have been clear and succinct speeches, I shall set out the Government&#039;s position pretty fully. That is not because I want to weary the House but if, as may well be the case, we come back to these issues time and time again&#151;and I hope that I have the attention of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, on this point&#151;it is fair that noble Lords should understand why the Government are doing this and the force of their position in this respect, so that there is no misunderstanding.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_736"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 736</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40706-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>When we originally introduced the Bill into this House, we had sought to remove judicial review. We did so not for any flippant or frivolous reasons but because we have a duty to this country to try to make the asylum system work. This is in the interests of those who claim refuge in our society but also in the interests of the taxpayer, the efficient use of public money and the confidence of our society that the Government are addressing the issue of asylum properly as well as addressing asylum abuse properly.
</p>

<a name="40706-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>We listened to noble Lords when they said that they   felt that ousting judicial review was going too far, and we listened seriously. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, had the courtesy to acknowledge that when my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor put before the House why we had listened and why we were going to change. But make no mistake&#151;we are not embarking on a process to recreate, amendment by amendment, the old two-tier system of appeals from the original decision process that we currently have. That is for a very good reason. While undoubtedly there are some people who ought to have had further consideration, in practice the process has led to abuse. If this House is party to perpetuating such abuse, the public will express their views on the matter very clearly and strongly. I make a distinction between abuse and trying to ensure that we uphold the civilised standards that we are proud of in our society.
</p>

<a name="40706-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>So we are not going to allow the recreation of a bells and whistles two-tier system which has been the central thrust of this part of the Bill. Why not? First, there is the issue of cost. The cost of legal aid for asylum and immigration cases went from &#163;53 million in 1998&#150;99 to &#163;176 million in 2002&#150;03, while the most recent figure is nearer &#163;200 million. There are plenty of good uses for &#163;200 million.
</p>

<a name="40706-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>The cost of an individual pursuing an appeal through to judicial review is probably about &#163;4,000. Of course it is right and proper that such an individual should be legally aided by the state if there is serious merit in his or her case, but it is not right and proper for the state to fund an appeal when there is not serious merit in the case. Our society would hold us, as a House, in contempt if we were not able to make that distinction.
</p>

<a name="40706-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>There is also the issue of delay. The consequence of a byzantine structure of appeals, which is what we are trying to demolish, is that it takes well over a year&#151;more than 62 weeks&#151;for a person who is persistent with their legal adviser and uses every single step of the process to bring the matter to a conclusion. We are seeking to put in place a system that is fair to the appellant but can nevertheless be concluded within 20   weeks or so.
</p>

<a name="40706-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>The effect of a long-running process also matters. Europol&#151;not me and not the Home Office&#151;estimates that 70 per cent of people who come into the EU are facilitated in doing so by criminal gangs. It is self-evident that they have to have assistance to get to Britain, either through false means of transportation or forged documentation. This is a criminally run and criminally supported business. One of the reasons that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_737"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 737</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

it is a good business for criminals is that people will pay them substantial sums of money to try to get into Britain and pursue an asylum claim.
</p>

<a name="40706-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>Britain is attractive because the process is long and slow, and removals are difficult. Countries where the process is rapid and removals are certain are a much less attractive proposition for a facilitator who is trying to extract &#163;5,000 from somebody in the Indian subcontinent who wants to get into another country. That is why it matters.
</p>

<a name="40706-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>The final reason why the process matters is that wider society in Britain does not believe that the Government or Parliament are able to make that distinction between people who are genuine asylum cases and those who, supported by criminals, are able to make claims that are not genuine and have a state-funded process that supports them in doing so. That undermines the confidence of society in government and the administration of justice. More seriously, it also undermines the public&#039;s belief that people who are granted asylum in our society are genuinely deserving of the refuge that this country gives. That matters in terms of our society. I do not want, nor should this House want, society to think that asylum recipients are liars, cheats, crooks or frauds. That terribly damages community cohesion.
</p>

<a name="40706-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>I have set out with no apology why that matters and why I fear noble Lords will be hearing me say it on a number of occasions again in the future, if, as I fear, both opposition parties choose to ignore that serious picture and vote against what we are proposing.
</p>

<a name="40706-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>I turn to the specifics of the issue. Approximately 70   per cent of people who are given a &quot;no&quot; decision by IND lodge an appeal. In many ways, one would expect them to do so. Of that 70 per cent who have had their case heard by the independent tribunal, which has not found that they deserve asylum according to our laws and international standards, about 50 per cent then appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. The noble Lord, Lord Newton, who is in his place&#151;

Without being too sharp about it, the lawyer has absolutely nothing to lose by taking cases that do not have serious merit, or even reasonable grounds to argue, to the next stage of appeal because they are fully funded by the state in doing so. Therefore, we have a system which provides an incentive <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_738"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 738</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

for both applicant and lawyer to play it long. That produces the serious, negative consequences that I have   described. Those consequences matter to this Government and they matter to this society.
</p>

<a name="40706-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>Finally, I shall speak to the summary figures. If one looks at the number of people who appeal from the decision of the adjudicator to a higher tier of process and if one then tracks the figures around the system, only one in 10 of those people who appeal against an adjudicator&#039;s decision has that decision changed at the end of the process. If one wanted evidence of abuse, that figure would provide it. I have identified the motivation for abuse, but that figure demonstrates that there is abuse in the system. Only one in 10 cases actually leads to a change in decision.
</p>

<a name="40706-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>The statistics are complex. I have put a letter in the Library of the House which explains why I am absolutely confident that that is a true and fair figure. It is the figure that should be sitting over this debate. We are not talking about a system where there is no problem and which we do not need to worry about sorting out. We need to worry about sorting it out extremely seriously and I shall watch with interest how the respective parties vote on these issues if the House divides.
</p>

<a name="40706-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>That is why the appeal system matters and why the Government are committed to trying to do something about it. I shall now say where the amendments are deficient and why I do not agree with them. I shall also, as I hope is my wont, signal where there may be some common ground. I shall be interested to see whether there is any common ground on these issues.
</p>

<a name="40706-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>I turn briefly to the process. Section 103D was part of the package of amendments that was introduced to replace the judicial review ouster with a new system of access to the higher courts. It is central to ensuring that   only those with a genuine claim apply for review and to discouraging abuse. I have spoken about the abuse and I shall not repeat that. In exceptional circumstances, the High Court will have the power to order legal aid to be paid for the review process. An example of an exceptional circumstance might be a case where, on consideration of the review application, the High Court referred it to the Court of Appeal because it raised a question of law of general importance to the system. In those cases, it is right and proper that legal aid should be awarded, as I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, would recognise.

</p>

<a name="40706-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>Under those new arrangements, we are asking lawyers to share the risk with the taxpayer when deciding whether a case should be pursued beyond the single tier. If we went along with the thrust of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart&#151;for whom I have the greatest respect and who I know has tabled it from good principles&#151;the broad consequence would be that virtually any appellant would be able to argue that there was some reasonable grounds. One would need an absolutely hopeless lawyer or an absolutely hopeless case, or both, not to be able to find some reasonable <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_739"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 739</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

ground for lodging an appeal. The consequence of no reasonable grounds is that virtually everybody would continue to receive legal aid, even for cases&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_177"></a>
<a name="40706-24_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware of the famous remark of one appellate judge; that the fact that a case has been argued for a week does not mean that is an arguable case?
</p>




<p><a name="st_178"></a>
<a name="40706-24_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   Yes, my Lords, I take the point. Without speaking at great length, while it is, on the face of it, seductive to the House to think that there are no reasonable grounds, I envisage the consequences of that being our finding ourselves very much where we are now. And where we are now is very unsatisfactory for the reasons that I have given.
</p>

<a name="40706-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>Some of the debate will turn on whether it is reasonable to put the burden on the lawyer to make a judgment about whether he should take a case to appeal. The lawyers who are making that judgment will already know the case, because, in most cases, they will have advised the applicant on legal aid when he was making his appeal to the IND. They will have advised the applicant when he made his application to the IAT. Therefore, they will know the facts and the strength of that case. Essentially, the system will be that they should be rewarded on success and that they should be rewarded on near-misses. They should be rewarded at a higher rate than would normally be the case so that they are compensated for the risk that they take, because none of us can perfectly judge which case is a winner or even which is a near miss. Our intent is not to squeeze out of the system those cases which have reasonable grounds for being argued&#151;those cases should be brought forward. Nor is it our intention to make the legislation so stringent that a good asylum lawyer cannot make a judgment where he thinks that the case has legs and should have a hearing. If he gets that wrong, one wants him to be in a position whereby, on swings and roundabouts over time, sufficient legal aid is granted as to continue an adequate supply of lawyers. Therefore, central to our thinking is that one has to pitch the legal aid, by whatever mechanism&#151;there could be variability in it or a debate about it&#151;so that there is an adequate supply of lawyers who are prepared to come forward and take cases that should be taken up because they have merit. However, we have to squeeze out those cases where there are no reasonable grounds for believing that there has been an error of law on the part of the AIT and that, therefore, they justify a reconsideration.
</p>

<a name="40706-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>At previous stages of the debate, I have been asked why the LSC should do not all of that. There are two reasons for that. First, the LSC will add a further delay to the loop. Secondly, it is extremely difficult, just on the basis of the case that is presented on paper by the appellant&#039;s solicitor, to make a judgment about whether that case has strong merit. Therefore what happens is that such cases are put through and it is only when the full case is argued before the AIT on reconsideration that anyone apart from the lawyer will be in a position to make a judgment about whether the case had serious merit or not. The approach involves <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_740"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 740</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

those reasons and not any flippant reasons. If we could have done it another way we would have given it serious consideration, but it does not actually work in practice if we are to achieve what we wish to.
</p>

<a name="40706-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>The mechanism of trying to incentivise lawyers to bring forward good cases&#151;and to reward them at a level that ensures that they do so and take a reasonable level of risk&#151;has to be crafted in detail through regulations. Those require a serious discussion with the professions to get the level right to ensure there is an adequacy of supply. That is not a flippant but a serious point. We want to ensure that there is adequacy of supply so that they do take those judgments and risks. We cannot calibrate the detail of that now.
</p>

<a name="40706-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>Amendment No. 26 would enable the High Court power to award legal aid for review applications even if the application was dismissed. That is totally at odds with the policy underpinning the proposals, which is to encourage lawyers to focus on meritorious cases. Paying legal aid for unsuccessful applications will not give the deterrent effect that is so crucial to ensure lawyers do not flood the High Court and the tribunal with weak cases.
</p>

<a name="40706-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>Amendment No. 28 gives the High Court power to order legal aid to be paid for reconsideration. Again that undermines the policy intention. It is important to understand the process. The review stage is a gateway. It will be a paper-based process and the High Court will only be engaged in deciding whether the tribunal might have made an error of law that affected the outcome. If it does make that decision, it will order the tribunal to consider the case in practice.
</p>

<a name="40706-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>On reconsideration, parties to the appeal will be able to make oral representations and the tribunal will have the opportunity to examine cases fully. It is inappropriate for the High Court, at an ex parte hearing, to make a definitive ruling binding on the tribunal. That judgment should be made at the tribunal, as I think the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, accepted when he spoke in his support for some of the amendments.
</p>

<a name="40706-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>Let me give an illustration of why that is so. We have some experience from, I think, May 2003 to April 2004 on statutory&#151;
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040706/text/40706-25.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_179"></a>
<a name="40706-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, I do not know if it will help the Minister, but I said in opening that I was not intending to press Amendment No. 28.
</p>




<p><a name="st_180"></a>
<a name="40706-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. He is quite right. Perhaps I will spare him some of my further dire statistics, but I can no doubt share them with him on another occasion.
</p>

<a name="40706-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>On Amendment No. 29, if the High Court thinks a review application has no merit, the amendment requires it to issue a certificate to that effect. I recognise the intention behind the amendment, but it is not necessary.
</p>

<a name="40706-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, knows, under the Government&#039;s proposals, which will be detailed in the regulations made in due course, we foresee the High Court will order legal aid to be paid only in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_741"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 741</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

exceptional cases&#151;for example, as we stated explicitly in Clause 103D(1) where the court refers a case to the Court of Appeal. In the majority of cases the High Court is only dealing with ex parte application and will not play a part in ordering legal aid to be paid. It will be for the tribunal. Amendments Nos. 30 and 31 require the tribunal to award legal aid in every case unless there were no reasonable grounds for doing so. I have spoken to that already and shown the dire consequences that would come about.
</p>

<a name="40706-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>Amendment No. 32 removes from the Bill the power to award different payments to different cases, based on the outcome of the case. What I heard from the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&#151;no doubt he will correct me if I heard wrongly&#151;was that while he did not like conditional fees&#151;I think he went so far as to say that they were wrong&#151;he did agree that for having an effective control system, costs had to be awarded retrospectively at the discretion of the tribunal. We are four square on that point.
</p>

<a name="40706-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>The noble Lord also said that he was perfectly comfortable with a robust merits test. What I understand by that is that he would see that there should be the payment of legal aid, clearly on cases that succeeded, and no doubt also, without putting words into his mouth, on cases that had merit or strong merit. Therefore I infer from what he said that there should be a flat fee on all such cases. It is possible that we are talking about whether there should be a two-stage fee or a flat fee, perhaps at a higher level than the lower level might be on a two-stage fee, applied for perhaps a tightly limited number of cases.
<a name="time_24"></a>
<a name="40706-25_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40706-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>If that is what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, intended&#151;I am not getting a response; yes I am&#151;I do not think the difference between us is necessarily massive. But no doubt he will correct me if I am wrong.
</p>

<a name="40706-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>I have gone on long enough. I am glad to hear that I have the House&#039;s support on that as ever. But my length is for a reason. If we do not get this matter right&#151;if this House does something to the Bill that means we fundamentally do not fulfil the duty we have to the country in being fair to asylum seekers, yet also controlling abuse of the system&#151;we will be rightly pilloried, but also the issue will return to your Lordships&#039; House. It is as well that noble Lords understand why we feel strongly on this issue.
</p>

<a name="40706-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>Before the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, interrupts, I conclude that I agree with him that as regards the system that we intend to put in place&#151;with or without modifications, if there is scope for modifications&#151;we would be very happy to give a commitment that we will review its operation over a two-year period and will put the report of that review into the Library of the House, so that it is there for inspection, debate and evaluation. I hope that answers the point of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_742"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 742</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40706-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>I hope that with those reasons the House will not feel it necessary to move to a Division because I have clearly signalled my willingness to debate within the parameters on which I had a discussion with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland.
</p>




<p><a name="st_181"></a>
<a name="40706-25_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, for those remarks. The position is this: we have put our names to Amendment No. 26&#151;it is a joint amendment&#151;and Amendments Nos. 32 and 34. Those amendments seek to remove the conditional fee system from the Bill. As far as we are concerned, those amendments are unnegotiable. We find a conditional fee system unacceptable.
</p>

<a name="40706-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>However, for my part, if the noble Lord were prepared to say that he would go off to another place and introduce a system based on merits with a robust merits test, but which applied equally to winners or losers without any distinction between the two&#151;if he were prepared to give that commitment on the Floor of the House&#151;then I would be prepared to leave the noble Lord to fulfil that commitment in another place and see what came back to your Lordships&#039; House as a consequence.
</p>




<p><a name="st_182"></a>
<a name="40706-25_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, I will respond to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. Although I have probably implied as much in what I said, but let me spell out our view for the avoidance of doubt. We are not wedded to the finest detail of the proposed mechanism. We are wedded to a system that focuses legal aid tightly on those cases which have real merit. That is for good reason. That means the decision can be made only at the end of the process by the tribunal. The detail has to be worked out in regulations, for good not flippant reasons, because one is also partly trying to ensure that whatever system one sets up has an adequacy of supply. You have to have an adequacy otherwise you do not meet the interests of justice.
</p>

<a name="40706-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>If the debate is on how we craft a system that has a robust merits test&#151;&quot;significant merit&quot; are the words that I would tend to look at&#151;we are not wedded to a two-tier system and we are open to looking at introducing amendments that brought in a serious merits test and paid legal aid for cases that won or did not win but met the serious merits test. I give that commitment that we would be happy to do so in another place. I hope that answers the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, clearly and unequivocally.
</p>




<p><a name="st_183"></a>
<a name="40706-25_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, our amendments meet absolutely the legitimate intention of the Government to cut expenses, because they would make the award of legal aid retrospective, so that it would not be granted when the application for reconsideration was made on unreasonable grounds. The Minister shakes his head, but he said during the course of this debate that the Government&#039;s aim was to squeeze out cases in which <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_743"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 743</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

there were no reasonable grounds. That is exactly our aim too. The problem is that the Minister&#039;s draft of these clauses will squeeze out not only cases in which there are no reasonable grounds but those in which there are reasonable grounds.
</p>




<p><a name="st_184"></a>
<a name="40706-25_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, I hope that I understand the position taken by the noble Lord. Noble Lords have corrected me previously, but I have said quite a lot. Essentially, I am convinced, as are our lawyers and officials, that the effect of the noble Lord&#039;s amendment would be that we would rapidly have a very large number of cases with pretty weak merits coming through the system, legally aided by the state. We would be recreating the two-tier system with all the negative consequences that I have set out.
</p>




<p><a name="st_185"></a>

They were tabled before I received his letter, which he sent me on 30 June. This could be partly my fault, as I do not have a secretary in Westminster to check my mail when I am not here. The internal mail seems occasionally <br>&nbsp;<br>

to emulate second-class post, and as nothing had appeared by early Thursday afternoon, I caught up with the letter only yesterday.
</p>

<a name="40706-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>It was particularly useful that he pinned down for   us   that the Scottish Parliament will provide accommodation for 105 MSPs and their staff. I am not sure whether there has been a reappraisal of the needs of the staff, but I understand some of the inquiries have shown that the first estimate for the building was for some 16,000 square metres, which later had to be revised to 23,000 square metres, and now stands at 31,000 square metres. Whatever else, it must surely be adequate for the purpose.

</p>

<a name="40706-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>The amendment once more raises the issue I brought up at Committee stage as to whether references relate to the Scottish Parliament or to our Westminster Parliament here. On reading the Minister&#039;s answer about references to &quot;Parliament&quot;, I find myself somewhat perplexed. Clause 3 of the Bill talks about &quot;money provided by Parliament&quot;&#151;that is, as the Minister assured me, this Parliament and not the Scottish one. I then mentioned the reference in Schedule 1 to the laying of the Electoral Commission&#039;s report before Parliament. The Minister confirmed that my interpretation was correct, and that the schedule referred to the Westminster Parliament. However, he then went on to explain that, as Schedule 1 replaced Schedule 1 to the Scotland Act 1998, definitions would follow those set out in Section 126 of that Act, where references to the &quot;the Parliament&quot; mean the Scottish Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40706-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>These two statements seem to be contradictory, and for the purposes of clarity I have tabled Amendment No. 1 to make absolutely clear how &quot;Parliament&quot; is to be understood in sub-paragraphs (9) and (11). If Section 126(1) of the Scotland Act defines &quot;Parliament&quot; as the Scottish Parliament, surely we need to make certain that, for these references in Schedule 1, it is the national Parliament at Westminster, and not the Scottish Parliament, before which the Electoral Commission should lay its report. I beg to move.

</p>

<p><a name="st_189"></a>
<a name="40706-26_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </b>   My Lords, I regret to say to the noble Duke that I think his amendment is wrong. I am happy with the idea that the expression &quot;the Parliament&quot; means the Scottish Parliament. I also think, in terms of the content, that it would be entirely right for the Electoral Commission to report to the Scottish Parliament about Scottish parliamentary constituencies.

<a name="40706-26_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, unfortunately for the noble Earl, what we are discussing is what the Government mean in the Bill, not what the noble Earl would like it to mean. That being the case, the clarity here is extremely important. When we are talking about who does what, and whether one Parliament or the other pays, or has to decide, or has orders laid before it, it is essential that the Bill is completely clear. I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, who replied at the last stage, and admitted that parliamentary draftsmen often thought things were a bit clearer than other people thought they were, or words to that effect. It is absolutely right to try to clarify this matter. I hope <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_746"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 746</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Minister has had permission to accept this amendment, or to clarify to some extent what is meant, because the answer we had before was fairly convoluted, and this is an important point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_191"></a>
<a name="40706-26_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, and the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, for their comments.
</p>

<a name="40706-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>I say at the outset that the letter of the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, was an attempt to clarify what has been a confusing issue. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, that the matter should be absolutely clear. I hope that during the next couple of minutes I can clarify matters to the satisfaction of the House. I, too, was slightly confused but, after reading carefully my speaking note, I saw the light. I hope that noble Lords will see the light as well.
</p>

<a name="40706-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>As I say, we have sympathy with the noble Duke&#039;s concern to have clear legislation and ease of reference for those who have to use it. However, on this occasion I believe that some of the apparent difficulties may arise from the nature and purpose of the Bill not being wholly appreciated. The Bill is not a freestanding measure. We have to understand that the Bill simply replaces Schedule 1 to the Scotland Act in its entirety, I should emphasise, rather than by making specific textual amendments to the existing schedule, precisely because the draftsman saw this as the most satisfactory way to achieve clarity and readability. Since the new schedule will substitute the existing one to the Scotland Act, it has to be understood and interpreted within the context of that Act as a whole.
</p>

<a name="40706-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>The noble Duke said in Committee that for ease of reference and the saving of time, the Bill&#039;s architects should ensure that throughout the Bill reference to &quot;Parliament&quot; should mean Westminster. Otherwise, where it did not, it should be qualified. I can reassure the noble Duke and other noble Lords that that is in fact the approach taken in the Bill, although we concede that it may not be quite as obvious as he would wish.
</p>

<a name="40706-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>All references to &quot;Parliament&quot;, without the definite article prefixed, are to be understood following established usage in legislation as referring to the United Kingdom Parliament. However, as my noble friend Lord Filkin explained in Committee, under the interpretation provision in the Scotland Act, at Section 126(1), any references to &quot;the Parliament&quot;&#151;that is, with the definite article prefixed&#151;are to be interpreted as meaning the Scottish Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40706-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>I know that that may not provide sufficient clarity to assuage the noble Duke, but I hope he will accept that at least there is a system of differentiation in operation within the Scotland Act&#151;without having to look outside the legislation itself&#151;which consistently distinguishes between the Westminster and Scottish Parliaments.
</p>

<a name="40706-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>I now turn specifically to the effect of this amendment. I have to point out&#151;in the light of the explanation provided above&#151;that if it were accepted, the amendment would in fact relate both provisions to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_747"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 747</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the United Kingdom Parliament. However, this would defeat the intention of paragraph 3(11), which is to ensure that the Electoral Commission&#039;s report is put before the Scottish Parliament at the same time as it is submitted to the Secretary of State. So, if the amendment were accepted, the currently existing duty to inform the Scottish Parliament directly of recommended changes to its constituencies would be deleted. We believe that that would be a most serious discourtesy.
</p>

<a name="40706-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>As I said earlier, I understand and have sympathy with the noble Duke&#039;s concerns here, but a consistent approach has been adopted in the drafting of this Bill&#151;although perhaps a very subtle one&#151;and the amendment itself would upset the purpose of the provision that it would affect. I hope that with that explanation the noble Duke will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="40706-26_spnew5"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   My Lords, I am very interested in the noble Lord&#039;s reply which, so far as I can see, has given a whole new power and meaning to the word &quot;the&quot;. In Committee I suggested that sub-paragraph (11) should include the words &quot;Scottish Parliament&quot; in order to make it slightly more obvious. Sub-paragraph (11) refers to &quot;the Parliament&quot; but it is interesting to discover that this is a matter of differentiation.
</p>

<a name="40706-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>It is a great relief to hear that the Minister was correct in referring us to the definition in Section 126(1) of the Scotland Act, because the way the argument was developing, it sounded horribly as if he had given the wrong definition.

</p>

<a name="40706-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>As the Minister knows, we had very little sympathy in Committee and even at Second Reading for the fact that the Government had ended up by having four different methods of voting and representation in Scotland. We will have the local government constituency, the European constituency, the Westminster constituency, and the Edinburgh constituency, each of which may have a different method of voting. Can one imagine anything more complicated for the Scottish public than four systems and four constituencies? The Westminster constituencies will be new ones, of course, so there will be five issues to upset the public in Scotland.
</p>

<a name="40706-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>The Deputy Prime Minister and others have spent a great deal of time saying that we should increase the percentage of votes at elections, that we should have postal votes, and goodness knows what else. All they have achieved so far, however, is a monumental difficulty for the average person to know in which constituency, how they are voting, and who their representatives might be. We also have, in the European Parliament, voting for parties rather than individuals&#151;which I think is totally wrong in the modern world.
</p>

<a name="40706-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>The key point here is that my noble friend has recommended a timetable. If we look at the present schedule, nothing need happen before 2010, which is six years away. In the light of what I have said about the shambles of the different constituencies and voting systems, I think that we have to get on with it a great deal quicker.
</p>

<a name="40706-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>While I do not necessarily say, as my noble friend says, that we have the right timing, the Minister could bring forward an amendment at Third Reading which <br>&nbsp;<br>

would speed up all the procedures by the Boundary Committee and the Electoral Commission. Between those two bodies and a general letting things drift, we will find that it will be 2010 before people know where we are in relation to half of the constituencies, boundaries and systems in Scotland.
</p>

<a name="40706-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>There is a great deal to be said for getting on with the review after the next election and not letting it drift on to 2010. I should have thought that two years after the next election would be more than adequate. The Government should think of a form of words and an amendment, in order to bring about a little more speed in this regard.

<p><a name="st_196"></a>
<a name="40706-27_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </b>   My Lords, the timetable proposed by the noble Duke is perhaps desirable, but I doubt that it needs to be on the face on the Bill.

<a name="40706-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>If the Minister is to tell us that this is all taken care of in the letter, there is no point in our proceeding further. Assuming that is not the case, however, I would like to associate myself with what the noble Lord, Lord Monro of Langholm, said.

We wait with interest to hear what the Minister has to say.

<p><a name="st_198"></a>
<a name="40706-27_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, when the Minister replies, will he bear in mind while these reviews are being undertaken that they are upsetting to local activists, because alterations to boundaries alter the way those people work and change many matters to which they must have regard when they are making submissions and so on? A review of boundaries is not a peaceful affair. The public does not worry as much about it. The Minister may well say that and he may be right, because the public do not realise what happens. But I know what it is like to live in an area which is about to move constituencies. I do not know in which area I shall have to operate during the general election, the election for the Scottish Parliament or how those areas will overlap. That is worrying. It is important to bear that in mind and the questions should not take too long. They should be as speedy as they conveniently can be.

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 750</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40706-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>The amendment would impose various timetables on the review of Scottish Parliamentary constituencies by the Electoral Commission and its boundary committee for Scotland. As was argued by my noble friend Lord Filkin in Committee, we believe that it would be quite inappropriate for this House, as part of its consideration of the Bill, to start challenging and changing matters that will in due course become part of the core responsibilities of the independent Electoral Commission and its boundary committees.
</p>

<a name="40706-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>The provisions in the Bill which relate to the review of constituencies are not some quirky, novel invention. Rather, they closely replicate the well established provisions for the review of Westminster constituencies which are set out in the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, supplemented as necessary by additional provisions regarding the regions for list seats in the Scottish Parliament in the Scotland Act. I should remind noble Lords that the Electoral Commission, which has a wide-ranging remit, was established by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. It is a UK-wide body, independent of Government and answerable directly to Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40706-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>The way in which the commission was set up and the means by which it is funded were designed to emphasise its distance from the government of the day. The 2000 Act provides <i>inter alia</i> for the transfer to the Electoral Commission of the functions of the four parliamentary boundary commissions. The Act requires the commission to establish four boundary committees&#151;one for each part of the United Kingdom. It should be obvious that these four committees need to operate under the same principles and carry out their functions in a similar manner.
</p>

<a name="40706-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>However, the present amendments would introduce particular requirements and constraints which would be applied to only one of the four boundary committees&#151;indeed, to only one of the reviews which it would be required to carry out. That cannot be right. Furthermore, the proposed timetables appear far too short and restrictive and would impose controls which   the parent legislation&#151;the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986&#151;on which these parts of the Bill are based, does not require for any of the Westminster boundary reviews.

</p>

<a name="40706-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>I should point out that the current boundary commissions&#151;and in future the Electoral Commission&#151;are required only to submit reports setting out their   recommendations on parliamentary constituency boundaries every eight and 12 years between their previous reports. It is important to note that beyond that requirement they have freedom to report when they see fit.
</p>

<a name="40706-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>As we said in Committee, if such restrictive timetabling as is proposed in the amendment were to be appropriate&#151;and we do not think it is&#151;it should be imposed on all the parliamentary reviews across the United Kingdom. The Boundary Commission and other interested bodies would almost certainly have to be consulted on both the principle and details before such far reaching changes were considered for adoption.

<a name="40706-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>I must repeat that the Government can see no justifiable case for departing unilaterally from the accepted review mechanism, which will continue to operate in relation to Westminster parliamentary constituencies. This is not the time to make such far reaching and important changes to the review of matters that go to the heart of the democratic process. Having heard this explanation, I hope that the noble Duke will withdraw his amendment.

<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>The noble Duke said: My Lords, this matter was dealt with to some extent in the letter that the Minister sent me. It probes the drafting of paragraph 6(8) which refers to the validity of Orders in Council. I raised the issue in Committee. When I challenged the Minister about what &quot;purporting to be&quot; meant, he commented:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a>&quot;I will check it, but I assume that the phrase takes its natural meaning from the Bill: &#039;seeming to mean&#039; and &#039;appearing to mean&#039;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 21/6/04; col. 1097.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>However, in his letter the Minister brings out the point that &quot;purporting to be&quot; is meant to apply if the order is challenged. There is nothing else in the Bill that deals with the challenging of Orders in Council. Perhaps we are supposed to take that interpretation, but our concern is that &quot;purporting&quot; has the connotation of something appearing to be what it is not. I mentioned in Committee the possibility of a counterfeit order. As paragraph 6(8) is drafted, any counterfeit order could not have its validity called into question in legal proceedings.
</p>

<a name="40706-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>According to paragraph 6(8), the Order in Council being challenged would have been approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament and so would already have been open to being challenged there.

I believe that it belongs to the same context as the expressions &quot;pretending to the throne&quot; or &quot;a pretender&quot;. The old meaning was clear: the person had a good claim to the throne.

I was fascinated by the part that covered this subject because it almost confirmed what we were saying from this side of the House about the word &quot;purporting&quot;. It seems that that word must be used because, if a Minister has a shot at making an order and it is challenged and falls, it is an order that never was. Therefore, it is all right to say that it was &quot;purporting to be&quot; an order. It may be an order which turns into an order. That seems to be what this is all about. I was fascinated by this matter. I have always wondered what the word &quot;purporting&quot; means and that seems to be it&#151;it allows for an order to fall.

A copy went to the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, and to the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, and a copy was placed in the House Library. But I think that it will be best if tomorrow we arrange for the letter to be sent to everyone who has taken part in this debate. If we need to discuss certain issues further, we shall be happy to do so outside the Chamber or at the next stage of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40706-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>The words &quot;purporting to be made&quot; have caused some confusion. It took two discussions with officials and another one with a QC for me to understand what it meant. I always thought that &quot;purporting&quot; meant pretending or whatever. But I think that we have to consider this matter in a legal context. The word is being used in this clause but it is used in many orders and it has an accepted definition.
</p>

<a name="40706-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>I shall try to respond to the concern raised in Committee and again today about the inclusion of terminology which refers to an Order in Council &quot;purporting to be&quot; made. The noble Duke argued that either an order had been made under this schedule or it had not. He raised, as he has done again today, the appalling prospect of &quot;counterfeit&quot; orders which could not be called into question or challenged.
</p>

<a name="40706-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>I hope that I can reassure the noble Duke and other noble Lords that there is little or no chance of such a fraudulent or malicious order being passed by this <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_753"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 753</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

House. If Parliament were ever to pass an order which was in some way wrong, it would always be open to the Government and Parliament to undo that error.
</p>

<a name="40706-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>However, that is not the background to this provision. The noble Duke received a letter in which my noble friend Lord Filkin explained why Orders in Council were described as &quot;purporting to be&quot; made. For the benefit of those who have not seen the letter, I shall repeat the reason that it sets out.
</p>

<a name="40706-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>As my noble friend indicated, the purpose of a challenge to the validity of an order would be to have it declared invalid. If there were claimed to be an error or some procedural defect in the making of an order, it could be argued that, as a matter of law, the order had not been made and was legally invalid. A tiny error could mean that the order was legally invalid. Therefore, if the amendment were carried, such an order would not be protected from court scrutiny as the amendment would protect only orders. It could be argued that legally the instrument being challenged was not an order.
</p>

<a name="40706-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>As orders that have been approved in draft by resolution of each House of Parliament should be above question in legal proceedings, the draftsman is required to protect documents that purport to be an order to prevent this argument being used to introduce scrutiny in legal proceedings. Orders are therefore all described as purporting to be made.
</p>

<a name="40706-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>If this phrase were not included, it would open the Order in Council up to&#151;possibly mischievous&#151;legal proceedings in the courts in some circumstances. This could have serious consequences for the conduct of future elections while the matter remained under dispute. The intention therefore is to prohibit such a challenge where the order has been approved by Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40706-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>But as I said earlier, if in the very unlikely event that Parliament should ever become concerned about any aspect of an order, then of course we could look into this and rectify the matter. That would be for Parliament to decide upon and not the courts.
</p>

<a name="40706-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>I hope that this explanation is clear. I would like to stress that this word is not being used simply in this Bill; it is used with all orders. I hope that the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, will withdraw his amendment.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>The noble Duke said: My Lords, I can be extremely brief with this final amendment. Again, the Minister has addressed this matter in his letter.
</p>

<a name="40706-28_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>Throughout the Committee stage of this Bill when we queried some of the points of detail in Schedule 1, the Minister returned again and again to the sanctity of the Parliamentary Constituency Act 1986. Interestingly, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a>&quot;The electoral arrangements and the ways in which the boundaries of constituencies are reviewed separate from government&#151;dealt with in the Parliamentary Constituencies Act&#151;should not be changed for one part of the United Kingdom on the back of a specific piece of legislation, even when it is about such an important part of the United Kingdom&#151;namely, Scotland&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 21/6/04; col. 1096.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-28_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>In reference to the rules which we have in Schedule 1, I now understand that they are based on the same rules contained in the Parliamentary Constituencies Act. Rule 2(2) mirrors rule 5 of that former Act and rule 3 mirrors rule 6. For rule 4, however, the idea is similar but the drafting of the rule differs from that of rule 7 in the 1986 Act.
</p>

<a name="40706-28_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>Our amendment would change the drafting of rule 4 to make it identical to rule 7 of the 1986 Act. In his letter the Minister refers to the change as being in the modern style. Perhaps he could explain to us what difference the variation in the drafting makes? Is there an aversion in the modern style to the wording that mentions the &quot;duty&quot; of the Electoral Commission? I almost expect that soon the wording would include the word &quot;choice&quot; rather than &quot;duty&quot;. I beg to move.

<a name="40706-29_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </b>   My Lords, this amendment gives a rather harsh replacement to the original text. It is important that rule 4 be retained as an override over the previous three rules. My previous Western Isles amendment revolved around the powers in rule 4.
</p>




<p><a name="st_208"></a>
<a name="40706-29_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting </b>  : My Lords, I appreciate that the wording in the amendment replicates that which is used in paragraph 7 of Schedule 2 to the Parliamentary Constituencies Act   1986. On this occasion I acknowledge that we cannot fall back on the argument that the provisions in this Bill are the same as those in the 1986 Act and therefore must not be changed.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a>The noble Duke suggested in Committee that rule 4 in the Bill appeared to be a slightly racier version of the similar provisions in the 1986 Act and he thought that not aiming to give full effect was less instructive and produced something that was confusing and nebulous. I am afraid that I have to disappoint him. This provision in the Bill is not materially different from that in the 1986 Act. As my noble friend Lord Filkin indicated to the noble Duke in his recent letter to him, having consulted the draftsman, there is no difference in meaning between rule 4 in the Bill and a similar rule in the 1986 Act. It is, as the letter said&#151;the noble Duke <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="time_28"></a>
<a name="40706-29_time0"></a><h5></h5>


<p><a name="st_210"></a>
<a name="40706-29_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting </b>   rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 20 May be approved [<i>20th Report from the Joint Committee</i>].

</p>




<p><a name="st_211"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, with your Lordships&#039; permission, we can conveniently consider two further instruments being made under powers provided by the Scotland Act 1998. They are the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman Act 2002 (Consequential Provisions and Modifications) Order 2004 and the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002 (Consequential Modifications) Order 2004. It has become common practice to batch instruments being made under the Scotland Act to make the best use of scarce parliamentary time.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a>The first instrument is being made under Section 63 of the Scotland Act. The two further instruments are being made under Section 104 of the Scotland Act. Many noble Lords are familiar with these powers, which rather than relating to substantive policy issues are technical in nature. But I hope it will be helpful to outline briefly what the powers under the Scotland Act allow us to do when explaining the policy background to the orders. Before doing so, I should emphasise that the orders have been scrutinised by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and the Lords Merits Committee. They have also been agreed to by the Scottish Executive and relevant Whitehall departments.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>I turn, first, to the Scotland Act 1998 (Transfer of Functions to the Scottish Ministers etc.) Order 2004, which is being made under the powers provided by Section 63 of the Scotland Act. The Scotland Act recognised that, in some cases, it would be appropriate for Scottish Ministers to be able to exercise executive functions in areas where primary legislation continues to be a matter for Westminster. That is the process known as executive devolution. It should be noted that executive, not legislative, competence is transferred under that process. In other words, the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament is not varied where the Scottish Ministers are given power to carry out the function.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>Section 63 of the Scotland Act allows functions, so far as they are exercisable in or regards Scotland, to be exercisable by the Scottish Ministers, instead of, or concurrently with, a Minister of the Crown. It also allows for functions to be carried out by a Minister of the Crown with the agreement of, or after consultation with, the Scottish Ministers.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_756"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 756</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40706-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>Orders made under Section 63 are also considered by the Scottish Parliament. This order was considered and agreed by the Scottish Parliament&#039;s Communities Committee on the 9 June. A Standing Committee in the other place considered and agreed the order on the 24 June. The order transfers functions in two distinct areas. The first relates to the approval of a co-operative housing association, whose registered office is in Scotland, in connection with a claim for tax relief purposes under Section 488 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. The second concerns the executive devolution to Scottish Ministers of concurrent powers to make regulations for Scotland under Sections 4 and 6 of the Fireworks Act 2003.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>I shall set out the content of these two parts of the order in a little more detail. Further information on the policy background and an explanation of what each article of the order does can be found in the Explanatory Memorandum, copies of which can be obtained from the Printed Paper Office.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>Section 488 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 provides that a co-operative housing association which meets the criteria set down in the Act can make a claim to the Inland Revenue for certain tax reliefs and exemptions.


</p>

<a name="40706-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>At present, the function of approving an association for the purposes of Section 488 is carried out in Scotland by a Minister of the Crown. Before devolution, officials in the former Scottish Office had delegated authority from the Secretary of State to confirm approval to the housing co-operative and its accountants for the purpose of Section 488. However, this function is not within the competence of the Scottish Ministers.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>Such approvals do not arise very frequently in Scotland&#151;as little as one every six or seven years. However, it is expedient and sensible for these consents to be issued by the Scottish Ministers since, after devolution, the expertise and resources lie within the Scottish Executive. The Government and the Scottish Executive have therefore agreed that it is appropriate for this function to be transferred.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>I should add that the order does not transfer the function of setting out the criteria against which a housing co-operative&#039;s eligibility is to be tested. That function will continue to be discharged by UK Ministers.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a>I hope it is helpful to noble Lords if I explain a further feature of this element of the order. Executive devolution requires the functions in question to be treated as exercisable in, or as regards, Scotland. To do that, the order uses powers under Section 30(3) of the Scotland Act. This power&#151;commonly referred to as a &quot;paving provision&quot;&#151;assists a transfer of function to the Scottish Ministers by specifying the extent to which the functions are to be treatable as exercisable in, or as regards, Scotland.

</p>

<a name="40706-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>In this instance, the functions transfer to the Scottish Ministers only where the housing association&#039;s registered office is in Scotland. For the remainder of Great Britain, the function will continue to reside with UK Ministers.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_757"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 757</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40706-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a>I hope it is helpful to your Lordships if I deal with one final aspect of this part of the order. In another place, a question was asked about whether a claim for tax relief could be retrospective. I should make it clear that the order before us applies only to applications which fall to be dealt with after the order comes into force. Any backdating would be in terms of the existing statutory regime, and not as a consequence of amendments made by this order.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a>The second area with which the Section 63 order deals is the Fireworks Act 2003. Noble Lords will recall that this is an enabling Act, which allows a Minister of the Crown to make regulations in a range of areas in relation to fireworks. The order before us will allow functions that could be currently exercised by a Minister of the Crown to be discharged also by the Scottish Ministers.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a>Section 4 of the Act provides that fireworks regulations can be made that include provision for prohibiting the supply, purchase, possession or use of fireworks during specified hours of the day or in specified circumstances. It also provides for exceptional dispensation from prohibitions to be made, if necessary, in the same regulations.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a>Section 6 of the Act provides that fireworks regulations may include provision prohibiting the operation of public fireworks displays unless specified conditions are complied with. These include the giving of notice and other information, the payment of required fees, training, and prohibiting persons from operating, or assisting in the operation of, displays if they are below a specified age. Section 6 of the Act also provides for exceptions to be made in relation to these conditions, and defines the term &quot;public fireworks display&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a>The order enables the function of making these regulations to be exercisable by the Scottish Ministers. It also confers the function on the Scottish Ministers of certain powers under the Consumer Protection Act   1987, which have been applied to fireworks regulations by the Fireworks Act in relation to offences and enforcement. As stated in the explanatory memorandum, this function is transferred only in relation to Sections 4 and 6 of the Fireworks Act. The reason that only those functions, not all the functions in the Act, are being devolved is that the Act covers a complex mix of reserved and devolved areas. Some aspects of the Act are best dealt with on a GB basis or relate to reserved matters, such as consumer protection. The DTI and the Scottish Executive, who agreed the content of the order before us, will be liaising closely on those issues so there is no risk of conflicting regimes.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a>I turn to the orders being made under Section 104 of the Scotland Act. That section allows for orders considered to be necessary or expedient in consequence of any provision in an Act of the Scottish Parliament. Section 104 orders are usually concerned with modifying areas of law reserved to the UK Parliament or amending the law of England and Wales&#151;and, in some cases, Northern Ireland&#151;in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_758"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 758</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

consequence of an Act of the Scottish Parliament. By definition, it would be outside the competence of the Scottish Parliament to legislate in those areas.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a>As a result, Section 104 orders are considered at Westminster only. In this instance, the Scotland Act requires the orders to be subject to affirmative resolution, as they amend primary legislation. The two Section 104 orders before us were considered and agreed by the other place on 24 June.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a>The main purposes of both Section 104 orders are to remove spent references in the statute book to bodies which have ceased to exist, and to substitute or make provision for references to new bodies. Neither Section   104 order alters the underlying statutory regime in the legislation as amended.

</p>

<a name="40706-29_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a>The first order is made in consequence of the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman Act 2002. That Act of the Scottish Parliament is designed to streamline and improve the public sector complaints system in Scotland. It transferred to the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman (SPSO) powers previously exercised by the Health Service Commissioner for Scotland, the Commissioner for Local Administration in Scotland and the Scottish Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a>A number of articles in the order remove references to the commissioners abolished by the 2002 Act and replace them with references to the ombudsman where necessary. Furthermore, the 2002 Act provides for the ombudsman to co-operate with ombudsmen and commissioners operating elsewhere in the UK in those areas relevant to those officeholders&#039; interests. The draft order makes reciprocal arrangements with other commissioners and ombudsmen.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a>The order also makes provision in respect of the Government. The 2002 Act provides that no person is, or may be required, to supply to the ombudsman information relevant to proceedings of the Scottish Cabinet. The draft order makes similar provision in relation to the UK Cabinet.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a>Noble Lords will wish to note that that is not a new policy proposal. The statutory frameworks that supported the former Scottish parliamentary and health service commissioners contained similar provisions. Precedent therefore exists for recognising that circumstances may arise whereby either of those officers&#039; work could require access to UK Cabinet papers in pursuance of their functions. The responsibilities of both those officeholders transferred to the SPSO.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a>Although it is anticipated that, in practice, the SPSO would rarely have cause to seek sight of UK Cabinet papers, it is sensible that such material should benefit from the protection given by previous ombudsman-related legislation.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a>The 2002 Act also provides that a member of the Scottish Executive may give notice in writing to the   SPSO that documents and information on which the ombudsman has sought disclosure should not be disclosed, as to do so would be contrary to the public interest. The order makes similar provisions for Ministers of the Crown. However, the order does not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_759"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 759</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

undermine the existing regimes on disclosure of information as laid out in, for example, the Freedom of Information Act 2000.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a>In summary, the order as a whole addresses issues   where the framework provided by the 2002 Act has a read across to matters outside the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a>Noble Lords will surely be delighted that I turn finally to the last order before us this evening. It is again being made under Section 104 of the Scotland Act, this time in consequence of the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002. The main purpose of this Act was to provide for the establishment of Scottish Water as the successor to three water and sewerage authorities in Scotland.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a>The effect of the order is to remove any references to the predecessor water and sewerage authorities in the enactments and subordinate legislation and to put references to Scottish Water in their place. It would be outside the competence of the Scottish Parliament to make the vast majority of modifications in the draft order. Thus this order is an exercise in making sure   that the new devolved body is appropriately represented in the statute book. It also makes amendments to reflect the creation of water customer consultation panels by the 2002 Act.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>Eagle-eyed noble Lords may have noticed from paragraph 5 of the Explanatory Memorandum that the draft order does include two modifications to the Transport Acts 1962 and 1968. That would be within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliaments to make. It is not our usual practice to include any modifications in orders under Section 104 to matters within the competence of the Scottish Parliament. However, in this instance, these two modifications have been included, since there is no suitable vehicle before the Scottish Parliament in which they could be included and because we wish to see the statute book as tidy as possible to assist the user. I hope noble Lords will agree that this is an example of sensible and pragmatic partnership between the Government and the Scottish Executive.
</p>

<a name="40706-29_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>These three technical orders are in our view a sensible, expedient and necessary use of the powers under Sections 63 and 104 of the Scotland Act and I commend them to the House. I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>When one tries to bring all these Scottish orders together, the kaleidoscope that appears is quite amazing. I feel that the ancients might have been pleased to see that we were dealing with the three basic elements: fire, air and water.
</p>

<a name="40706-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a>I am sure the Scottish Executive will be pleased that it has powers under the Fireworks Act. It can be a sensitive issue in a local area, when people wish to have regulation to suit their immediate needs. I am glad to hear the Minister say there is a definition of what is a &quot;public display&quot; because in my area a lot of people have fireworks in their back garden. The minute they fire a rocket, it seems to me that it is then almost a public display.
</p>

<a name="40706-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a>I have a few comments about the order on the substitution of Scottish Water for the various authorities in the other Acts. I am fascinated to know whether this was triggered by the EU directive on water or whether it was simply an effort to harmonise charges. I notice that up to last year, 77 per cent of businesses that got water from Scottish Water received an increase in charges, with only 18 per cent receiving a reduction.
</p>

<a name="40706-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a>The water industry commissioner reckoned that there would be an increase in revenue of about &#163;30   million since two years ago. One can understand that some regulations may have to be made, but we hope that this money will be properly used.

<p><a name="st_217"></a>
<a name="40706-30_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Michie of Gallanach: </b>   My Lords, I should like to ask the Minister a question. I appreciate that these draft statutory instruments have to do with modifications, as the Minister explained at some length, and that they are technical in nature. They deal with naming new bodies, and so on. I very much welcome the statutory instrument which allows the transfer of functions to Scottish Ministers. However, I question why the draft statutory instruments on the Scottish public services ombudsman and Scottish Water are being debated here.
</p>

<a name="40706-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a>It is ridiculous that we are debating these matters here, when they should be debated in the Scottish Parliament. As long as these reserved powers are in place, the Government are doing nothing to enhance the stature of the Scottish Parliament. The fact that there are only 10 Members in the Chamber demonstrates the lack of interest there is in Scottish matters. I have no quarrel with that, but I think that Westminster does nothing to help the Scottish Parliament to be responsible and accountable so long as it retains these reserved powers. Why are we debating these matters here when nobody really cares about them and they should be debated in the Scottish Parliament? I know what the Minister&#039;s answer will be.
</p>




<p><a name="st_218"></a>
<a name="40706-30_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, we care about these matters very much. I do not think that we are making policy.
</p>

<a name="40706-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a>The water supply order seems to be a matter of redrafting to include the new titles of the water company. Why has it taken until now to do that, as the Scotland Act was passed so long ago? Is there any reason for that?
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_761"></a>

</p>

<a name="40706-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a>Paragraph 13 of the order dealing with the transfer of functions to Scottish Ministers gives them the job of deciding that a housing association could make a claim for tax purposes. The Minister said that this used to be done by Scottish Office Ministers and was delegated to officials. Does he know whether Scottish Ministers will delegate this to officials, or will they be in a better position to do it themselves? That would be a useful piece of devolution. Could he tell us that?
</p>




<p><a name="st_219"></a>
<a name="40706-30_spnew7"></a><b> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </b>   My Lords, the transfer of functions order can be welcomed as being devolutionary in trend, albeit being only executive devolution from Ministers of the Crown to Scottish Ministers.
</p>

<a name="40706-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a>The transfer of housing association approval for tax purposes strikes me as a tidying-up exercise, as the old Scottish Office used to do this work. This measure is benign and welcome.
</p>

<a name="40706-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a>The other order, covering fireworks, is new because the Act only came into force in 2003. It makes eminent good sense for such domestic activities as fireworks and firework displays to be administered by Scottish Ministers. There is a distinct need for the private use of the noisier fireworks to be controlled, certainly in terms of dates. It seems to me that the season for fireworks in Scotland is becoming ever longer, often to the distress of residents and animals.
</p>

<a name="40706-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a>The order that relates to the Scottish Public Service Ombudsman is unusual in that it is consequential on an Act of the Scottish Parliament. That is a fact for constitutional anoraks. The order allows the Scottish Public Service Ombudsman to consult with other UK ombudsmen, but prohibits him demanding either Scottish or United Kingdom Cabinet papers or disclosing information that would not be in the public interest. I have one question: is the SPSO allowed to deal with all public service matters in Scotland or just those which are devolved? If the latter is the case, who deals with reserved public service matters?
</p>

<a name="40706-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a>The water supply order is another order that is consequential on an Act of the Scottish Parliament. It clearly relates to the reduction of Scottish public water authorities from three to one. The streamlining may be good idea.
</p>

<a name="40706-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a>I note the tiny use of the Sewel convention in the two transport Acts, but like my noble friend Lady   Michie of Gallanach, I wonder why we have to do this in quite this way. Will the order effect any real change beyond the amendment of legislation?
</p>

<a name="40706-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a>Finally, the three orders remind the House of how quite quietly Scotland is going its own way, as it should do. The First Minister, Jack McConnell, is worried about that and the fact that the UK news media ignore government activity in Scotland, except for the silly stories. As a Unionist, he should be worried. However, I suspect that it is &quot;aye been&quot; and that it is a &quot;no bad&quot; thing.
</p>




<p><a name="st_220"></a>
<a name="40706-30_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Monro of Langholm: </b>   My Lords, I certainly agree with the recommendation that these matters <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_762"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 762</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

should have been sorted out in Edinburgh. Will the Minister explain how much of the legislation comes under the Sewel convention, or memorandum of understanding with devolved administrations, and how much under Act of Parliament?
</p>

<a name="40706-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a>It is unfortunate that the Scottish Office gave the Minister a brief to put three orders together, because it was very difficult to follow the derivation of each order from its original Act of Parliament. The majority of the legislation seems as though it will come under the Sewel convention, which does not have legislative purpose, but which has become accepted by the Government in Devolution Guidance Note 10.
</p>

<a name="40706-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a>The Sewel convention is a way of avoiding debate in Scotland on legislation that we have passed here. That is wrong. The Scottish Parliament should have the right to discuss in detail the Fireworks Act and the Act which deals with consumer protection. It would have been able to give a more detailed answer and it would have a more detailed knowledge of what is going on. More importantly, Scotland would know what was happening. Nobody in Scotland will know about the orders being laid tonight, but they should, because it is part of the democratic process. Yet, under the Sewel convention&#151;the Minister might like to comment on it&#151;the legislation will not be discussed in detail in Scotland nor will it receive the publicity that it deserves. That is particularly true of the order on fireworks. I used to have a fireworks factory in my constituency. One knows just how much legislation dealt with the safety of fireworks and the promotion of the company.
</p>

<a name="40706-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a>I make a further point with a rather wry smile, because I was the Minister who took the original Water Act 1994 through Parliament. All hell broke loose among the Labour Opposition and the Liberal Party when we did away with a multiplicity of local government water companies and put them into three units: the east, the north and the west. That worked very satisfactorily until the Labour government returned to power. The arrangements were then used effectively to nationalise the industry and create one company for the whole of Scotland. That is what this order is all about. Since then we have seen the most incredible increase in the cost of water in Scotland. I should think that in many areas it is as expensive as whisky. Even on my humble farm it has gone up about four times in a year, and that is supposed to be because of the cost of putting in new drains and sewers. By and large it is thoroughly unsatisfactory. Scottish Water wants to take a good look at itself before it provides for Scotland the water that it is entitled to have.
</p>

<a name="40706-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a>Is that happening under the Sewel rules or under another procedure? People in Scotland would like to know what is going on and why this order is being passed here rather than in Edinburgh in the Scottish Parliament. I should like the Minister to give detailed comments on the Sewell arrangements because that is vital in relation to these orders.

<p><a name="st_221"></a>
<a name="40706-31_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords for their comments on the orders. I will go through the questions asked and hope that I will <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_763"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 763</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be able to give satisfactory answers. First, I thank the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, for welcoming the   orders. He asked about the cost of water in Scotland. The order does not relate to the cost of water in Scotland. We are simply inserting the term &quot;Scottish Water&quot; into reserved legislation. Water charges are rightly a matter for the Scottish Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40706-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_490"></a>Unless I completely misunderstood the noble Baroness, Lady Michie, I was amazed at her almost emotional outburst that we do not discuss Scottish matters properly in this House. By her contribution she showed the emotion that sometimes comes to the surface when we discuss Scottish matters. Although very few noble Lords are present, we have most Scottish Peers, and the discussion has been both rather interesting and totally worth while.
</p>

<a name="40706-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_491"></a>I also said during my speech that these orders have been discussed. They have been discussed by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, the Lords Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee, the Scottish Executive, within Whitehall departments and, as noble Lords will see in <i>Hansard</i>, there was an interesting discussion in the other place. I tried to head off many of the questions that were discussed there by incorporating those into my rather lengthy speech. So I make no apologies to the noble Baroness, Lady   Michie, for the way that this matter has been handled.

</p>

<a name="40706-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_492"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, asked about the water order and whether that is a matter of redrafting. I can confirm that it is. She also asked who will be taking the decisions on housing co-operatives in Scotland&#151;whether it will be Scottish Ministers or civil servants. That is a purely procedural matter. The Scottish Executive officials will be given delegated authority to confirm approval of a housing co-operative for tax-relief purposes, having first considered the rules and constitution of the co-operative. She also asked whether there are any changes in the water order other than in the name. There are no changes.
</p>

<a name="40706-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_493"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, asked what matters the SPSOs deal with. His powers are set out in the SPSO Act 2002. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration would deal with reserved matters for the UK.
</p>

<a name="40706-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_494"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Monro, asked why the three orders were being taken together. If we had taken them separately, we would have been here twice or even three times as long as we have. That may or may not have been something that the noble Lord would have welcomed&#151;but that is the reason.
</p>

<a name="40706-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a>As for the Sewel Motion, that consent is sought on occasions when the Westminster Parliament is to legislate in devolved areas in primary legislation&#151;not in secondary legislation, such as the three orders that we have been considering.
</p>

<a name="40706-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_496"></a>I hope that I have answered the questions that have been raised.

   &quot;REVIEW AFTER EXHAUSTION OF RIGHTS OF APPEAL

<br>
(1)   Where a person&#039;s statutory rights of appeal have been exhausted with respect to an immigration decision, and where that person subsequently makes an application to the Secretary of State for his deportation to be stayed on the grounds that there has been a change of circumstances, if the Secretary of State decides that there has been no change in circumstances or accepts that there has been a change of circumstances but decides that they do not justify a stay of deportation, the applicant within 10 days of the decision may apply to a High Court judge or a judge of the Court of Session to review the decision.


<br>
(2)   The review shall be conducted on the papers save in exceptional circumstances.


<br>
(3)   The decision of the High Court judge or the judge of the Court of Session is final.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_225"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, as I explained on Report when I promoted the same amendment, its purpose is to exclude the necessity for judicial review in the system of asylum appeals. Since Report, I have been fortunate enough to have a conversation with an extremely able member of the Minister&#039;s staff in the Home Office. I am most grateful for that. If I do not, entirely, accept the advice that she gave me, I apologise in advance for what I am about to say.
</p>

<a name="40706-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_504"></a>A legitimate criticism of my amendment is that it does not make sufficiently clear the difference between three situations. The first one is when a new set of circumstances arise, following the completion of the appeal procedure, that are unforeseeable. The second <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_765"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 765</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is when such new circumstances arise in a situation where they would have been foreseeable. The third is when, although there is an assertion of new circumstances, it is, in effect, unsustainable.
</p>

<a name="40706-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_505"></a>I also understand the criticism that it is not clear from the terms of the amendment what the judge can actually do if he decides in favour of the application. Does he stay deportation indefinitely; or might circumstances arise that would entitle him to reverse his order and subject the applicant to immediate deportation?
</p>

<a name="40706-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a>Although I accept that those details might need the attention of the parliamentary draftsman, I do not accept that the amendment is unnecessary. The Government claimed at the outset of the Bill that they wanted to establish a situation in which the whole of the asylum appeal system would be dealt with by statute. However, we are faced with something like the Maginot Line, we have a statutory system that reaches the Belgium border and goes no further. By that I mean that the statutory system under the Bill does not deal with individuals who seek to stay a deportation order. They are, however, entitled to apply for judicial review.
</p>

<a name="40706-31_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_507"></a>Unlike my amendment, which introduces a time limit of 10 days, the time limit on judicial review is three months. Unlike my amendment, which focuses attention on a judge who is likely to specialise in asylum matters, a judicial review case can come up in front of any administrative judge, irrespective of his skills. Put that way, in my submission, there is no contest between the Government&#039;s solution and my own. I shall be most interested to hear what the Minister has to say in response. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_226"></a>
<a name="40706-31_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, with that challenge I shall do my best, without much hope. We start by sharing the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, about spurious last-minute delays to removal when there is no merit or substance to them. In that sense, he is exploring similar territory to ours throughout this Bill: our objective is to uphold access to justice where appropriate, but not in ways that worsen the system. However, we do not believe the clause would be an effective solution, or one that is necessary, essentially because a process already exists for dealing with new representations made after appeal rights have been exhausted. Let me try to set it out.

</p>

<a name="40706-31_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a>The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, built on the one-stop appeal process first introduced in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. That process provides for, on application, one decision and one appeal, and it has worked. For example, an asylum seeker who makes a claim is required to provide all their reasons for wishing to stay in the country. Any new representations they make later will be considered under paragraph 346 of the immigration rules, to decide whether or not they constitute a fresh claim. If it is decided that the representations do not constitute a fresh claim, but rather simply further representation on the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_766"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 766</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

original claim, the Secretary of State may maintain his original decision, and so no new right of appeal arises. This decision can be challenged by judicial review.
</p>

<a name="40706-31_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a>If the new representations are considered to be a fresh claim, however, a new decision will be made by the Secretary of State that will give rise to a new right of appeal, unless the case is certified under Section 96 of the 2002 Act. Certification, as we recall, may take place where a new claim relies on facts that should have been raised at an earlier stage, and prevents any further statutory right of appeal to the appellate authority or the courts&#151;again, as it should do, although there is still the longstop of judicial review where the Home Secretary is open to challenge that it was an unreasonable exercise of his powers under the statute.
</p>

<a name="40706-31_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a>Whether the approach is a fresh claim or simply further representation, the applicant has a remedy, be it a fresh appeal right or the option of applying for judicial review if appropriate. Let me speak to why this is not the scale of problem that the noble Lord, Lord   Kingsland, may fear, and then I shall speak to why we cannot support the amendment, not only on principle but also on technical grounds.
</p>

<a name="40706-31_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a>In essence, the remedy of judicial review at such a late stage of the process is a relatively rapid one. We are getting such reviews heard within a very limited number of days in those circumstances. We are not experiencing such a volume of cases and such a delay that we think the existing legal remedies are being excessively abused or frustrated in ways that weaken the fundamentals of the asylum system compared to what we had experienced in the earlier stage of the process, which led us to believe there was a good case for ousting judicial review earlier on. The answer to the noble Lord&#039;s question on Report, which I recollect was &quot;If you are against JR then, why are you not against it now?&quot;&#151;I am putting it rather crudely&#151;is essentially that it was a problem there, but it is not a problem here. That kind of pragmatic judgment must drive our thinking.
</p>

<a name="40706-31_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_512"></a>To irritate the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, I wish to comment on the technical reasons why the measure is inappropriate. That is slightly unfair of me. Amendment No. 36 does not make provision for the other party to make representations and an <i>ex parte </i>paper review process is not appropriate in this context.

</p>

<a name="40706-31_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_513"></a>Amendment No. 36 would require the High Court judge to have to come to a final substantive decision without the benefit of representation from the other party. However beastly the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, may wish to be to the Home Secretary, I believe that he would not consider it in the interests of justice that he was not able to put his representations.
</p>

<a name="40706-31_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_514"></a>The amendment does not restrict the grounds for appeal on an error of law, which would mean that the High Court would be reconsidering errors of fact and law. It is an inappropriate court to test matters of fact for exactly the reasons that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, gave; namely, the administrative court deals with a range of issues and you cannot guarantee that the judge is necessarily an expert in the detail of immigration law.

Further, I suspect that I have not answered all of his probing questions, in which case I apologise. I shall seek to do better if pressed: otherwise, I may have to resort to the lame excuse of further correspondence, even at this late stage of our proceedings.

<a name="40706-32_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, I am extremely flattered by the Minister labelling my questions as probing. In those circumstances I shall do my best to disguise my deep irritation at his reply.
</p>

<a name="40706-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_517"></a>I accept that there are technical problems with the amendment. Indeed, I think that it could be truly satisfactory only if it had the attentions of the skilled parliamentary draftsman. Nevertheless, I remain perplexed at the fundamental basis upon which the Minister opposes it. I had understood the Government to wish to exclude judicial review from the asylum process altogether. They tried to do it illegitimately by an ouster clause. However, there is a legitimate way to do it, and that is to provide a comprehensive statutory procedure which expedites the process and yet, at the same time, is fair. I simply cannot understand why the process has gone most of the way to achieve that objective but has left this gap at the end. In my submission it is a big gap.
</p>

<a name="40706-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_518"></a>It may be that, in certain circumstances, the administrative court expedites these matters; but the fact of the matter is that an applicant is entitled to three months and he may well come before a judge who is not expert in these matters. There is a real danger that not just the issue before the judge, of deportation, is spoken to by counsel, but there is an attempt to rerun the whole case which featured in front of the tribunal. That would bring the system into disrepute.
</p>

<a name="40706-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_519"></a>I simply do not understand why the noble Lord&#151;I do not, of course, question his good will&#151;is not prepared to make the system absolutely watertight. In those circumstances I feel compelled to ask the opinion of your Lordships&#039; House.

<p>
<a name="stpa_522"></a>Clause 29 [<i>Entry clearance</i>]:
</p>


<p><a name="st_228"></a>
<a name="40706-32_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Avebury </b>   moved Amendment No. 37:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a>Page 30, line 23, after &quot;rules,&quot; insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_14"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   relate to an issue of objectively verifiable fact, and not questions requiring subjective assessment of evidence or intention,&quot;


<p><a name="st_229"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, it should be universally agreed that the quality of initial decisions on entry clearance applications, the subject of this clause, is even worse than that for asylum. In 2002, 46.2 per cent of appeals against refusal of visa applications were successful, in spite of the fact that all of those appeals <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_769"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 769</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

were dealt with on paper only. The percentage of refusals at the 10 overseas posts with the highest rates of refusal for non-settlement applications increased in 2003 compared with 2002. The independent monitor for entry clearance in her report published last month said that at any particular post:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a>&quot;Systems need to ensure that any drastic increase in refusing applicants is reflective of the quality of applications rather than a more restrictive regime&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a>Do the Government accept the recommendation that research should be conducted with that object in mind? If the Minister can give me an answer I would be grateful.
</p>

<a name="40706-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a>The independent monitor found on the basis of her sample that some 10,000 applicants were wrongly denied the right of appeal in 2002; a third of them students and two-thirds family visitors. She dryly remarks:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a>&quot;Parliament may wish to consider this when and if consideration is given to removing other rights of appeal&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_525"></a>Now we have the opportunity to do that. The finding shows that even where the criteria are objective, mistakes can be made on a large scale. It would not be sensible to grant the Secretary of State powers that could be used to deny right of appeal where matters of opinion or judgment are concerned, and entry clearance officers cannot even get it right when they have to decide whether a course of study lasts more than six months.
</p>

<a name="40706-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_526"></a>Apparently 3,000 students were denied an appeal because one module of their proposed course lasted for less than six months. Family visitors were denied because they were wrongly categorised as not having a qualifying relationship or because the ECO did not believe that they were related as claimed, an issue that should be determined by appeal.
</p>

<a name="40706-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_527"></a>It is wrong for Parliament to allow the Secretary of State to limit the right of appeal still further when he is not exercising the existing powers in accordance with the law. If we are to grant him an unfettered power to widen the list of those who are to be deprived of appeal rights, we should at least make sure that he can do so only on the basis of objective criteria, as the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said was the intention.
</p>

<a name="40706-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_528"></a>The Minister also said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a>&quot;The best brains in Whitehall are on the case. If we can clarify and make more transparent what we seek to do, to meet the points raised, we will do so&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 28/6/04; col. 85.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_529"></a>We on these Benches do not claim to match the expertise of the Home Office. However, if its officials have not come up with a solution so far, even if the amendment does not precisely achieve the objective that we share with the Government, by inserting the words in this clause we lay down a marker and give all those brains an extra few weeks to get it right in another place.
</p>

<a name="40706-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_530"></a>For the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, to suggest, as he did last week, that judicial review provides an adequate alternative remedy for those who may be unlawfully denied their appeal rights is fanciful; it has not provided a remedy for the 10,000 people who were <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_770"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 770</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

unlawfully denied their appeal rights against a refusal of an entry certificate in 2002. No legal aid would be available for those proceedings and I do not know of any successful judicial review applications in relation to wrongful denial of entry certificate appeal rights. If it were a realistic option, hundreds of cases would be flooding the courts.
</p>

<a name="40706-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_531"></a>I refer again to the JCHR report because it said in relation to this clause that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a>&quot;Not providing a right of appeal in cases where the basis of the refusal is the failure to meet a requirement which turns on an objectively ascertainable fact is likely to be unobjectionable in human rights terms. However, the breadth of the power conferred on the Secretary of State by new clause 29, without specifying on the face of the legislation the types of case in which the power can be used, is a matter of concern. Parliament is being asked to authorise in advance a very wide power which is capable of being exercised in a way which may impede access to an effective remedy or unjustifiably discriminate between different classes of applicant for entry clearance&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-32_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_532"></a>It is common ground between ourselves and the Minister that we want the power to be exercisable only in relation to totally objective and ascertainable facts, which is what the amendment would do. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_230"></a>
<a name="40706-33_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall speak to Amendment No.   38, which stands in my name and is grouped with Amendment No. 37. In moving his amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, rightly addressed the broad principle underlying this clause. When we first debated this issue in Committee on Recommitment, I, like him, raised the concern that we are being asked to sign a blank cheque for the Secretary of State to apply a refusal of a right of appeal in the future to such categories as he or she may designate.

</p>

<a name="40706-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_533"></a>I then asked at whom the Government were now aiming this provision. Was it aimed at alleged bogus students going to alleged bogus colleges? The Government said that it was. Therefore, my Amendment No. 38 continues to probe the mechanism that the Government intend to put in place properly to prevent people attending sham colleges. It is on that basis that I tabled this amendment for Third Reading.
</p>

<a name="40706-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_534"></a>Of course, we are aware that those who represent the interests of education in this country are fully behind the Government&#039;s policy to land a punch on the sham   colleges. We have heard from UKCOSA, the Association of Colleges and ARELS, all of which are in favour of a proper policy. But they all have a difficulty in seeing how the Government&#039;s proposals in this new clause reflect a real attempt to cut down on sham colleges.
</p>

<a name="40706-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_535"></a>On Report on Recommitment, I asked what criteria the Government would use to determine a college&#039;s eligibility to get on to a register of bona fide colleges that the Government tell us will be operated by DfES but will be accepted by the Home Office for the purposes of identifying which colleges are all right and which are not. In response, the Minister concentrated on saying what the criteria would not be. He said that   they would not relate to quality control or state what the level of education should be. I fully accept <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_771"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 771</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that because it is not the duty of the Home Office to determine the quality or level of education in either privately or publicly funded establishments.
</p>

<a name="40706-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_536"></a>Surely we should have some indication from the Government of what their discussions with the DfES have thrown up concerning how a college will get on to a list. The Minister will be aware that the education world is concerned that the DfES may operate a list which will have fewer hoops for people to go through in order to get on to it. It will be easier for the colleges to get on to that list than it will be for them to get on the current Home Office list. The education world is saying that the Home Office&#039;s current list of bona fide colleges should constitute the minimum level of entry. Possibly the level set should be tougher than that, but that should certainly be the minimum level of entry.
</p>

<a name="40706-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_537"></a>One particular concern is that the information from the DfES so far leads some people to believe that it may be sufficient for an organisation or company acting as a college simply to say, &quot;Here are our company accounts. We can prove that we are trading&quot;. What we need tonight is an assurance that that will not be sufficient. As we know from apocryphal stories that have come before noble Lords, some organisations can produce trading accounts that, in anyone&#039;s view, would be considered to be those of a bogus college. We would not want people to gain right of entry if they were allegedly attending such a college.
</p>

<a name="40706-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_538"></a>I also asked the Minister whether he could give an assurance that the Immigration and Nationality Directorate would provide colleges with a list of students who had been issued with visas on the basis of an offer letter from a college. I asked that because it was something that the colleges specifically wanted to see in place. The Minister replied that the DfES was consulting representative bodies from the education sector on this matter. He said that he could not give an assurance about how the system would operate because the detail was still being worked out. Therefore, at this late stage&#151;it is only a week later, I know&#151;I am asking whether the Minister has any further and better particulars on the matter.
</p>

<a name="40706-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_539"></a>The Minister has been playing a straight bat in telling the House that many of these policies are still under discussion. This is our last chance to obtain from the Government an account of their progress. As other noble Lords have commented today, my honourable and right honourable friends in another place will have but a limited time in which to consider these matters when they go to another place. Therefore, I think it is right that we ask the Minister to update us on how far we have progressed on these matters.
</p>




<p><a name="st_231"></a>
<a name="40706-33_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I can with the leave of the House and a bit of goodwill put two paragraphs on the record. That will save writing letters&#151;there are delays with letters in the post, as we know.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_772"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 772</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40706-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_540"></a>The noble Countess, Lady Mar, is still in her place and I hope I can give her a decent answer. She thought the last one I gave was appalling. She asked me if paragraph 284 of the immigration rules works. Yes it does.
</p>

<a name="40706-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_541"></a>Paragraph 284 of the immigration laws requires that persons applying for leave to remain on the basis of marriage to a British citizen or persons settled here have extant leave to remain in the UK and have been granted over six months leave since the date that they were admitted.
</p>

<a name="40706-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_542"></a>However, paragraph 284 does not affect the spouses of European economic area nationals. It is the act of marriage that gives the right of residence and not the act of the Home Office granting leave. I have probably explained that inadequately. It is working but it does not do the job that we intended it to do.
</p>

<a name="40706-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_543"></a>In his absence I would also like to answer the specific question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, about paragraph 46 of the JCHR report. Bearing in mind that it will be pretty quick when the other place gets this, it is important to get an answer on the record. The report said that the legislation was silent about the purpose of the open-ended power to exempt certain classes of individuals, and so on, from the new requirements.
</p>

<a name="40706-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_544"></a>The answer&#151;my brief says &quot;line to take&quot; here&#151;is that the power to exempt certain categories of persons can be found in subsections (3)(c) of Clauses 19, 21 and 23. At present the Government envisage that persons with settled status in the UK will be exempted from the requirement for entry clearance or the certificate of approval. We do not feel that it would be appropriate to state this category of person on the face of the Bill. By leaving it to secondary legislation we are able to then consider the effectiveness of the measures and who it would be appropriate to exempt, taking into account fluctuations in the sizes of categories and future changes in immigration rules. I hope that answers the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord   Lester.
</p>




<p><a name="st_232"></a>
<a name="40706-33_spnew2"></a><b> The Countess of Mar: </b>   My Lords, I refer to the Minister&#039;s reply to me. If that provision works for people marrying British citizens, why do we not apply these clauses to those marrying EEA nationals?
</p>




<p><a name="st_233"></a>
<a name="40706-33_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, that was probably the original question that the noble Countess, Lady Mar, asked in Committee. It is not possible to do that as it would mix up European and UK legislation. That is the point at issue. There is a route through. We have clearly stated that people can nip off to France or Germany, get married and go through the route that way. We are not blocking it off. We are doing our best to put a hurdle against some of the alleged sham marriages. Nobody says that it is perfect and completely blocks everything off.
</p>

<a name="40706-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_545"></a>I turn to these two amendments, with which I will deal in reverse order. I have already spoken at some length about the Government&#039;s intention to address the problem of students who enrol at bogus colleges, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_773"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 773</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

or at establishments that do not maintain proper attendance checks. This amendment resembles closely the amendment that was withdrawn. I understand why it has been placed on the agenda tonight, I have no problem about that.
</p>

<a name="40706-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_546"></a>The amendment places on the face of the Bill the Government&#039;s intention to create a register of bona fide or approved colleges, and of making enrolment at a registered college a requirement of the immigration rules. The order-making power provided by new Clause 29 could then be used to specify this requirement. The consequence of such a specification would be that an entry clearance application refused on these grounds would not attract a right of appeal. This revised amendment makes it clear that the registration requirement should not affect persons domiciled in an EEA state.
</p>

<a name="40706-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_547"></a>I am not entirely clear as to the reason for this reference to domicile in the EEA. European economic area nationals travel freely to the United Kingdom without the requirement for prior entry clearance. A non-European economic family may require an EEA family permit before travelling to the United Kingdom.
</p>




<p><a name="st_234"></a>
<a name="40706-33_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, with great apologies to the Minister, it was only when he expressed his puzzlement just now that I re-read the wording of the amendment. What I tabled was,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a>&quot;who is not normally domiciled in an EEA state&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_548"></a>rather than,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74"></a>&quot;who is normally domiciled in a non-EEA state&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-33_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_549"></a>There has been a trifle of a mix-up in the typing here. It is one of those dreadful things: when I read something in the Marshalled List I see what I think should be there, not what is there. It is my fault and I apologise to the Minister.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040706/text/40706-34.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_235"></a>
<a name="40706-34_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, in that case I can move on. During our debate on 28 June a number of questions were raised about the operation of a register of educational establishments. I should like to answer those concerns because the Bill will return to the other place fairly soon. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay of St Johns, has expressed the view that there should be a right of appeal for establishments not included in the register. As I explained, the Department for Education and Skills is consulting on the detail of how the register will operate and will be considering whether there should be a right of appeal as part of that consultation.
</p>

<a name="40706-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_550"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Baroness and the noble Viscount seeks to place the responsibility for a register of bone fide educational establishments in the hands of the Secretary of State for the Home Department. The Department for Education and Skills is responsible for education and skills within England and it is therefore appropriate that any register which records the existence of learning providers be owned by the department with those responsibilities. Much of the information needed for the register relating to publicly funded providers is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_774"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column 774</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

already held within the Department for Education and Skills and it already has strong working links with those bodies responsible for accreditation of private providers.
</p>

<a name="40706-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_551"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, asked whether there would be consultation on the register in Scotland. Once the register is operational, the Home Office will need information about all education providers in the UK and the Department for Education and Skills and the Home Office are therefore in consultation with the devolved administrations to ensure that that is achieved.
</p>

<a name="40706-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_552"></a>I can therefore assure the noble Baroness and the noble Viscount that the proposition in Amendment No. 26&#151;the original Amendment No. 26&#151;that the power in Clause 29 could be used to specify a requirement relating to approved educational establishments is one with which the Government are in full agreement. It can be achieved using Clause 29 as drafted. We do not consider that it is necessary to refer to the example on the face of the legislation.

</p>

<a name="40706-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_553"></a>The noble Lords, Lord McNally and Lord Avebury, have tabled an amendment that seeks to ensure that the order making power in Clause 29 could be used only in relation to requirements under the Immigration Rules which relate to an issue that is objectively verifiable and factual, and not to questions which require subjective assessment of evidence and intention.
</p>

<a name="40706-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_554"></a>I agree with much of the thrust of what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said in his opening remarks. We want this to be highly targeted and precise so that there is no argument; otherwise, it would be grossly unfair if the matter were subjective. After the previous debate, we agreed to consider whether Clause 29 could be amended so that the only grounds that could be specified by order are those that relate to a factual requirement of the Immigration Rules. We explained that it would be difficult to define what was meant by &quot;factual&quot;. However, we made it clear that we were sympathetic to the principle behind the suggestion; namely, that the power should be used only in relation to requirements of the rules which concern a simple question of fact.
</p>

<a name="40706-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_555"></a>We explored the suggestion with parliamentary counsel but concluded that Clause 29 should not be amended in the manner suggested. For similar reasons we are resisting this amendment. Inserting the word &quot;factual&quot; or referring to &quot;objectively verifiable facts&quot; would not give effect to the principle behind the suggestions. We reached the same conclusion when, previously, we considered using the word &quot;objective&quot;. All the Immigration Rules could be described as relating to factual matters or as being objectively verifiable. The question is the extent to which there is room for debate&#151;the noble Lord gave a couple of examples in his opening speech&#151;and thus scope for appeal, in coming to an objective conclusion about a factual matter. Generic limitations of the kind suggested would not necessarily prevent the use of the power in relation to requirements which we would have no intention or wish to include.

<p><a name="stpa_556"></a>Whether or not the right of appeal against a refusal of entry clearance on a particular ground should be removed is best judged on a case-by-case basis. That is the effect of Clause 29 as drafted. It requires the Secretary of State to specify by order the grounds in relation to which he intends to remove the right of appeal. The affirmative resolution procedure will ensure that both Houses will be able to consider whether the grounds specified are appropriate for the use of the power. No Minister would want to be embarrassed at the Dispatch Box unless a robust order, which cannot be picked apart, is brought before the House. We would certainly want the order to include consideration of the specific provisions of the immigration rules to which those grounds relate. That would also include consideration of the need for subjective assessment of evidence or intention in relation to those immigration rules.

<a name="40706-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_557"></a>We have given assurances that we would not wish to use the power in relation to requirements under the immigration rules which are particularly open to assessment or argument. If the power were used inappropriately, the relevant order, as I have said, could be subject to challenge by way of judicial review. I know the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said that was fanciful. It would not take many such cases by concerned people and organisations outside to start to   clog up the system. That would be acutely embarrassing to both the Home Office and the Government, bearing in mind the commitments I have given at the Dispatch Box, which will be repeated in the other place in the next few days.
</p>

<a name="40706-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_558"></a>There are some grounds for refusal which are straightforward and self-evident, where there should be limited scope for appeal. I have a fresh example to give. It is a fair example and I offer it for the record. The requirements to be met by applicants wishing to set up as a businessperson are set out in paragraph 200 to 210 of the immigration rules. These include the fact that the person has at least &#163;200,000 of his own money to invest in the business. The availability of funds is assessed through scrutiny of the applicant&#039;s business plan and supporting documents such as financial accounts. Checks are also made to ensure that funds are the applicant&#039;s own and not from another source, and that they are entirely under the applicant&#039;s control. Applications can be, and have been, refused solely on the grounds that the applicant has not provided sufficient evidence that he is investing not less than &#163;200,000 of his own money directly into the business in the UK.

</p>

<a name="40706-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_559"></a>There is not much more to report on the compiling of the register, as I indicated last week. I hope that I have been able to reinforce our intention about the way this   new power will be used. We are working with the English language sector to encourage comprehensive accreditation of English language schools so that, in due course, visas will be issued only to English language students who are coming to the UK to study at an accredited school.

<p><a name="stpa_560"></a>A point was raised&#151;and I regret I did not make a note of it during the speech&#151;asking about the cross-flow of information so that schools know the names of the students who the Home Office knows. I gave a positive response to that. Maximum transparency has got to be best for all concerned, and that is my understanding of the intention as to how this operation will work. Whether or not the position will have been advanced by the time this group of changes goes to the other place, I genuinely cannot say. The latest update on the position will clearly be given when these Lords amendments, as they will be, are moved in the other place in the next few days.
</p>




<p><a name="st_236"></a>
<a name="40706-34_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, it is not a question of argument whether or not we have this register of colleges which is approved on all sides by your Lordships. The only questions that have arisen again today are just how establishments will be put on the register and whether there will be a right of appeal against refusal to list a particular establishment.
</p>

<a name="40706-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_561"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has said that that would be considered for inclusion in secondary legislation. Clearly it could be limited to non-educational matters, such as whether proper records are kept and the hours that students attend, whether lectures are given in the subjects offered, whether examinations are held, and whether they lead to a recognised qualification such as the NVQ. All of those are legitimate matters of fact which should be specified. There will not be any difficulty in, as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, put it, &quot;landing a punch&quot; on the sham colleges by listing the criteria which have to be satisfied by an organisation wishing to be on the list.
</p>

<a name="40706-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_562"></a>We were looking at something much broader than that. Until this evening, the only example that had been given of an objective and factual requirement was the colleges. Now the Minister has kindly given us another one, which needs a little analysis. As the noble Lord has said, whether someone has the funds to set up in business is a question of fact and that would be ascertainable by evidence submitted by the applicant in the form of a bank statement, for example. However, the noble Lord then said that doubts could arise on whether the funds were the applicant&#039;s own or whether they were under his control.
</p>

<a name="40706-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_563"></a>That precisely illustrates our point. If the entry certificate officer says that the funds are not under the applicant&#039;s control or belong to someone other than the applicant, but he has no objective reason other than his suspicions for saying that, then these matters ought to be subject to independent appeal. They should not be treated as objective and readily verifiable facts. That is the distinction that we have sought to make all along: between matters of fact, which are properly to be dealt with under this power, and somebody&#039;s opinion, assessment or judgment, on which there ought to remain a right of appeal.
</p>

<a name="40706-34_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_564"></a>If this example had been given to the JCHR and it had been able to consider it as part of its scrutiny of the legislation, it might have said, as I do, that the example demonstrates our doubts about leaving the clause as it <br>&nbsp;<br>

is. I did not understand the noble Lord&#039;s explanation of why it was impossible to incorporate our suggested wording in the clause. However, we shall have to be satisfied with his assurances, which enable outsiders to rely on the <i>Pepper</i> v <i>Hart</i> statements that have been made more than once on the Floor of the House.

<p><a name="st_242"></a>
<a name="40706-35_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, the amendment ensures that in Scotland a sheriff only and not a justice of the peace will be entitled to grant the search warrant referred to in the clause. That was originally suggested by my noble friend Lord McNally in Amendment No.   36JA, which he moved on 27 April, as the noble Baroness will recall.
</p>

<a name="40706-35_para1"></a>

provisions limiting the issue of such warrants to JPs occur only in legislation dealing with terrorism or firearms offences.
</p>

<a name="40706-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_570"></a>The Law Society of Scotland has cited three instances which go beyond those offences. Under Section 289 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, the approval of the judicial officer has to be obtained for searches. Section 290 defines the judicial officer as a justice of the peace in England and Wales but the sheriff in Scotland. Under Section 17 of the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003, warrants for searches may be granted by a justice of the peace in respect of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but in the same circumstances, warrants under Section 18 in respect of Scotland may be granted by a sheriff. The third example was the Extradition Act 2003, where, under Section 156, search and seizure warrants may be granted by a justice of the peace for England and Wales but in Scotland only by the sheriff.
</p>

<a name="40706-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_571"></a>It is not clear whether there is any recent precedent for powers of this kind being conferred on justices of the peace in Scotland. Section 8 of the Bail, Judicial Appointments, etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 defines two classes of justice in Scotland, and this may be the reason for the confusion. There are full justices and signing justices. The function of issuing warrants relating to the investigation of serious offences, including those related to asylum claims, should be undertaken only by the former. But there could be difficulties in making sure that only a JP skilled in such matters was approached if the class of justice was not specified, and that would subvert the intention of Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40706-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_572"></a>The Government really should undertake more and better consultation with authorities in Scotland, including the Law Society of Scotland, with a view to agreeing not only how this matter should be dealt with under the Bill but how future instances in legislation should make it more certain that the correct person be appointed as judicial officer.

<p><a name="stpa_576"></a>We have had a number of useful and wide-ranging debates about the operation of this power and the safeguards in place. In response to a recommendation from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and to points raised by your Lordships in previous debates, we indicated at Report that we would be bringing back amendments to strengthen these safeguards.
</p>

<a name="40706-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_577"></a>In short, the amendment provides, first, that prior to the introduction of a fee under this power, the Secretary of State shall consult appropriate persons.

<p><a name="stpa_579"></a>Prior to the laying of the order to levy fees, we will undertake all possible consultation with appropriate bodies.

I begin by welcoming government Amendment No. 40, which was a result of amendments that I had pressed earlier when the noble Lord, Lord   Bassam of Brighton, was responding to them. He gave the commitment that is now being fulfilled.

</p>

<a name="40706-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_581"></a>I was particularly grateful to the Minister for taking the care to give some examples of those bodies that can expect to be consulted as a result of the amendment. I fully accept that he was giving the House an illustrative list and not a definitive one, but it was helpful to get a flavour of the bodies concerned.
</p>

<a name="40706-35_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_582"></a>My two amendments seek further information from the Minister in two different ways. Amendment No. 41 would ask the Minister to tell the House what progress the Government have made on this matter since Report on 18 May, when I first brought the amendment before the House. A problem has been identified to me by the Refugee Children&#039;s Consortium: unaccompanied minors who are refused recognition as refugees, but who are given leave to remain in the UK, are now being charged under Section 5 of the Asylum Act 1999. They would thus face increased charges under Clause 42.
</p>

<a name="40706-35_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_583"></a>However, the very fact that they are charged at all causes a problem. Have the Government found a way of resolving it? Are they now in a position to give a satisfactory undertaking to vary the regulations to give effect to the intent which underlies my amendment; that is, to give an indication of when that may happen?
</p>

<a name="40706-35_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_584"></a>Like the Minister, I am not going to use my full note&#151;I hope that the Refugee Children&#039;s Consortium will forgive me for that&#151;but the nub of my question is whether the Minister is able to give an undertaking.
</p>

<a name="40706-35_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_585"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 42, which returns to a matter that has been previously rehearsed, but on which I have yet to receive a convincing reply from the Government. The amendment would put into the Bill the power to correct errors in the charging of fees. I am   asking the Government merely to keep to a commitment that was given to this House by the now Lord Chancellor when was at the Home Office. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a>&quot;We shall ensure that when fee regulations are made, appropriate provision is made to deal with errors which may occur&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 12/7/99; col. 49.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-35_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_586"></a>So far, the Government have sought to reject the amendment on the basis that they can already make <i>ex gratia</i> payments if they wish. The difficulty has been that colleges are not persuaded that that brings sufficient certainty and equity into the process and I agree with them.
</p>

<a name="40706-35_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_587"></a>One example of an error is what happened on the admission of a student, who had her mother with her as a visitor to help to find somewhere to live. The student stamp was put in the mother&#039;s passport and the visitor&#039;s stamp was put in the student&#039;s passport. That caused all manner of problems. Too many students still receive the wrong leave for no apparent reason.
</p>

<a name="40706-35_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_588"></a>My amendment would not direct the Secretary of State to use his discretion in particular way; it is intended to be helpful. When I consulted the Association of Colleges and UKCOSA between 18   May and now, they were very much of the view that if the Government were unwilling to keep to the commitments that were so clearly given by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, they <br>&nbsp;<br>

would not be at all disappointed if I were to press the matter to a Division if I did not receive a satisfactory answer from the Government.
</p>

<a name="40706-35_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_589"></a>I have been talking to the Bill team between then and now as well as to the colleges. I pointed out that I hoped that we might get at least a little further information from the Government as to the robustness and the fairness of their policy. I have also pointed out to the colleges that, as the noble Countess said, given their timetabling, the Government were likely to come round at an exceedingly late hour, when there might be too thin a House, properly to reflecting the views of the education world. I think that that gives a big enough hint.

<p><a name="stpa_590"></a>In order to address the outstanding concerns, Des Browne, the Home Office Minister of State for Citizenship, Immigration and Nationality, has indicated that he would welcome the opportunity to meet with a wide range of representatives to explore further what measures we might take to assist in delivering a more efficient and effective service, particularly to students in the education sector.
</p>

<a name="40706-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_591"></a>It is not a perfect service; it is getting better; we are working on it; we have hot lines all over the place; and we have been monitoring it since the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor made his Statement. However, the Home Office Minister of State responsible for that, who, of course, takes full responsibility as the Minister should for all the defects in the system, is opening up his office for a grand powwow with all the interested bodies. I hope that is a sufficient answer on Amendment No. 42.
</p>

<a name="40706-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_592"></a>I am very grateful to the noble Baroness for tabling Amendment No. 41 because it gives me an opportunity to state on the record the Government&#039;s position in relation to charges for applications for further leave to remain by former asylum-seeking children. While it would not be inconsistent with our international obligations to impose a charge on former asylum-seeking children whose application for further leave to remain in the UK is not based on asylum or Article 3 grounds, we believe this group is in many ways a special case.
</p>

<a name="40706-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_593"></a>We know, for example, that many of these applicants are in receipt of benefits and support from local authorities under the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 and would find it difficult to pay the fee themselves. Consequently, I can confirm that we agree that children, or all those applicants who sought asylum while under the age of 18 who subsequently apply for further leave to remain should be exempted from the leave to remain application fee.

</p>

<a name="40706-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_594"></a>However, as we indicated on Report, we do not believe that an amendment to Section 5 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 is the most appropriate means to achieve that. Section 5 enables the Secretary of State by <br>&nbsp;<br>

regulation to provide for exemptions to the leave to remain application fee for certain immigration applications, including applications for leave to remain in the UK.

<a name="40706-36_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, I rise to respond to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, Amendment No. 43, and in doing so I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 44 and 49. I shall be very succinct.
</p>

<a name="40706-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_598"></a>We have listened to the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, and others in the House who are concerned that the term &quot;dismissal&quot; seemed to be inappropriate for judges who are, of course, office holders. Therefore we have replaced the word &quot;dismissal&quot; with the word &quot;removal&quot; and I emphasise that no removal can take place without the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales.
</p>

<a name="40706-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_599"></a>The second concern of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, was whether the concept of supervision might be seen to imply an interference with judicial independence. In response we have tabled Amendment No. 49, which removes that entire provision from the Bill, as it is no longer our intention that those matters should be provided for in rules. Instead, Amendment No. 44 specifies that the terms of appointment of an immigration judge may also make provision for training, appraisal and mentoring, which was exactly what we wanted to achieve in the first place. I have now made that more explicit. With these amendments, I very much hope that the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, and the House are content.

   &quot;At the end of section 2B (deprivation of citizenship) insert &quot;(and section 40A(3)(a) shall have effect in relation to appeals under this section).&quot;&quot;

<p><a name="st_255"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, paragraph 4(b) of Schedule 2 empowers the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal, in the event of a successful appeal against deprivation of British nationality, to direct that any order for such deprivation made prior to determination of the appeal is to be treated as having no effect.
</p>

<a name="40706-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_602"></a>The amendment will confer a parallel jurisdiction on the Special Immigration Appeals Commission in relation to successful appeals to that body against deprivation of nationality under Section 2B of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997.
</p>

<a name="40706-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_603"></a>This might be thought to be a minor technical amendment, and I suspect that it probably is, but it ensures that the Bill gives full effect to the policy on joining deprivation appeals with appeals against deportation action and/or certification, as the case may be, under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, whose daily passage I remember even now. The measure was described in detail at recommittal, and your Lordships supported it. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said at the time that they were sensible and overdue provisions that should be supported.
</p>

<a name="40706-36_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_604"></a>I want to make it clear for the avoidance of any doubt, because there will not be opportunities later, that the Bill does not alter the grounds for deprivation of citizenship. It is important to make that clear. The Bill does not have retrospective implications. It is not directed, for example, at Abu Hamza and his appeal. The changes in the Bill would make the procedure for appeals against deprivation of citizenship and the effect of such appeals not retrospective. Any appeal currently in progress will be conducted in accordance with the existing procedure. That is an important point; I would not want people to get the wrong idea. Furthermore, the Bill does not limit the grounds for appeal against deprivation of citizenship or take away appeal rights in those cases.
</p>

<a name="40706-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_605"></a>Deprivation of citizenship is one issue&#151;but it does not necessarily mean that deportation or removal from the United Kingdom automatically follows. Each case will be considered on its merits and separate decisions taken about the propriety of deportation or removal, as distinct from deprivation of citizenship. There might, for example, be practical or legal difficulties <br>&nbsp;<br>

These are minor amendments suggested by parliamentary counsel to tidy up the drafting of the Bill. I do not propose to go into excessive detail, but they all tidy up the drafting of the consequential amendments in Schedules 2 and 4 to the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

</p>

<a name="40706-36_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_608"></a>In Sections 85 to 87, all references to &quot;adjudicators&quot; need to be changed to references to &quot;the Tribunal&quot;. The Bill already provides for changing &quot;he&quot; to &quot;it&quot; and &quot;his&quot; to &quot;its&quot;. Amendment No. 46 completes the set of changes, by changing &quot;him&quot; to &quot;it&quot;. Paragraph 20(e) of Schedule 2 changes the reference at Section 106(2)(e) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 from &quot;an adjudicator for the Tribunal&quot; to just &quot;the Tribunal&quot;. Amendments Nos. 47 and 53 make the same change to a similar reference at Section 106(2)(f). Amendments Nos. 48 and 54 remove a reference to Section 101 of the NIA from Section 106(2)(m). Section 101 is being repealed by this Bill, as it sets out the old appeals structure. I hope that is sufficiently detailed to be clear. I beg to move.

<a name="40706-37_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I do not in any way wish to alarm the Minister by standing up at this point. Of course I have no objection to these amendments being made. However, the moment should not pass without a comment that, at this stage of the Bill, on Third Reading, when we have also had recommitment of clauses, it is interesting that the Government are still able to find drafting improvements, however minor in nature. It is certainly important that they are so made.
</p>

<a name="40706-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_609"></a>When these and other amendments pass to another place, do the Government foresee that other drafting amendments may be made within the rules to their own amendments? As I understand it, the only way in which the Government may further improve the Bill is if they are able to bring their amendments back to this House in an amended form.
</p>




<p><a name="st_259"></a>
<a name="40706-37_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, since the noble Baroness has asked a question, perhaps I may be permitted to return to a subject I raised at an earlier stage of this Bill. When we have complex amendments of this kind, even though in the particular case we are talking about, as the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, has explained, they are minor and technical, there may be other <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_785"></a>

instances where the effect would be more substantial. I said then, and I am sorry if I sound like a bit of a gramophone record on this topic, that it makes things much easier for noble Lords to understand if, in a case of this kind, Keeling schedules could be produced. The noble Lord is aware that that suggestion has been supported on all sides, and other noble Lords have said that it should be a common practice and not confined to a particular instance, such as we are discussing at the moment.
</p>

<a name="40706-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_610"></a>When the noble Lord comes to reply, I would be grateful if he would at least say that the Government would have a look at this issue. I am not expecting him to give me a definite answer this evening, or to declare of his own volition that Keeling schedules would also be produced by the Government whenever there is a case of complex technical changes to a particular clause or schedule, but if the Government would look at it as a general issue, I feel sure that it would facilitate the work of the House, not just on this particular Bill but in all future legislation.

Having said that, I think the House would have recognised when we discussed previous stages of the Bill that we had considerable concerns not simply about the House&#039;s insistence that lay members should be retained but also about the intersection of that with the three member tribunals. It was that latter point&#151;the two matters are interconnected&#151;that caused us particular concern as it appeared to us that it significantly fettered the proper discretion of the president of the tribunal.

<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40706-38_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I rise to oppose the question that Clause 1 stand part of the Bill. We meet in rather unfamiliar surroundings but they seem to me better than those of the Moses Room. The only constructive suggestion I have at this stage is that perhaps we should follow the practice on the Floor of the House of Commons and have the gap between the tables two sword lengths apart. That would open the room up rather more.
</p>

<a name="40706-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>In rising to oppose the question that Clause 1 stand part of the Bill, I should explain that, as noble Lords will have noticed, we have tabled a number of similar amendments to various clauses. The reason is that it seems to us that this is an extremely difficult and complicated Bill. In some cases it is very difficult to put down meaningful amendments, and that is the case as far as this clause is concerned. It simply says that there should be a body corporate called the Pensions Regulator. If, in the event, the debate has already covered the main points that need to be raised on subsequent clauses, we will not speak to those amendments. The Public Bill Office, in its wisdom, has put the list of all the places where we have tabled such Motions on the front of the Bill. It may be that your Lordships will find the pension grouping list rather more convenient since it shows the point at which the clause stand part debates appear.

<a name="40706-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>At Second Reading, we were very clear that the basic objective of the Bill&#151;to ensure that those who are in danger of losing their pension entitlements are protected&#151;is one that we support. The trouble on this clause, and on others, is that there are unfortunate side effects that may result in the provisions of the Bill causing damage in various ways to pensioners and to others. In due course, we shall come to consider those.
</p>

<a name="40706-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>To some extent, that is even true of the simple clause that we are now debating because it will incur a considerable additional cost, something over &#163;23 million, and there will probably be other costs on top of that figure. Those will be met by a levy on pension schemes. Inevitably, there will be some employers&#151;but one hopes very few&#151;who will feel that they do not wish to bear the additional cost. It is very simple to avoid the levy by closing down the pension scheme.
</p>

<a name="40706-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>There is a danger that the Bill overall puts another nail in the coffin of final salary schemes. The Bill is primarily concerned with defined benefit schemes&#151;or final salary schemes, as they are sometimes called&#151;although there are some clauses that affect defined contribution schemes as well. There is a balance to be struck about the best way to proceed to achieve the objectives that we all wish to see.
</p>

<a name="40706-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>The pension regulator is a successor to the existing regulator, OPRA. I speak from personal experience as a one-time chairman of a pension fund when I say that OPRA has done a very good job indeed. But, at the same time, the Sandler, Pickering, NAO and other reports suggested that a rather more wide-ranging regulator would be appropriate.
</p>

<a name="40706-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>The problem with that, again, is one of balance. In the Commons, it was said that the regulator would be proactive and focused. We will return to those points in detail later when we will need to consider to what extent this adds to the problems that trustees and pension funds generally have to contend with by way of red tape. There is not the slightest doubt that the change from OPRA to this regulator will significantly increase the degree of work that the pension trustees will have to do to achieve the objectives of their schemes. That is all a question of balance.
</p>

<a name="40706-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>I would not go so far as to say in regard to various clauses&#151;particularly, for example, Clause 35&#151;that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. But there are some very important side effects. Therefore, in discussing this and subsequent clauses, we will need to consider very carefully the extent to which we can minimise the unfortunate side effects of these proposals.
</p>

<a name="40706-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>My understanding is that there are still a large number of government amendments to come. That is surprising at this stage, given the amount of preparatory work that was done and given that the matter has already been through the House of Commons. Perhaps the Minister can give an indication of what we may expect so that we can be forewarned and can take action to deal with that situation.

<a name="40706-38_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   I declare my interest as a pension fund investment manager. At Second Reading, we made clear our general approach to the Pensions Regulator. I do not propose to add to that, save to say that our approach to this Bill&#151;I share several of the detailed concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins&#151;will be one of proceeding by amendment rather than outright opposition. Therefore, we will not support any suggestion that Clause 1 do not stand part of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40706-38_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   At Second Reading, my noble friends and I, who have put down amendments to this Bill, nevertheless supported the general idea of the regulator. We believe that it is necessary to take some further means to protect pensions. The regulator is the way that the Government have chosen. We on this side support that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="40706-38_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions  (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </b>  I am grateful for the opening statements made by the noble Lords, Lord Higgins and Lord Oakeshott. As and when, and if and when, this Bill gets full parliamentary approval, that will not be the end of the process. There will still be consistent regulations to be explored and negotiations will continue. I recognise the skills, experience and abilities of Members of the Committee on all sides. I am looking at my colleagues here: three of us were engaged in the arguments on the Pensions Act 1995. Other noble Lords have direct experience of DWP work or other pensions experience. As a result of your Lordships&#039; scrutiny, I am confident that we will ensure that the Bill is as robust, and will have as much staying power, as can be achieved. The essence of pension planning is that it has staying power so that people can have some degree of security in the years ahead.
</p>

<a name="40706-38_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>Clause 1 establishes in law the Pensions Regulator. Subject to Parliament&#039;s approval, it will be in place from 6 April 2005, which is only some nine months away. The current regulatory body, OPRA, will be replaced by a new non-departmental public body (NDPB); that is, the Pensions Regulator. I am pleased to be able to agree with both the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and my noble friend Lady Turner that, since it was established in 1997, OPRA has laid good foundations in the regulation of work-based pensions. We propose to build on its experience of more than seven years of regulation. Having talked with the chairman, it is clear that the authority feels that this is an appropriate way forward in building on the work it has already done.
</p>

<a name="40706-38_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>As noble Lords who took part in the debates in 1994 and 1995 will recall, OPRA was designed specifically to avoid another Maxwell-type situation. At the time of the 1995 Act, the fraudulent use of pension scheme assets was considered the greatest risk to pension <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC104"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column GC104</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

scheme members. OPRA was given the task of monitoring employers&#039; contributions to occupational pension schemes and the activities of the trustees responsible for those schemes. Given the context, I would say that an almost adversarial relationship developed between the interested parties. Someone had to act as a form of &quot;gamekeeper&quot;, keeping watch on possible defaulting trustees or employers.
</p>

<a name="40706-38_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>Since 1995, however, the pensions environment has changed significantly for reasons that all noble Lords will know. We would argue that the problem is no longer one of fraud, but of underfunding. OPRA has no powers to tackle the risks associated with the underfunding of pension schemes. It has no powers to ensure that errors, omissions or other breaches of pension legislation are put right; it has very little scope to take a flexible, proactive and responsive approach to regulation to adapt to changing circumstances or, indeed, to influence those changes through information, advice or education.
</p>

<a name="40706-38_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>We believe that our proposals for the new regulator will address these issues. We shall concentrate on problems that generate risks. The body will be given an additional range of powers to help those with duties under pensions legislation to comply and will be able to put things right at an earlier stage through its preventive as well as remedial powers. As the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, said, our proposals will implement the wide-reaching recommendations about the regulation of work-based pensions made in a number of key reports. Pickering, the quinquennial review of OPRA and the National Audit Office study of the authority all recommended that the regulator of pensions should target resources on cases where members&#039; benefits are at greatest risk and avoid &quot;cheapening the regulatory currency&quot; by wasting time on petty breaches that have little or no effect on members.
</p>

<a name="40706-38_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>That is exactly what we propose the Pensions Regulator will do. The issue of risks to members&#039; benefits was a key theme of the discussions held both in the other place and during the debate on Second Reading in this House. Moreover, the Better Regulation Task Force has concluded, from its experience of working with regulators across government, that regulatory bodies are most effective if they can focus their resources on areas of real risk rather than the &quot;graffiti&quot; problems of reporting a day or two late and so forth, which make up over 50 per cent of OPRA&#039;s caseload.
</p>

<a name="40706-38_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>The task force has also recommended that regulators should, whenever and wherever possible, adhere to the principles of better regulation. Regulators should be accountable, proportionate, targeted, consistent and transparent in their approach to regulation. I am sure that noble Lords will want to measure our proposals by those five standards. We intend that the Pensions Regulator will embed these principles in its design, working processes and overall approach to the effective regulation of pension schemes.

</p>

<a name="40706-38_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>As OPRA is now, the Pensions Regulator will be funded indirectly through a levy on pension schemes. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, asked about costs. As he stated, we currently estimate that the running costs of the regulator will be around &#163;23 million. This compares with a projected &#163;17 million for OPRA&#039;s final year, 2004&#150;05. Those increased running costs reflect the staffing and processes required to support the wider powers of the body, as well as its additional responsibilities in respect of the Pension Protection Fund, and our approach to regulation.
</p>

<a name="40706-38_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>We shall be developing other themes as we proceed through Part 1 of the Bill but, as noble Lords accept, the Pensions Regulator should concentrate on risk in order to reduce as far as possible, without in any sense being able to make a guarantee, risks to the security of defined benefit schemes. That is to be the core of its job. It will monitor compliance with the provisions of this Bill and other pensions Acts; it will help trustees and others to get it right and keep it right, taking appropriate action where necessary; and it will be the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; of the Pension Protection Fund, tackling the risks associated with underfunding and employer solvency. By doing all that, we hope to ensure that members&#039; benefits are protected so that people have some certainty about their pensions in retirement.
</p>

<a name="40706-38_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>I hope, with my very &quot;blue sky&quot; description of the intent of the Pensions Regulator, that noble Lords will agree that Clause 1 should stand part of the Bill.

<a name="40706-39_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   Perhaps the noble Baroness would give us a little breakdown of how the costs compare. She says that they go up from &#163;17 million to &#163;23 million, which is an addition of only &#163;6 million, yet there appears to be a huge increase in the amount of work that the regulator will do compared with what OPRA does.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="40706-39_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I was looking for my statistics on the number of staff. We are expecting an increase of about 40 staff to the current number at OPRA, which as I recall is about 240 in both Brighton and Newcastle. The increment is of that order. I shall certainly be happy to write to the noble Lord with any further details but, relying on my memory, we are talking about taking staff numbers up from about 240 to 280 or 300, which would account for the additional costs. The Pensions Regulator will have his or her own staff as well, of course.

<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="40706-39_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   How many of the additional staff will be in Brighton, and how many in Newcastle? Will additional office space be taken in each place?

<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="40706-39_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   At the moment, I cannot help on that. One job that OPRA has encompassed in the past is tracing activities.

made as to where precisely all the additional staff will be, but the presumption is that staff currently in Brighton will remain in Brighton, and staff currently in Newcastle will remain in Newcastle. The pension protection staff will be placed accordingly.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 1, line 11, leave out &quot;five&quot; and insert &quot;six&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 1 is really a paving amendment for Amendment No. 4, with which it has been grouped and to which I shall speak as well. Amendment No. 1 changes the number of persons appointed by the Secretary of State as membership of the regulator from five to six. We are doing that to make arrangements for our proposals in Amendment No. 4.
</p>

<a name="40706-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>The Bill establishes bodies with more power than we have yet seen. I agree with that power in the main, as the objective is to protect the rights of pension scheme members now and for the future, as the Minister indicated. The Government accept, as do most people, that there has been a decline in confidence in pension providers generally. That is rightly felt to be something that must be dealt with, and the Bill is an attempt to do that. It is therefore important to ensure that the new bodies charged with administering the Bill should be seen to be widely representative.
</p>

<a name="40706-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>When OPRA was established, legislation laid down a basis for representation that pretty much guaranteed that there would be a TUC nominee. However, this Bill is non-specific on the origins of board members, and the Government have talked about members being properly equipped to do the job; I agree, of course. Consumer interests are also very important, and consumers in this context are employees. As I am sure that the Minister will tell us, the provision of pension schemes is at present a voluntary matter for employers, so there has to be representation of employer interests. There obviously must also be a level of technical competence among board members, and our amendment seeks to deal with that through having a member who knows about life assurance business and someone with experience of management and administration of pension schemes.
</p>

<a name="40706-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>I am indebted to my union, Amicus, for the text before the Committee. My union has always taken a very considerable interest in pension provision for members. We do our best, as do other unions, to ensure that members are knowledgeable about pension matters. We run training courses so that that can be achieved. We have tabled a similar amendment for when we consider the PPF board. So far as the <br>&nbsp;<br>

regulator goes, the amendments show our view of the way in which there should be representation on the board, so that it becomes publicly and generally acceptable. We believe, as do the Government, that we have to do something to restore the lack of confidence in the pensions industry. I beg to move.

<a name="40706-39_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde: </b>   I support my noble friend Lady Turner in Amendments Nos. 1 and 4. Traditionally, there has been a representative voice of employees on OPRA. That is entirely logical when it is acting as regulator of people&#039;s pension funds through their employers. This is not a principle change in the Bill; it brings in some fairness. I may be wrong, but I am sure that at the weekend I saw in the press an advert for members of the Pensions Regulator. No? I will get my paper out of the bin then.

</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40706-39_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Freeman: </b>   I seek some clarification, because the spirit of Amendments Nos. 1 and 4 must be right. I have three concerns. First, I am somewhat confused by the maths in Clause 2, because if at least two members appointed under subsection (1)(c) must be appointed from the staff of the regulator, then by definition they cannot be non-executive. If you are to have a majority of the board who are non-executive, you must appoint five other persons appointed by the Secretary of State, because it has been assumed that the chairman is non-executive.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="40706-39_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   The clause says &quot;at least&quot; five.

<p><a name="st_24"></a>

<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="40706-39_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Freeman: </b>   I am grateful. My final point involves the numbers in Amendment No. 1. The experience of running public bodies such as this is that the chairman normally reserves his or her right to intervene. If you are to have a majority who are non-executive, you need six, not five, because the chairman is being included in the majority according to the Higgs principle.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40706-39_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   I keep on having to get up. That is what our amendment says. Our amendment says to leave out five and insert six.

<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="40706-39_spnew20"></a><b> Lord Freeman: </b>   I was seeking to explain the reasons why the amendment should be supported.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40706-39_spnew21"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   When I first saw the opening clauses of the Bill, I found rather odd the use of the words &quot;pensions regulator&quot; to mean something other than one person. However, Clauses 1 and 2 together make it perfectly clear that it is a corporate body and, whether or not we take this amendment, what the membership is to be. I do not have any view on whether in addition to the chairman and the chief executive there is a minimum of five other members, as the Bill says, or six as proposed by the amendment. After all, the Bill provides a minimum and there is freedom to have more than that number.
</p>

<a name="40706-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>But in relation to Amendment No. 4, the principal amendment, I am not sure whether we should be as specific and prescriptive as proposed. As the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, indicated, the categories seem reasonable, although, as the noble Lord&#039;s questions indicated, one or two may require interpretation as to exactly what they are. Why not leave the matter of a well-balanced board, which everyone wants, to the judgment of the Secretary of State and, insofar as they act together, with the chairman?
</p>

<a name="40706-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>I recall from experience that being over-specific can cause a certain amount of difficulty. I was once appointed to a quango under a specific provision, which I did not quite fit. Fortunately for me and for the department, no one questioned it; no one seemed to notice. Everyone thought I was a splendid appointment&#151;or so they let me assume&#151;and certainly no one sought judicial review. This was some time ago in the early days of judicial review, and perhaps it was just as well.

</p>

<a name="40706-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>My main reason for mentioning that example is to raise the rhetorical question of why create unnecessary difficulties by having specific categories, some of which may or may not be easy to interpret at any given moment? With the prospect of numerous meetings of the Grand Committee&#151;I do not know how many&#151;surely none of us here today would happily contemplate another major Bill of this kind for a decade or so. Being over specific on this and other matters would be unwise because we may not in 2004 anticipate all future possibilities.
</p>

<a name="40706-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>The categories set out by my noble friend are perfectly reasonable, but I do not want such categories. Perhaps we should place greater trust not only in the present Secretary of State but in others who may come from other parties and other political backgrounds in the future. On the matter of appointments, I doubt whether more specificity than is in the Bill is required.

<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="40706-40_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   My noble friend Lord Higgins has already explained the general philosophy of our amendments. As my name is attached to Amendment No. 1 but not to Amendment No. 4, I was slightly surprised to see them grouped; we tabled Amendment No. 1 for a totally different reason. Nevertheless, the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, and I caused unwitting confusion in the Public Bill Office by unknowingly tabling exactly the same amendment within two hours of each other. However, the matter seems to have been resolved. I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, and the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, for agreeing to their names being removed from the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40706-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>As I said, we tabled the amendment for totally different reasons. For us, its purpose was to determine two matters. First, what kind of animal is the regulator to be? Am I right to assume that, by virtue of Clause 8, as he will chair a non-executive committee he will himself be a non-executive? Or is it the case that he will be an executive chairman by virtue of his functions transferred from OPRA under Clause 4(1)(a)? There is confusion in my mind. In either event, Part 1 and Schedule 1 together comprise an almost unique form of corporate governance. I shall have more to say about that when we get to Clause 4.
</p>

<a name="40706-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>The second reason for the amendment is tied into the first. Clause 2 informs us that there are to be not less than three non-executive members. As my noble friend Lord Freeman said, it is clear that this is a minimum because Clause 2(1)(c) states that there are to be at least five members other than the regulator and the chief executive. If the regulator is to be a non-executive, as I suspect, then the minimum number of people on the non-executive board will be four.

</p>

<a name="40706-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>I cannot for the life of me see how so few people can do justice to the work encompassed in Clause 9, for example. Nor indeed are they really non-executive as they can be authorised to do anything that is in the province of the regulator. Be that as it may, what happens if the committee needs to have a vote and it <br>&nbsp;<br>

splits 2-2? Does the chairman have a casting vote? If so, should the Bill make provision for it? If not, then there should be an even number of non-executives other than the regulator. I do not really mind whether there are six, 10 or whatever even number the Minister picks out of the air, but an even number there most certainly should be.
</p>

<a name="40706-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>Amendment No. 4, as I said, has been grouped with Amendment No. 1, and I am afraid that I have to agree with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, on this. I cannot be nearly as complimentary to the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, as I was on the last amendment because I simply do not like shopping lists in Acts of Parliament. However, I would say that she is right in wanting to know what sort of people are to be appointed as non-executive members. Clearly employers, employees and pension fund managers are all suitable people, but the danger of a list is that of leaving out those from other backgrounds.
</p>

<a name="40706-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>It further occurs to me that paragraph (b), which refers to employees, could cover employees who are not members of their company pension schemes, which if memory serves me right is not compulsory. Indeed we had quite a lot of chat on that on Second Reading.
</p>

<a name="40706-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>For those reasons, I very much look forward to what the Minister has to say.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="40706-40_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   Perhaps I can start with a tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, for her lifetime of service for the members and pensioners of Amicus and of what she and I as former members will remember as ASTMS. I link that also to the work of the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, for the print union members.
</p>

<a name="40706-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>I have some sympathy for the amendment. Although I think it is possibly a little rigid as it stands, if it is interpreted in a particular way, might that not solve the problem? Can all these categories overlap? Can people qualify as someone with experience in the management? If the categories could be overlapped so that they were flexible, I would be happy to support the proposal.
</p>

<a name="40706-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>One of the noble Baronesses touched on the question&#151;and this a question, indeed a suggestion, also to the Minister&#151;of having seen this advertisement. Can we be assured that no advertisements have yet appeared for the non-executive directors of the regulator, which I think would be very discourteous to the Committee? There are amendments on the composition of the PPF. I believe that it was very discourteous that, before we have even had a chance to consider those amendments, on the very day that we are starting to discuss the Bill, this should have come out. Will the Minister assure us that it will not happen until more time has gone by? I really do think that this is taking things for granted.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="40706-40_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   Perhaps I can respond to that. I see no reason why some of these categories could not overlap, particularly as far as paragraphs (a) and (d) are concerned. Unions often have members who have had managerial experience; it is certainly <br>&nbsp;<br>

true of my union. There is no reason why the overlap should not be flexible. I do not see any reason why not. The essential point is that there should be representation of those interests.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="40706-40_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Before I speak to the amendments it might be helpful if I gave a brief explanation of the purpose of Clause 2, which deals with membership of the regulator and the reasons for the structure. Afterwards, Members of the Committee can press me on any points that I have left undiscussed.
</p>

<a name="40706-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>As the Committee will be aware, the regulator will consist of executive and non-executive members. It will have a chairman&#151;who has not yet been appointed&#151;who is appointed by the Secretary of State. The chairman cannot be either a member of staff of the regulator or of the Pension Protection Fund. So in that sense he is one of the non-executives, as your Lordships surmised perfectly correctly.
</p>

<a name="40706-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>The chief executive&#151;the former chief executive of OPRA, Tony Hobman&#151;will be a member of the regulator. The first appointment will be made by the Secretary of State with subsequent appointments to be made by the regulator with the approval of the Secretary of State. Given that we do not yet have a chairman, we have gone down only to the other members.
</p>

<a name="40706-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>The chief executive&#039;s main function is to ensure that the regulator&#039;s functions are carried out efficiently and effectively. The regulator will have at least five other members who are appointed by the Secretary of State. That is the minimum. As I understand it, OPRA has nine members. However, it needs that larger number because it must encompass a determinations panel which, in this regulator, is a separate and independent body. So the numbers are not dissimilar and are perhaps more generous than the old OPRA numbers.
</p>

<a name="40706-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>At least two of those five members must be appointed from the regulator&#039;s staff. The majority of the board of the regulator must be non-executive members. That will provide appropriate scrutiny of the rest of the board and the regulator&#039;s activities. The structure has been chosen deliberately&#151;following Higgs and the various reports coming from Cadbury on corporate governance&#151;to strike a balance between ensuring sufficient flexibility in the skills, knowledge and experience of members, and creating a governing body that is effective and accountable while being kept to the minimum number.
</p>

<a name="40706-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Amendment No. 1 is required in order to increase the minimum number of members of the regulator and thus accommodate Amendment No. 4. Amendment No. 4, requiring board appointments to be subject to consultation with representative organisations of employers and employees, is&#151;as I would hope your Lordships will accept&#151;superfluous and inappropriate. I believe that it places disproportionate emphasis on the interests of employers and employees. Although it follows from the current OPRA structure, the OPRA structure of specified interests was set up in the context of Maxwell in which there was theft of individual members&#039; assets in the name of fraud. My <br>&nbsp;<br>

noble friend was powerful in her exposure of that fraud. Nevertheless, I think that we have moved on from that adversarial context.
</p>

<a name="40706-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>I have the same hesitation about shopping lists. Like the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, I was a member of a regional health authority. Because my friends, allies, mates and so on within the then eastern region wanted me on that body, they decided that they had better put me in as a representative of the trades unions. That was fine, although I was a member of the Association of University Teachers and had no connection whatever to any of the health unions which should probably have been represented. We had to fiddle, construct and organise it, and I met regularly with trade union colleagues to take on board their concerns; I did an honourable job. However, it was actually a limitation of capacity rather than a representation of capacity. Like the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, we had to find a way round it very precisely.
</p>

<a name="40706-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>The Secretary of State&#039;s exercise of the power to appoint members to the board of a statutory public body must in any event be exercised in accordance with administrative law principles, in a reasonable, proper manner, taking into account the interests of the public in general, including the interests of employers and employees.
</p>

<a name="40706-40_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>As I say, noble Lords will be aware that the proposed structure is from the OPRA structure. I do not think that it is appropriate to reproduce such a structure in a very different climate. However, I should like to reassure my noble friend. When discussing this, she may want to consider that we are significantly and, in my view, absolutely rightly strengthening the role of member-nominated trustees from among the ranks of employees and, where appropriate, involving trade union negotiation. That seems to me exactly where we should be strengthening the role of employees&#039; representatives&#151;at the trustee scheme-specific level. I am delighted that we will be addressing that later in the Bill. However, when it comes to the regulator, I think that we would be denying ourselves the capacity to have people with experience who can range across fields without trying to confine ourselves to shopping lists. I hope that my noble friend will accept that.
</p>

<a name="40706-40_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>Appointments to the regulator will be made in accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines, following open competition. There will be nothing to prevent groups representative of employers, or of employees, from encouraging their members to apply. But if such a person were to be successful, it would be on the basis of their abilities alone rather than because they represent a specific interest. We are effectively asking them to operate under trust law rather than to be delegated representatives of a body or sectional interest.
</p>

<a name="40706-40_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Mindful of the Division Bells, I hope that, with that explanation, my noble friend and noble Lords opposite will feel able to withdraw or not to press their amendments.

<a name="40706-41_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   The Minister invited her noble friend Lady Turner to withdraw Amendment No. 1 on the basis of what she had just said, but she did not actually answer the question to which we all seek a response; that is, are three non-executive directors plus the regulator, himself non-executive, sufficient to cover the work of both the non-executive committee and, more important, the Determinations Panel, to be established under Clause 10? There is no reason why one or two of the non-executive directors should not be appointed to that panel.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="40706-41_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I am sorry, but I thought that I had made that point clear. At present OPRA has nine members precisely because it is carrying out a determinations function which, quite legitimately, creates problems as regards chinese walls and so forth. Under the Bill, the Determinations Panel will have no overlapping membership at all. Therefore the members of the panel will be over and beyond the members of the Pensions Regulator. I said that in my response, and I am sorry if I did not make myself clear.
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="40706-41_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I apologise, but the Minister speaks so fast sometimes that I find it very difficult to keep up. However, my original question still stands. There is a perfectly good non-executive committee that is given all sorts of roles. Is three plus the regulator enough for that purpose? I suspect that the answer must be no, in which case I say, for totally different reasons from the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, that there should be an unequal number of individuals on the non-executive committee.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="40706-41_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I do not want to be rude, but I wonder whether we are making heavy weather of the provision. We are simply talking about a minimum. I am sure that, if the need is there and the workload justifies it, the chairman and/or the chief executive would make representations to the Secretary of State to increase the membership. At present, of the five people appointed by the Secretary of State, three would be non-executive, at least two would be from the staff, and there would be two others&#151;the chairman, who is non-executive, and the chief executive, who might be regarded as a member of staff. Therefore, we would end up with four plus three. There should not then be a problem about majorities. As I say, we are talking about a minimum, so it is open to the Secretary of State to increase the number.

I would like to consider very carefully, as I always do, what the Minister said. I note that she said that the ball game was now different from OPRA. Presumably it is not the same as the Occupational Pensions Board, of which I was a member for 17 years. In those days, there was a trade union seat on that body. I did not occupy it; I was one of the then Minister&#039;s nominees, but the TUC had a right to be nominated.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="40706-41_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   In going away to consider the matter, might the noble Baroness consider in her efforts to secure representation the potential problem of how people in such categories would be nominated? How would one ensure representation of the groups that she seeks to have on the board?


</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="40706-41_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   Historically the TUC has been invited to make nominations for seats on the Occupational Pensions Board, and presumably on OPRA as well. I was not a member of OPRA, but I was for a long time a member of the Occupational Pensions Board, which had a specific seat allocated. The Minister put forward nominees, as did the industry. We had a board which, as far as the Minister was concerned, was representative of all the interests involved.
</p>

<a name="40706-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>Certainly, my noble friends who have attached their names to the amendment are anxious to ensure that arrangements are made for interests to be represented, as am I. It may be that the wording is not very good&#151;there may be all kinds of other ways in which this can be expressed&#151;but we believe that it is necessary to have some indication that there will be representation for not only the interests of employees but the interests of the other bodies referred to in the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40706-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>I note with interest and welcome what the Minister said about the increase in powers of member-nominated trustees. That is obviously very important. But this is a different matter; it is not about trustees but about an overall regulator for the industry as a whole and the interests of members who hope to benefit from what the industry can offer.
</p>

<a name="40706-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>We shall consider very carefully what has been said and probably come back again at Report stage with another form of wording in order to ensure that the interests for which we think it is so important to secure representation are acknowledged on the face of the Bill.

<p><a name="st_47"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment may seem excessively cynical. In effect, it seeks to change the balance in the Bill from the Secretary of State making appointments after consulting the chairman, to the chairman making appointments with the approval of the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="40706-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>It is important that the appointments should be impartial and there is some concern that there may be a degree of cronyism in such appointments. On the other hand, the Minister may be able to reassure me as far as that is concerned. I should be further reassured if she could make it clear that, if it is to be done by the Secretary of State, he may not make an appointment under subsection (2) unless the procedures recommended by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments have been followed. Perhaps she will assure me that that is so.
</p>

<a name="40706-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>There are provisions in the Bill for payment of pensions to staff and so on, but I am not absolutely clear whether these are to be full-time appointments. It may emerge later, but I am not sure whether an amendment has been tabled in that regard. Again, that is not irrelevant to the people making the appointments. My feeling is that they will have considerable responsibilities&#151;certainly much greater than OPRA.
</p>

<a name="40706-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>The noble Baroness has been forthcoming to some extent about the timing of these matters: is it the intention that the chairman and others will not be appointed until after the Bill has received Royal Assent? We ran into a little problem with the Energy Bill in regard to advertisements and appointments. Of course you can advertise if a Bill has had its Second Reading in the Commons&#151;which applies to this Bill&#151;but employers and employees would like to know roughly what the timing will be for getting the scheme up and running. Obviously we do not want to set it up, with the corresponding costs, until we get fairly close to the implementation of the Bill. I should be grateful if the noble Baroness would clarify these points.

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>He is suggesting a subtle change. However, it is not desirable because the Secretary of State, while of course consulting with the chairman&#151;and this applies whether it is the regulator or the public protection board&#151;should be responsible for the appointments because he or she is responsible to Parliament for the functioning of the Bill and the many different parts of it that we have to discuss in Committee.

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column GC116</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which was an issue of concern at Second Reading. In establishing the new Pensions Regulator, we are seeking to achieve an appropriate balance of powers and responsibilities between the sponsoring department and the regulator. In that context, the regulator will be answerable to the Secretary of State and, through him, to Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40706-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>We believe that it is right for the Secretary of State to take responsibility for ensuring two things. One is that the chairman is fully consulted and involved in the process of selecting the members of the regulator. The other&#151;which goes back to our previous discussion&#151;is that the board fully reflects the skills, knowledge and experience needed to run this key organisation. The effect of this amendment would be that these tasks would fall primarily to the chairman rather than to the Secretary of State. It is not appropriate to delegate such key responsibilities from the Secretary of State, who is directly answerable to Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40706-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>On the specific questions on public appointments, the OPCA will be fully involved, as it was for OPRA. The expectation is that appointments will not necessarily be full-time but we cannot yet confirm that. Appointments will need to be advertised, but official appointments cannot be made before Royal Assent. We will write to noble Lords when we have a clear idea of the timetable. The chief executive has already been appointed: Tony Hobman, the chief executive of OPRA, will move across to the Pensions Regulator. The chairman has not been appointed. We will need a chairman in place before the Secretary of State can consult him about the rest of the members of the board. My understanding is that his appointment cannot legally be confirmed until after Royal Assent. I hope that answers noble Lords&#039; questions.

<br>
(   )   The affairs of the Regulator shall be conducted having appropriate regard where relevant to the principles set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (as amended or replaced from time to time).&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_53"></a>The noble Lord said: The objective of this amendment is to ensure that in making the appointment of the chairman, the regulator and the sub-committees regard should be given to the skills and experience of the individuals and the group of individuals who comprise the regulator.
</p>

<a name="40706-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>The amendment makes specific reference to the requirement for knowledge and understanding under Section 238(4), on which I shall make two points. The first is that the Bill is a two-volume work. It would be helpful if the schedules were in one volume and the rest of the Bill in another. We constantly have to find where on earth we have got to with Schedule 1. The other problem with this amendment is that it refers to Section 238(4) and I cannot find subsection (4).
</p>

<a name="40706-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>But I think the intention of the first part of the amendment is clear enough. Clauses 236, 237 and 238 require individual trustees to have knowledge and understanding&#151;I am sure that we shall come back to this at later stages in the Bill&#151;and if trustees are to have that, it is very important that the regulator should have the corresponding knowledge. We cannot expect the regulator to encourage the type of provisions that exist in Clauses 236, 237 and 238 unless it has adequate knowledge. That is the purpose of the first part in the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40706-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>The second part of the amendment requires that the regulator shall be conducted in line with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance. The chairman and chief executive are divided in the case of the regulator and these provisions would combine with that. But there are other provisions in the code that the Minister may perhaps be prepared to accept it is important that the regulator should implement. If she gives an assurance to that effect, that will carry the necessary weight with those concerned with these matters. I beg to move.

<a name="40706-42_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde: </b>   Can the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, shed a little more light on the second part of this amendment? What does he regard as appropriate? There is a tendency today to cherry-pick between the public and private sectors. The Combined Code on Corporate Governance is from the private sector. As the noble Lord says, the separation of the powers of the chief executive and chairman are covered in that code, but here we are dealing with primary legislation. I think I understand the gist of what the noble Lord is saying, but it is not clear. There are parts of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance that would be entirely inappropriate for a public sector regulator.

Combined Code on Corporate Governance works in private companies. I do not know what the amendment means.
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="40706-42_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The amendment would restrict the skill bases of the Pensions Regulator board members because the Pensions Regulator is not an individual but a corporate body. Individual members and the board, the non-executive committee and the Determinations Panel, as groups, would be required to have knowledge and understanding of the law relating to pensions and trusts, the principles relating to funding and investment and such other matters as may be prescribed. The amendment would place an undue prominence on such limited areas as knowledge and understanding of the operation of occupational pension schemes at the expense of the operation of personal pension schemes, including stakeholder pensions, or the more widespread regulation of work-based pension schemes. In any event, general administrative law principles would encompass the overall need for the knowledge and skills base of the board relevant to the functions it exercises. I do not think that the first part of the noble Lord&#039;s amendment takes us forward.
</p>

<a name="40706-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>On the second part of the amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, and my noble friend Lady Dean have very effectively made the point that I was going to make. A requirement for the regulator to have regard to the Combined Code on Corporate Governance is unnecessary. As an NDPB, the regulator will be subject to periodic review and scrutiny by the National Audit Office, as well as to any other review considered appropriate by the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="40706-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>The combined code has no statutory force and, particularly if amended from time to time, it may not be entirely appropriate to the management of a NDPB. The amendment would therefore have the effect of irreversibly tying the regulator to guidance that has no statutory force and to which no other organisation in the public or private sectors is required by law to adhere. Members of the Committee may well deem that to be inappropriate. I hope that in the light of my explanations the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_59"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 5 stands in my name and that of my noble friend. In my opening remarks I did not refer to the fact that we are sitting in Grand Committee rather than on the Floor of the House, but I feel bound to say that it is not a satisfactory arrangement. First, we cannot vote in Grand Committee, whereas we could if the Bill was being considered in a Committee of the Whole House; and, secondly, because our proceedings are continually being interrupted by votes downstairs, so that the flow of the discussion tends to be broken. It is wrong, and it will probably mean that the usual balance between the number of days in Committee in relation to the number of days on Report on the Floor of the House will need to be rather more weighted in favour of the Report stage rather than the Committee stage.

<a name="40706-43_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   Members on this side of the Grand Committee have the same sympathy with this amendment as we did with the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner. They seek to do slightly similar things; to ensure that the regulator has within its corporate structure the relevant experience. However, this amendment perhaps ought to suffer the same fate as that proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner. It would be wrong to treat the two proposals in wholly different ways just because people come from different backgrounds.
</p>

<a name="40706-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>That said, the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has a valid point. Representatives of occupational pension schemes put into this position would have an insight into the work of the board. None the less, for the sake of consistency, perhaps this proposal will receive the same response from the Minister.

much further. At least that will allow me to be not only brief, but possibly slow, which will mean that I shall avoid criticism from the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott.
</p>

<a name="40706-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>The position is the same. The amendment would put an undesirable limitation on flexibility, which is designed to ensure that appointments to the regulator are based purely on the skills and knowledge required and the relative merits of each candidate. Although the regulator will have a role in respect of the Pension Protection Fund, its primary objective is to protect members&#039; benefits. That is best served by an ongoing, properly funded scheme and a solvent employer. It is also worth noting that the regulator has responsibility for many types of schemes, including defined contribution occupational schemes, personal pensions and stakeholder schemes, as well as defined benefit schemes which will be subject to the pension protection levies.
</p>

<a name="40706-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>The amendment applies unnecessary pressure to try to introduce what I would call sectional interests, as opposed to breadth of experience. If I can make the distinction, we are on the side of breadth of experience. The arguments are much the same as before. If we agreed the amendment, we would then go down the road of saying, &quot;Here are the employers, here are the employees&quot;, and so on. We could not escape that, so I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>Page 233, line 22, leave out paragraph 2.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>The noble Lord said: Schedule 1 contains the &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; provisions for the appointment of the members and chief executive, the proceedings of the regulator and its funding, accounts and so forth. My first question concerns paragraph 2, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;Where a person ceases to be employed as Chief Executive, he ceases to be a member of the Regulator&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>That states the obvious. The question that originally sprang to my mind was, &quot;What happens then?&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40706-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>It seems obvious that a former chief executive could easily make a most useful contribution to the regulator&#039;s activities in a non-executive post. He or she would certainly have the experience for which the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, was looking in her list in Amendment No. 4. If the chief executive were sacked for some misfeasance, by definition he would not have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC121"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column GC121</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that experience, but in the case of a normal retirement why should he not hold such a post, perhaps after a short gap? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="40706-43_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   I should be interested to know from the Minister, on the last point made by the noble Lord, whether after ceasing to be chief executive there is a gap and that person may then be appointed as a member of the regulator; I imagine that he would be. When a chief executive ceases to be a chief executive&#151;if someone else has been appointed at the end of his term of office or whatever&#151;the paragraph may be stating the obvious but makes the matter clear.
</p>

<a name="40706-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>On the earlier part of the noble Lord&#039;s speech, I would have thought that, certainly immediately after and perhaps for a certain period, it would be inappropriate for the chief executive to be part of the regulator because there is a new man in the job; it is usually undesirable for the previous holder of the office to appear to lean over his successor&#039;s shoulder immediately thereafter.

<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="40706-43_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   It must be right that the chief executive ceases to be a member if he is then reappointed as a non-executive. Otherwise the balance would suddenly change between executives and non-executives.
</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="40706-43_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I used to think exactly the same as the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. But during my time as chairman of the Stroke Association, I suggested to my fellow trustees that a new chairman of the executive committee be appointed because the other one wanted to retire. Against my better judgment, the new chairman insisted that his predecessor remain on the executive committee. It caused absolutely no problems. It was a matter of personal choice for the new chairman of the executive committee. Perhaps, in a sense, we are both right.
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="40706-43_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I think that there is a great deal of consensus on the matter. As my noble friend Lord Borrie suspected, after a period of time there is no reason why the former chief executive, if that person so wished, could not be reappointed, through public procedures, to membership of the committee as a non-executive director. That would depend on the harmony of views and whether the new chief executive felt in any sense threatened by such an appointment. I suspect it would also depend on the circumstances under which a chief executive left and to what extent he or she continued to command the support and confidence of other members of the board.
</p>

<a name="40706-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>As regards the second point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, my understanding is that in such a situation a new chief executive would serve on the board and therefore the balance of non-executive and executive members would be maintained.

</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 9, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 10. Amendment No. 9 relates to paragraph 5(a) of Schedule 1, which states that the regulator may,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;pay to . . . any person who . . . has been a non-executive member such pension, allowances or gratuities as the Secretary of State may determine&quot;.</p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-43_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>of these payments.
</p>

<a name="40706-43_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>It seems curious that on the one hand the regulator is to make the payment, but, on the other hand, the amount is to be determined by the Secretary of State. Paragraph 5(b) seems to be a question of the Secretary of State determining what provision should be made. The implication is that the regulator may decide to pay something and the Secretary of State will decide how much, but he may decide to pay some of it and not the rest which, presumably, would then fall to individual members to contribute to the cost of the operation. That seems somewhat convoluted.
</p>

<a name="40706-43_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>If I have understood the paragraph affected by the second amendment correctly, the Secretary of State seems to have been given discretion as to whether or not he pays the whole amount, having determined what the gratuity or pension should be. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the situation.

<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="40706-43_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I do not think that there is anything sinister about this; it is conventional. Cabinet Office guidance to departments who are setting up NDPBs&#151;Chapter 7 of <i>NDPBs: A Guide for Departments</i>&#151;states that key decisions, such as the appointment of members and chairs and their appropriate remuneration, allowances and pensions are a matter for departments, and not for the body itself. In other words, members should not be setting their own pay. That is not appropriate. They should follow general guidance about pro rata pay per number of days attached responsibility.
</p>

<a name="40706-43_para18"></a>

I understand that she is referring to normal Cabinet Office guidance as regards the gratuity, pension or whatever being determined by the Secretary of State. But I do not understand, as regards paragraph (b) on page 234, that he may determine what provision he shall make. The implication seems to be that he will not fully finance whatever award he has made. This is a little inconvenient because we have to turn over from page 233 to page 234.
</p>

<a name="40706-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>On the one hand, the regulator pays the amount that the Secretary of State has determined. On the other hand, the Secretary of State decides whether to pay the whole lot or not. I may be mistaken, but no doubt the noble Baroness can clarify this because it is not clear. In Amendment No. 10, we suggest deleting paragraph (b)&#151;that is, the Secretary of State can determine how much of a provision to make. He has decided what should be paid. Then he will have a second bite of the cherry or, more accurately, not bite the cherry at all.

</p>

<a name="40706-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>I am advised that that is the exact wording of Section 8 of Schedule 1 to the Pensions Act 1995. It is a straight lift from existing regulations in which salary, allowances, provisions and so forth made to members of the board are paid for entirely by the levy as currently exists. So no change is envisaged in the existing method of remuneration. Perhaps I may write to the noble Lord if there are any further points on this.

<a name="40706-44_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   There is one point that strikes me. Under what circumstances would pension payments be made to non-executive members?

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>Earlier, we discussed the additional costs of this regulator against the present costs of OPRA. I expressed some hesitation about whether the additional costs or the increase in staff would be adequate to deal with the much heavier workload&#151;as it seems to me&#151;of the new regulator&#151;certainly if it is to be proactive, focused and so forth. That might reasonably be decided by the chief executive in conjunction with other members of the regulator. Why the Secretary of State suddenly comes back into it, rather than it being done independently in the light of the workload, does not seem a very sensible way of proceeding. I beg to move.

<a name="40706-44_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, makes a strong case. The Minister will need to be at her most persuasive to persuade me otherwise.

<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="40706-44_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   That sounds an irresistible invitation; I am not sure whether I shall succeed. It is custom and practice for the department to have such an arrangement. It is certainly in place with OPRA now, as empowered by the Pensions Act 1995. Schedule 1, paragraph 11(5) enables the Secretary of State to make available to OPRA additional staff, and vice versa. This secondment&#151;that is what it is because their rations, so to speak, are paid for by their home employer and not the one to which they go&#151;has proved useful to both the department and OPRA.

</p>

<a name="40706-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>From personal experience, some of the policy briefing and some of the work on this Bill has come from OPRA staff who have been seconded to the DWP for that purpose. We would be denying ourselves a wealth of hands-on experience that is available to us. This is part of the standard workings of government departments. We second staff to appropriate bodies; they second staff back. I am used to it in other forums within the department. I should have thought that this is enriching for both sides and it is pretty standard.

<a name="40706-44_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   Again, I am grateful to the noble Baroness. I am becoming increasingly suspicious of &quot;pretty standard&quot; things; not least because we were told on the previous amendment that it is what is in the 1995 Act.

<p><a name="st_95"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 16 concerns the Determinations Panel. This is a complicated point, which I shall seek to explain as best I may. It seems that Part 3 of Schedule 1 relates to Clause 10.

<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="40706-44_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Is the noble Lord speaking to Amendment No. 16 together with Amendments Nos. 28 and 36 with which it is grouped?

<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="40706-44_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   Yes, that is right. I think that is the most convenient way to deal with this. In a sense, it is a drafting point, but it may be more substantive than that. No doubt we can establish the true position. It seems that Part 3 of Schedule 1 relates to Clause 10&#151;&quot;The Determinations Panel&quot;. Amendment No. 16 would leave Part 3 out of the Bill. Amendment No. 28 would reintroduce it as Schedule 1A, relating to Clause 10. That seems to be the way in which it ought to be done.

<a name="40706-45_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Why?
</p>




<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="40706-45_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   The noble Baroness asks why. The provision does not fall appropriately in Schedule 1, which is largely related to parts of the Bill not concerned with the Determinations Panel. It is a drafting point. Perhaps I may try the argument again. Part 3 of Schedule 1 relates to Clause 10, whereas the rest of Schedule 1 does not. It relates to earlier parts of the Bill. Therefore, this group of amendments sets up a separate schedule which would relate to Clause 10. Currently, Schedule 1 deals with matters that ought to be dealt with separately. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="40706-45_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   Part 1 of the Bill is headed, &quot;The Pensions Regulator&quot;. Within Part 1, Clause 10 deals with the Determinations Panel. That seems to be paralleled in Schedule 1&#151;headed, &quot;The Pensions Regulator&quot;&#151;where one would expect to find details on all aspects of Part 1 of the Bill dealt with, including membership of the Determinations Panel. I am not sure what is wrong with the present drafting in that respect.
</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="40706-45_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I see what the noble Lord seeks to do. But this part of the Bill is about &quot;pay and rations&quot;. Throughout Schedule 1 there are references&#151;for example, on page 242 of the Bill&#151;to the nature of disqualification of members of the Determinations Panel. Right through the schedule there is an understanding that the Determinations Panel is part of the regulator, although there are no overlapping members between the non-executive and executive members of the regulator with the membership of the Determinations Panel. Conceptually, it is all part of the regulatory function. Therefore, throughout that schedule, there are numerous references. Obviously, we have followed the advice of parliamentary counsel that this is the appropriate place to put it, which makes perfectly <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40706-45_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I have heard what the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said, and I take his point.

<p><a name="st_105"></a>The noble Lord said: We come here to the various provisions for the Determinations Panel. It seemed to us that this would be a more appropriate way of making the appointment. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="40706-45_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Amendment No. 17 seeks to remove the provision for an appointments panel to appoint the chairman of the Determinations Panel, and instead allow the regulator to make that appointment.
</p>

<a name="40706-45_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>I will not go into the functions and purposes of the Determinations Panel at this stage. We have modelled our proposals on the regulatory decisions committee of the Financial Services Authority. Your Lordships will remember, although I was not a player in that Bill, that it was thought important by the House to ensure separation between investigation and decision-making. In setting up the determinations procedure, we have therefore followed the Financial Services Authority model&#151;that means the chairman of the Regulatory Determinations Committee being appointed by the regulator on the recommendation of an independent group established by the regulator for that purpose.
</p>

<a name="40706-45_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>Suitable people on that committee could, for example, come from the Department for Constitutional Affairs, and the Council on Tribunals, to ensure that the chairman has the appropriate decision-making skills. A non-executive member of the regulator will, as is the case with the FSA, chair that independent group on the appointment. The regulator also appoints all other members of the Determinations Panel on the recommendation of the chairman of the Determinations Panel. Again, that mirrors FSA procedures. I hope that the noble Lord will be content with that explanation.

</p>




<p><a name="st_109"></a>The noble Lord said: This is almost a traditional amendment. The top of page 236 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;The Regulator may pay, or make provision for paying, the members of the Determinations Panel such remuneration as the Secretary of State may determine&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>The implication of that seems to be that they may be amateurs rather than professionals. Therefore, it seems strange. One would have thought that the regulator must pay, or make provision for paying, the members of the Determinations Panel. We are not clear why he is apparently given discretion. No doubt the noble Baroness can tell us. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="40706-45_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Am I right in thinking that Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 are grouped? No, it is Amendments Nos. 18 and 20. I take it that the noble Lord is also speaking to Amendment No. 20.
</p>

<a name="40706-45_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>The amendments seek to shift responsibility for determining the appropriate provisions for paying Determinations Panel members from the Secretary of State to the regulator. That is the effect of the amendment. As I have already explained, the Determinations Panel is there to ensure an appropriate degree of independence from those who investigate and those who take decisions, to ensure that the procedures are seen as fair. It would be inconsistent with that approach for the regulator to have sole control over the pay of the Determinations Panel. It is more appropriate, following non-departmental public body guidelines as reflected in the Cabinet Office and so on, for the Secretary of State to determine the appropriate remuneration for panel members. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="40706-45_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I think we are slightly at cross purposes. The clause as it stands states:

</ul>
<p>

<a name="40706-45_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>I assume that he will pay&#151;indeed, he must pay&#151;the members of the Determinations Panel, unless of course they are to be amateurs. I do not imagine that that is what the Government envisage. The reply given by the noble Baroness does not make the point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="40706-45_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The point is whether it is to be the regulator or the Secretary of State&#151;and the Secretary of State sets levels of pay and so on for non-executives on NDPBs, following, as I said, Cabinet Office guidelines. Not all non-executive members seek, want or receive pay&#151;but that is a subsidiary point. Basically, the Secretary of State sets the levels rather than the regulator because that is consistent across NDPBs.

<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="40706-45_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   It may be a question of English, but I cannot see how anyone can object to saying that the regulator must pay such remunerations as the Secretary of State may determine. That seems to cover the point.

<p><a name="st_114"></a>

<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="40706-45_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   Very well. After what the noble Baroness said, it seems even stranger that the Secretary of State will make provision and the regulator may pay or not as the case may be.
</p>




<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="40706-45_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I shall have yet another go. We have provided that the regulator &quot;may&quot; make such payments as the Secretary of State may determine, rather than requiring the regulator to make such payments. The reason for that is that the regulator should have that slight degree of flexibility within the maxima set by the Secretary of State for NDPBs in accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines.
</p>

<a name="40706-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>The Secretary of State will determine a maximum salary level for panels, but the regulator may agree with some or all members of a panel that they should work, for example, on an expenses-only basis and not receive a salary. This is similar to the way in which some noble Lords have been known not to claim their full entitlement to allowances.

<p><a name="st_122"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 21, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 22, 23 and 24.

<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="40706-46_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I am having some difficulty with this. The basic structure&#151;and this applies to a whole range of bodies&#151;is that there is a maxima payment, on a pro rata basis, for certain services. It may be that three days of work a month represents &#163;10,000 a year or &#163;30,000 a year or whatever. Therefore, certain jobs and responsibilities come with those days attached. The maxima for the work is based on Cabinet Office guidelines and is reflected in the determination by the Secretary of State.

This is the first mention of regulations in anything that we have discussed so far. The noble Baroness has always been helpful on previous occasions in providing us with draft regulations all the way through, and no doubt those subject to the Bill will be interested to know what the fees are likely to be and on what basis they are likely to be charged.

It has always been very helpful. I beg to move.

In the last case OPRA dealt with under this section, involving the return of &#163;50 million to an employer&#151;I have the details with me but it might not be appropriate to read <br>&nbsp;<br>

them into <i>Hansard</i>&#151;it had to write to the affected parties three times with details of the case. With 30,000 members that was done at a cost of more than &#163;75,000, which was borne by other employers who were paying a levy to sponsor the return of the &#163;50-million surplus to an individual employer. We think that it is appropriate in such cases for the employer benefiting from the return of surplus to bear the burden of costs rather than all levy payers.

<a name="40706-46_para9"></a>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>in the course of its operations. That is a very sweeping statement and gives the regulator very considerable protection indeed. I wonder whether, when we come later to questions of disclosure, unauthorised disclosure and so on, we ought to examine this matter a little more clearly. For example, in the context of the present takeover business at Marks & Spencer and so on, the regulator might suddenly and wrongly disclose information that could have very important consequences.

<a name="40706-47_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   As your Lordships have said, Amendment No. 27 would remove the regulator&#039;s exemption from liability in damages. Without this protection, the regulator would be liable in damages for the actions, or failures to act, of its staff. It is not just sins of commission but sins of omission as well. When one thinks of the number of schemes that go down and some of the current rows about regulating regimes, one can see the implications of the provision.
</p>

<a name="40706-47_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>The effect of this would be to prevent the regulator achieving its objectives, in particular protecting members&#039; benefits. I can understand that this exemption may raise eyebrows, as it has today, but perhaps I can suggest why it is necessary.
</p>

<a name="40706-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>Say, for example, that the regulator receives information from a scheme auditor that a particular trustee is about to remove scheme funds for his own purpose.      The regulator, if it reasonably believes that to be the case, should act, via the special procedure, to appoint a trustee with exclusive powers, to take control of the scheme&#039;s bank account and ensure funds cannot be removed. However, if the regulator were liable for damages it would have to consider before acting the consequences and cost of being wrong&#151;the cost of defending potential actions by trustees of the scheme, the employer and any members affected, and of course any damages award.
</p>

<a name="40706-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>One might think that there is therefore a disproportion between the injury done and the amount of risk that might go by the board if one did not have this protection. Ultimately, the costs of all of those damages and action would fall on all members of pension schemes. That would prevent the regulator from acting in the majority of cases&#151;just about any case&#151;unless the evidence is 100 per cent certain and he feels that there is therefore no risk of liability to damages.
</p>

<a name="40706-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>Your Lordships will have noted that, over the page in sub-paragraph (5), there is provision for damages where the regulator has acted in bad faith. Damages <br>&nbsp;<br>

are, of course, also available when the regulator has acted, or failed to act, in contravention of the Human Rights Act 1998. I was told not to believe in precedent, but that is the situation for OPRA. My understanding is that it is also the position for the FSA and its members. It therefore seems appropriate.
</p>

<a name="40706-47_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>From my experience, if there are issues of liability in any sense that involve an intervention, improvement notice, freezing order or other preventive action in which one may be liable for damages, I think it is possible to return to a situation where there are few options between doing nothing or having such certitude that one winds up the scheme and goes for the full nuclear option.
</p>

<a name="40706-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>Throughout the Bill we have provided an array of graduated steps of intervention, with powers attached, in order to prevent the worst case scenario&#151;that of a scheme failing and calling on the Pension Protection Fund because the promise cannot be delivered. Provided that the regulator acts in good faith, is acting reasonably on the information he has been given and is not contradicting human rights legislation, it is right that he is given this degree of protection in the same way as it is given to OPRA, the FSA and similar financial supervisory bodies.

<p><a name="st_135"></a>
<a name="40706-47_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   I understand the term &quot;in bad faith&quot;, but who will decide whether the regulator reasonably believes it to be the case&#151;which I think were the words just used by the Minister?
</p>




<p><a name="st_136"></a>
<a name="40706-47_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Obviously there is a full appeals procedure in place as regards the decisions taken by the regulator&#151;the tribunal through to the ombudsman and so forth. That is available to individuals if there is a view that someone has acted unreasonably. That remedy is always available.
</p>

<a name="40706-47_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>I am assured that the exemption we have provided is narrower than that currently given to OPRA by Section 1(4) of the Pensions Act 1995, in that it would not apply to acts or omissions committed in bad faith; that is, it would not prevent an award of damages under the Human Rights Act 1998.
</p>

<a name="40706-47_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>All I would say is that, over and beyond the bad faith and the human rights points, there are rights of appeal against the judgment of the regulator if that judgment is ill founded in fact and in law. Surely that is where we would want to be.
</p>




<p><a name="st_137"></a>
<a name="40706-47_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   No one would argue that there should not be some protections. In a sense, the noble Baroness was arguing against the principle of having no protection, but there must be some. However, the issue that we are trying to probe is whether the protections need to be quite as whitewashing and draconian as this. We have talked about the conditions under &quot;bad faith&quot;, but are there other conditions in which the exemptions should not be quite so sweeping?

<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="40706-47_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Following the point made by my noble friend, noble Lords will understand that some of these concerns read across to other areas about the form and degree of regulatory practice and the resultant exposure of members of such bodies to criticism, judicial review and the like.
</p>




<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="40706-47_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   One understands that people are reluctant to put themselves at risk. Later in the Bill shareholders will be exposed to just that kind of risk, because we are breaking limited liability in a way which may put them at great risk if a pension fund in a company in which they have invested goes wrong. We have to be even-handed and understand that these motivations work on everyone, not only on regulators.
</p>




<p><a name="st_142"></a>
<a name="40706-47_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I should like to say a word before the noble Baroness responds, otherwise we shall become rather too conversational.
</p>

<a name="40706-47_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>As the noble Baroness has said, this is drawn very widely indeed because otherwise it may be difficult to persuade people to do the job or join the staff of the regulator. We have to balance all that. However, it may be that a person or organisation suffers damage, only to find that they have no form of redress whatsoever. Even where there is no question of bad faith, they none the less would have suffered damage. The question here is about to what extent the balance is right in ensuring that, however bad the damage may be&#151;such as on disclosure of information, wrongly or otherwise, which may amount to tens of millions of pounds&#151;the appropriate redress and the limits of the matter are agreed.
</p>

<a name="40706-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>In effect, the cost is carried by the person who is damaged, or the regulator and those paying the levy or, possibly&#151;my old Treasury hackles rise when saying this&#151;the taxpayer, or I suppose that it could be insured. I am not sure to what extent that might be possible. In any event, we need to look at this sub-paragraph again. The general opinion of the Grand Committee is that this provision is very broad.

<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="40706-47_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Before the noble Lord decides what to do with his amendment&#151;given the conventions of the Grand Committee, he should withdraw it&#151;perhaps I may say a few more words. We all accept the point about bad faith and understand that the remedy of judicial review is available if the actions taken were inappropriate. However, I am puzzled by the notion of the basis on which we think the regulator will intervene. He would intervene on the basis of a scheme return which has raised concerns about the level of underfunding and the capacity of the pension scheme to meet its pension promise. The regulator would then proceed on that basis, in <br>&nbsp;<br>

conjunction with Standard & Poor&#039;s risk assessments and so forth, to produce&#151;we hope in consultation with the trustees&#151;a remediation strategy. Only if that fails, or if it is impossible by virtue of the issues to be raised in Clauses 35 onwards that the company is unwilling to make good, would we then be drawn into a much more adversarial situation.
</p>

<a name="40706-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>At what point in that process would one regard the regulator as being liable for damages for acting in the way laid down by law, even if ultimately he is able to reach agreement with the company and the trustees to make good the funding of the pension scheme? Is it a slur on the character of the trustees that the regulator has asked them to remedy the situation? Yes, I suppose it is, but then so they should. The fact that the trustees are carrying an underfunded pension scheme is a perfectly proper piece of public information based on the scheme return.
</p>

<a name="40706-47_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>I am finding it quite hard to conceive of the circumstances in which one would regard the proper activity of the regulator, which may rightly be critical of the company or the trustees, as inappropriate. Only if the criticisms were not well founded in fact, based on the scheme returns, could an issue of damages payable due to the unjustified imputation of reputation be justified. As I say, I have difficulty in envisaging the scenario.
</p>

<a name="40706-47_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>I imagine that the noble Lord will want to come back to this on Report. At that point perhaps he will describe for us the situation in which he thinks that there should be some constraint on the regulator acting for fear that if he did, a claim for damages might be pursued on other members of the body. The amendment would serve to limit the capacity of the regulator to act. Do we wish to see that, and in what circumstances would the noble Lord want it to happen? If the noble Lord can help me on this point, we may be able to take the argument further on Report. However, I repeat that I am perfectly happy to write on the legal and technical details of this point.

<a name="40706-48_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   Perhaps I can help the noble Baroness, because I think that she has moved on a tack concerning reputation.

The Minister has talked about the regulator acting reasonably and carrying out his obligations, and that is fine.

<a name="40706-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>As I said in my contribution to Amendment No. 1, moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, the Bill sets up a most peculiar form of corporate governance.

</p>

<a name="40706-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>The Explanatory Notes make great play of relying on the Higgs report on corporate governance for the regulator&#039;s governance performance, yet there is no recommendation in that report or in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, which now implements it, for a non-executive committee in the form and shape envisaged by the Bill. To make matters worse, under the Bank of England Act there is in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC137"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column GC137</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Bank a sub-committee of non-executive members of the Court. The non-executives massively exceed the executives, by 16 to three. We have had that discussion, but I wanted to make the point for future reference.
</p>

<a name="40706-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>Paragraph 28 of the Explanatory Notes quotes the Higgs review as recommending a balance between executive and non-executive members including&#151;I underline the point&#151;independent non-executives. The Bill makes no reference to independent non-executives, who are key to the Combined Code recommendations on audit committees and remuneration committees. Under Higgs and the Combined Code the chairman, even if non-executive as is currently the case in the Bill, is not independent except at appointment. Hence, the chairman of a public limited company is not a member of an audit or remuneration committee, but in the Bill he actually chairs the non-executive committee, which seems to cover at least the audit committee territory and some of the remuneration committee territory.
</p>

<a name="40706-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>A non-executive committee is objectionable because it potentially undermines the unitary nature of the board/regulator overall. The functions of the non-executive committee ascribed in Clause 9(3) are only loosely derived from the Higgs report and the Combined Code, but the important point is that under Higgs they are not functions of the non-executives acting as a separate group. Rather they are a definition of the contribution of the non-executives to the unitary board as a whole.
</p>

<a name="40706-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>Technically, as we have discussed, in Clause 8 the Bill creates the non-executive committee as a sub-committee of the regulator&#039;s board, which means that it derives its authority from the board and must report to it. This seems strange because in essence it would be reporting to itself.
</p>

<a name="40706-48_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>I have some questions to put to the Minister. If Higgs is the model, why is there no differentiation between independent and non-independent non-executives and why, in particular, is it appropriate for the chairman to chair the non-executives? Do the Government believe that the Bill creates a new unitary board for the regulator? How do they reconcile their provisions with the first Higgs principle, that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;The Board is collectively responsible for promoting the success of the company by leading and directing the company&#039;s affairs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-48_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>Why are the non-executives&#039; roles spelt out in the Bill but not the role of the whole board? Why have the Government chosen to set up a non-executive committee at all? Higgs said that non-executives should meet without the executives present and at least once a year without the chairman present. Clearly, the Bill provides otherwise.
</p>

<a name="40706-48_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>There is nothing equivalent to Clause 9 in the combined code. It also says that the non-executives should meet once a year without the chairman to discuss the chairman&#039;s performance. Why is that not in the Bill? Why does Clause 9(4) require a separate report in the annual report from the non-executives? I understand that there is no parallel in commercial or any other practice, except in the Bank of England Act.

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>I shall see whether there are any questions that I have not answered, but most of those asked were covered by the Higgs report on corporate governance. The only one with which we were slightly at odds was on whether the chairman of the regulatory body was also the chairman of the non-executive committee. That was the only one on which we had some divergence, so I shall come back on it.

Perhaps she could write to me on that. She referred to my merely citing the Bank of England Act.

<br>
(a)   which is compatible with its objectives under section 5, and

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(   )   In discharging its functions the Regulator (and, where relevant, the Non-Executive Committee and the Determinations Panel) must have regard to&#151;

<br>
(a)   the need to use its resources in the most efficient and economic way,


<br>
(b)   the principle that a burden or restriction which is imposed should be proportionate to the benefits, considered in general terms, which are expected to result from the imposition of that burden or restriction,


<br>
(c)   the need to minimise any adverse effects that may arise from anything done in the discharge of those functions, and


<br>
(d)   the interests of all persons who may be affected (including members, employers and others with an interest in, or an obligation in respect of, the scheme concerned).


<br>
(   )   The Regulator (and, where relevant, the Non-Executive Committee and the Determinations Panel) shall have regard to the need for openness regarding its activities and shall consult with interested persons and their representative bodies when developing policies procedures and practices.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_158"></a>The noble Lord said: The objective of the amendment is effectively to set guidelines for the way in which the regulator may discharge its function and, to some extent where relevant, the way in which the non-executive committee and the determination committee shall operate. It sets out the fact that the objectives must be compatible with Clause 5 and in a number of other ways, such as the need to use resources most efficiently and the principle that any restriction or burden imposed should be proportionate to benefits. It seems appropriate that the regulator should have some guidelines set out in legislation, and that it should have the need for openness on its activities.
</p>

<a name="40706-49_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>I am trying to remember to what extent that is true so far as OPRA is concerned. My experience has been in relation to particular issues rather than the general extent to which its operations shall be published and public. The guidelines may not be ideal, but they seem the kind of thing that the industry as such&#151;we have had representations on the matter&#151;thinks appropriate to include. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_159"></a>
<a name="40706-49_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   It is hard to object to the amendment; it seems quite sensible.


</p>




<p><a name="st_160"></a>
<a name="40706-49_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   It does seem hard to object to the   amendment. It contains a number of favourite governmental words, such as &quot;openness&quot;, &quot;proportionate&quot; and &quot;efficient&quot;. I do not know what the inverted commas at the end mean, but, subject to that, the amendment is splendid. However, is it really necessary to add it to the Bill?

<p><a name="st_161"></a>
<a name="40706-49_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   My advice states that it is not, splendid though the amendment is and despite the seemingly universal assent. The regulator has the functions transferred to it from OPRA and the other functions conferred on it by the Bill. The clause sets out further detail on how the new regulator will discharge its function and reserves certain functions to the non-executive committee. It also reserves the discharge of certain of the regulator&#039;s regulatory functions to a special committee called the Determinations Panel, as the Committee is aware. The <br>&nbsp;<br>

regulator&#039;s general powers to delegate certain functions are subject to the Secretary of State&#039;s power to make regulations.
</p>

<a name="40706-49_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>The amendment seeks to make the regulator more accountable in its policies, procedures and practices. It also aims to ensure that the duties and functions of the regulator discharged to the non-executive committee and the Determinations Panel meet the regulator&#039;s objectives specified in Clause 5. That is, indeed, our intention. The proposals for a new regulator have been developed in the findings of the Pickering report of July 2002, the NAO report on OPRA of November 2002 and the quinquennial review of OPRA in December 2002. They all recommended that, in future, the Pensions Regulator should target its resources on those areas where members&#039; benefits were at greatest risk.
</p>

<a name="40706-49_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>That view is supported by the Better Regulation Task Force&#039;s <i>Principles of Better Regulation</i>, published in 1998 and revised in 2000, which recommends that regulators be proportionate, targeted, accountable, consistent and transparent. The introduction of statutory objectives is one way to address the criticisms of OPRA. The objectives provide a driving force for the organisation and will allow for flexibility of regulatory approach. In the light of that reassurance, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment. We do not think it necessary.
</p>




<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="40706-49_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   That was a rather disappointing reply. As the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, pointed out, the sentiments are admirable and might reasonably provide some guidance to the regulator on the way in which he would operate. There is certainly feeling in the industry that it would be appropriate to have some guidelines. Perhaps those suggested in the amendment are not sufficiently concrete. By Report, we might try to formulate something rather more specific.
</p>




<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="40706-49_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I want to reinforce some of what my noble friend says. The regulator will not be subject to being sued, so there is not that sort of restraint. There is not even any requirement on him that he not be negligent. It is as well to have that offset to some extent by a set of objectives whereby he can be judged in the court of the public, as it were, where we can all see whether he is doing what he is supposed to do. To have a requirement for openness is absolutely key if we are dealing with someone as protected as the regulator is to be.
</p>

<a name="40706-49_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>It is also important to look at the wider interests of the people whom the regulator is supposed to cover, as opposed to the narrow interests in relation to their immediate pensions. Unless we have these requirements in the Bill, or something very similar to them, we will find that we are dealing with an organisation that is not as accountable or responsible as it should be, as there is no way for the public to judge it or for a body that has suffered at its hands to seek redress. It is enormously important, because of the restrictions on suing, that we have an explicit commitment to openness and breadth of judgment.

</p>




<p><a name="st_165"></a>
<a name="40706-49_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I shall add a word or two about this clause at this stage. My noble friend Lord Skelmersdale posed a number of specific questions regarding the way in which the regulator will operate and the Minister said that she will write to us about that. The main point he was making was that the Explanatory Notes make great play about the Higgs report on corporate governance in relation to the governance requirements of the regulator, but when one comes to look at the detail, it does not seem to be the case that Higgs is reflected. For example, the case my noble friend gave about whether the non-executives should meet at least once a year to consider the position of the chairman is tremendously important.
</p>

<a name="40706-49_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>Over recent years, we have seen considerable developments in the role of non-executives. I know from personal experience that the relationship between chief executive and chairman can be very important for effective governance in any organisation. I think that the point my noble friend made is important. I also think that the idea of a non-executive committee undermines the unity of the board to some extent; it is not helpful. Having sat on various boards, I think that once the non-executives start getting together, particularly in a formal situation such as a committee, it does not, on the whole, result in the governance being as coherent as it would normally be.
</p>

<a name="40706-49_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>I shall not go over all the specific points made by my noble friend but I think that the claim that this is based on the Higgs report is open to considerable doubt when one goes into the matter. I hope that the noble Baroness will write to us about it. I wonder specifically whether at the moment the arrangements are as correct as they ought to be. We have some doubts about the structure of the regulator, which is obviously very important.
</p>

<p><a name="st_166"></a>
<a name="40706-50_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I entirely agree with what my noble friend said. This is not a Higgs arrangement. In England, we do not have supervisory boards in the general run of corporations, which are what the Bill is moving towards creating. Non-executive directors act as part of the board; we have a single board and non-executive directors work through that. There will be committees of the board and there will be functions that will be operated separately, but the responsibilities belong to the board. That is, by and large, the structure that Higgs addresses in his report.
</p>

<a name="40706-50_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>We obviously want to be informed by what my former colleague says about the way in which companies should be run. I hope that we will produce something in line with current thinking. But if we are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC143"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column GC143</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

producing a structure that is as far from the basic structure that Higgs addresses in his report as the one we are now contemplating&#151;which is much closer to a continental model of how a board should be run than to a UK model&#151; then we must review matters from the base upwards. Higgs cannot be applied as if it is the current best practice because it does not address this kind of situation. Either we have to go to something that more closely reflects the way in which a best-practice company operates or we must review the conclusions that Higgs reached to see whether they apply to the rather strange model in front of us.
</p>

<a name="40706-50_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>I have not heard any arguments advanced about why this is the right way to do things. Why do we have to invent our own way of doing things just for pensions? Why is the existing model, as it works with companies and corporate boards, not the one to follow? What is wrong with the unitary board? Why do we need to create this second tier? If we are creating a second tier, we need to be much more precise about what it is and what the relationship between it and the executives is. On the continent, there is a structure and a tradition that governs the way in which the two parts work together and the relationship between them. It is quite different in concept. Although one uses the same words when talking about it, it is quite different in concept from the way in which non-executives work with boards in this country. It may be the best way of doing things, but I want to hear the arguments about why we should follow the Dutch model rather than the English one.

<a name="40706-50_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I am slightly puzzled by this. Obviously, this has been discussed and consulted on. We have had either silence or support for these proposals. I do not quite understand why we are trying to reinvent either Higgs or Cadbury when, as I understand it, we are proposing to extract from Higgs the appropriate bit that fits a non-departmental public body. That is what we are doing. That separation is in the Bill in Clause 9 and other clauses, clearly laying out the functions of the non-executive committee&#151;a strategic review function that needs to be set aside from the daily running. One reason why the chairman is an appropriate member of that body is that his salary is determined by the Secretary of State rather than by the rest of the board, which is perhaps different from private companies.
</p>




<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="40706-50_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   Would the noble Baroness say that sentence again? I did not quite catch it.

<p><a name="st_169"></a>
<a name="40706-50_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The chairman&#039;s pay is set by the Secretary of State. Therefore, it is not subject to review by the rest of the non-executive members. I was being pressed on why the chairman was a member, and that is one distinction from a non-departmental board, because it comes within the guidelines of the Cabinet Office.

<a name="40706-50_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>So I am a bit puzzled about why people are puzzled by this structure. It seems to me consistent and congruent with developing good practice, following Cadbury and Higgs&#151;and following abuses in the City&#151;as applied to non-departmental public bodies in the light of the review of OPRA and other consultation exercises we have had. As I understand it, until today we have had no dissent from anywhere about this structure.
</p>

<a name="40706-50_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>I am perfectly willing to believe that your Lordships have concerns that have not been picked up outside. However, I am a little surprised by this. I am very happy to write back more fully on the detail of how we expect this to operate. If there are still concerns, then your Lordships will no doubt want to revisit them. My understanding, however, is that across the industry there has been either silence or consent to this structure as the appropriate way forward given the responsibilities that we are asking this body to carry. So I am a little taken aback by the assault on this structure as somehow un-British. If British structures have led to some of the problems we have seen in the past, perhaps it is time we moved on.

<p><a name="st_171"></a>
<a name="40706-50_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I did not say that any particular body had been consulted. However, two or three weeks ago when I myself had discussions on this and other matters with senior FSA members, they seemed entirely comfortable with the structure. I was interested in exploring whether we shared some of the concepts of risk, analysis of the structure and ideas on the roles of the regulator and the appropriateness of the division of responsibility between the two bodies. I was given full reassurance on all those points.
</p>




<p><a name="st_172"></a>
<a name="40706-50_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   Will the noble Baroness tell us which bodies have been consulted? It seemed to us apparent that the claim in the Explanatory Notes about Higgs was not well founded. It was a fashionable thing to say, &quot;This is in conformity with Higgs&quot;, but when you begin to look at it, it turns out that it is not. For example, the point I made earlier about whether the non-executives will meet at least once a year without the chairman present does not seem to appear at all. There are real issues here. Although the noble Baroness apparently has not had representations on them, these issues are important. Can she tell us who has been consulted on this specific aspect of the Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_173"></a>
<a name="40706-50_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   It is not like that. We are proposing this structure as a result of Cadbury, Higgs and the like. The structure is known and has been exposed and is in the Bill. I had a meeting a fortnight or 10 days ago with the senior players, including the chairman, from NAPF. Of all the concerns they could have raised with me, one that they did not raise was this structure. Obviously we have consulted with OPRA members about their experience, but both myself and my colleagues in the other place have had a series of meetings with <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC145"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column GC145</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

interested and very powerful parties, including NAPF and the FSA, at which we discussed a whole agenda of issues of mutual concern. This could have been raised by them if they thought it inappropriate. In all the meetings that I have had, no one has mentioned at any stage that this is not the appropriate way forward.
</p>

<a name="40706-50_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>As far as I am aware, we seem to have narrowed this down to one issue&#151;we discussed it previously with the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale&#151;and that is whether the chairman of the regulatory authority should chair the non-executive committee, which is not a Higgs recommendation. One of the distinctions I made was that a non-departmental government body chairman has his or her salary or pay determined by the Secretary of State. That is why there may not be a parallel with private companies, which may wish the non-executive directors to consider that role. It is not appropriate here.
</p>

<a name="40706-50_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>Apart from that, I have not heard anything from Members opposite to suggest that the structures we have in place are in no sense appropriate or, indeed, are inappropriate. I have been asked why we have developed them in this way; I have gone through the history of the corporate governance structure we have pursued. It has been exposed in the form of the Bill and through numerous meetings with important players, who have not shown any concern about the structure.
</p>

<a name="40706-50_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>I am a little puzzled why Members of the Committee opposite seem to be labouring the point. Let me put a question back to the noble Lord. Has he had representations from any bodies or professional groups indicating that they have worries about the structure, in particular the role of the chairman, that he feels we should have addressed but have not done so? If he has, I shall be very happy to take them away and consider them, but I have not heard him or any noble Lords opposite put such an argument. Obviously we can argue about particular words, but does the noble Lord have any evidence that this is a concern to other bodies?

<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="40706-50_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   The arguments put forward by my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale spell out very clearly where the concerns exist. The Higgs report is the basis on which the Government have promoted their view. It is not the case, as the noble Baroness said, that there is only one outstanding item. When she reads <i>Hansard</i> she will find that there are a number of areas where we have expressed concern.

<a name="40706-50_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>But let us not delay the Committee longer at this stage. These are important points.

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column GC146</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>




<p><a name="st_176"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 31, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 32 and 33. The amendments are concerned with the clause, which sets out the regulator&#039;s objectives. Clause 5(1)(d) states that the regulator has a function,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;to promote, and to improve understanding of, the good administration of work-based pension schemes&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-51_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>I can see that, in a way, that is an appropriate function, but is it really appropriate for someone regulating a part of our society to seek to tell us how to go about it? Is it really an educational function of a regulator? There may be a strong case for ensuring that trustees and others understand their responsibilities&#151;we shall come to that at a later stage&#151;but I have some doubts whether that educational function is an appropriate role for the regulator.
</p>

<a name="40706-51_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>Amendment No. 32 seeks to insert an additional objective for the regulator&#151;namely, to promote occupational pension provision by minimising regulatory burdens applying to well run schemes and their sponsoring employers. The trouble with this is that the regulator itself will impose considerable extra burdens on employers sponsoring schemes and on trustees, so some injunction to the regulator to minimise those burdens is important. Similarly, at page 3, line 8, it is suggested that, in conjunction with the pension protection fund, the regulator should take steps to ensure that the cost of the levy on occupational schemes is kept to a minimum.
</p>

<a name="40706-51_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>Our concern is that while the objective of the Bill is desirable, its effect is likely to reduce rather than increase the number of occupational pension schemes that survive&#151;I think that that is the right word&#151;in the present environment. While it is clearly desirable that the regulator should carry out its operations that protect pensioners, the fact that the regulator will be more intrusive is no great help if a particular group of pensioners finds that its scheme closes or closes to new members as a result of employers getting fed up&#151;I think that that is the right expression&#151;with additional burdens on top of those they are carrying at the moment.
</p>

<a name="40706-51_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>Elsewhere, particularly in the Finance Bill, the Government have sought to simplify matters. But there is no doubt that, as a result of introducing the Bill, the regulator will increase the burden on pension funds and the amount of work that they have to do, without any benefit to their members. These amendments seek to ensure that that is kept to a minimum. I beg to move.

<a name="40706-51_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   I hope that the Minister will not feel disposed to accept these amendments. I do not suppose that she will. Clearly, they would set out in the Bill the desire to keep regulation down. No one wants to have unnecessary regulation or to have an unnecessarily high levy. However, to put these two requirements in the Bill sends out entirely the wrong message. One has to have regulation in order to protect people. That is what all this is about. If one does not have regulation, one does not have protection. It is a question of getting the balance right. If this is put in the <br>&nbsp;<br>

It may seem odd to seek to take out an objective to promote and improve understanding of the good administration of work-based pension schemes. But it is important to be clear about the functions of the regulator. If we look at the Financial Services Authority, there is increasing evidence that it is getting itself into hot water and is undermined in carrying out its proper functions in cracking down on the split capital trust scandal because it also has a duty to promote, inform and educate. Some of the material it issued a year or two ago is being used by the people in the split capital scandal to say that it was partly encouraging people. A regulator in this position, with very important quasi-judicial powers, should not at the same time have this sort of wiffley-waffley clause saying, &quot;promote these things&quot;. That is a different job. It is not an appropriate job for the regulator and we support Amendment No. 31.

<a name="40706-51_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   First, Amendment No. 31 would remove the responsibility to promote good practice. It is important that the regulator has clear objectives. It provides a framework for regulatory activities. The establishment of such objectives was a strong recommendation of the National Audit Office study of OPRA in 2002. We hope to combine that, as my noble friend said, with appropriate flexibility.
</p>

<a name="40706-51_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>The two major changes proposed by the noble Lord are to add in two additional amendments that were criticised by my noble friend Lady Turner. The concern is to reduce burdens on pension funds. Obviously, we seek to minimise inappropriate regulatory burdens; it would be wrong to seek to minimise appropriate regulatory burdens. The risk-based approach will concentrate on those schemes where scheme members&#039; benefits are most at risk, with minimal regulatory intervention for well run schemes. Surely, that is what we all wish for. Well run, appropriately funded schemes will have less contact with the regulator than they did with OPRA, which did not have the discretion to make that judgment and did not operate in a risk-focused way. A risk-focused approach to regulation does exactly what my noble friend asked for, which is seeking to protect members&#039; benefits where they could be at risk, without in any <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC148"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column GC148</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

sense being oppressive to a well run scheme. By a well run scheme, we also mean an adequately funded scheme where benefits are not at risk.
</p>

<a name="40706-51_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>The second new objective laid down by the noble Lord is that, in conjunction with the PPF, the regulator should take all reasonable steps to maintain the cost of the levy to the minimum compatible, which would oblige the regulator to work with the board of the PPF to minimise the levy payable by occupational pension schemes. Obviously, we want that partnership, but the board of the PPF will be responsible for setting PPF levy rates and structures. It will be the responsibility of the board to understand the implications that the levy structure will have on pension schemes and the overall funding position of the PPF.
</p>

<a name="40706-51_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>Before altering the levy rate or the structure, the board will be required to consult the stakeholders and publish any determination that it makes relating to the levies. There are already appropriate measures in the Bill to check the cost of the levies payable by schemes. The cost of the PPF rather than the cost of the regulator is the most significant financial responsibility of the companies affected. The regulator, like OPRA, is being funded indirectly through a levy on pension schemes. The regulator will collect that levy on behalf of the Secretary of State, who will set the rate as he does for OPRA. As previously discussed, we envisage that being around &#163;23 million a year, compared to &#163;17 million a year.
</p>

<a name="40706-51_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>It is not right to expect, or to require, the regulator at this stage to move into the territory of determining the levy rate, which is the responsibility of the PPF board and will be subject to consultation in the appropriate way. I hope that with those responses, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_181"></a>
<a name="40706-51_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I very much hope that the noble Baroness will address herself to what the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, said about Amendment No. 31. It causes problems when an organisation that sets out to be a regulator becomes at the same time an adviser. They will presumably under the powers in the Bill put forward suggestions and schemes as to how a pension fund should be organised. When one of those proves to be deficient, and some new way is discovered of defrauding pensioners, the defence will be, &quot;Oh well, you told us how to run a good scheme and you did not warn us against this&quot;. That is happening to the FSA at the moment. It is not necessary to dig that pit in front of this regulator. It has a job to do; it should do that job, which is to protect pensioners. If it gets into the business of advising companies on how to run pension funds, it will only make its future work more dangerous and difficult.
</p>




<p><a name="st_182"></a>
<a name="40706-51_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde: </b>   I hope that the Minister does not give way on that point. I was somewhat taken aback by the support for paragraph (d) coming out. I take the point about the FSA. I accept that it is not just in one area, but in two areas, that it is in trouble because of its advice. Here, we are dealing with the administration of work-based pension <br>&nbsp;<br>

schemes. Many of those schemes have got into trouble because they have not had anyone to advise them properly. Hopefully, that is what the regulator will do in the areas of good administration. Certainly, improved understanding is absolutely necessary. If they do not go to the regulator, where do they go? It is terribly important that this paragraph stays in.
</p>

<a name="40706-51_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>While I am on my feet, I have some difficulty with Amendments Nos. 32 and 33. Having been the chairman of a regulatory body, a housing corporation, I can see people having a field day with these amendments if they go into the Bill. You have only got to judge by &quot;minimising regulatory burdens&quot;. Who decides? To some people, that means no regulatory burdens.
</p>

<a name="40706-51_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>I will try not to take up too much time. Amendment No. 33 includes the phrase,

<a name="40706-51_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>It is important that in our exchanges, as recorded in <i>Hansard</i>, it is noted that we must somehow keep the levy level down as low as possible. We cannot let the regulator run away with that. Once we take on board in the primary legislation,

<p><a name="st_183"></a>
<a name="40706-52_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I will answer the point raised by the noble Baroness. If you are running a company, you do not go to a regulator for advice on how to run it. The most immediately obvious adviser that you would turn to is your accountant, or perhaps your auditors. Amendment No. 156, in my name, brings in that part of the European directive that requires schemes to be properly run. That becomes a matter on which the auditors report and the auditors have an interface. That would be the ordinary way in which a scheme would become and be seen to be well-regulated. To my mind, that is how it should be done, rather than compromising the regulator.
</p>




<p><a name="st_184"></a>
<a name="40706-52_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde: </b>   The noble Lord has more confidence in accountants and auditors than I do.

</p>




<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="40706-52_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde: </b>   Yes, well, that is fine. We talked about two cases that are with the FSA at the moment. If we look at the record of the City, the scandals and their implications for the position of the professional bodies, accountants, auditors, lawyers, I suggest that their record is far worse than the record of the FSA.
</p>




<p><a name="st_187"></a>
<a name="40706-52_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   Yes. That is exactly why the regulator should stick to its business of criticising and leave advice to other people.
</p>




<p><a name="st_188"></a>

opposite, certainly the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, have such a negative, disciplinary idea of the role of the regulator. We are trying above all to create a culture of compliance, information and best practice. One should not extract that from what else is going on in the Bill. For example, I referred earlier to the fact that for the first time all companies will be required to have at least one third of their trustees nominated by members. That will mean that for the first time we will have a new cohort of trustees who possibly have not been trained. We hope and expect that they will be trained and will act in a responsible way, and there are clauses dealing with that.
</p>

<a name="40706-52_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>That is the sort of thing that I would expect the regulator to be issuing as guidance; whether you call this information, education, or a climate of compliance, I do not really mind. It might also be guidance to trustees to ensure that accounts are provided on time, or checking the cash equivalent transfer values.
</p>

<a name="40706-52_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>I was talking to an old friend who is chief executive of a major media company, and he is also on the pensions board of the consortium of those companies, from the Anglia region. I asked him what percentage, in his major company, of member nominations trustees there were. There was something like half. I asked him if they were useful, and he said &quot;Yes. For example, we wanted to adapt, or change, the cash equivalent transfer value of schemes, which as far as existing employees were concerned, was absolutely fine by them, but none the less the trustees, including the member nominations, said that we had to do a broad consultation exercise, which we had not expected to do&quot;. That was their experience.
</p>

<a name="40706-52_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>If you are trying to lay down lines for CETV&#151;and there are new rules under the Pensions Bill which will allow you to do that&#151;you will want to establish the good practice in the minds of employees and employers alike that you do not milk people who are leaving the scheme and who may as a result never build up a decent pension portfolio.
</p>

<a name="40706-52_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>Whether you call this information, education, compliance or informed choice I do not really mind or care, it is a job that needs to be done&#151;particularly given the increased responsibility of trustees for the scheme specific funding, which they will have to monitor with the aid of the one-size-fits-all minimum funding requirement that we have had in the past. This suggests that the regulator needs to act in a proactive way, which I think is highly desirable.
</p>

<a name="40706-52_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>I cannot conceive that the regulator and members of the regulatory body will wish to go down any route that interferes with their task of ensuring the protection of members&#039; benefits. The best way to do that is to have alert and empowered trustees. The regulator has a part&#151;but only a modest part&#151;to play in developing that expertise.

</p>

<a name="40706-52_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>I do not think there is any difference between the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, and myself; we are all agreed that it is important that the position of pensioners should be protected. But if one is not to deter companies from continuing to have such schemes, then it is important that the burden on them should be minimised. That is what the amendment seeks to do. Whether it is a function or an objective is an arguable point.
</p>

<a name="40706-52_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>So far as concerns the first amendment, the question is whether it is an appropriate objective of the regulator&#151;it is interesting that it appears as an objective and not as a function&#151;to promote better understanding and so on. The noble Baroness, Lady Dean, saw it as more of a function. If the regulator is to intervene in the kind of situation she described&#151;where a particular fund has problems and so on&#151;it may be appropriate for it to intervene in ensuring that pensioners are protected, but a role in educating trustees across the board would seem to be a quite different function.
</p>

<a name="40706-52_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>There are various other organisations to which trustees can go for advice.
</p>




<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="40706-52_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   How I envisage that might happen, for example, is that the regulator would issue a document offering advice about best practice which may or may not have statutory authority. Why would it not be appropriate for the regulator to issue a code of guidance on some aspect of best practice to all trustees, not only in the major companies but in the tiny companies that will come within this remit for the first time? Why should it not do that?
</p>

<a name="40706-52_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>If we do not have this power in the way laid out, it is conceivable that someone could complain on the grounds of <i>ultra vires</i> that it did not have the power to use it. That would be absurd.
</p>




<p><a name="st_191"></a>
<a name="40706-52_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   If it were a power it would be under &quot;regulatory functions&quot;. I think I am right in saying that this is an objective, not a power. But, by all means, let us transfer it to regulatory functions. In that case it is clear what it will be doing; it will be issuing codes of practice and so on.
</p>

<a name="40706-52_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>It will certainly not be possible to operate within the very tight manpower restraints referred to by the noble Baroness earlier; there will be only &#163;7 million a year more than for OPRA to go into the highways and byways and carry out a broad educational process. It does not seem to me that that is what a regulator is about. The regulator&#039;s function and its objectives are rather different. I should like an exhortation, if you like, on the face of the Bill that the carrying out of its prime responsibilities to protect the benefits set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and so on should be exercised with the minimum of cost to pension schemes. I think that is important. I would very much like to believe the Minister when she says that there will be interventions only in badly run schemes. I will probably never know, but I would be astonished if the scheme of which I was chairman until recently&#151;it was even commended as a <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_193"></a>
<a name="40706-52_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I am not on the promotion point, but on the one about the extent to which there is intervention. I take note of what has been said. Again, the question is one of balance. We must make sure that we do not create a situation where, because things become too interventionist and heavy handed, schemes close down and pensioners do not have the benefit of a scheme. It is all very well to protect them in the existing scheme, but if employers get fed up and decide that they will not have it anyway, the object is pointless.
</p>

<a name="40706-52_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>The amendment sought to ensure that the risk of schemes closing down was reduced, as the regulator would always have in mind the costs that it was likely to impose on business. There may not be any difference between us, but the balance seemed better restored with the amendments. If we do not have them, things are more lopsided. However, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40706-52_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>The subsection refers to subsection (1)(b), which protects the benefits and so on. That seems rather restrictive, as it applies to only those who have direct payment arrangements, whatever they may be, and when the pension is a stakeholder pension. We agree that most of the Bill is concerned with defined benefit schemes, but the provision seems to extend it to defined contribution schemes. Is that why the provision is there? Is it simply to make it clear that not merely defined benefit schemes are covered?

<a name="40706-53_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   They are set out in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999.

If the employee pays in 5 per cent, the employer hands over 10 per cent to the pension scheme administrators. This provision would cover that situation, which is a version of direct payment, thus bringing it within the remit of the regulator.

<a name="40706-53_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   It would not necessarily cover some defined contribution schemes. The regulator will have two functions: protecting the security of the pension promise so far as defined benefits are concerned; and taking responsibility for ensuring that there is no fraud in all schemes.

<a name="40706-53_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I shall take a moment to check that I understand the point. There will be pension schemes where the employer makes no contribution whatsoever. The regulator has no remit to ensure that the conditions of the scheme are met because it does not exist. It is a private personal pension and is therefore not covered.
</p>

<a name="40706-53_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>We are talking about schemes, of which hybrid schemes are an example, where the employer and the employee make contributions and the employer pays the total sum across to the pension scheme managers. The purpose of the provision is to make it clear that the regulator has only a limited role for personal pensions because the FSA looks after the regulation of personal pension providers. However, in so far as these are versions of workplace schemes to which the employer contributes, the remit of the regulator would extend to them.

pension for a non-working spouse. In that case it is clear that no contribution would be made by an employer. I do not see how that arrangement would be any business of the regulator.

<a name="40706-53_spnew19"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I had rather assumed that the Pensions Regulator would regulate all pensions, but obviously I am mistaken in that. Perhaps that is why I have delayed the Grand Committee unnecessarily. Can we be clear which pensions will not in any way come under the remit of the regulator?
</p>




<p><a name="st_215"></a>
<a name="40706-53_spnew20"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I shall be happy to write to noble Lords at greater length on this point. The regulator will regulate what conventionally would be called defined benefit salary schemes; that is, occupational, workplace-based salary schemes. But also, where appropriate, the regulator will ensure that schemes to which the employer as well as the employer makes contributions and which are paid direct may also come within the regulator&#039;s protection. That is not necessarily in terms of the benefits that may accrue, because a defined contribution scheme does not guarantee the benefits that may accrue, but the regulator will provide protection against fraud, for example.
</p>

<a name="40706-53_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>Essentially, the regulator will ensure that final salary schemes or, where appropriate, hybrid schemes that are workplace based and to which the employer on behalf of the employee makes contributions are sufficiently funded to meet the pension promise that formed part of the original pension contract. However, the Pensions Regulator will also take on wider functions, such as against fraud, where contributions are made by both the employer and the employee. But there will some pensions, such as my example in which a husband purchases a stakeholder pension for his non-working spouse, which are not workplace based and are therefore not in any sense the function of the regulator. However, if such pensions have been inappropriately sold, they may be the responsibility of the Financial Services Authority, to be dealt with under the remit of mis-selling. That is my understanding of the structure of the pension schemes. I am not quite sure why we are at odds on this point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_216"></a>
<a name="40706-53_spnew21"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I do not think that we are at odds; it is merely a question of my being educated.

<p><a name="st_227"></a>
<a name="40706-54_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Higgins </b>   moved Amendment No. 34:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>Page 3, line 25, leave out &quot;(except borrow money)&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_228"></a>The noble Lord said: I have just realised that there was a point on the previous amendment that I forgot to make.
</p>

<a name="40706-54_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>Amendment No. 34 is nice and straightforward, so we need not worry unduly. Clause 6 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;The Regulator may do anything (except borrow money) which . . . is calculated to facilitate the exercise of its functions, or . . . is incidental or conducive to their exercise&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-54_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>When I first tabled the amendment, I thought that it concerned the Pension Protection Fund which, when we come to discuss it, I will suggest is very likely to be short of money and may need to borrow. That is not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC157"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column GC157</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the case at all at this stage and the amendment is actually concerned with the regulator. For reasons about which we are not clear, the regulator is not allowed to borrow money. The regulator may well find that it needs to borrow money because it has underestimated the levy or its costs are more than originally thought, and the Treasury will not give it any more.
</p>

<a name="40706-54_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>I have an incidental point that the noble Baroness may be able to clarify, again based on my failure to understand the situation. There is obviously a levy so far as the Pension Protection Fund is concerned, but is the levy to be used to finance the regulator the same levy or part of the same levy? They are two quite separate levies. We will come to how the levy for the Pension Protection Fund is calculated, but I am not clear how the levy for the payment of the regulator will be calculated. If it is inadequate and the regulator needs to borrow money, perhaps we should be clear about the situation and why the paragraph is in the Bill. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_229"></a>
<a name="40706-54_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   It is delightful that the noble Lord is encouraging us to allow the regulator to increase his expenditure. A previous amendment would have reduced his expenditure on the grounds that it was a burden on business, but I am sure that he will not mind the tease.
</p>

<a name="40706-54_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>The provision on not borrowing money is also the position for OPRA. Given the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, for sources, I should say that paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 to the Pensions Act 1995 limits that power. The basic reason for the provision is that the regulator&#039;s expenses, apart from staffing, are the likes of office leasing, IT equipment, stationery and so on. The resources produced by the levy of &#163;23 million should be more than adequate. If not, it is obviously available to the regulator to increase the levy in due course.
</p>

<a name="40706-54_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>That is entirely different from the Pension Protection Fund. When we reach that part of the Bill, we will all agree that its costs are much more volatile and unpredictable. When a scheme goes under, for example, one does not know whether it has 200 members or 2,000 members. One does not know what assets may be brought into the scheme or what degree of transfer has already taken place. One does not know the proportion of existing pensioners to employees and deferred pensioners, and therefore what the liabilities will be. For the Pension Protection Fund, apart from the assets coming in and the levy, there is therefore a fallback power to be able to borrow money if necessary, as a smoothing activity, to deal with quite substantial contingencies. A major company going under could produce a very swift and substantial contingency.
</p>

<a name="40706-54_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>That is not the case with the administrative levy, which is essentially predictable and continues from year to year. We think that it is adequately funded and so we do not see the need for the amendment. I am intrigued that the noble Lord would like the regulator <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC158"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column GC158</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to have this power, but we do not think that it is necessary and, if your Lordships agree, we are not minded to give it to him.
</p>




<p><a name="st_230"></a>
<a name="40706-54_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I shall seek to persuade your Lordships otherwise on this occasion. It is not the case that this is a proposal for the regulator to ask for more money. If it has the power to borrow, it will have a little flexibility and, instead of over-estimating how much it needs to levy to make sure that it does not have to borrow, it will be able to steer a more moderate course between being in surplus and being in deficit. If it is not allowed to borrow, it must make absolutely sure that the levy is enough, and to be safe, more than enough, than would otherwise be the case. So it will levy more than it needs. It can levy less if it can borrow. I leave the Minister with that thought.
</p>




<p><a name="st_231"></a>
<a name="40706-54_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   That is very interesting. I had not thought of that before. Surely the point is that we are dealing with a budget of &#163;23 million, which is an increase of &#163;6 million or so on OPRA&#039;s budget. The costs are essentially those of administrative, recurrent revenue expenditure. They are not lumpy, but predictable and therefore, we do not see the need for this power in the same way that we did not see it as necessary for OPRA. If the regulator finds after one year that the flat-rate levy is inappropriate, he can come back to the members and, if necessary, seek to raise the levy for the following year. We think that that is better than having borrowing powers.

<a name="40706-54_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   I do not think I heard the Minister answer the question of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, about the basis on which the regular budget is raised. I have been leafing through the Bill and I cannot spot it. Can the Minister help us with the section number so that we can see it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_233"></a>
<a name="40706-54_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The levy provisions are in Section 175 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993. They are wide enough to allow a carry-over or carry-under from year to year. My point about predictability has been confirmed as OPRA has not changed its levy. It has remained fixed at the same rate for the past three years. Apart from the theoretical point made by the noble Lord, I do not see any need for this power.
</p>




<p><a name="st_234"></a>
<a name="40706-54_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   Given that we all accept that the Pensions Regulator is quite a change from OPRA, would it not be a good idea to have the basis of the levy stated in the Bill rather than referring to old Acts?

</p>




<p><a name="st_235"></a>
<a name="40706-54_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I am puzzled by this. We are talking about the administrative levy for the Pensions Regulator. We are not talking about the infinitely more complicated issue for the Pension Protection Fund. The levy is a flat-rate levy for all members of appropriate schemes, as it was for OPRA. That was raised by OPRA and will be raised by the regulator in accordance with deemed expenditure. OPRA has got it right over the past three years and kept the same levy, so in real terms it is fractionally reduced. There are powers to carry over or carry under <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40706-55_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   It may be, but it is not in the Bill. The fact that there are levy provisions in earlier legislation to finance OPRA, which is going to disappear and be replaced, does not on the face of it give the new regulator power to raise the levy unless it somehow appears like the smile on the face of the Cheshire cat after he has disappeared. Surely there must be provision in this Bill for raising a levy to finance the regulator. The fact that there was earlier legislation enabling OPRA to be financed cannot be right.
</p>




<p><a name="st_240"></a>
<a name="40706-55_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   As noble Lords will know, many of the regulator&#039;s powers have been taken over directly from OPRA, and the Bill makes that clear. I share the noble Lord&#039;s view about schedules and clauses. Paragraph 26 of Schedule 1, on page 240, in volume II, spells out exactly what is happening, does it not? It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;Section 175 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 (c. 48) (levies towards certain expenditure) is amended as follows&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-55_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>It then goes on to say how it is amended. So I should have thought that noble Lords&#039; concerns are covered by the cross-reference in the schedule.

<p><a name="st_241"></a>
<a name="40706-55_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   I read that provision when I was leafing through the Bill, but it was certainly not very clear to me. If we believe that it is right that this should be done on a straightforward flat-rate levy, why not say so in the Bill?

<p><a name="st_244"></a>
<a name="40706-55_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   As we discussed earlier, when an employer is, for example, facing a surplus, part of OPRA&#039;s job is to interrogate members of the scheme on whether the surplus should be returned to the employer. In this case it was a &#163;50-million scheme, and I am very happy to give any of your Lordships the details of the company to which I am referring. That cost OPRA &#163;75,000. Would it be right to have that as the levy or to have it as a recharge of fees? It seems to me that we can discuss that type of issue later when we look at the detail of the Pension Protection Fund and other matters.

<a name="40706-55_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>As for earlier legislation, no Bill starts anew unless it is a consolidation Act. As a Pensions Bill, this Bill is amending relevant previous legislation that continues. Therefore, as we discussed, quite a few OPRA functions go over into the new regulatory body to which are added new functions, which may or may not be welcomed by the regulator, and new powers.
</p>

<a name="40706-55_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>In this legislation we are saying that previous provisions have been amended by other legislation. That is normal drafting. One does not go back and restate the whole provision. I suppose that we could do that and have a Bill of four volumes rather than two. What we are doing is absolutely conventional practice. In the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act, for example, we were amending the Child Support Act with new child support proposals. We did not spell it all out in a consolidating Bill and then put it all in the relevant Bill. We cross-referred continuously back to the previous legislation. I do not think that there is anything unusual about that. The time to clarify that is, I think, when one makes a consolidation Bill.

<a name="40706-55_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   We are trying to keep things simple here. Can the noble Baroness tell those of us who do not have her extensive knowledge of previous Acts whether the Act that is being amended states the basis on which the levy shall be raised and whether it should be flat-rate? I have read in the Bill&#151;I have just gone through it&#151;that the regulator will have power to make a specific charge for a specific fund, which was the example that the noble Baroness raised, but what does the &quot;old Act&quot; say about how OPRA, now the regulator, shall fix its normal annual running charge? In terms of this amendment, that is the relevant factor in whether it is likely to need to borrow money.

<p><a name="st_246"></a>

I think that the noble Lord the Deputy Chairman of Committees is inclined to agree with that view. When a member or the chairman of trustees of a pension scheme comes along and says, &quot;Why am I paying this levy?&quot;, would it not be a good deal easier to answer &quot;Look at the clause in this Bill&quot; and not go on to say &quot;but you must dig out the other Bill&quot;&#151;which is probably out of print and only annotated in the Libraries of the House of Lords and the House of <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40706-55_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>Existing members already pay a flat rate levy and there is no proposal to change that. They would not expect there to be any changes to the system, and that is what we are proposing here. It is possible that at some stage in the future Parliament may, through regulations or whatever, decide to amend it because it wishes to see certain expenses incurred by the regulator referred back to the organisation that generated the costs&#151;for example, in the paying back of surpluses. I can conceive that in that situation regulations may come before your Lordships&#039; House for approval.
</p>

<a name="40706-55_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>At the moment, it seems to me that the Bill is absolutely conventional in its handling of pensions and other social security legislation. We are not doing anything new. If we were, there might be a case for the amendment. However, we are continuing existing practice and we are not dealing with a consolidation Bill. If we were to take the approach suggested by the noble Lord, almost every clause would require a fuller explanation because we could not rely on the heritage of existing Bills as we do in all other areas of government legislation.

<p><a name="st_253"></a>

The regulator can fine tune from year to year the levy he needs to raise. I think we all agree that it is very different with the Pension Protection Fund, where we are dealing with a much more volatile and unpredictable situation without such capacities.

<a name="40706-56_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   We have had an interesting set of exchanges. The only matter I am unclear about is if the levy is to be the same as the levy raised for OPRA, and as the regulator will clearly be more expensive than OPRA, how will it be financed in full?
</p>




<p><a name="st_257"></a>
<a name="40706-56_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The point that I was making was not that the OPRA levy will stay the same; merely that given OPRA&#039;s current responsibilities the level of funding necessary to deliver those responsibilities has been predictable in such a way that the levy has remained unchanged for the past three years. I said earlier that I thought that there would be another 40 or so added to the 240 to 260 members of staff that are currently part of OPRA. Obviously, more staff would require an additional levy. That is reflected in the fact that it is going up from &#163;17 million to &#163;23 million. In so far as that is borne by schemes, there will be a modest increase in the levy paid by members to do that. I am surprised that noble Lords are surprised by that.

<p><a name="st_267"></a>The noble Lord said: I must admit to a rather personal prejudice. The prejudice is not that were I a detective story writer I would be preparing to write a book about the metaphor that got away after the last amendment; the prejudice is that I hate the word &quot;targets&quot;, especially when I do not know what they mean. Ever since this Government came into power, my hackles have risen at the very mention of the word. The noble Baroness earlier admitted to having been a member of a health authority. That was under a Conservative government. That is a political point that she can forget about.

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column GC164</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

contains 97,147 other references to targets shows that this Government have gone target mad. Why this obsession with targets? I am not asking the noble Baroness, but I am making a general point. It is not quite a rhetorical question, that would be under-kill. I do not particularly want to have a philosophical discussion about targets but I note that the <i>Little Oxford Dictionary</i> describes them as &quot;anything aimed at&quot;. I would have thought that that is fair enough. But if one looks up the word &quot;objective&quot;, definition 2 states that it is a noun meaning:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;object or person aimed at&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40706-56_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>Does that not say it all? Objectives and targets, certainly in the way they are mentioned here, are one and the same thing. Years ago, I was taught that that amounts to tautology, which, in my children&#039;s language, is a &quot;no-no&quot;. Why do we need both words in the Bill? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_270"></a>
<a name="40706-56_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Being very crude about this, objectives are strategic goals or aims, maybe to eradicate child poverty or something like that. Targets are when one turns the qualitative into the quantitative so that progress can be measured down the road. They may break down into low level targets about how many phone calls are answered within nine rings or how quickly letters are returned or, in the example about child poverty, they could be that one wishes to do half by such and such a date or a quarter by such and such date so that the target is measurable. For example, one could have a target for the regulator to reduce the number of schemes in the high-risk category by 10 per cent, which is to fulfil the objective of protecting members.
</p>

<a name="40706-56_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>My experience in government is that the target is something one can quantify and therefore measure on one&#039;s way to fulfilling the objective. It is the difference between the blue-sky high level and the accountable and measurable way of delivering it. One might say that the objective is to protect members and the target might be to reduce the number of schemes in the high risk category by 10 per cent, or it might include a much lower level target, for example to ensure that all scheme returns are produced within 30 working days. One could have a range of different targets at different levels of blue skyness in order to meet the bigger objective.
</p>

<a name="40706-56_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>It seems to me to be perfectly proper to have the objective on the face of the Bill. It seems to be perfectly proper to allow the organisation to work out how best to meet those objectives by specifying its targets, which would then be widely available and known. I do not know any organisation that does not work in that way.
</p>




<p><a name="st_271"></a>
<a name="40706-56_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   I am struggling to remember who the management consultant was who said that an objective is what one tells the world one&#039;s organisation aims to do and a target is what one tells one&#039;s boss one will struggle to achieve in the perfect knowledge that one can do so very easily.
</p>




<p><a name="st_272"></a>
<a name="40706-56_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   This is a digression but we are coming to the end of the day. The point is that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC165"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column GC165</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the trouble with targets is that staff tend to perform to the targets because pay is very often related to them. By definition, targets have to be quantifiable. One ends up putting more value on quantifiable things than qualitative things. There is a problem about turning qualitative objectives into measurable ones for staff at quite modest junior levels whose pay is related to them. This happens in every field whether in universities, research publications, health authorities or in this body. But I am in no doubt that there is a distinction. It is sensible to preserve that distinction, which the Bill currently does.
</p>




<p><a name="st_273"></a>
<a name="40706-56_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   This is a very academic argument. I am not sure that after four hours on the Bill I can quite take it in. But who will set the targets? Will they be set by the regulator so that it aims at its own benchmark or will it be set by the Secretary of State and the department? Does this apply to both the objectives and the targets?
</p>




<p><a name="st_274"></a>
<a name="40706-56_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   If I am wrong on this I shall write to the noble Lord, but my understanding is that we will expect the regulator and his regulatory body to come up with proposed targets and to see that they satisfy the Secretary of State. This happens with the Child Support Agency, for example. The chief executive of the agency produces a proposed list of targets on matters such as accuracy, speed in answering letters and telephone calls, the number of complaints that go to the independent case examiner and so on. Those come through to me so that I can make a recommendation to the Secretary of State on whether those targets are sufficiently demanding or whether they perhaps need to be revised upwards. On that basis, the targets are publicly available. When the agency&#039;s annual report is done, its performance is measured by the agreed targets.
</p>

<a name="40706-56_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>I have no reason to think that the procedure will be any different here. If it is, I will write to the noble Lord.

very brief points on the clause, which is about the functions exercisable by the non-executive committee. First, the committee has to scrutinise the performance of the chief executive, but, as we have pointed out before, no one seems to be scrutinising the performance of the chairman.
</p>

<a name="40706-57_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>Secondly, there is a kind of throwaway line about Northern Ireland here. After the interesting exchanges we had on the Civil Partnership Bill last week as far as Northern Ireland is concerned, I am not clear why that is not spelt out in rather more detail.

<a name="40706-57_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>Thirdly, it is said that the committee will contribute to and keep under review the strategic direction. I am not the least bit clear why the whole organisation, the non-executive committee and the rest of the board, are not simply all working together to look at the strategy. To have it divided so that the rest of the board decides the strategy, but the non-executive committee contributes to it and then monitors it, seems an excessively complicated system and not one likely to produce a united front on the overall position.

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="40706-57_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following Statement.

</p>

<a name="40706-57_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>I am announcing today a new commitment of &#163;36 million over four years (2004&#150;07) for UNAIDS (the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS). This will support the UNAIDS secretariat, its country co-ordinators, and the 10 co-sponsor agencies that together make up the Joint Programme1. The new commitment represents a tripling of our core funding to UNAIDS compared with the past four years. DfID is finalising a new UK strategic partnership with UNAIDS to accompany the multi-year financing arrangement, linked to UNAIDS&#039; own work programme. DfID is also increasing its direct funding to several co-sponsor agencies including the UN Population Fund (UNFPA).
</p>

<a name="40706-57_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>UK funding will enable UNAIDS to expand its work to ensure developing countries affected by HIV and AIDS can access appropriate and co-ordinated support from donors. UNAIDS will be working with governments to take forward the &quot;Three Ones&quot; initiative, which stresses the responsibility donors have to work through one national HIV and AIDS action plan, through one co-ordinating authority and to work to one monitoring and evaluation framework in each country.
</p>

<a name="40706-57_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>UK funding will also support UNAIDS&#039; advocacy work. This includes helping to ensure new or neglected issues are taken up, and building partnerships across government, the private sector and civil society. UNAIDS will be working with the World Health Organisation and others to ensure that treatment programmes address equity and access issues and that a proper balance is maintained between prevention and treatment. UK funding will also support UNAIDS&#039; technical work, including helping countries to access new funding and ensuring it is used properly. UNAIDS has a strong track record in this area.

</p>

<a name="40706-57_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>I am today publishing a DfID position paper on sexual and reproductive health and rights. It describes progress to date and sets out what remains to be done. It will form the basis for planning future investment and activities. The paper complements the UK&#039;s Call for Action on HIV/AIDS and DfID&#039;s target strategy papers on <i>Better Health for Poor People</i> and <i>Realising Human Rights for Poor People</i>.
</p>

<a name="40706-57_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>The paper recognises sexual and reproductive health and rights as central to human development and to achieving the millennium development goals. The UK is firmly committed to the programme of action of the   International Conference on Population and Development of 1994 and its targets of reproductive health for all by 2015. The paper states.; our continued commitment to work with country governments and partners to achieve improved maternal and newborn health, accessible, high quality family planning choices, elimination of unsafe abortion, reduced incidence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, greater awareness of sexual health and reduced risky behaviour.
</p>

<a name="40706-57_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>The paper recognises the progress that has been made since 1994, but also highlights new challenges, including the increased burden of HIV and AIDS. DfID will use opportunities to integrate HIV and sexual and reproductive health services in ways that respond better to people&#039;s needs, especially those of women and young people.
</p>

<a name="40706-57_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>I am placing a copy of the paper in the Library of the House. It is also available on DfID&#039;s website at www.dfid.gov.uk.
</p>

<a name="40706-57_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>Today I am announcing increased funding for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The UK will be providing &#163;80 million over four years (2004&#150;07) in core funding to UNFPA to support its work on sexual and reproductive health and rights, population and development, and gender. UNFPA&#039;s work is also   a critical part of HIV/AIDS prevention efforts within   the framework of the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).

</p>

<a name="40706-57_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>Accordingly, prior to the hand over of power on 28   June and the Coalition Provisional Authority ceasing to exist, Her Majesty&#039;s Government considered it appropriate to grant licences for the export of the military listed goods on these two applications for use by private security companies, one working under contract to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the other working under contract to the Coalition Provisional Authority, the US Department of State and the project management office in Iraq. The licences are consistent with the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria. Future applications will continue to be assessed on a case by case basis against the UN embargo and   consolidated criteria, taking into account the circumstances prevailing at the time.

<a name="40706-58_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>The White Paper therefore presents a series of challenges to the European Union. In order to thrive in a globalising world, the EU has to redouble its efforts to improve its own competitiveness. At the same time, it needs to look outwards, placing new policies and regulations in a global context. The EU, together with other developed countries, has to reject the mercantilist approach to trade which prizes only exports and inward investment as opposed to international trade and investment as a whole.

<a name="40706-58_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>Specifically, it must tackle the continued harmful effects of the common agricultural policy. The EU and other developed countries should commit to eliminate export subsidies, to make further reductions in trade-distorting domestic support and to reduce agricultural tariff peaks towards the maximum levels allowed for non-agricultural products.
</p>

<a name="40706-58_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>The White Paper describes the changing nature of international trade and investment. International trade is moving away from traditional patterns of imports and exports towards a world of global partnerships and joint ventures. Government services to UK companies have to respond to this. I announced in this House on 1 July the new arrangements which we are setting in place for the Export Credits Guarantee Department. The White Paper also sets out the role of UK Trade and Investment&#151;the Government&#039;s lead national provider of international trade and investment support for business.
</p>

<a name="40706-58_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>The White Paper sets out how we think international trade and investment can and should work to reduce poverty in the poorest countries. The   need to reduce poverty&#151;working towards the millennium development goals&#151;is a key challenge for this Government.
</p>

<a name="40706-58_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>To fight poverty, the EU and other developed countries must tackle the barriers&#151;both tariffs and non-tariff barriers such as excessively burdensome technical regulations&#151;which currently prevent poor countries selling to us.
</p>

<a name="40706-58_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>The evidence shows that the developing countries that have been more successful in fighting poverty tend to be those that have opened their own markets to international trade. But we have learnt that developing countries need to open their markets in a properly sequenced way as part of a broader plan for their economic development and poverty reduction.
</p>

<a name="40706-58_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>In order to benefit from international trade and investment, the poorest countries need to put in place a full range of complementary policies. We need to work with these countries to help them to tackle the key challenges: health, education, the transport and communications infrastructure, good governance and effective social protection.
</p>

<a name="40706-58_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>This White Paper has been produced following widespread consultation with interested parties in the UK. We are grateful to everyone who has helped us and we look forward to continuing a dialogue on these issues.
</p>

<a name="40706-58_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>In the mean time I look forward to working with ministerial colleagues in other countries&#151;both inside and outside the EU&#151;to win the argument against protectionism and mercantilism in international trade. We will take the opportunity of the UK presidencies of the EU and of the G8 next year to take this forward.
</p>

<a name="40706-58_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>I am confident that this White Paper will contribute to pursuing the UK&#039;s objectives in the area of international trade and investment.

[HL3319]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="40706w01_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  All government departments endeavour to answer Questions for Written Answer within the 14 day deadline. I regret, however, that it has taken so long to answer these Questions.
</p>

<a name="40706w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>The majority of the overdue Ministry of Defence questions relate to operations in Iraq and in many instances this has meant contacting personnel there to obtain details to be able to answer them. Clearly personnel on operations are subject to operational pressure which can result in delays in obtaining the information required.
</p>

<a name="40706w01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a>A number of the Northern Ireland Office questions have required co-ordination between several parts of the Northern Ireland Office and the 11 departments of the Northern Ireland Administration which has occasionally resulted in the deadline not being met.
</p>

<a name="40706w01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a>I can assure the noble Lord that officials in both departments are working hard to provide the necessary information and ensure that the outstanding Questions are answered as soon as possible.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_2"></a>What assessment they have made of the relationship between the millennium development target to eliminate gender disparity in education and similar targets for halving the proportion of people without safe water or basic sanitation.  [HL3491]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_3"></a>
<a name="40706w01_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   DfID&#039;s assessment of this relationship is twofold. First, access to basic facilities such as school toilets, safe drinking water, clean surroundings and information on hygiene all improve the quality of the school environment and influence <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WA72"></a>

<b>6 Jul 2004 : Column WA72</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

better learning. This is important in terms of the overall goal of achieving universal education and eliminating gender disparity in education. Basic sanitation for girls in particular can lead to a lower dropout rate for girls, especially at puberty. For example, in Bangladesh, a school sanitation and hygiene education programme reported to increase girls&#039; attendance rates by 11 per cent.
</p>

<a name="40706w01_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a>Secondly, the opportunity costs of parents sending girls to school are substantially reduced when households have ready access to safe drinking water and girls are no longer required to collect water from distant water pumps.
</p>

<a name="40706w01_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a>As part of its support for the peace process in Sudan, DfID has provided approximately &#163;2 million to assist UNICEF&#039;s education programmes in the conflict-affected areas of the country, providing books and materials to over 2,000 primary schools and supporting the construction of water and sanitation facilities where these were priorities.

This usually means collecting evidence (as opposed to intelligence which is handled on a police-to-police basis) for use in criminal proceedings or investigations.

The paper makes clear that the timing of the   third anthrax vaccine dose was varied, and that the main immunisation programme was suspended before the point at which a fourth dose would have been due. There is no formal record of consultation between the Ministry of Defence and the manufacturer and supplier, the then Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research (CAMR), Porton Down about these variations. There is no association between failing to complete a course of immunisation and adverse health effects, other than possible failure to achieve full protection.

<p><a name="wa_qn_15"></a>
<a name="40706w02_wqn8"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer  </b> asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_16"></a>What role the Department of Trade and Industry plays in the regulation of the use of depleted uranium.  [HL3451]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_16"></a>
<a name="40706w02_spnew6"></a><b> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Sainsbury of Turville):  </b>  The DTI UK Safeguards Office is concerned with the application of international safeguards on civil nuclear material in the UK, including depleted uranium. This involves working with the UK nuclear industry (and others with safeguards reporting requirements) and safeguards inspectors from the European Commission (currently part of the Directorate for Transport and Energy (DG-TREN) and based in Luxembourg) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS) the security regulator, promotes a robust security regime for civil nuclear material. We cannot comment on the security measures taken, which could be of potential use to terrorists.
</p>

<a name="40706w02_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_16"></a>Imports of depleted uranium into the United Kingdom do not require the specific approval of the department. All imports of armour-piercing ammunition, whether or not containing depleted uranium, require an individual import licence granted by the department under the Import of Goods (Control) Order 1954. No other product containing depleted uranium requires such an individual import licence.
</p>

<a name="40706w02_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_17"></a>Although strategic export controls do not regulate the actual use of depleted uranium, any exports of depleted uranium from the Community are controlled under Council Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000. The DTI is responsible for the licensing of goods controlled by the regulation.

<p><a name="wa_qn_16"></a>
<a name="40706w03_wqn0"></a><b> Lord Beaumont of Whitley  </b> asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_17"></a>What are the next stages towards implementation of the European Union Directive on Batteries (2003/0282 CD); when these are likely to take place; and what steps they are planning to take to implement domestic battery recycling to meet the targets laid down.  [HL3503]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_17"></a>
<a name="40706w03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville:  </b>  The Government have issued a consultation document seeking views from stakeholders on the Batteries Directive proposal by 5   August 2004. These views will be taken into account as negotiations on the proposal continue within the European Council over the coming months. Collection and recycling targets have yet to be agreed, and it is unlikely that negotiations will be completed until 2005.
</p>

<a name="40706w03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_18"></a>The Government have been actively involved in a pilot battery collection scheme in Bristol involving key stakeholders and are in discussions about establishing other schemes elsewhere. Domestic battery recycling facilities are also likely to be established in the UK.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_18"></a>Whether permission has been given to the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses and to the Trinity House Lighthouse Service to obtain new vessels; and, if so, what is the estimated in-service date for those vessels.  [HL3534]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_18"></a>
<a name="40706w03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham:  </b>  Ministers have approved proposals to replace three of the general lighthouse authorities&#039; current vessels with two new multi-function tenders (MFTs) and a smaller rapid response vessel. The new MFT&#039;s will replace the Trinity House vessel &quot;Mermaid&quot; and the Northern Lighthouse Board vessel &quot;Pharos&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40706w03_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_19"></a>Invitations to tender to construct the vessels were issued in June. Approval to procure the vessels will be dependent on the cost of the bids received. If agreed, the contract to build is expected to be awarded in October 2004. The vessels are expected to come into service between 2005 and 2007.
