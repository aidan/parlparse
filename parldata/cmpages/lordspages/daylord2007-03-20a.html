<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="07032035000227"></a>&#147;Dear Lord President,</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="07032035000228"></a>I would be grateful if you could inform the House that I have asked the Prime Minister to inform Her Majesty The Queen of my intention to retire from the office of Clerk of the Parliaments with effect from Saturday 3rd November 2007, the eve of my 65th birthday. The Prime Minister has confirmed that Her Majesty has been informed.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="07032035000229"></a>By November I shall have served the House of Lords for more than 43 years, including nearly 4Â1/2 years as Clerk of the Parliaments. During my career the House has been transformed, and I am glad to have been able to help that transformation. The small hereditary House which existed in 1964 has become a successful and energetic second Chamber, and it is supported by staff who have similarly grown in number and professionalism. We are proud to contribute to the effectiveness of Parliament and I hope that, in any further reforms, the undoubted strengths of the House of Lords will be reinforced.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="07032035000230"></a>The mutual respect and friendship of Members and staff have made the House of Lords a very happy place in which to work, and I count myself lucky to have enjoyed such a privilege. Please convey to all Members of the House my thanks for their friendship and support over the years&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="07032035000022"></a>Following receipt of Mr Hayter's letter, I have consulted the party leaders in the House, the Convenor of the Cross-Bench Peers and the Lord Speaker, andit has been agreed by us all that a successor toMr Hayter should be appointed following a trawl among the staff of this House and the staff of the House of Commons, the Scottish Parliament, the Parliamentary Service for the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly. This decision follows closely the practice adopted last time for appointment to this very senior post. The timetable for the trawl should mean that the recommendation of a successor to Mr Hayter can be made to Her Majesty during May.</p>

Does he agree that it would be naive to think that the public service and private enterprise have not come closer together? There is nothing wrong intrinsically in that, but public perceptions are such that they require safeguards to be put in place, as they have been; the code suggests two years, as he says. Is he happy that two years is enough? I am not suggesting that there is a problem, but it could arise and the Government could well be criticised if it were later found that two years was too short a time.</p>

When criticism has been advanced, it has been over that factor. Most often, that criticism has been readily refuted. I do not think that there have been any cases where civil servants close to the end of the two-year period have sought an appointment and then received criticism for doing so.</p>

As the noble Baroness would rightly recognise, the arrangements that apply for former Cabinet Secretaries are not going to apply to a clerk in the Department for Transport, for example. However, the concept is the same. It must be clear that, as my noble friend Lord Barnett indicated, because of the obvious advantage that might accrue to a private enterprise as the result of the experience of an individual in the public service, safeguards are there under the code to which all civil servants subscribe and which is part of their conditions of service.</p>

Have the Government received, and will they reply to, the report on ethical regulation from the House of Commons Select Committee on Public Administration? Secondly, will the Government give consideration to the possibility that it might assist members of the Civil Service to find highly appropriate work in the private sector if they were directly to employ across the board the services of executive recruitment companies?</p>

Of course, I acknowledge that the Select Committee on Public Administration in the other place is doing very important work on these issues. The Government will respond to its recommendations in due course. That serious work has been going on for a considerable period of time. That committee is there to be concerned about the whole range of ethical standards in public life and probity. Its recommendations will require significant consideration by the Government.</p>

Their case is slightly different, in that they are finally vetted not by Ministers, but by the head of the Home Civil Service, for obvious reasons. However, political advisers are civil servants of a special kind, and they fit within the broad parameters of the arrangements that I have described.</p>

The Government ought not, therefore, to be terribly frightened; the proposal did not come from them in the first instance, which is unusual. Do they not now agree that the decision to privatise the entire railway system was a major mistake and that such a measure is unknown in almost every other European passenger railway system of any size, yet we continue with it and everyone hears the complaints? Is it not high time that we had a serious examination? A long time has passed; there is a lot of experience.

Obviously, I will need to re-plan my holiday schedule. First-class and economy fares are matters for the operating company. The department regulates some fares, particularly for season tickets and savers, which account for approximately 75 per cent of all rail travel. I am sure that market forces must have a bearing on all other fares.</p>

The &#147;living stadium&#148; concept, with a mixed-sport offering, combined with commercial, school and community use, is the most compelling option to delivering the legacy ambition. The Olympic Board has now commissioned further detailed work on the concept.</p>

It is very much in line with the thinking of the authority. The capacity of the stadium will be reduced, from the 80,000 that is necessary for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games and for the Olympic Games themselves, to 25,000 for athletics and other sports, so that it can be more readily used by the community, schools and others who wish to participate in sport. The stadium is only one of five sports facilities that will be permanently in place as a legacy from the Games.</p>

Part of our ambition is that the Games will involve the whole of the United Kingdom and not just London, although London is the site of the Games and the winning-bid city.

The United Kingdom is pushing for tougher measures in the Security Council against Sudan, including a countrywide arms embargo and sanctions against individuals responsible for atrocities in Darfur.

I wonder what specific sanctions the Minister had in mind from the list that he has just given to the House. Do the Government now favour disinvestment, the freezing of assets, travel bans, the extension of an arms embargo and a no-fly zone over Darfur? Four years after the killing began in Darfur, with 400,000 dead, some 2 million people displaced and 90 per cent of the villages razed to the ground, surely now is the time for decisive international action to end this tidal wave of killing.</p>

There is no agreement on the hybrid force. There is no agreement on the second phase&#151;the heavy UN support force&#151;which I regard as an even more urgent problem. The intention is to secure an arms embargo across the whole of Sudan so that not just the Government of Sudan but the rebel groups are deprived of their weapons as fast as they can be. The United States, ourselves and other allies are now discussing lists of those&#151;I am afraid that I cannot share the names today&#151;to be subject to a wide variety of sanctions.

For the reasons that I gave in my Answer, there is the prospect of another Security Council resolution, and I am hopeful that we will get wide international support for it. Although China has not always performed in a way that we would wish, I draw to the attention of the House the fact that, when President Hu visited Sudan, he made it clear that China, too, is coming to the end of its patience.</p>

The humanitarian efforts of NGOs have probably never been under such acute pressure as they are now. This is an issue that we have been raising persistently, along with those organisations. One of the other setbacks of recent days has been the unwillingness of the Government of Sudan to take any of the steps that they had agreed to take to get more humanitarian access and food relief to Darfur and, incidentally, to Chad, where many of the refugees have gone. This issue is in front of the United Nations. We are clear that the situation has to be reversed, and the United Nations has the basis in current resolutions to do that without further discussion.</p>

<a name="70320-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="07032035000094"></a>In this Bill we return to the implementation of Section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, as I said we would when we debated the Fraud Bill. Section 43 created the possibility of trials without juries, in the interests of justice, in a limited category of serious and complex fraud cases. The proposals are about justice. Lord Justice Auld said in his independent review of the criminal courts on this issue:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="07032035000231"></a>&#147;If I had to pick two of the most compelling factors in favour of reform, I would settle on the burdensome length and increasing speciality and complexity of these cases, with which jurors largely or wholly strangers to the subject matter, are expected to cope. Both put justice at risk&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70320-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="07032035000095"></a>Section 43 would allow a handful of the most serious and complex fraud cases to be tried by a judge sitting without a jury. Before the debate becomes monopolised by a discussion about jury trial, as generally seems to happen with debates on this subject, I want to spend a little time on the ends rather than the means: the problem that we are seeking to solve rather than the device by which we are hoping to solve it.</p>

<a name="70320-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="07032035000096"></a>Fraud inflicts significant and increasing damage on the United Kingdom economy. It is a crime that the Government take extremely seriously. Our strategy for tackling this problem has several elements. One is law reform. The Fraud Act 2006, which came into force this January, creates a new general offence of fraud and new offences relating to deception. Another element is the cross-departmental review of fraud that has examined the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution and punishment of fraud. Its report was published in July 2006 and was put out for consultation, and last week I issued the Government&#146;s response to that consultation. New procedures have been introduced to improve the management of large criminal cases, notably the protocol issued in March 2005 by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, the then Lord Chief Justice, on the control and management of heavy fraud and other complex criminal cases. The other key element of the Government&#146;s strategy is aimed at the very small group of cases that involve frauds that are so serious and complex that the criminal justice system finds it difficult to prosecute them effectually.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="07032035000097"></a>The present situation is far from satisfactory, for a number of reasons. The complexity and resulting length of some serious and complex fraud trials lead judges to sever indictments in order to make them manageable for and comprehensible to a jury. Despite this, it is often necessary to restrict the material presented to the jury. Evidence is pared down and the charges are  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1147"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reduced to the main charges only. The result of that may be that the full scale of the allegations against the defendant or, more often, defendants cannot be exposed.</p>

<a name="70320-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="07032035000098"></a>I have attended meetings with the Serious Fraud Office and prosecution counsel where they have stated that the most logical way of prosecuting a case is to try defendants together but that this simply would not be possible under the current system of jury trial. Secondary defendants, who ought properly to be prosecuted, are not proceeded against for fear of complicating the trial further. Occasionally, trials collapse with the highly unsatisfactory outcome that the taxpayer has incurred substantial cost and no one has been brought to justice.</p>

<a name="70320-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="07032035000099"></a>Let me make this clear: we do not found our case for this measure upon the proposition that juries are incapable of understanding the evidence in fraud trials, although there are mixed views about that. Our argument is that the measures that need to be taken to enable the jury to cope with the evidence are a problem in themselves. As a very senior judge put it:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="07032035000232"></a>&#147;I believe that it will normally be possible for a competent judge, with the co-operation of competent and conscientious counsel for both prosecution and defence, by a process of severing counts and ring-fencing evidence, to reduce the case to a dimension that the jury can comprehend ... But this process only renders the trial manageable by removing from the jury a large (sometimes even the major) part of the evidence that is relevant to the central issue&#151;the honesty of the defendant. Often the evidence that is ring-fenced from the jury is cogent. I believe that a trial process that requires one to remove from the tribunal a large part of the relevant evidence, because it would otherwise overwhelm the tribunal, is seriously flawed and, so far as I am concerned, this is the primary reason why I consider that complex fraud cases should not be tried by juries&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032035000217"></a>The judge who said that is now the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. I need to explain that those comments were not made absolutely in the context of the present debate about this Bill but in a public lecture made some years ago on the basis of his experience of trying such cases.</p>

<a name="70320-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07032035000100"></a>Despite attempts such as the 2005 protocol of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, to keep trials within reasonable bounds, which the Government welcomed, complex fraud trials often last for months. In the four years from 2002 to 2005, 27 fraud trials lasted more than six months and six of them lasted for over a year. The burden that this places on jury members is excessive; few, surely, would disagree that it is unreasonable to expect citizens to tolerate such an intrusion into their personal lives. As only a limited number of people are able to give up other commitments to sit on a jury for so long, it also means that the juries that hear these cases cannot be properly representative of the community. How many Members of this House would be willing or able to give up many months or even a year or all their current commitments&#151;and in many court cases, I am glad to say, substantial incomes&#151;in order to sit on a fraud trial jury?</p>

<a name="70320-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07032035000101"></a>So we are left with enormously long trials that impose an intolerable burden on jurors and do not result in a jury which is representative of the community&#151;one of the arguments in favour of the jury system&#151;yet which fail to expose the full criminality of the alleged fraud. The public see an unhappy contrast between everyday frauds, such as benefit fraud, which  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1148"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are dealt with effectively, and those on an infinitely grander scale, where a combination of blizzards of paper and&#151;dare I say it?&#151;obfuscation mean that justice is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.</p>

<a name="70320-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07032035000102"></a>Changes to the system need to be made and, indeed, have been proposed for the past 20 years. The first call for change was in 1986, when the Roskill report, under the chairmanship of the most distinguished judge Lord Roskill recommended that, instead of being tried by a jury, such cases should be tried by a special fraud trials tribunal consisting of a judge and two lay members drawn from a panel of persons with general expertise in business and experience of complex transactions.</p>

<a name="70320-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07032035000103"></a>In 1998, the Government published a consultation paper, <I>Juries in Serious Fraud Trials.</I> The majority of respondents to it favoured replacing the jury in such trials, as did Sir Robin Auld&#151;now Lord Justice Auld&#151;from whose review of the criminal courts of England and Wales I quoted earlier. Although the Auld report, like Roskill, recommended using a panel of experts to hear such cases, it highlighted numerous difficulties, including uncertainty about the role of the expert members, the risk that they would contribute evidence that could not easily be challenged by the parties, the question of how readily suitable members could be found and the cost of paying them.</p>

<a name="70320-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07032035000104"></a>Taking account of the comments received following consultation on the Auld report, the Government decided that the option of a judge-alone trial was, on balance, the best solution, and that was adopted in what became Section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. That provides for the judge in a serious or complex fraud case to order, on application by the prosecution, that the trial should be conducted without a jury where he is satisfied that its lengthor complexity is likely to make it so burdensome on the jury that the interests of justice so require&#151;I underline those words, as I did in opening, because that is the test. Not only must the judge be satisfied that those onerous conditions are met, even if he is persuaded, an order can be made only with the approval of the Lord Chief Justice or another senior judge nominated by him. As a final safeguard, there is a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="07032035000107"></a>The key benefit of Section 43 provisions will be more efficient trials that enable the full criminality of cases to be exposed. A judge sitting alone will be able simply to read evidence that would have had to be presented orally to a jury. Arguments that would have

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70320-0003.htm"/>


<a name="70320-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="07032035000108"></a>I want to emphasise this because it has been a matter of concern to the House: Section 43 is not a general assault on the principle of trial by jury; nor is it about choosing between a fair trial and an unfair trial. It is about choosing between modes of fair trial. I fully acknowledge that there are great advantages to trial by jury, which is why it is appropriate for the vast majority of Crown Court cases; but there are circumstances&#151;very limited circumstances&#151;involving a very small number of cases where the advantages are outweighed by the disadvantages. For these cases, the 2003 Act provides for non-jury trial in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland. One category is where there is a real danger of jury intimidation. That was accepted by the House, and the provision was brought into force last year.</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07032035000109"></a>The other category is serious and complex fraud cases. Other sorts of case can give rise to very long trials&#151;terrorism, for example&#151;but serious fraud cases are distinct in that even an enormously long trial may not, for the reasons I have given, ensure that justice is done. That is why we are seeking to implement this measure. I should like to make it clear&#151;the question is bound to arise during the debate this afternoon&#151;that the Government have no plans to extend juryless trials to any other categories of case.</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07032035000110"></a>Section 43 will affect only a tiny number of exceptionally long and complex serious fraud trials. It will ultimately be for the Lord Chief Justice and other judges making decisions in individual cases to determine how many non-jury trials will take place. Our expectation is that, out of around 28,000 contested cases heard by a jury each year, the number of cases qualifying for juryless trial under Section 43 may be only half a dozen and will certainly not exceed 15 to 20 cases. That means that over 99.9 per cent of current jury trials will be unaffected by these measures. In the minute number of cases that Section 43 addresses, there exists an unacceptably high burden on the public, the public purse and the jurors.</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07032035000111"></a>Noble Lords will recall that, when Section 43 was passed, its implementation was made subject to a requirement for an affirmative resolution of both Houses. This unusual step constituted a guarantee from the Government to undertake further consultation. In accordance with that guarantee&#151;</p>

I am always greatly assisted by the Benches behind me&#151;in arithmetic and, I hope in other matters as well.</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07032035000114"></a>In accordance with the guarantee of further discussion, we made several attempts to seek a way forward in 2005-06. There was a seminar attended by members of the Opposition, including the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, members of the senior judiciary and representatives of prosecuting authorities and the professional organisations. Although no clear agreement emerged, there was unanimous agreement on the need to change the way serious and complex fraud cases are heard. We then sought an affirmative resolution, which was passed in the other place. It became apparent, however, that it would not be passed in this House. At that point we again sought consensus, by opening further discussions with the Opposition on the basis that the Fraud Bill, which was then before Parliament, could be used to make modifications to Section 43 that might be acceptable to all sides. Again, no agreement was forthcoming.</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07032035000115"></a>The Government have always signalled their intention to give effect to the provisions of Section 43. The inclusion of the requirement for an affirmative resolution was never intended to constitute a permanent obstacle to the introduction of juryless trials; if so, there would have been no point in enacting the provisions. The failure to reach consensus on a way forward left the Government in the unfortunate position of having to introduce fresh legislation to give effect to the provisions of Section 43. We remain resolute in our belief that Section 43 is necessary. We hope that the House, having considered our arguments, will conclude that it would be inappropriate not to allow this to occur.</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07032035000116"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has tabled an amendment that, if passed, would result in this Bill being rejected now. I need not remind noble Lords how unusual it is for that step to be taken on Second Reading in this House. It would not, however, be inappropriate to remind the House that when the order for commencing Section 43 was passed in another place, noble Lords opposite intended to block it in this House until the matter had been considered in primary legislation. The approval Motion in this House had to be withdrawn. The clear implication was that noble Lords opposite wished to engage in debate in the context of primary legislation. When negotiations that were carried out during the parliamentary process before the Bill came to nothing, I announced that we would not bring back another order but would introduce primary legislation. This Bill is the result: it gives further opportunity for the debate that noble Lords opposite made clear they wanted to engage in. At least, that is what we understood. It is surprising, then, that having tabled amendments in another place, the opposition parties do not wish to pursue them further.</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="07032035000117"></a>We said in our manifesto that we would overhaul laws on fraud and the way that fraud trials are conducted to update them for the 21st century and make them quicker and more effective. We have listened to the views of this House on more than one occasion. We have debated, consulted and twice taken back this issue for further discussion and to consider amendments. We have held many meetings with

The Government, having listened and made those attempts, are committed to this Bill. It will be no surprise to anybody, therefore, for me to make plain that this Bill, if rejected today, will be reintroduced next Session, with a view to using the Parliament Acts.</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="07032035000122"></a>I would not wish the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General to think that we in the Opposition in any way underrate the importance of the fight against fraud. We attach the utmost seriousness to this battle and we applaud many of the things that the Government have done in recent years to improve society&#146;s position in relation to the fraudster&#151;most particularly the recent Fraud Act, which redefines fraud in a way that I trust will be much more effective in achieving what the noble and learned Lord described as justice in the courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="07032035000123"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General finished his observations by addressing the Opposition&#146;s amendment. It is true that we seek to defeat this Bill at Second Reading. The commitment to change the rules about jury trial did not appear in the manifesto, so we are not bound by a constitutional convention not to so act. But that is not the main reason why we have chosen to take this course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="07032035000124"></a>As the noble and learned Lord said, underSection 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, before the substance of the change to jury trial can be implemented, an affirmative resolution must be passed in this House. That affirmative resolution could not be amended by your Lordships; it would either be yes or no. The noble and learned Lord took the view that, at the end of the day, your Lordships would say no; he therefore chose not to introduce a resolution under Section 43 but to introduce primary legislation. The reason why

For both those reasons, we have chosen to table today&#146;s amendment in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="07032035000130"></a>On the substance of the matter, as your Lordships are well aware, jury trial has been a central component in the conduct of all serious criminal trials for about the past 700 years. Its contribution to the preservation of the liberty of the individual, and to the legitimacy of Government, is quite incalculable. In particular, it is not the state but the community and individuals within it that determine who is responsible for depriving individuals of their liberty. This process has been endorsed by each generation for all of those centuries; so it will require some very cogent evidence and powerful arguments to convince us that the system needs changing. We submit that the Government have simply not produced them.</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="07032035000131"></a>There are a number of reasons for getting rid of jury trial, or modifying it, that might reasonably be argued. One is the question of the length of fraud trials, which are expensive and take a long time. Would  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1153"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1153</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the measure proposed by the Government make them any shorter? Well, the answer is no. When the noble and learned Lord and I attended a seminar in January 2005, arranged by his department, the now Lord Chief Justice&#151;then Master of the Rolls&#151;was a participant. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, will recall the noble and learned Lord, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, saying in terms, as Master of the Rolls, that switching from jury trial to trial by judge alone in long and complicated fraud trials would not shorten them.</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="07032035000132"></a>Indeed, if the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, were to read the Second Reading speech of the Solicitor-General on this Bill in another place, he would have seen that the Solicitor-General adduced, as an important component of the Government&#146;s thinking, the fact that they want the opportunity to present what the honourable gentleman described as &#147;the full criminality&#148; of the accused<I></I>to the court. He suggested that this would be much easier to do in front of a judge sitting alone than in front of a judge with a jury.</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="07032035000133"></a>I shall later question whether that is true. However, more immediately, my understanding of the problem that the Serious Fraud Office faces is not whether it can represent the full criminality but whether it can secure a conviction at all. That issue in no way calls into question the jury principle&#151;unless of course the Government are going to suggest that it is easier to secure a conviction in front of a single judge than itis in front of judge and a jury. Nothing in the Solicitor-General&#146;s proposal will shorten fraud trials. If anything, it will lengthen them because much more evidence will be put in front of a single judge than in front of a judge and jury, and no money whatever will be saved.</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="07032035000134"></a>The second suggestion is that juries are not capable of understanding the complexities of fraud trials. This has been firmly disproved by the outcome of the Jubilee Line case. Your Lordships will remember the debate in this House of the report by Mr Stephen Wooler, Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of the Crown Prosecution Service, after the breakdown of the Jubilee Line case. All the jurors were interviewed many months after the trial broke down. A special study was conducted by Professor Sally Lloyd-Bostock of the University of Birmingham. The conclusion drawn by Mr Wooler and Professor Lloyd-Bostock was that the jury had a very firm grasp of a large number of extremely complicated issues, even after seven or eight months and without referring to any documents whatever to refresh their memories. Indeed, the Solicitor-General went out of his way in another place to say that the Government were not contending that the jury was not capable of understanding complex cases. I am at a loss to know why the Government have continued to use the word &#147;complex&#148; in the standard laid down in Section 43 if what the Solicitor-General said in another place not so long ago continues to be government policy.</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="07032035000135"></a>If the trials are not going to be any shorter, and if a jury is perfectly capable of understanding all the complexities of the evidence presented, what argument is left to the Government? The Government have said that the real problem is that these trials are too burdensome  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1154"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the jury, and use a number of criteria to explain this, including the disruption of family life. However, many other sorts of trials are also long and complex. There are health and safety trials, narcotics trials, many trials relating to child abuse and terrorism trials. Many of these trials are equally lengthy and equally complicated, and often involve vast amounts of documentary evidence. What is the difference between a long and complicated fraud trial and a long and complicated trial of many other issues? I suggest that there is no difference whatever; so how long will it be before the Government come up with another Bill dealing with another section of criminal law in which it is alleged that a jury is simply incapable of understanding the matters, or that the matters are far too burdensome for a jury to get to grips with?</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07032035000136"></a>One of the things that most concern the Opposition is that we are being presented with the thin end of the wedge. If we allow the Bill to go to Committee and to make its way through the House, and if it ultimately gets on to the statute book, this will then set a precedent for removing juries from other cases; and that would be quite unacceptable. It was also suggested in another place that juries are in some way unrepresentative. It is true that on long trials quite often the composition of the jury is made up of perhaps a disproportionately large number of ladies and retired or temporarily unemployed people. But that is true for all long trials, not just for trials for fraud. Moreover, whatever the composition of a jury, it is likely to be far more representative than the judge alone.</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="07032035000137"></a>Perhaps I may draw your Lordships&#146; attention to what it would be like for a single judge to try a case like this. In any jury trial, the jury sees only admissible evidence. A great deal of evidence is brought before the judge by the prosecution asking for it to be admitted into the trial. The judge reads that evidence and considers whether it is admissible. If it is inadmissible thejury does not see it. I am thinking particularly of hearsay, confessions or propensity evidence. But if the judge is not only the judge of law but also the judge of fact, in a single-judge case, he will have to read all the evidence. He will see all the evidence which he, for one reason or another, goes on to declare inadmissible. I am not suggesting thatthe judge is not capable of divorcing inadmissible evidence from admissible evidence, but in some cases it may be very difficult. However, the perception of the public will be that he cannot.</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07032035000138"></a>In another passage in the debate in another place, the honourable gentleman the Solicitor-General suggested that one way to shorten a trial would be for the judge to read himself into the case so that it would not be necessary for what he read to appear before the court. That is a quite unacceptable proposition. A cardinal feature of trials in front of a jury is that the defence has an opportunity to cross-examine all the evidence put against his client. But if the honourable gentleman&#151;</p>

Is he aware of that experience and the general high regard in which judges in Northern Ireland are held, and that trials tried in Diplock courts are universally regarded as fair?</p>

It is usual to bring in a second judge to deal with that problem, but, as the noble and learned Lord knows full well, it is the duty of a judge throughout a trial to keep this matter under review. It is extremely difficult to have a second High Court judge on hand all the way through a fraud trial, which might last for many months or even years, to constantly check these issues.</p>

<a name="70320-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="07032035000143"></a>Moreover, as the noble and learned Lord is also well aware, we hope that very soon it will be possible to restore trial by jury in Northern Ireland. I do not think that an example taken from terrorist cases in a situation which is extremely special, if not unique, ought to be an argument against the propositions that I am putting forward about the difficulty of trial by a single judge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07032035000144"></a>I am aware that I have taken up a great deal of your Lordships&#146; time in putting the Opposition's case. In our view, the way forward is to let the various measures that the Government have quite sensibly put in place take their course. We do not know yet what the effect of the Fraud Act will be. As the noble and learned Lord knows, I regret the fact that the Government have retained the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud because there is certainly evidence from the Jubilee Line case that that vastly over-complicates all the issues without, in the words of Mr Wooler, adding anything at all to the type of sentence that would have been imposed had the trial turned out differently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="07032035000145"></a>The noble and learned Lord has also drawn our attention to the protocol of the Lord Chief Justice, as he then was&#151;the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf. This is an extremely helpful and constructive document. Essentially, it would require all the admissibility issues to be dealt with before the jury was impanelled. If properly implemented, that would make an enormous difference to the expedition of trial by jury. Then the noble and learned Lord referred us to the inter-departmental analysis that has been conducted and reminded us it has been out to consultation. We look forward to seeing the results of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="07032035000146"></a>A number of measures are on foot at the moment that may well achieve the result that the noble and learned Lord is looking for; but the issue of jury trial

It is a crucial component of our constitution. It is one of the most important guarantees, together with habeas corpus, of the liberty of the individual. We should be extremely slow and wary of calling it into question let alone abandoning it in one particular form of criminal trial. Of course fraud is difficult to prosecute; but that is no reason why the citizen should be deprived of this fundamental constitutional guarantee which has been with him the centuries.

<a name="07032035000148"></a><b><a name="70320-0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07032035000344"></a>Lord Maclennan of Rogart:</b> My Lords, the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General began by indicating that the procedures followed in this debate are somewhat unusual. He is entirely right; but I am bound to say that we entirely agree with the reasons advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, for treating this measure in the way that he has done. It is not a new matter of substance; I recall participating in another place in a debate on the Roskill committee report in which many of the arguments advanced by the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General were deployed. The remarkable difference, however, has been the unwillingness of our present Government to respond to the objections to their proposals.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="07032035000149"></a>The previous debate was led by Douglas Hurd, now the noble Lord, Lord Hurd of Westwell, who listened to the views of another place. Of those who spoke in the debate, 11 out of 12 Members spoke against the proposal that the Attorney-General seeks to advocate today. Unsurprisingly, the measure was withdrawn in the form currently being advanced.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="07032035000150"></a>It is remarkable how little the arguments have changed in 21 years, but in one respect the general legal ethos has changed. There have been disturbing indications from the Government that they do not cleave to the foundations of our freedoms, our rule of law and justice without cavil to the extent of their predecessors. We have seen measures that have called into question habeas corpus and the rules about the burden of proof in criminal trials. The Attorney-General may not like it, and he may shake his head, but the reality is that this country needs to beware of measures that undermine one of the fundamental rights of the citizens in this country&#151;the jury trial, which they perceive to be a guarantee of their freedoms.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="07032035000151"></a>No doubt the Attorney-General is aware of the recent inquiries by the legal professions in England on the attitude of the public to jury trial. Eighty per cent of those who gave evidence thought that juries would be much more likely to adhere to their views than judges would. There was far greater confidence in juries than in judges. That does not reflect an understanding of the very great distinction of our judicial profession, but it sounds a warning against the limitations on the jury system that this measure seeks to introduce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07032035000152"></a>One point made in the minority report on Roskill, which I thought telling at the time, was whenMr Merrick said that legislators ought to bear in mind,</p>
<ul><a name="07032035000233"></a>&#147;the public incomprehension which would follow in denying the right to a trial by jury to a man who has stolen &#163;1 million by the use of a computer and allowing it to a man who has stolen&#163;1 million from a bank by the use of a gun&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 13/2/98; col. 1167.]</ul>
<p><a name="07032035000218"></a>It is hard to understand precisely what motivates the Government to persist with this legislation in the face of the grave anxieties expressed in another place, by the legal profession, bodies such as Liberty, JUSTICE and the Law Society, and many who have had direct experience of the conduct of fraud cases. What lies behind it? It is hard to tell from the views expressedin another place by the Solicitor-General. When pressed, he said that,</p>
<ul><a name="07032035000242"></a>&#147;shorter trials, however desirable, are not our primary objective. We want to enable justice to be done by exposing the whole criminality of the case in a single trial. If trials are short, that will be a bonus&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 29/11/06; col. 1101.]</ul>
<p><a name="07032035000219"></a>It is not the length of the case that leads to this radical measure; length is apparently incidental to the Government&#146;s motives.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07032035000153"></a>In any event, on the length issue&#151;it was ably dealt with by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&#151;the procedures provided for in the measure would enable the defendant to take matters on appeal from the judge, including the reference to provide for a trial without a jury. On the face of it, it seems highly likely that the appeal process would extend trials beyond the time acknowledged, in relatively few cases, to be very burdensome.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="07032035000154"></a>The complexity of trials from the point of view of the juries has been dealt with by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, who properly pointed to the findingsin respect of the Jubilee Line trial and the comprehension of the jurors of the issues at stake. It is proper to remind ourselves that the concerns expressed in that review by the independent inspector were about the management of the case, which appears to be what underlies the complexity. Here again, there is ambivalence on the part of the Government and the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General. When he talks, as he did, about bringing all the issues together in one trial, I wonder exactly what he has in mind. Is that in the interests of justice? Is it necessary to make the case more complex to cover all the issues that might be raised? It certainly was not necessary, when Dr Shipman was being tried for murder, to bring into the case all the possible cases in which he might have committed murder. It was possible to convict him on the evidence of a number of cases, but to obtain a conviction and an exemplary sentence appropriate for the seriousness of the crime it was not necessary for the case to be comprehensive in the way in which the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General seemed to suggest that fraud cases should be.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="07032035000155"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General has brandished the threat of the Parliament Act. I am bound to say that that does not make it more attractive to me to see this Bill continued beyond today. It suggests deep commitment, for whatever reason&#151;I  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1158"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>find it difficult to divine the reason, other than a degree of stubbornness&#151;that would render the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General opposed to any amendment that might be advanced. It was clear from the way in which amendments were dismissed in another place that the Government are not open on these issues. They have set their face firmly in one direction and they intend to travel down that route until they arrive.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="07032035000156"></a>The question that might properly be asked is: why have the Government shown so little confidence in the measures that they themselves introduced to deal with some of these problems? Why are they not prepared to wait to see the effect of the Fraud Act, which only came into effect in January? Why are they not prepared to consider whether the amendment by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Justice Woolf, to the criminal procedure rules and the protocol for the control and management of serious fraud and other complex cases deliver the objectives that, on the face of it, they seem concerned about? Why are these measures being written off as not as important as tampering with the jury system? The noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General stated that they are not enough, but he has no evidence of that; he has no evidence at all, because they have not been in effect for long enough to draw conclusions.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="07032035000157"></a>There is another matter, again relating to the Government&#146;s own legislation. The Attorney-General spoke about the all-embracing nature of the charge and the inclusiveness of the trial, making sure that every point is considered. That was not the motivation behind the introduction of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, which provides for trial by jury of sample counts only, if certain conditions are fulfilled, with the remaining counts to be tried by a judge alone. Whether that Act leads to differences is worthy of consideration. It might tell us something about the possible effect of the measure before us.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07032035000158"></a>Despite the fact that these matters have been considered and debated for 21 years, the Attorney-General&#146;s action appears, in the light of what has been done in the past two or three years, precipitate and careless of our fundamental rights and freedoms. I therefore hope that a stop will be brought to this legislation today and that the public will have an opportunity to consider the issues and why this House is proposing to take this action.</p>

It is not so much a battle as a campaign. One is tempted to compare it with medieval sieges: the troops are deployed subtly; the advance trenches are dug; the trebuchet catapults are bedded in place, all directed towards what is perceived to be a weakness in the defensive wall. I shall not extend the metaphor further and suggest what might happen to the Attorney-General when he leads us with forlorn hope into the breach, but one may be tempted to say that, if that attack on the breach fails, he is considering almost a nuclear option. That is the situation.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07032035000160"></a>A problem has very properly been identified by the Government. They have very honourably considered a solution as an alternative, by way of the Fraud Act of last year, the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 and the protocol that was introduced almost exactly two years ago this week by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07032035000161"></a>The Government rely heavily on two postulates; first, that the failure in the operation of trials for serious fraud must be somehow be laid at the door of the jury. There has been a great deal of examination of anecdotal and empirical evidence, but that case has never been proven. Such evidence as exists is very much to the contrary. Reference has already been made to R v Rayment and others; that is, the Jubilee line case. The remarks of Mr Wooler, Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, went far beyond merely saying that there was no evidence that the jury failed in this matter. Indeed, he specifically exculpated the jury with these words:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="07032035000234"></a>&#147;No responsibility for the inconclusive outcome of the case can properly be attributed to the capabilities or conduct of the jury. Overall, they discharged their duties in a thorough and conscientious manner, and the fact that the trial became unmanageable was not their responsibility&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70320-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07032035000162"></a>Seven or eight months after the end of the trial, members of the jury were able to state conclusively exactly what the issues were in that trial. We should always remember that for the last seven months of that trial, the jury sat to hear evidence on only 13 days. The trial collapsed for a number of reasons. It seemed to be jinxed. Illness and various other factors probably contributed as much as anything else, as much as the prosecution&#146;s tactical mistakes in the way that it deployed its case.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07032035000163"></a>There is no evidence to show that there is a causal connection between what the Government regard as failure in high profile fraud cases and the actions of a jury. That begs the question how one defines failure. If one takes an Orwellian view, one may well say that conviction is good, acquittal is bad. Surely that argument is not going to be relied on by the Government.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07032035000164"></a>The Government&#146;s second postulate is that there are inherent weaknesses in the situation of a jury in such a trial. The arguments have already been very properly deployed by the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Maclennan. The Government no longer seem to rely on a jury&#146;s lack of cognitive capacity, although there were doubts about the way in which the matter was put by the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General. This is what his partner, the Solicitor-General, said in the House of Commons at Second Reading on 29 November last year:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="07032035000235"></a>&#147;It is not our case that jurors are not clever enough to understand complex fraud cases. That is a straw man that the Opposition seem to put up each time we debate this issue. That is not our claim&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 29/11/06; col. 1089.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032035000165"></a>He went on to say in the same speech:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="07032035000236"></a>&#147;I am not advancing what the hon. and learned Gentleman describes as the stupid jury argument&#151;not at all. I want to make it very clear that it is not our claim that juries are incapable of understanding complex fraud cases&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 29/11/06; col. 1098.]</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1160"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70320-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07032035000166"></a>I mention the matter because the twin qualifications for an application under Section 43(5) are, on the one hand, that there should be a lengthy trial or, on the other, that there should be complexity. Complexities will inevitably lead to the length of trial. However, since the length of trial is dealt with separately from the question of complexity, it seems that complexity must apply in some way or another to the capacity of a jury to understand. In other words, that the issues are so complex that a jury is not able properly to comprehend what the issues are at each stage, evaluate relevant evidence or collate evidence and reach a rational conclusion. If the Government say that they are not relying on the stupid jury argument, so be it, although there seemed to be some overtones of that in the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General&#146;s address.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07032035000167"></a>The second matter is the length of trials. The Government are very properly applying their minds to a genuine problem. It must be burdensome, sheer purgatory, for a person to have to sit on such a jury for, say, 12 months or more, but I am not sure that that forms a relevant part of the Government&#146;s case. If the length of the trial is the problem, that does not confine itself to trials for serious fraud. The definition of a lengthy trial given by the Lord Chief Justice was a trial of three months or more, six months as a ceiling and 12 months in unique situations. I am sure we would all accept that definition. However, I ask the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General this question&#151;and I am sure that he will assist the House in this matter. Of the 30,000 or so trials in the Crown Courts last year, how many lasted more than three months? I suspect that the number must be many hundreds. Some of them would be drugs cases, some would be non-fraud conspiracy cases and some would be terrorism cases. If the Attorney-General has such data, I am sure that he will release them to the House. If those are not available to the Attorney-General, how could he and his colleagues have come to any conclusion about evaluating the whole problem in relation to serious fraud?</p>

If I am right in my submission, as I believe I am&#151;although I have an overwhelming sense of my own fallibility at all times&#151;the Government should succeed in this matter if the only possible way by which they can bring the matter to a solution is through this legislation. However, in view of the three-pronged attack that they have already, very properly, announced in relation to the Fraud Act 2006, which has been in operation for only two months, the protocol which has been in operation for exactly two years and the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 which has not been brought into force, it seems to me that there is a very strong case for tarrying a while.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="07032035000169"></a>I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said. When dealing with a jury, we are dealing with something that is much wider than a legal context&#151;I say that not out of any soggy sentimentality for juries. Juries are utterly central and fundamental to our concept of liberty and justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="07032035000170"></a>I end with a quotation from Sir Patrick Devlin, as he then was, in a book that was published exactly50 years ago, <I>Trial by Jury</I>. The verities that are dealt

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="07032035000237"></a>&#147;Each jury is a little parliament. The jury sense is the parliamentary sense. I cannot see the one dying and the other surviving. The first object of any tyrant in Whitehall would be to make parliament utterly subservient to his will; and the next to overthrow or diminish trial by jury, for no tyrant could afford to leave a subject&#146;s freedom in the hands of 12 of his countrymen. So that trial by jury is more than an instrument of justice and more than one wheel of the constitution: it is the lamp that shows that freedom lives&#148;.</p>

I support the Second Reading of the Bill and will vote against the wrecking amendment. I note the pledge to use the Parliament Act if necessary.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="07032035000172"></a>The Bill deals with an issue that seems to generate considerable feeling and sometimes has been described as the thin end of the wedge as regards trial by jury. There is no trial by jury in a magistrates&#146; court and for summary cases the defendant does not have a right to opt to have the case heard instead in a higher court so that it can be before a jury. If a district judge is sitting in a magistrates&#146; court, the case is heard not by three people, but by one person who determines the verdict and, where applicable, the sentence, which could be a period of imprisonment.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="07032035000173"></a>Trial by jury is not the norm throughout the criminal justice system. In the civil courts, where cases of potentially enormous significance can be heard, it is not a key part of the process at all. Even in the criminal justice system, cases can be heard, in exceptional circumstances, without a jury if a jury could be subject to intimidation.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="07032035000174"></a>However, the Bill does not propose to hack away at the current rights of trial by jury. There are just under 30,000 contested jury trials a year and the Bill will reduce that number by a handful. The figure is unlikely to be more than 20 and probably just half a dozen. It would apply only to lengthy, complex and serious fraud cases, of which there were half a dozen lasting six months or longer in 2005, and only in cases where the prosecution, the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice were satisfied it was necessary, in the interests of justice, judged against the strict criteria laid down. For the four years from 2002 to 2005,26 fraud trials lasted for more than six months, six of which lasted for more than a year.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="07032035000175"></a>The need for new ways of trying complex fraud cases, often involving many defendants in inter-linking transactions and other acts, was highlighted in the reports by Lord Roskill in 1986 and Lord Justice Auld in 2001. Their argument did not extend to either other types of case or into a general proposition for a move away from jury trial. This Bill, in line with those reports, is also about a limited number of very specific, lengthy or complex fraud cases, which are likely to go on for many months, indeed up to a year or more. For the members of the jury that is an enormous period of time, and way beyond what can justifiably be expected of a citizen required to do his or her civic duty. It certainly raises questions about  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1162"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>why cases need to go on for so long, and why we have a judicial system that allows, allegedly in the name of justice, for cases to extend over such a period of time.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="07032035000176"></a>For a juror, it can mean a lengthy disruption of his or her personal life. For those in employment it can put at risk promotion prospects or even their job, levels of income, pay rises and bonuses, and the ability to keep up to date with developments in their field of work. In some jobs, if skills are not regularly used, it can make a return to work many months later even more difficult. Needless to say, not being around for many months does not exactly endear an employee to his or her employer.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="07032035000177"></a>All these factors can also make it harder to end up with a jury that is as representative as the selection system is intended to produce. Those with careers to think about, those who have a less than sympathetic employer, and those with significant personal commitments are likely to use whatever channels they can to avoid sitting on cases lasting up to a year. Thus the principle of the randomness of selection of the jury is compromised in such cases.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="07032035000178"></a>My noble and learned friend quoted Lord Justice Auld&#146;s report in which, referring to fraud cases, he said that their burdensome length and increasing speciality and the complexity with which jurors had to cope put justice at risk and was a most compelling factor in favour of reform. Whether Lord Auld is right in inferring that jurors may have difficulty in coping I do not know, but I am sure he is right in referring to the burdensome length and its impact. That was an issue brought out in the report undertaken by the inspector following the Jubilee Line case even though it may not have met the intended criteria for trial without a jury since it was not expected to be as lengthy or as complex as it was.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07032035000179"></a>The requirement for oral explanation of documents which can run into thousands of pages in complex fraud trials is a factor in such trials lasting many months or even up to a year or more. This places a real burden on juries, since few people are in a position to give up their normal lives for so long. There is evidence that to get round this problem prosecutors split complex fraud trials into separate trials, drop the less serious charges against secondary defendants and reduce the number of charges before the court. None of these actions is in the interests of justice, since it means that the full alleged culpability of the defendants is not presented to the court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07032035000180"></a>In the Blue Arrow case the trial judge had to sever the case into two trials to make it,</p>
<ul><a name="07032035000243"></a>&#147;manageable for the jury&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032035000220"></a>He said that,</p>

<ul><a name="07032035000245"></a>&#147;there is a significant risk of a miscarriage of justice resulting from the volume and complexity of the evidence&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032035000222"></a>A judge sitting alone should be able to overcome these difficulties, hear a large number of charges, look at all the evidence and make sure that speeches and questions are not repetitive and are directed at the relevant issues and differences over facts.

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07032035000181"></a>Complex fraud cases almost by definition include issues of whether what was being alleged was, or was not, being done knowingly and with intent. If it was, it is more than likely that fairly elaborate steps were being made to cover tracks and to present it in another light. Defendants in complex fraud trials are not usually relatively unsophisticated folk, unlike many who appear in benefit fraud cases tried in the lower courts.</p>

<a name="70320-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="07032035000182"></a>Lengthy fraud trials, where juries have sat for many months before being asked to make decisions reflecting complex evidence, speeches and questioning relating to multiple defendants who they heard weeks and months earlier in the trial, would not be many people&#146;s idea of how an effective criminal justice system should function. They certainly wouldnot regard it as so if a better way was available, in certain clearly defined circumstances, to deal with such cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="07032035000183"></a>I do not believe that the public would regard the hearing of a small number of very lengthy and complex fraud cases before a single judge as an injustice or as an attack on jury trials; nor do all members of the legal profession share a lack of confidence in the appropriateness of a single judge and a non-jury trial in such cases. I believe that the public would support such a move, particularly if it ensured that the whole case was heard in one court and that all appropriate charges were laid, all appropriate defendants charged and all the evidence heard. That is justice, and that is what the public support and want. They do not want a system which, in respect of a limited number of lengthy and complex fraud cases, at times appears to be the sophisticated fraudster&#146;s friend.</p>

For 10 years this Labour Government have been actively undermining jury trial. Since 1997 we have had two modes of trial Bills presented. I remind the House that they were to take away the right of the accused to elect trial by jury in certain cases and pass the decision to magistrates. I recall that during the proceedings on that Bill, we were given a clear understanding by the Ministersthat there would certainly be no attempt to remove jury trial for more serious cases.

The point is a simple one for me: giving the Bill a Second Reading involves an implicit acceptance of the unacceptable. The only acceptable amendment to it that I can see is to oppose Clause 2 standing part; that would have the same effect as voting against the Bill at Second Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="07032035000201"></a>I also feel entirely unintimidated by the noble and learned Lord&#146;s threat of the Parliament Act. By the next Session we shall have a new Prime Minister, new priorities, new views and possibly even new personnel in various offices. If a week is a long time in politics, it is an extremely long time if there is a change of Prime Minister in the interim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="07032035000202"></a>I do not say that the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General is seeking to undermine the jury system. I listened carefully to what he said and I take him to be a man of his word, as I have always found him to be in the past. Nor do I think that he is proposing the thin end of a large wedge; that is not a very useful argument in this debate. He just has it horribly wrong on this occasion.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="07032035000203"></a>I agree entirely with the noble and learned Lord that, over the years, the Diplock courts have reached high standards of justice in Northern Ireland. I also agree with him entirely that there are certain classes of case in which, in this modern age, it is no longer possible to have a reliable trial by jury, but they are a very special class of case. They are not cases where the jury has to be there for a long time or has to make a difficult judgment; they are cases where the jury system is so undermined by, for example, intimidation of or threats to jurors or sectarian conflict that it is simply not possible for the jury to return a reliable verdict. By no stretch of the imagination do fraud cases fall into that category. This is an attempt at a pragmatic Bill; it is an attempt by the Government to persuade the House that, quite simply, fraud cases are too burdensome for juries. However, for reasons that I shall set out, I disagree wholeheartedly.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="07032035000204"></a>My one serious criticism of the noble and learned Lord&#146;s introduction to this debate, measured as it was, was his inappropriate use of remarks made some years ago by the Lord Chief Justice as he now is. The Attorney-General should perhaps have recognised, as he may reflect he should have done, that significant changes have taken place in the management of fraud trials since those remarks were made. As I understand it, today the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice takes a somewhat adjusted view of what he said, as the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General put it, several years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07032035000205"></a>I do not want to dwell on the legal philosophy behind the jury system&#151;many have already spoken about that&#151;but I hold to the view that a jury trial is a most democratic act. Taking part in a jury trial is probably the most democratic act that any citizen can undertake.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07032035000206"></a>Surely the decision on honesty or dishonesty&#151;the essential decision in a jury trial&#151;is a classic determination for a jury. It is worth looking at the record of jury trials. How many cases have there been in which there has been a successful appeal on the basis of something done by the jury? So few as to amount statistically to zero. But there have, of course, been many appeals in which errors by judges are so serious that the conviction has been rendered unsafe, with the result that there has had to be a retrial.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07032035000207"></a>I believe that the Attorney-General knows that in every, or almost every, case of fraud, if tried by judge alone, there would be an appeal in which his or her conclusions not only of law but also of fact would be attacked. There would be complex decisions on disclosure and PII. Although the system of PII has worked tolerably well in Diplock courts, there has been at least one instance in the past two years in which there have been difficulties because two judges were dealing with issues on the admissibility of evidence, with a separate judge deciding on public interest immunity.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07032035000208"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, said that judges decide very important issues of liability on their own every day of the week. Of course he is right, but the cachet of criminal is rather different from the cachet of tortfeasor. We do not refer to that tortfeasor over there, but, for example, we may well not wish to see sitting in your Lordships&#146; House criminals who are convicted while Members of this House. It is a different quality of issue.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07032035000209"></a>Jurors&#146; determinations of fact are based on a collective view as lay people of the conduct of the defendant. A judge&#146;s determination of fact may in some cases&#151;I hesitate to say this in the presence of distinguished and retired judges in this House&#151;can be somewhere between idiosyncratic and a great deal worse. The annals of the law reports are full of cases where judges have made serious mistakes; as I said earlier, jurors have made few.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="07032035000210"></a>The Fraud Act 2006 has already been mentioned. In so far as there is any complexity in deciding whether someone has been proved to be dishonest or not, that decision-making process has been simplified very sensibly by the introduction of an overarching offence of fraud. We can expect to see that charge frequently. From my experience and that garnered from others, I can speak of many cases in which juries have brought in differential&#151;mixed&#151;verdicts. They find some defendants guilty and others not guilty, and defendants guilty of some charges and not others in very long cases.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="07032035000211"></a>I can cite one from the Central Criminal Court where all defendants were found guilty&#151;regrettably including my client. It was an SFO case. I can cite another SFO case at Snaresbrook Crown Court in which two were found guilty, one not guilty&#151;happily, my client&#151;and one not guilty on a retrial. I can cite a  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1168"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>case at Southwark Crown Court in which there was a very obvious understanding between the judge and jury. Eventually as a result of extremely good case management, the judge took it out of the hands of the jury at half-time, accepting a submission of no case to answer. The jury had asked numerous questions during the trial, and it was quite clear that their engagement had had an effect on the judge.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07032035000212"></a>In another SFO case at the Central Criminal Court, two defendants were found guilty and another not guilty. There are many other cases, not of serious fraud, where exactly the objections made by the noble and learned Lord the Attorney General could be made. For example, in the cockle pickers&#146; case at Preston Crown Court, which lasted for several months and in which I appeared for one defendant, three defendants were found guilty and two not guilty. </p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07032035000213"></a>This brings me to the question of representative juries. I do not know where the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, gets his view that juries in long cases are not representative. It is illogical. Within a random selection of the population will be people who have employment difficulties, people who have booked holidays and people who have family difficulties. Thinking in particular about the cockle pickers&#146; case, among others, I suggest that if one examined the evidence empirically&#151;and far more research into juries is needed&#151;one would find that juries were just as representative in long fraud cases as in others.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07032035000214"></a>The question of undue burdensomeness for juries has already been discussed; I will not repeat what has already been said about the research of Professor Sally Lloyd-Bostock. The noble and learned Lord the Attorney General has failed completely, in addressing the House, to take into account the numerous measures taken in the last two to three years to enable juries to understand fraud cases better. I have heard the Lord Chief Justice&#146;s protocol cited day after day in court; it has had a dramatic effect on the management of cases. There is currently a long ongoing case, albeit not one of fraud, in which a High Court judge has decided that there should be one lead cross-examination of the expert witnesses to be called by the prosecution. Someone involved told me that this has shortened the case substantially.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="07032035000215"></a>Judge Rivlin, resident judge at Southwark Crown Court, has a system of allocating and managing cases so that they are dealt with effectively and practically within that Crown Court. Technology, as I have seen, is used in many cases; it shortens them dramatically, juries like using it and it gives everyone, counsel included, a much clearer understanding of the case. Then, of course, there is the welcome development of plea bargaining. Plea bargaining, let us face it, has been done behind the scenes throughout my 35 years of practice at the Bar. It should be formalised and made more open; it should be clear what benefits are available. Perhaps it should be more like the American system in that regard. It is another development that can be used to shorten cases and manage them more effectively.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07032035000216"></a>Comparable common law countries retain juries for long cases, including those of serious fraud&#151;as, in my view, we should here. I am afraid that the Government

It is not a case of the jury being out; the jury should not be in at all. The evidence for juries&#146; ability to deal with these cases is stronger than ever.</p>

The mixed results he has adduced concerning representation should not be viewed by anybody as a deterrent to instructing him; they will be very well represented.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07032045000002"></a>I am rather torn on this issue. My own experience compels me to the view that the situation presented by the Bill is somewhat misplaced. On the other hand, I do not think that what the Opposition propose in moving this amendment is worthy of them. All in all, because of that, and because I consider this Bill capable of amendment, I shall vote for it&#151;but with gritted teeth.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07032045000003"></a>To suggest, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, did, that there has been no adequate consultation about this issue is quite wrong. The Roskill report, the Auld report and the debates that have taken place in the legal profession on this issue have all been of immense importance. I think that the noble Lord rather overstated the case, uncharacteristically, because I like to think that he is a friend of mine. I am sure thathe is.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07032045000004"></a>However, I am torn on this matter because I spent some 50 years in the profession of solicitor&#151;indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and I are the only two solicitors in this debate&#151;and a great deal of time involved in fraud trials, but I cannot recall any in my own experience that lasted for more than three or four months. Nowadays it is quite common for fraud trials to last considerably beyond that period. Indeed there was the Jubilee Line case, which has been widely quoted today; that was not a fraud issue, but it lasted in all for more than two years. Certainly, any juror who was on that panel should be sympathised with.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07032045000005"></a>It is no small wonder, therefore, that demands have grown for juries to be dispensed with. My own view on what ought to be a non-political issue is that the Government have not finally fully made out the case for taking this very drastic step. I am far from convinced that all or a majority of fraud cases have become so complex in more recent times that a jury is incapable of comprehending the essential issue. Of course, that hesitation that I spoke of could be overcome&#151;but it has not today by virtue of the arguments made in this important debate. We have heard some excellent speeches, but speeches that have been devoid of argument.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07032045000006"></a>The proposal that the Government advance to do away with juries in certain fraud trials divides the legal profession. Many organisations that advise on criminal proceedings, such as the Bar Council, the Law Society and Justice, have made very strong representations on this count. But although these representations have been very persuasive, do they really express a majority or minority view? We do not know. It is certainly an issue that divides the whole  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1170"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>legal profession. Accordingly, it would be folly for the Government to ignore those significant views&#151;and I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that there ought to be more discussion about this issue than has taken place.</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="07032045000007"></a>There is a powerful common denominator between everyone who has participated in this debate. How do we improve the present position? How do we ensure that we arrive at an intelligent decision on admittedly complex matters? Are we satisfied that trial judges always exercise sufficient and satisfactory control of the long cases that come before them? How best can we accomplish that? We have heard little about it, except that the present situation is fine; that it ought not to be altered. The Government have said, &#147;Of course, we should&#151;as far as a small minority of fraud cases is concerned&#148;. So how can we make an intelligent decision about that?</p>

<a name="70320-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07032045000008"></a>My suspicions about the Bill were intensified by the Solicitor-General&#146;s statement, on extendingthe measure to other classes of cases, that the Government,</p>
<ul><a name="07032045000071"></a>&#147;have no intention at this stage&#148;&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 29/11/06; col. 1094.]</ul>
<p><a name="07032045000057"></a>of doing that. Rather importantly, he said that the Government had no intention at the present time to do anything about that. That is why I am so obliged to my noble and learned friend for saying today, in clear terms, that that was not the Government&#146;s case, which was that there was no intention of going beyond what they were proposing at the present time. I am grateful to him for saying precisely that. In other words, the Government are saying that, as far as this is concerned, the anxiety that several of us have expressed is misplaced.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70320-0006.htm"/>


<a name="70320-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07032045000009"></a>The Government contend that the proposed legislation is satisfactory, and that it is only because of this House that they have not been able to ensure that the necessary legislation should take effect. Well, that may be and it may not be. Certainly, serious consideration ought to be given to what the Government say regarding highly complex cases; they are duty-bound to adduce evidence that juries are incapable of coming to a sensible decision as far as that is concerned. Having said that, I depart from the Opposition in several respects.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07032045000010"></a>It is idle to pretend that it is possible to oppose this Bill in principle, and therefore come to the decision that we ought to vote against it. Of how many Bills could that be said? There are many that I have heard myself in this place, put by the Opposition of all kinds&#151;Labour and Conservative. Is it not possible to come to a decision today that we can amend this Bill in several respects&#151;to make it rather better and make sure that a jury trial in a democratic society can take place, but that there may be an exception to that? Should we not come to a conclusion that fraud is rather special and difficult? How should it be handled?</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07032045000011"></a>All this is capable of amendment. No single issue has been adduced so far to show that the Bill is incapable of amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, says that the House of Commons concluded that it would try to amend the Bill and faileld. But that  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1171"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is quite different from this place. If the Liberal Democrats, Conservatives and some Members on this side conclude that a certain amendment should be tried, it is possible that it will be carried. That has happened many times in the past. I plead guilty myself to voting against the Government on four or five occasions, and could do so on this Bill.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="07032045000012"></a>In conclusion, I have several questions for my right honourable and learned friend. First, would the defendant be entitled to be heard at the same hearing at which the prosecution can submit that the case should proceed without a jury? I do not think that anything is said about this in the Bill. Secondly, what sort of sanction can be imposed on prosecutors who do not obey the injunction that they should present their case succinctly, as sometimes happens?</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="07032045000013"></a>Although I have doubts about the Bill, I do think that the Opposition entirely misconstrue the situation. To play politics on so important a matter is scandalous and unforgivable. Any chance of amending the Bill will be lost, without doubt, if the Government deploy the Parliament Act; so rather than abstain, as I was inclined to do, I will vote for the Government in the hope that the Bill will be satisfactorily amended in many respects. The Opposition cannot escape from the past as easily as they pretend. Mr Michael Howard, who was then the Home Secretary, proposed exactly what the Government are doing today. Who on the opposition side objected then to what he said? Not a single person.</p>

However, it is not a subject on which I normally speak in your Lordships&#146; House, especially as there are so many eminent lawyers here. Listening today to so many of them, I wonder why I changed my mind.

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07032045000017"></a>Like many members of the public, I have been concerned at the huge costs, which sometimes run into millions of pounds. The defence, lacking the resources of the prosecution, is often at a disadvantage. I am concerned about the gridlock caused when a specialist judge, a courtroom and prosecuting lawyers are tied up for many months; about cases in which members of the jury are drowned in paper or, nowadays, have to study masses of figures and documents on a computer  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1172"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>screen, although I note the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, that sometimes this makes it easier for the jury; and about cases in which even a jury consisting entirely of chartered accountants&#151;this is obviously an imaginary jury&#151;might find themselves bewildered by all the facts in front of them.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07032045000018"></a>However, the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General asked how many of your Lordships would like to be tied up for nine months, a year or even longer. I found that a bit odd because he went on to say that the length of the trial was not the concern. I agree that most of us would not want that, although we sit here day after day, week after week and month after month quite happily, but we do not have to because we can sit outside if we wish.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07032045000019"></a>The problem is that the public often are rightly incensed when all that effort, time and money is wasted, and the case collapses. I am not talking about too many defendants being acquitted, as is sometimes claimed. That is what juries are for; namely, to put the onus entirely on the prosecution and to give the defendant the benefit of any doubt.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="07032045000020"></a>The Bill is supposed to deal with complex fraud cases; can the Minister tell us why so many of them have to be complex? That that bothers me. I am not talking about cases where the fraud is a result of convoluted manoeuvrings of the defendant. Often, the most blatant frauds are as a result of some relatively simple actions. Why is it so often the case that a large number of similar charges, based on similar actions and evidence, are levelled against the defendant? The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan,said that it was not necessary in the Shipman case to bring in all the other cases that had taken place. There can be dozens of such charges and, sometimes, there are many more. Why? Unlike in the United States of America where sentences are usually consecutive,the sentencing practice here is for concurrent sentences.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="07032045000021"></a>I apologise for repeating myself from my maiden speech&#151;I am not 100 per cent sure that I will say exactly the same today, 13 years later. I said that I hope that our judges will limit the use of concurrent sentences because I believe where there are three convictions there ought to be three sentences. Our courts should not be a kind of discount store: commit two crimes and get one free. I notice the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, shaking his head, although I did say that I am not sure if I will still say the same today. My point is about concurrent sentences. To hear one case is one thing, but to have to listen to 40 cases to get to the same position is something else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07032045000022"></a>There is a story, which is perhaps apocryphal, about a president of the Court of Appeal who, when faced with counsel&#146;s opening remark, &#147;There are X number of grounds for appeal&#148;, would reply, &#147;Well, Mr So and So, just tell us your best point&#148;. Without trying to create an atmosphere of prejudice in the minds of a jury by the sheer weight of allegations against a defendant, it cannot be beyond the wit of the prosecution to secure a conviction on the basis of perhaps one, two or even three sample charges. The magistrates&#146; courts had a system of taking into consideration similar

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07032045000023"></a>This avoids the prosecution taking a second bite at the cherry if it is dissatisfied with the sentence that has been imposed. It also clears the book of numerous other related offences. In the end, the consequential disgrace of the conviction will always be the same, especially to a so-called white-collar criminal. As I said, concurrent sentences result in the same amount of time in prison no matter how many charges are levelled against the same defendant. The Crown Prosecution Service and the Serious Fraud Office could be persuaded to restrain their exuberance in the interests of securing justice for the prosecution and the defendant and in the public interest. They should simply bring before the court in the words of the Court of Appeal judge &#147;their best case only&#148;. That would help to solve some of the problems that, according to the Government, this Bill seeks to redress. I know that the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General is trying to do his best, but we wonder whether getting rid of the jury is the solution.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07032045000024"></a>Juries, which have been so aptly described by my noble friend Lord Hunt, are a pillar of our legal system. In all conscience, to get rid of the jury to alleviate the problem of complexity is a step too far. I do not believe that we on this side or the Government should be thinking of allowing this to happen. I very much hope that the Attorney-General will think long and hard about this. I know that he has. I do not know how much consultation has taken place, but I have heard from around the House today that there has not been enough. The Attorney-General is nodding his head; we are all doing that today. I assume that he does not agree with what has been said. However, he will agree that all people today, whether they are speaking for or against the Bill, are doing so with conscience, conviction and with real belief. Therefore, it is imperative that, before we get rid of systems that have been in place for some700 years, as my noble friend said, we take to heart and think carefully about what it would mean.</p>

Because of that, I have an interest in jury trials and therefore a deep concern about the Bill. I have to make it clear that I do not have a sentimental view about juries, but I do know that most of the British public are proud to fulfil their civic duty by doing jury service, even when it is most inconvenient for them. I also know that various governments have explored this issue before, and that the Roskill commission in the mid-1980s, as we have heard, recommended a judge and two assessors for some serious fraud trials. However, there were powerful voices on the opposite side too, in particular Lord Devlin, who said in his evidence:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="07032045000063"></a>&#147;Trial by jury forms part of the political compromise we have made between arbitrary and popular government. &#145;Arbitrary&#146; in this confrontation means the rule by those, e.g. the judges, who are not answerable to the electorate&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="07032045000058"></a>He went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="07032045000064"></a>&#147;Not since the glorious revolution of 1688 has a citizen been imprisoned for any substantial time, ie longer than the short sentence for summary offences, otherwise than on the verdict of a jury&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70320-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07032045000026"></a>I wish to make three points. The first is whether this Bill is the best way to remedy the problem of the length and complexity of some serious fraud trials. Surely, it is not only the jury for whom it is a burden, but all those involved, including the trial judge. Arguably, serious fraud is not as stressful on the jury as trials involving the emotions, such as rape or murder. As for complexity, the report on the aborted Jubilee Line trial, about which we have heard so much this afternoon, showed that the jury were fully up to speed on that particular case, in spite of those who hoped that it would vindicate the Government's position. I have recently heard of several serious fraud cases lasting months in which the jury has had up to half a dozen lever-arch files of documents to read, which it has willingly done. Only last week, I heard of a trial with 30,000 documents, in which the judge told me that the jury was completely on top of the issues. If there is no jury in such cases, is it not likely that they will last even longer, as there will be no incentive on the part of either side to cut to the chase, as it were? In a debate on the Roskill proposals in 1986, the late Lord Wigoder QC pointed out that there would be no pressure at all to keep the case simple or clear.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07032045000027"></a>My first point is therefore that surely the more difficult job of tackling the length and complexity of cases should be undertaken before the relatively simple and blunt instrument is used to axe jury trial in serious fraud cases. As others have said already, the reforms instituted by the then Lord Chief Justice, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, in March 2005 on the control and management of heavy fraud and other complex criminal cases have hardly been given any time to work, and certainly cannot have had time to be reviewed.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="07032045000028"></a>Secondly, the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which contains the substance of this Bill, was only passed after the Government offered the famous consultation on this particular part. As we have heard, that turned out to be a hurriedly arranged morning seminar; I remember it well. Considering that this is an important change in the law, I would be interested to hear what consultation the Government have had with bodies such as the Criminal Bar Association. It cannot be right that the Government seek to change the law in this area with so little consensus among law practitioners.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="07032045000029"></a>My third and last point is that abolishing jury trial for any serious crime is a dangerous step for the Government to take without that consensus. It looks to the man and woman in the street as though the Government do not trust them, as members of a potential jury, to get serious fraud case decisions right. My informal researches among the judges whom I have come across recently have not uncovered any appetite at all for judge-only trials&#151;in fact, just the opposite&#151;and I am sure it was not just to do with their personal safety, which is not something we have heard much about. Their comments have all been remarkably similar&#151;that they believe juries do a good  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1175"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1175</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>job. One said to me only yesterday, &#147;Their verdicts, as representatives of society, have a validity which that arrived at by a judge sitting alone, even supported as it would be by a fully reasoned judgment, would lack in the eyes of society as a whole&#148;. Undermining public confidence, even in subtle ways, in our criminal justice system is extremely undesirable. People trust the jury system, even though it may be more costly and time-consuming than any alternative.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="07032045000030"></a>When the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General was asked in a radio interview last year whether the Bill was not the thin end of the wedge to abolish jury trial in other cases, I distinctly heard him reply that if it was a wedge, it was the thinnest of all possible wedges. But that is what a wedge has to be in order to be effective. The same rationale that the Government are using in this case could be used to abolish the jury in other cases. After all, other long criminal cases are just as burdensome and complex, as we have heard.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07032045000031"></a>Finally, I find the Government's method of getting their way on the Bill oppressive, and I am glad that the combined opposition are planning to act in a robust fashion at the end of the debate.</p>

The jury trial most democratically embraces another aspect of citizenship&#151;the right to be tried by your peers. The two&#151;being a juror and being tried by a jury&#151;therefore fulfil two basic elements of being a citizen: the duty to perform a duty and the responsibility that that entails, and the right to have rights to be tried by a jury.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07032045000059"></a>I regard that as not legal, although in its context, in essence, it is a democratic feature of our democracy. If this is an appropriate act of citizenship, I remind those on my Benches that the work that was put in to achieving the working man&#146;s suffrage was subsequently followed by the abolition of special juries and the right of every voting man and woman to sit on a jury. It was thought to be that fundamental.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07032045000033"></a>Any change to this democratic issue should be tested democratically. One should always be prepared to test a principle, no matter how firmly held, by its practicality. This Bill tests the principle of jury trial by its practicality in serious fraud cases. It does so by setting out conditions. In the fifth volume of thesix volumes of legislation for 2003, Section 43 ofthe Criminal Justice Act provides conditions, which the Bill does not rehearse again but which still apply.The condition for a trial without a jury is that the complexity of it or its length is likely to make it so burdensome to a jury that the interests of justice require a trial by a judge alone. Before a judge so decides, he must have regard in Section 43(6) to,</p>
<ul><a name="07032045000072"></a>&#147;any steps which might reasonably be taken&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07032045000060"></a>to make the trial less complex and shorter. Those principles still apply, and I propose to test them against the Bill.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07032045000034"></a>Complexity means intelligibility of the evidence, not only by a jury but by the people who present it. Whether they are the police or the Serious Fraud  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1176"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1176</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Office, it is their duty to make a criminal charge and its supporting elements intelligible. I simply do not accept that because we are in the 21st century fraud and dishonesty have become so complex that they are no longer intelligible to the ordinary person.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07032045000035"></a>In the very first fraud case in which I was led as a junior, the opening by the prosecuting silk was something like this, &#147;This case is about a lot of money&#148;. He pointed to the people in the dock. &#147;It belonged to their company, and it is all gone. It is gone because of their dishonesty. Over the next few days, we are going to find out what they did with it&#148;. He then called the first witness. Am I to be told that that did not explain to the jury the three elements of any such fraud case&#151;participation, knowledge and dishonesty&#151;each of which is capable of being judged by any ordinary citizen, provided the material is presented intelligibly? It would be a sad moment if, as some think, the implosion of the Serious Fraud Office was accompanied by this fundamental constitutional change. Let us see the fraud prosecution system working effectively first to make things more intelligible and therefore less complex.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07032045000036"></a>On length, I unashamedly invite the House to note that our friend and ally the United States took on what it thought to be our best values, one of which was the jury trial. It has never ever given up on that value and on its importance in society. If American citizens were listening to our debate, they simply would not understand it. &#147;Why are you proposing to conduct a serious fraud case without a jury?&#148; they would ask. &#147;Because it takes too long&#148;. &#147;Why does it take too long&#148;? &#147;Because that is our system&#148;. &#147;Why is it your system&#148;? &#147;Because it has always been like that&#148;. That is a weak and illogical basis for doing away with a serious principle.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07032045000037"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, was quite right to point out significant change: the as-yet-untested effect of the Fraud Act; simplicity of the offence; the growing effect of complex trial protocols; new ways of doing things; shortening matters; introducing technical evidence in an attractive way; and time-limiting us lawyers.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07032045000038"></a>On the last of these, why not? I once heard a prosecutor being told by a judge in a New York trial concerning a fraud about letters of credit that, with five defendants, he had 30 minutes to close the three-week trial to the jury. He dealt with the first defendant as follows. He explained in a about minute the man&#146;s defence, then looked at the jury and said, &#147;If any of you guys believe that, meet me after court because I am going to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge&#148;. He then moved on to the second defendant.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="07032045000039"></a>Are the Government really saying that the complexity and length of trials involving dishonesty mean that they are not capable of being judged by the ordinary folk of this country? Everybody knows dishonesty when they see it. The questions are not as complex and long as we claim they ought to be. It is a disgrace that any trial should take more than three months. That the six that we heard of took more than a year is unbelievable and unjustifiable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="07032045000040"></a>I looked up what our party&#146;s manifesto of 2005 said on this issue. It stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="07032045000065"></a>&#147;We will overhaul the laws on fraud&#148;&#151;</p>

<ul><a name="07032045000073"></a>&#147;and the way that fraud trials are conducted to update them for the 21st century and make them quicker and more effective&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032045000062"></a>I invite my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General to explain to us in his closing remarks how this Bill will make trials quicker and more effective; in other words, more intelligible and shorter. I have seen nothing in the Bill, nor heard anything said, that shows that objective being achieved in this legislative context.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07032045000041"></a>Even in this modernising 21st century, we should not forget the basics. There is nothing more basic than to sit in a court room and watch one citizen being judged by other citizens. It is absolutely essential. We do away with it at our peril, and we certainly do not do away with it without compelling evidence that it is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07032045000043"></a>As Solicitor-General in 1986, I supported the then Government&#146;s decision not to accept the recommendation of the majority of the Roskill committee that serious and complex fraud trials should be tried by a special fraud tribunal, consisting of a judge and a small number of a specially qualified lay members. I preferred to retain the jury system, and I still do. Perhaps it is right that I should begin by declaring that I have form.</p>

<a name="70320-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07032045000044"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, I propose to leave to others the well recognised and, to my mind, compelling virtues of jury trial. I would otherwise be only repeating and no doubt spoiling what many others have said in that regard. I shall make only a single point, which is that this state of conflict which today&#146;s debate has illustrated is no kind of background against which to introduce an important constitutional change, especially one which bears on our rights as citizens to be tried by our peers, and especially when so many innovations, sensibly and properly made by government and the judiciary in recent years, have yet to be proved and evaluated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07032045000045"></a>In 2003, as we have been reminded, this was recognised by Mr Blunkett, the then Home Secretary. He showed this by inserting a provision into his Criminal Justice Bill that the clause giving effect to his policies&#151;now Section 43&#151;could come into force only if it was approved by resolution of both Houses using the affirmative procedure. Today, I want to suggest that the background is even less propitious for the kind of change that Section 43 would make. That is because many innovations have been put in place, whose purposes are to improve the arrangements for serious and complex fraud trials&#151;indeed all serious and complex trials&#151;the full effects of which have not yet had time to materialise. For example, the Fraud Act 2006 has been in force only since January this year. We should insist that sufficient time is given.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07032045000046"></a>Let me instance further the protocol introduced by the then Lord Chief Justice, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, on 22 March 2005, just two years ago. We were reminded of that today so I can make the point quickly. However, incidentally, the date that that was handed down by the learned judge was the date on which the Jubilee Line case trial was terminated to general consternation. The trial judge accepted that a fair trial was not possible because there had been such delays and interruptions.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07032045000047"></a>The new protocol, the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, has said, is cited every day in the courts. In introducing it, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, said at the outset:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="07032045000066"></a>&#147;Hitherto, a lack of case management has contributed to problems across the whole criminal justice system. Nowhere is this more evident than in the case of heavy fraud and other complex cases.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032045000048"></a>Stating that it was designed primarily for jury trials, the noble and learned Lord said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="07032045000067"></a>&#147;It will ensure&#148;&#151;</p>

<ul><a name="07032045000074"></a>&#147;that trials are conducted in a way that will enable juries to retain and assess the evidence which they have heard. The need for this is obvious.&#148;</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07032045000050"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, said that it was implicit in the protocol that trials of six months are not capable of satisfactory disposal save in exceptional circumstances, a point already made by the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan. He said that generally they ought not to be permitted to exceed three months and, to achieve that, the roles of the lead advocates for the prosecution and the defence team were clearly identified in the protocol. By reason of these and other directions on case management, enough time must now be given to see how they affect matters. We have been told that first indications are encouraging.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07032045000051"></a>As I have indicated, recent innovations do not stop there. Faced with the d&#233;b&#226;cle of the Jubilee Line, the Attorney-General sensibly commissioned an independent report from the Chief Inspector of the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, Mr. Stephen Wooler. When this was published in June 2006, it was accorded much acclaim. Mr. Wooler wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="07032045000068"></a>&#147;Although the termination of the case was the direct result of its length, that in turn was attributable to a number of factors, some of which were clearly avoidable. In addition, the case was formulated in a manner which greatly added to its length and complexity.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032045000052"></a>Crucially, for today&#146;s debate, he added:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="07032045000069"></a>&#147;Its circumstances were in reality so unusual that it cannot be relied on to support either position in that debate&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032045000053"></a>He was referring to the debate about the suitability of juries to try fraud cases and, in particular, the proposal to implement Section 43.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07032045000054"></a>In an Oral Statement made to this House on the day of publication, 27 June 2006&#151;reported at cols. 1096 to 1099 of the <I>Official Report</I>&#151;the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General made it clear that he did not agree with that conclusion. He was at pains to explain, as he was entitled to do, that in 2003 he had agreed with the DPP a new approach to the management of serious and complex cases so as to enable greater

Moreover, he said that the director had established a new system of case management panels&#151;in operation only since September 2005&#151;which were already demonstrating their worth by strengthening the presentation of cases, identifying any potential weaknesses and, in some cases, shortening the predicted trial lengths.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="07032045000070"></a>&#147;These developments, combined with revised disclosure protocols and my own revised guidelines to prosecutors on disclosure, combine to make a very different system from that which was in operation during the Jubilee Line trial&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 27/6/06; col. 1099.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07032061000005"></a>The Bill&#146;s first flaw is that it approaches only one tiny area of the criminal law. Fraud does not have a monopoly of complexity. A very short case, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, pointed out, may involve technical or scientific issues or a sheer bulk of evidence, which are difficult to convey to a layman and, very often, to a lawyer. Fraud does not have a monopoly on length.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07032061000006"></a>Cases with a large number of defendants, in particular where there are many witnesses for the prosecution and perhaps many for the defence, may involve relatively straightforward facts&#151;in other words, who did what to whom during an affray? However, they still take a very long time to try and do impose the burdens, about which we have heard, on jurors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07032061000007"></a>Fraud does not have a monopoly on long trials or on causing inconvenience. All jury trials, especially long ones, cause inconvenience to jurors, even when they have been given a reliable estimate of length at the outset and when, on occasions, those estimates are inaccurate because of unforeseen delays. In those cases, the inconvenience is magnified.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07032061000008"></a>There are problems with all long jury cases; yet the Bill makes no attempt to tackle the real problems to which, I believe, there are real solutions. Instead, it simply sacrifices the principal cornerstone of our criminal justice system: that serious crime is tried by ordinary men and women sitting as a jury. I believe it makes that sacrifice for no good reason.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07032061000009"></a>Jury trial matters. It is one of the main reasons why our criminal justice system is still the most respected in the world. Justice is done in public. Our criminal law is not just the province of lawyers, but in every criminal trial, the law is interpreted in a practical way by 12 lay people&#151;they are usually lay people&#151;in a way that, through their verdicts, sets public standards of morality and honesty that reflect the changes in society. Juries are largely incorruptible and, most importantly, as others have said, they command public confidence as no individual can, however distinguished a lawyer he or she may be. What is more, juries get it right more often than any other system.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07032061000010"></a>When the Labour Party came to Government in 1997, I never thought that just 10 years later I would be saying to a Labour Attorney-General, trust the people. Jury trial and its continuation for all serious allegations of crime is not just of historic importance and is not just of importance to woolly liberals who have been dismissed by recent Home Secretaries; but, apart from throwing away 700 years, it is, or it should be, of importance to anyone and everyone who cares that those who commit crimes are convicted and those wrongly accused are not.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07032061000011"></a>What are we really talking about? What is the justification for the measure that is before the House? It does not follow the recommendations of either Lord Roskill or Lord Justice Auld in its detail. We all recognise there is a problem; not only does it affect juries but also defendants, their relatives, the judges who have to sum up at the end, witnesses, police officers and even lawyers. However, the problems are not faced by the Bill. Somewhere in the Chamber is an elephant which my noble and learned friend refuses to confront: the suggestion that juries cannot understand difficult cases. It would not be possible for the noble and learned Lord to say that juries cannot understand complex fraud, so he does not do so. However, it is implicit in the wording of the notes to the Bill that I picked up from the Printed Paper Office in this House. That suggests that complexity makes a trial too burdensome for ordinary men and women.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07032061000012"></a>Fraud is about dishonesty. Time and again, a jury of 12 people has shown that it can tell what is dishonest; what is more, our criminal law defines &#147;dishonesty&#148; by the standards of ordinary men and women. Therefore, it is ordinary men and women, not professional lawyers, accountants or experts, who should make that decision in the courtroom. If there is any real evidence that juries are bamboozled into

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07032061000013"></a>It is said that it is easy enough to prosecute what is sometimes called blue-collar fraud but not white-collar fraud and, therefore, sometimes people who commit more complex fraud get away with it. Surely, the solution to that cannot be to create a two-tier justice system with different modes of trial for each of them. That is a mad logic and cannot lie with equality before the law.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07032061000014"></a>From my reading of the debates in another place, I had not understood that it was suggested on behalfof the Government that cases tried by a judge alone will either cost less or be any quicker. I had not understood that until I heard my noble and learned friend today suggesting that they might be quicker because a judge would be able to go away and read the evidence. Is it suggested that these new-style fraud trials are to take place away from public scrutiny? A cardinal principle of our criminal trials is that evidence is presented in open court for all to see and hear rather than a judge reading papers in his room and then emerging to give a ruling. Where is the evidence that this measure will cost either a penny less or save any time whatever?</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07032061000015"></a>Nor is it suggested that conviction rates, which are already higher than average according to the Serious Fraud Office statistics, will necessarily rise. To confront the problem, which we all recognise, we need something to which speaker after speaker has referred: a concerted effort that has already begun to deal with how long cases like these, whether fraud or terrorism or whatever, are presented before a jury.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07032061000016"></a>I agree with what my noble friend Lord Brennan said; I do not see why any trial should last more than three months. Most trials should have no more than three people in the dock and, looking at the protocol, produced by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, two years ago, at the Fraud Act, which was produced last year, and at the proposals of the Criminal Bar Association, there are many ways in which case management could be vastly improved. Judges perhaps have been too timid about intervening.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07032061000017"></a>Not that long ago, I had a case in front of a judge who was far from timid. The case was likely to last some time and involved very young witnesses. We were told that no subject could be raised by more than one counsel in cross-examination&#151;in other words, one counsel dealt with a topic and that was the end of it&#151;and that no one was to cross-examine for more than half an hour. We got our act together and we did it. It was not unlike this House. At Second Reading, speeches are not time-limited and we speak for longer, but if we are given a fixed time we usually stick to it. That could be done in courts up and down the land, with proper timetabling and a robust approach to case management. That would render the whole of this exercise, the whole of what my noble and learned friend has done, unnecessary.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07032061000018"></a>The handling of jury trials and of jurors has improved greatly, but there is a huge amount to be done and a willingness to do it. I am very sad that instead of

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07032061000019"></a>We do not need a measure that masquerades as a modest little proposal, designed to deal with only a very few cases each year, but which, in reality, sticksa knife into the main artery of our criminal justice system; that is the principle that all serious crime should be tried by a jury of ordinary men and women. We now need to tackle those two problems: how we present complex issues and how we can reduce the time for which everyone involved in a case has to be present. That can be done.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07032061000020"></a>I am troubled by my noble and learned friend&#146;s remark that there are no plans to extend this provision to other areas. I am afraid that that givesme no confidence, because we have heard those assurances before. On criminal justice issues, often government plans appear to have been made at very short notice in response to that day's newspaper headlines. In another place, Mr Quentin Davies reminded the House of what Blackstone had written in his commentaries 200 years ago. I apologise for doing the same, but those words are so apposite to today's debate that they are worthy of note. He said,</p>
<ul><a name="07032061000066"></a>&#147;let it be again remembered, that delays, and little inconveniences in the forms of justice, are the price that all free nations must pay for their liberty in more substantial matters; that these inroads upon this sacred bulwark of the nation are fundamentally opposite to the spirit of our constitution; and that, though begun in trifles, the precedent may gradually increase and spread, to the utter disuse of juries in questions of the most momentous concern&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032061000060"></a>That must not be allowed to happen. I regret that I shall be unable to support my noble and learned friend in the Division Lobby tonight.</p>

We are dealing with one of our historic rights and liberties. The noble Lord, Lord Brennan, could not have put it better when he pointed out that every citizen has both the right to be tried by jury and the duty to sit on a jury. That, as the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, said, was drawn to our attention by Blackstone 200 years ago and reinforced by Lord Devlin, who has been rightly quoted.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07032061000022"></a>Juries are exceptionally well fitted to try questions of honesty and dishonesty. They have shown that in complex fraud cases just as much as in any other type of case. Although the Serious Fraud Office had a tricky time during my period as a law officer, I did my best to build it up and it has done remarkably well. I hope that the Government are not going to dismantle it. About eight or nine cases were described as having collapsed during those years, and I have made it my business to look into every single one of them to find out why they went wrong. The problem was neverthe jury; it was always either problems with the presentation of the case by the prosecution or difficulties that the judge&#151;and one often had great sympathy with the judge&#151;had in seeking to analyse  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1183"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1183</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and sum up the case for the jury. It is now proposed that the duty of trying the key issue of honesty or dishonesty be removed from the jury and put as an extra burden on to the judge.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07032061000023"></a>Although I have a practising certificate, I do not practise and am not formally declaring an interest in fraud cases; but over a long career I have had the opportunity to discuss this with many very experienced fraud judges, the great majority of whom would much prefer to analyse the case for the jury in the summing-up and leave the question of fact to the jury. One of the great strengths of the system is that the jury&#146;s decision commands huge&#151;I would almost say complete&#151;public confidence. It is one of the absolute mainstays of our liberties in that respect. To ask the judge to carry out all those duties and present it in a written judgment is a formidable burden. Noble Lords have been absolutely right in saying that it will not reduce costs and it is unlikely to shorten cases, particularly if, as the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General said, it will bring in many more charges.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07032061000024"></a>There is a point in being able to bring the full ramifications, or a sufficient number of them, to present the overall dishonesty. I know that that matter has quite rightly concerned the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice, with whom I have had the privilege of discussing these matters, but I could not properly go further than to say that. The Government have rightly addressed that serious point. Taking that into account, I am quite certain that one should always focus, if possible, on the main charges only. If you can convict on the main charges there is no point in overburdening the case with a lot of charges, particularly in relation to the smaller fry. As noble Lords have pointed out, juries have shown themselves well capable of distinguishing between the real architects of the fraud and the lesser individuals. They have very often rightly acquitted the lesser individuals while convicting the main architects of the fraud.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07032061000025"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General said that the average conviction rate over the past five years was 61 per cent. In my day, I looked at that figure and at the proportion of cases in which Mr Big was convicted, which was significantly higher than the overall average conviction rate. I can tell the House with absolute confidence that juries have no hesitation in convicting fraudsters if they are satisfied that their guilt is proved.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07032061000026"></a>For this reason I believe that the Government are going down the wrong course in this Bill. The criticism that it might be the thin edge of the wedge cannot be ignored. It has to be remembered that this is the fourth or fifth attack on the jury system brought forward by this Government in the past 10 years, starting with very small cases, on the basis that they were only very little&#151;I think that that is the Victorian cartoon about a baby&#151;and now in serious and complex fraud cases, on the basis supposedly that there are only a very small number of them and that that is where it will stop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07032061000027"></a>Anyone who has been a Minister knows what the words &#147;The Government have no plans to do so&#148; mean. It means that it is not part of their current proposals for the coming Session; it does not mean

I will say no more about that. The criticism of the idea that the Parliament Acts might be used is vulnerable on several grounds. First, as has rightly been said by almost all noble Lords, this is a huge, historic constitutional issue in which the Parliament Acts should never be used, except in extremis. The manifesto does not say &#147;we propose to abolish trial by jury in any circumstance&#148;. As the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, indicated, the words used have already been put into effect and the new protocols should be given time to work. I believe they will work. The mood for more efficient prosecution of fraud and complex cases has been growing over the past 10 to 15 years and will continue to do so. The counter act to a use of the Parliament Acts might be repealed by some future Government coming in, but I do not think we want to get into that kind of ding-dong. Let us draw back and think carefully now. Let us allow the present protocols to work.</p>

<a name="70320-0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07032061000028"></a>I will finish on the burdensomeness of the duties on the jury. Although I take an entirely different view on this matter from, the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, he did the House a service by pointing out that can be very burdensome to sit on a jury. That is the defence of our liberties. Blackstone, as quoted by the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, reminded us of that. We are all conscious in this House, and our children and grandchildren will look back at it further, that in defence of our liberties our parents fought the Second World War and our grandparents went through the ordeals of the First World War. How does sitting on a jury compare with that in the defence of our liberties? What do the jurors think in any event? It is not the length of time that they resent; it is when a case collapses, when they perhaps are fully on top of it and the opportunity to do justice is taken from them through no fault of their own. Let us continue with our present system.</p>

I am therefore seriously concerned about the problem. However, I do not see anything in the Billto suggest that my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General is engaging in a general, or even significant, attack on jury trials. To hear the rising rhetoric of some speakers in this debate, one would imagine that this is a full-frontal attack on every civil libertythat has existed for the past 700 years. I do not see it that way, nor do I believe that jury trials are a pre-requisite for justice to be dispensed. Day by day across the UK,

As the Solicitor-General, Mike O&#146;Brien, said at Second Reading in the House of Commons:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="07032061000064"></a>&#147;Every day, in criminal courts across the country, people elect in either-way cases to allow district judges&#151;judges sitting alone&#151;to decide guilt or innocence in trials ... Someone who gets arrested for benefit fraud and charged with a deception can be tried by a judge sitting alone, so it surely cannot be said that a senior judge sitting alone could not do justice in the case of someone arrested for a serious white collar crime&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 26/11/06; col. 1097.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032061000061"></a>I listened with interest to the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, waxing eloquent about our freedoms and liberties, which he equated with jury trials. I do not believe that he enjoys an unfettered right to them north of the Border, but are we going to conclude from that that people north of the Border have lost all their liberties and do not enjoy any of the freedoms we have? Of course we are not. It is a preposterous notion.</p>

<a name="70320-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07032061000031"></a>Anyone can complain about all sorts of things, but nobody can properly complain about the length of the consultation process in relation to trial without juries in cases such as these. If there were to be any complaint, one could say that the consultation process, which has taken place over two decades, has, if anything, been far too lengthy. We heard about Lord Roskill&#146;s fraud trials committee. It recommended that complex trials be held before special fraud tribunals made up of a judge and specially qualified lay people rather than before a jury. I understand that the 1998 consultation paper, <I>Juries in Serious Fraud Trials</I>, elicited a majority response favouring replacing juries in serious and complex fraud trials. We have heard several times that, in 2001, Lord Justice Auld reviewed criminal courts in England and Wales. He reported on the benefits of trial by a single judge and concluded in favour of a tribunal comprised of a judge and people with business and financial experience. The Government held a general consultation on the Auld report. When they published their White Paper, <I>Justice for All</I>, in 2001, they decided in favour of trials by judges alone. In the special circumstances of the very small number of long, complex and serious fraud cases each year, I am persuaded of the merit of trial without a jury. However, I can see merit in a judge being assisted by perhaps two assessors with business and financial experience. If my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General is really set against that, I hope we will hear his arguments in his reply so that we can examine his reasoning fairly closely.</p>

<a name="70320-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07032061000032"></a>The facts are clear. There were some 28,000 contested jury trials in 2005 and about 30,000 last year yet, during the debate in the House of Commons, Mike O&#146;Brien, the Solicitor-General, replied with great clarity to a question from Mr Dominic Grieve about how many cases were affected by the provisions of the Bill. He said:</p>
<ul><a name="07032061000067"></a>&#147;our estimate is that the number will be between half a dozen&#151;that is the more likely figure&#151;and 15 to 20 cases&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 29/11/07; col. 1090.].</ul>
<a name="70320-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07032061000033"></a>I believe that justice is well served by this modest measure. Considering the size of the problem, it is perhaps too modest. My noble and learned friend quoted what Lord Justice Auld said in his report and

If I had to pick two of the most compelling factors in favour of reform, I would settle on the burdensome length of trials and the increasing speciality and complexity of the cases with which jurors, who are largely or wholly strangers to the subject matter, are expected to cope. They both put justice at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07032061000034"></a>Particularly in the light of last week&#146;s votes in favour of an appointed House, I caution this House against the amendment moved by the Opposition. For an appointed House that claims to recognise the primacy of the House of Commons to deny the Bill a Second Reading is to play with fire. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 has been passed. Section 43 of that Act, which requires an affirmative resolution, allows serious and complex fraud cases to be tried without a jury in closely defined circumstances. If this Bill were enacted in response to demands from the Opposition, the Government could implement Section 43, as amended, without the need for further parliamentary proceedings. The Bill received a Second Reading in the Commons by a substantial majority. On Report, the Government secured substantial majorities. The Bill was read a third time. To defy the Commons by denying the Bill a Second Reading and a Committee in which amendments can be discussed is dangerous in the light of our vote on composition. I remind the House that the report of the Joint Committee on Conventions was approved by both Houses. I shall quote three short sentences from its conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="07032061000065"></a>&#147;We do not recommend any attempt to define a manifesto Bill ... We recommend that in future the Convention be described as the Government Bill Convention&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032061000062"></a>and, very significantly&#151;</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="07032061000068"></a>&#147;In addition the evidence points to the emergence in recent years of a practice that the House of Lords will usually give a Second Reading to any government Bill, whether based on the manifesto or not&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032061000063"></a>This House and the other place approved that report on conventions as the basis of a common understanding about how we go forward in relation to reform of your Lordships&#146; House. If we were serious in the vote last week, we take the step of voting against a Second Reading at our peril.</p>

However, I have had great experience of using the jury system in fraud cases, and it might be helpful to have some practical experience of what that has meant. Over the past 25 years, I have been the chairman of11 public companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="07032061000036"></a>At the time that they came into my hands, those11 companies had been recording aggregate shareholder fund losses of just on &#163;2 billion, despite the aggregate value of the frauds against them probably coming out at only half a billion pounds. The emphasis of this is that frauds of this nature are frauds against a whole community. The community affected is not only the people who work in the companies and the shareholders and pension funds around them, but also the traders who are creditors awaiting payment and who will

Therefore, it is right that a jury should effectively speak for a community, with the voice of a community, which is what it does. To take the trial into another city, into the hands of a single, detached judge does not give the community the opportunity to assess and, as appropriate, judge what has taken place.</p>

<a name="70320-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07032061000037"></a>Of the 11 public companies that I have had in my hands, we took fraud proceedings against the chairmen of four&#151;chairmen who had immediately preceded me. Every one of them was judged guilty by a jury and received a significant custodial sentence. There would have been a fifth charge but the individual concerned died before the charges could be brought. He thereby had presumably opted for trial by a single judge in a higher court. I am sure that he got justice there as he would have done in the jury system here.</p>

<a name="70320-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="07032061000038"></a>I am a very satisfied customer of the jury system. On arriving in your Lordships&#146; House eight months ago I was delighted to find an old friend of mine in the noble Lord, Lord Dear, who was the Chief Constable of West Midlands when I was heavily engaged in that territory. Without doubt, the noble Lord, Lord Dear, ran the best fraud investigation unit that I have ever seen. There are lessons in how he was doing it to which the Home Office should listen, and either prompt him to run a training course for all the other constabularies around the country or get him to write the definitive textbook on the subject. He was absolutely outstanding.</p>

<a name="70320-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07032061000039"></a>It is worth considering what he did that made life so much easier for the juries. His CID team would never take a case on for investigation unless you could prove to the team, as though you were the investigating officers, that there was a fraud. Effectively, you had to go through a mock trial and prove it. Once the team had got into the deal and had taken it on board, it was the only constabulary I ever knew that produced a data room on every bit of evidence that came up. It was the pioneers in doing that electronically. The data could be available to the counsel when the case was being prepared for court. That was a missive simplification of the process. That meant that it could also bring in the legal team that would run the prosecution a great deal earlier than would normally be the case. In this way, we managed get through some extraordinarily complex cases.</p>

<a name="70320-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07032061000040"></a>I remember we had one where the chairman of the company concerned had devised 52 different methods of removing money from a company in one year. This was very complicated. We managed to get completely separate data to show all the various methods. When the case went to court, the prosecution started not at the biggest end&#151;the &#163;600,000 single take&#151;but on a single &#163;700 item. The evidence was incontrovertible. The chairman had written to a lady saying, &#147;You give me an invoice for &#163;700, I&#146;ll send you a cheque for &#163;700, you give me &#163;500 back and you can keep the other &#163;200&#148;. On that straightforward matter the jury started off knowing the exact nature of what it was dealing with. Thereon, the prosecuting counsel was able to build up all 52 cases, right up to the &#163;1.2 million which had gone missing. At that time, the West Midlands approach was very advanced. I do not know how many others do it today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07032061000041"></a>I would like to illustrate the nature of the juries that we dealt with in those days. One of the cases turned out to be the longest continuous trial in British criminal history. By continuous trial, I mean it sat every working day for 16 months. It was in Wolverhampton Crown Court, ending in April 1993 with a conviction. The judge in that case complained about the deliberate attempts of the defending counsel to confuse the court and the defending counsel was subsequently suspended from practising. The jury still managed to get through the case every day and follow it.</p>

<a name="70320-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07032061000042"></a>Each of those cases had a majority of ladies on the jury. I am a great supporter of housewives as jurors. They are absolutely wonderful. We overlook certain factors about them. I hope that the Government are not implying a lack of confidence in the British housewife as a juror because I think that she is excellent. It would be a gratuitous insult to that fine body of women if the Government meant that. Many of them are highly qualified in their own right; they have frequently worked as analysts or secretaries with the boards of companies which have had troubles. They know where bodies get buried in boardrooms and are expert in knowing where to look and what questions to ask.</p>

<a name="70320-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07032061000043"></a>I have doubts about jurors who have not had the experience of working in industry. If they are 20 or21 years old and have never worked, have come straight from university or whatever, there is a problem. They lack the experience and understanding of what goes on and how business is run. I would exclude them if there could be a positive discrimination against them.</p>

<a name="70320-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07032061000044"></a>The point was made earlier about the difficulty in getting senior businessmen to be available for big trials. I do not think we want them. In the main, they come from the same community as the people who are being tried and have moved in the same circles, but they are not necessarily the right people to act for that community. Therefore they are not desirable jurors. Give me a jury of 12 housewives and I would be delighted.</p>

<a name="70320-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07032061000045"></a>I am familiar with the arguments against the jury, but it is the guarantee of trial by a community of a crime against a community. There is no reason whatever to disrupt that well tried process. There are certain things which could and should be done for the future to make jury trial more effective. We should follow the wonderful example of Southwark Crown Court which has got the most definitive fraud-compatible courtroom anywhere in the country. It has a most accessible database which can be distributed to every member of the jury simultaneously. That is a wonderful facility and we need more of them up and down the country, please. Some consideration should be given to positive discrimination to exclude youths who have not worked, and we should not worry about an imbalance of too many women on a jury because it would work well. In particular, the jury system in this country should not lead us to worry about the time it takes to get a case heard. We have had talk about three months as a maximum. I have never had sucha case running for less than six months, and wehave never failed in getting everybody&#146;s clear understanding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07032061000046"></a>The most impressive act I ever saw was the only jury acquittal I ever had. That is the last issue I will deal with. I suspect that this acquittal would not have happened if a judge had been sitting in isolation. In the extremely complex case, we had a very dominant, bully-boy chairman. He had a finance director working for him who thought that the chairman was God Almighty, and he would do anything for him. The finance director was a sad case; his wife had left him, his mother was dying and he was her only support. He had nothing in his life other than the joy of going to work each day and doing whatever his beloved chairman told him to do. What he told him to do was steal &#163;1 million for him. I did not want that finance director put into court. The noble Lord, Lord Dear, and his colleagues, on the only occasion that we ever had serious disagreement, put him up on a charge. I thought that this was going to be terrible; they are going to send him down, he is going to die and it is wrong. He had not taken any money, he had no inflated salary and it would not have been just. The jury convicted the chairman and acquitted the finance director. Had that gone before a judge in isolation, I suspect that they would have had to convict the finance director as well. He might only have got a suspended sentence, but there would not have been the humanity and the insight that the jury was prepared to bring. It was a remarkable case.</p>

I must confess that I am somewhat mystified by some of the arguments that run along those lines. Like my noble friend Lord Rosser, I note that the British legal system considers very many crimes to be best tried without a jury. It was not so long ago that a drink-driving charge could be tried by jury until it was decided, under a Conservative Government, that that was impractical. Let us take the case of a man getting drunk, taking a car without consent and assaulting the police officer who apprehends him. Parliament has now agreed that the serious offences involved&#151;taking a vehicle without the owner&#146;s consent, assaulting a police officer and drink-driving&#151;are ones that only magistrates can try. I do not hear calls to return such cases to jury trials, so I assume that we believe that justice is being served.</p>

<a name="70320-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07032061000049"></a>We often hear that the Crown Court is generally reserved for more serious cases, and we reserve jury trial for those cases. I am sure that many here would rather be defrauded than assaulted, so I am not sure on what basis we decide that fraud is more serious than theft and assault. Rather than being serious, fraud is a more complex and difficult charge to pursue and prosecute, and it cannot be dealt with in the same  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1190"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1190</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>way as common assault. Fraud requires forensic treatment and expensive lawyers, and both are best found in the Crown Courts.</p>

<a name="70320-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="07032061000050"></a>Parliament has long had the power to change the categories of offences which are subject to jury trial, and, as life and society change, it makes changes when they are needed to improve the likelihood of justice being achieved. I believe that that deals with the &#147;slippery slope&#148; argument. Can my noble and learned friend say whether I am right in asserting that a whole raft of offences which were previously subject to trial by jury are no longer so?</p>

<a name="70320-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07032061000051"></a>I take pride in speaking not as a lawyer but as near as possible as a member of the public. I sense that the public are not convinced that in serious fraud cases the guilty are always convicted and the innocent freed. Rather like my noble friend Lady Mallalieu, I believe that in general the public have confidence in juries but not always. For example, if comedians are prosecuted for tax frauds, I believe they stand a better chance of getting off in Liverpool than they do in Birmingham. I can give many other examples where, from time to time, juries have reached perverse decisions and judgments. In fraud cases, I observe as a member of the public that the minnows seem to get caught, but I perceive that an abnormally high number of serious fraud cases fail, and I believe that there is public concern about that.</p>

<a name="70320-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07032061000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, asserts that his party is not soft on fraud trials. However, a problem in dealing with fraud trials was identified as long as 22 years ago, when his party was in power and turned its attention to the matter. I think that most speakers today have accepted that there is still an unresolved problem and I have heard a range of options advanced as solutions. Many involve saying, &#147;Let&#146;s just wait a little bit longer until we see how that works as time passes&#148;, or, &#147;Let&#146;s wait a bit longer for another piece of legislation to work its way through&#148;. If we were to move on not 22 years but 24, 26 or even 28, I suspect that most people in this House would be prepared to let the issue run along those lines. However, I do not believe that, if the public were tested, they would be willing to go along with that. They sense that something is wrong and that it needs to be put right. Given the way in which the Government have presented their case and have been turned back on several occasions, I do not think that our Front Bench is being soft on serious fraud cases; it has put forward a pretty compelling argument for change in respect of juries and I believe that the public will support it.</p>

<a name="70320-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07032061000053"></a>It seems to me that the major issue is not the length of the trial nor, indeed, the ability of some juries to cope with the issues put before them; it is that the full criminality of fraud is not exposed because of the complexity of cases these days and the inability to present the facts to juries clearly and concisely. That was a strong point advanced by my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General, but&#151;I was listening carefully&#151;I did not hear the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, respond to it convincingly. Perhaps I am being unfair but I should be grateful if the noble Lord would return to that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07032061000059"></a>My noble friend referred to the debate last week and mentioned the possible consequences of the Opposition, supported by the Liberal Democrats, moving their amendment and the way that that would be perceived by the Commons. He warned that in due course it could have an adverse effect for this House. I come from an entirely different angle. My noble friend is in favour of a fully appointed House; I am in favour of an elected one. Last week, I argued that this House already has substantial powers&#151;powers of such enormity that, in my opinion, from time to time they should be subject to the consent of the people through elections. I believe that the debate today completely bears out that argument. A totally unelected, appointed House is flying in the face of what the elected Members in the other place perceive to be the correct way forward. We should think long and hard before we decide to wreck, in the way that is being proposed, legislation that has gone through the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07032072000005"></a>That was the summing-up of the Honourable Justice Brook in a capital case of murder in the Port of Spain Assizes in Trinidad last year. It illustrates better than I can think the way in which we should be proud of how we have exported all over the world the concept of a democratic jury to determine guilt or innocence in serious criminal cases. Nothing could have been more burdensome for the jury than that case, which ended with the judge saying to the defendant in sentencing him:</p>

The trial of one of our number, the noble Lord, Lord Black of Crossharbour, is about to start in Chicago. It is said that there are 2 million documents. It is a trial with a jury and it is estimated that it will take four months. That gives you some idea of how, with a proper approach, a trial can be confined.</p>

It found the two former chief executives guilty of fraud and conspiracy. After the guilty verdict the jury gave a press conference, which is a good example of transparency, which we do not have in this country. It is interesting to see how representative the jury was. To hear the arguments advanced, sometimes you would think that the jury comes from the most unemployed people in our society. In this case, a payroll manager, Carolyn Kuchera, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="07032072000186"></a>&#147;We were responsible. We were always accountable. We had to find a way to circle back and tie up loose ends. And I think those [Enron] employees were entitled to the same thing&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07032072000169"></a>The jury forewoman, Deborah Smith, who works in human resources at an oil services company, said that the jurors came with a variety of life experiences but a mutually high level of endurance. The issue at the end was simple: dishonesty or not. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="07032072000187"></a>&#147;It&#146;s hard to believe that the defendant, such a hands-on individual, could not possibly know the things that were going on in the company&#148;.</p>

It may be that that is where this is all coming from. He called for early plea bargains and the removal of juries. The head of the Serious Fraud Office said that. Well he would, wouldn't he? However, the report&#151;referred to by many of your Lordships&#151;from the Chief Inspector of the CPS Inspectorate, Mr Stephen Wooler, who investigated the collapsed trial, stated:</p>

I want to make it very clear that it is not our claim that juries are incapable of understanding complex fraud cases&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>Commons, 29/11/06; col.1098.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032072000173"></a>That is an answer to some noble Lords on the Benches opposite.</p>

<a name="70320-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07032072000010"></a>What is &#147;burdensome&#148;, to use the word from the Act? What is burdensome to the jury? It is now said that the length of such trials represents,</p>
<ul><a name="07032072000204"></a>&#147;an unreasonable intrusion on jurors' personal lives&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032072000174"></a>The complexities of the case will place a burden on ordinary members of the public. Your Lordships will recall that the Jubilee Line case lasted some two years. In the Wooler report, the jurors said that they were &#147;pleased&#148; to serve for nearly two years and that they took their task seriously and were committed to jury service. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, said, they were incensed that the case had been stopped before they could come to their conclusions.</p>

<a name="70320-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07032072000011"></a>The argument, as many of your Lordships have said, of unreasonable intrusion on jurors' personal lives applies, of course, to any long trial, such as in cases of terrorism, where there will be much evidence of surveillance; trafficking in people or drugs; corruption; murder/manslaughter; or any conspiracy. There is nothing special about fraud, as the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, said, which makes it overlong. If the Bill goes through it will not be long before there will be pressure to try any case that is likely to last more than six weeks or three months by judge alone. Mention has already been made by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, of the fatal words:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="07032072000191"></a>&#147;The Government have no plans to extend the Bill at this stage&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70320-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07032072000012"></a>I remind the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, that no argument has been advanced that convictions will be more likely as a result of a transfer to a judge-alone trial. That is not the argument. That would be surprising because where there is a trial, 81 or 82 per cent of defendants are convicted, which is higher than in almost any other category of crime.</p>

<a name="70320-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07032072000013"></a>The Solicitor-General pointed out the advantages of trial by judge alone, as he saw it, in the Bill's passage through the Commons. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="07032072000192"></a>&#147;A judge can curtail lengthy speeches by ... windbag lawyers&#148;</p>

<p><a name="07032072000175"></a>to,</p>

<p><a name="07032072000176"></a>That was his first point. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, will allow me to remind her that I fancy that the Court of Appeal would have said, &#147;Just tell us your best point, Mr O&#146;Brien&#148;. Juries are not persuaded by wind; they are much more persuaded by the leader spoken of by the noble Lord,  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1194"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1194</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Brennan&#151;the one who is succinct and to the point. The &#147;windbag lawyers&#148; is just abuse with no foundation in fact&#151;not even in Birmingham. I see the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, here, so especially not in Birmingham, where Mr O&#146;Brien practises as a criminal solicitor&#151;or did so.</p>

<a name="70320-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07032072000014"></a>The second point is that there will be much less need for cases to be severed or for sample charges. Justice can be done by exposing the whole criminality of the case in a single trial. We have heard that argument advanced by the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General today as well. That is the great error of assuming that by lumping together all the charges that you can think of, putting in all the evidence, adding as many defendants as you can, there will be a greater degree of justice. Nothing could be further from the truth, as any practitioner will tell you. The whole point is to simplify, pare down, make clear exactly why, if you are prosecuting, you want a person convicted. It is only right that when someone goes to prison as a result of having been convicted of a crime, the argument has been advanced in such a simple and clear way that the public understand it. We do not want a system where so much is thrown in front of a judge that no one can understand whyX has gone to prison for three years. There must be clarity.</p>

<a name="70320-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07032072000015"></a>Indeed, in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, the Government introducedthe trial of sample counts by a jury. As far as I know, that has not been implemented. If there is no simplification, no cutting down on documents and no paring of the issues, prosecution cases will be less well prepared and less concise, and trials will be longer. The only ones to gain, as usual, will be the lawyers with high fees.</p>

<a name="70320-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07032072000016"></a>Mr O&#146;Brien&#146;s third point was that a reasoned judgment will demonstrate that all procedures have been followed. The American solution is to allow the jury to hold a press conference, as I have already pointed out. I have some experience of these reasoned judgments from the district court in Hong Kong, where a judge sits on his own in fraud cases. I echo the noble Lord, Lord Carlile. Do not think that a reasoned judgment will result in greater acceptance of a verdict of guilty by the defendant or will lead to fewer appeals. As the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, said, every case is likely to be appealed. The virtue of the jury verdict is that it is conclusive. There is no partial blame; you are either guilty or not guilty. Every verdict, wherever it is given, in any court in the country, carries the same weight. It is conclusive. You do not have to look at the small print to see why that verdict was arrived at.</p>

<a name="70320-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07032072000017"></a>What the Government propose is, in effect, a special court for white-collar crime, where the criminality of the defendant is tested not by a cross section of the public, but by a single white-collar judge. I think the noble Lord, Lord James, would be opposed to that. This is supported by lawyers in the Government, including the noble and learned Lord the Attorney General, whose lips would have curled, in practice, at the thought of appearing in a criminal court before a jury. They are happy to have commercial cases tried by

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07032072000018"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, is not in her place. I understand that she is in America to receive an honour for her work in human rights. I remember her comment to me when we were talking about our responsibility, as criminal lawyers, for people&#146;s lives, rather than cash. She said that it did not pay very well, but at least it was fun. The noble Baroness,Lady Kennedy, warned the House, when opposing Section 43 during the Committee stage of the Criminal Justice Bill, of undermining public confidence in the judicial system. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="07032072000193"></a>&#147;In some high-profile cases, there may be a public perception that the judge is a man brought in to do a job for the state&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 15/07/03; col. 780.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032072000019"></a>I have no hesitation in quoting her further. To my chagrin, I cannot better what she said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="07032072000194"></a>&#147;Juries keep the law honest and comprehensible because working with juries&#151;as those of us who work with juries know&#151;puts an obligation on all of us to explain the law and the rules and to apply the standards of the public to what is right and wrong. The jury stops the law becoming opaque. It stops the law becoming closed and sometimes even dishonest&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 15/07/03; col. 779.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032072000020"></a>I entirely agree with the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy.</p>

<a name="70320-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07032072000021"></a>This Bill should go no further. Mr Robert Wardle may think that it will make his task easier; he is wrong. We are threatened with the Parliament Act, but surely this is not as important to the Government as hunting, is it? I see no advantage in cost savings, the simplification of issues, greater transparency or&#151;above all&#151;fulfilling the aim of the criminal justice system, which is to protect the innocent and punish the guilty. This Bill should be thrown out.</p>

I am sorry that, at times in this debate, the same was not true of the opposing arguments. I absolve, if I may, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. Like the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, I would like to regard him as a friend. I understand his strong feelings in light of what happened in 2003, but I disagree with him entirely. It is now three and a half years since the Criminal Justice Act 2003 came to its conclusion.

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07032072000024"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, put her finger on two aspects of why this matters. I want to make the point that people participating in debates in this House should never say that they are sorry that they are not lawyers. I hope never to hear such an apology again. Many of us should, perhaps, make the opposite apology.</p>

If she will permit me, I draw attention to it because this is not a matter for lawyers, but for the public. That is why the second point made by the noble Baroness is so pertinent. She said&#151;and I believe her to be absolutely right&#151;that the public in this country are utterly disconcerted when they see serious crime not being dealt with and serious cases collapsing. The noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, may be right to say that in many parts of the world our justice system is admired. I wish that was true in all the cities in this country; it certainly is not. This is something we must look at very hard.</p>

<a name="70320-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07032072000027"></a>What arguments have been advanced the other way? The principal argument is that this is a generalised attack on the jury system. It is not. It is limited to a small category of cases. It is not the first time that Parliament has agreed that there are exceptional cases where jury trial should not be applied. This House agreed this in 2003 in relation to Section 44 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, with regard to jury intimidation. It accepted it in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, which, contrary to the knowledge of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, is in force. In 1988&#151;forgive me for mentioning it&#151;the government of the party opposite declassified or reclassified a number of offences so that they ceased to be offences capable of being tried by jury and became summary offences. Several noble Lords who have spoken were Ministers in that Government. From time to time it is appropriate to look at the merits of the argument and see whether that is right. As I said when I opened this debate, I fully recognise the huge advantages of jury trial, many of which have been referred to, but there are some exceptional cases in which the disadvantages outweigh those advantages.</p>

<a name="70320-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07032072000028"></a>What was the second argument put forward? There was the perhaps slightly curious argument that if it was justified to have a non-jury trial for serious, complex and long fraud cases, what about other complex and long cases? I do not think that those who made that point were inviting me to amend the Bill to extend it. That is the one thing that I do not want to do. But there is a difference, which has been referred to in this House before&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Marsh, drew attention to it in an earlier debate,  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1197"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1197</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and I am sorry that he is not in his place. There are serious and long trials in which the subject matter is well within the understanding and experience of those who hear it; but when you get into areas of great complexity about financial instruments, capital markets, split capital trusts and so forth, it becomes much more difficult for any of us to be able to judge those against the experiences that we have. If it is a case in which the question is&#151;and this was a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, who is I think not in his place&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07032072000031"></a>If you can point to the people in the dock and say, &#147;The money was once over there, but now it is in their pockets&#148;, I do not think that juries have much difficulty in seeing the dishonesty. Other cases are much more complex and difficult and problems and difficulties arise. I cannot remember which noble Lord asked this question, but we are certainly not saying that all cases that involve fraud fit within these procedures; absolutely not.</p>

<a name="70320-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07032072000032"></a>That takes me to a point that singularly, with respect, was not referred to by those noble Lords who responded to this Bill&#151;that is, the terms of the Criminal Justice Act that require a decision on whether the interests of justice require that a case should be tried by a judge alone.</p>

<a name="70320-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07032072000033"></a>The third point that was raised was that there are other measures that ought to deal with the problems that we have identified. I make it clear and have made it clear that I welcome those other measures and welcome the support expressed today for some additional measures, such as plea bargaining. I am not sure about press conferences by juries, but no doubt we shall hear the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, further on that at a later stage. Some of those measures are very valuable, but the question is whether they would solve all the problem cases. I have two responses. First, I do not believe from the empirical evidence that they will. Secondly, to the extent that we have improvements in trial process, those are all matters that can be taken into account by the judge and the Lord Chief Justice who makes the decision whether the mode of trial should be by judge alone or by judge and jury. So there is a built-in mechanism in the Bill to enable those measures to have effect&#151;and, if they do, no doubt a judge will say in the light of looking at a particular case that the interests of justice do not require that it should be dealt with by a judge alone, because it is possible to deal with it in this or that way.</p>

<a name="70320-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07032072000034"></a>That takes me on to an important point. Case management largely works one way. A judge can tell the prosecution, &#147;You&#146;re not bringing that evidence, that charge or those defendants&#148;. A judge cannot say to a defendant, &#147;You&#146;re not running this or that defence&#148;. So the way in which you cut cases down&#151;and this is  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1198"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1198</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the fundamental point about bringing the full criminality&#151;is by requiring a prosecution to cut down its case. I do not deny that; indeed, I encourage the prosecutors to look hard at cases to cut them down when appropriate. I go back to the passage that I quoted in opening from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, the Lord Chief Justice&#151;and I do not understand him to take a different view about this matter, despite the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew&#151;that justice is flawed if the nature of the tribunal&#146;s process means that cogent evidence cannot be put before it. There are examples where cases have not proceeded as a result of that. In the Maxwell trial, the trial judge said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="07032072000195"></a>&#147;The prosecution and most of the defence are agreed that, were it practicable, all the counts should be the subject matter of a single trial. All are agreed that the length and complexity of such a trial would far outstrip the capacity of any jury&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032072000177"></a>It was not dealt with in a single trial and, after the first trial came to an end, the second trial was stayed on the grounds that it would be an abuse of process to continue.</p>

<a name="70320-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07032072000178"></a>I do not say that juries cannot understand. What I said very clearly in opening was that for juries to understand you have to cut the case down, and it is in cutting the case down that in some cases means that the case is not presented as it ought to be.</p>

He therefore changed tack and decided to introduce primary legislation, knowing that one consequence of doing so&#151;if the House did not agree with the contents of that legislation&#151;would be Parliament Act procedures. His decision to do that had nothing whatever to do with any expressed desire by the Opposition of preferring primary legislation because, unlike an order, they could amend it.</p>

I had thought and hoped that we were here to look at the substance of the proposals. The fact is that a Motion was tabled, but not two or three months before the resolution came to the House. After it had been passed in another place, it became apparent that the resolution would not be accepted in this House&#151;I entirely agree and was perfectly open about that&#151;and a resolution was tabled, or was about to be, I believe by the noble Lord, making it clear that the Opposition wanted to debate this through the course of primary legislation. Indeed, they put down amendments to the Fraud Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07032072000043"></a>I had thought, from the fuss that there was about how much consultation there had been and the demands for Motions that the parties opposite wanted to discuss the possibility of changes. Yet that is not possible if this Bill is voted down today. I am sorry, but I find the explanation for taking that view and going against the conventions of this House extraordinary.</p>

First, that is not right because amendments were accepted following suggestions put forward by the Government. Secondly, if that is a new Opposition policy&#151;that if we are grumpy enough in the other place, amendments will not be tabled in this place&#151;I suspect that my noble friend the Chief Whip will be absolutely delighted.</p>

There is a simple logic behind tabling the amendment at Second Reading, as we have done today. If we went on to Committee, we would table &#147;do not stand part&#148; amendments to every single clause in the Bill. What is the point of doing that? Indeed, I wonder whether it would be procedurally acceptable if we sought to do it. The decision to amend the Second Reading flows ineluctably from the position that we would have taken in Committee.</p>

This Bill is not an attack on the jury system and repeating the contrary proposition, however often, does not make it true. It is ultimately about justice and about ensuring that those who are responsible for fraud on the grander scale can be called to account as effectually as those charged with more everyday offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07032072000049"></a>We want the sharks to be caught and not just the minnows, to take the analogy that was used behind me. Many distinguished people and senior judicial figures over the years have proposed non-jury trial as a solution to this particular problem&#151;and Parliament enacted it in 2003. Lord Justice Auld&#146;s dictum&#151;that our present position puts justice at risk&#151;has been referred to several times. That is the basis on which this Bill is put forward, and I commend this Bill to the House.</p>

First, in my submission the Government have not made out a case for the measure. From what the Government wish to do in procedures for fraud trials run by a single judge, we know that they will not be any shorter; indeed, it is highly likely that they will be longer. I do not think that that will give the public any more confidence in non-jury trial than they have in some of the existing trials. So, they will not be shorter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07032072000052"></a>Secondly, in the mind of the Government there is clearly no problem about complexity. The Solicitor-General, in another place, said in terms that the problem was not complexity but the length of time that the trial took and the burden which that placed on the jury. That may well be true; but that problem applies to all long and complicated trials, not just fraud trials, which is why some of your Lordships raise question marks about the underlying intentions of the Government with respect to jury trial. If the logic behind this measure is that long and complex trials are burdensome to juries, it is easily extended to all such trials. That may not be the intention of the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General but it is the logic of his argument.</p>

<a name="70320-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07032072000053"></a>It would be extremely easy for a future Government&#151;or, dare I say it, a future noble and learned Lord, a future Attorney-General&#151;to apply that logic to a whole other range of criminal trials. The noble and learned Lord shakes his head now, and I am sure that his intentions are sound; but the logic is clear.</p>

It is not just the length and complexity but the particular circumstances of serious, complex fraud cases that involve considerations, financial instruments and all the rest that is outside the normal ken of most of us that adds an element of complexity that is not present in other cases.</p>

<a name="70320-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07032072000056"></a>There is a wider dimension to this case, which is that we are not just talking about a procedure in the context of a particular offence. We are talking about jury trial in general. If there are two principles that infuse the liberties of the citizen, they are the principle of habeas corpus and the principle of jury trial. They are both under threat from this Government. Happily, we have managed to prevent the Government from extending the time in which someone can spend in detention without charge to 90 days; but I suspect that very soon we will have another battle on our hands.</p>

I am taking the Bill through this House because there is no mechanism for something which affects Parliament to be brought forward except through the Government. I confirm that this is not a government Bill, it is a parliamentary Bill. I recognise that this is an issue that has concerned the noble Lord, Lord Cope, and the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, who raised this when we discussed the Bill at Second Reading. There are different governance arrangements between the two Houses. Clause 2 provides that in exercising certain functions under the Bill, the Corporate Officer of the House of Lords may act only in accordance with recommendations made by the House Committee of the House of Lords and approved by this House. That is the way that we do business. The Corporate Officers are the Clerks of the two Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="07032072000072"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cope, suggested that the draft Bill should be amended to include the Floor of the House requirement. We were happy to agree that and the Bill was amended prior to its introduction. This amendment would require a decision on the Floor of the House in another place. It would be highly unusual for this House to amend a Bill in this way, given that it touches on a matter of internal House of Commons procedure. I hope, therefore, that having had the opportunity to raise the issue and my having explained that there are different governance arrangements between the two Houses, the noble Lord, Lord Cope, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="07032072000077"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment provides for an annual report. It stems from the idea that these joint departments are to be, in effect, self-standing joint subsidiaries of the two Houses. I think it would be wise to ensure that the affairs of such departments are not solely to be judged by being disentangled from the consolidated reports and accounts of the two Houses, but seen first separately as individual departments.</p>

The present drafting means that the report for the financial year ended 3l March 2007 need not be produced until 30 September 2008.

I added my name to it because it is a sensible way of addressing a point that came up at Second Reading. As my noble friend indicated, it anticipates the future if a joint department&#151;not just PICT but any future joint department&#151;is created. It is important that there is transparency and some reporting to each House and this would be one way of achieving that. I regard it as a necessary but not sufficient condition for informing the Houses about what a joint department is doing. One would assume that a department would want to disseminate material about what it is doing, keeping both Houses informed as a matter of course, but it is invaluable to have this on the record as part of the Bill itself. It would trigger some action on behalf of the joint department and serve as a reminder of the responsibility to both Houses. I therefore strongly support my noble friend&#146;s amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="07032072000083"></a>In terms of the practice envisaged here, the House of Commons Commission and the House Committee already publish annual reports. It is anticipated that the joint departments would include within those reports a report of their work. We do not need to legislate about an annual report, but in listening to what noble Lords have said about the importance of recognising that a joint department is somewhat different from other departments, I see no reason why we should not encourage the House Committee, for example, to ask the joint department to put a separate report on its work to the House Committee, which can then be available to Members of this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="07032072000089"></a>The noble Lord said: I now turn to a more significant point in some ways. It concerns what happens when there is a difference in the treatment of the staff from what would apply normally in the Home Civil Service. Under the Bill as it stands, when the requirements of both Houses make it necessary, the conditions of service of the staff can be varied and presumably will be varied to allow for the requirements of both Houses. But the Bill says &#147;both&#148; Houses. In some respects, the requirements of both Houses will be the same or similar, but in other respects they are different. If one House has different requirements, under the Bill as it stands, they cannot be accommodated. If the Bill were adjusted to say, as the amendment suggests, that the requirements of &#147;each&#148; House should to be accommodated, there would be less pressure for both Houses to go about their business in the same way and we would be freer to make our own arrangements.</p>

<a name="70320-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="07032072000090"></a>I will give an example. Take the hours of sitting. In your Lordships' House, we are much more flexible than another place these days in the hours of sitting and the way that we arrange our business. That is to our advantage. The Commons can predict its hours of sitting and voting with much greater precision than we can. Last night, for example, we sat on for an extra hour to finish off the Report stage of a Bill which had taken rather longer than had been expected.</p>

<a name="70320-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="07032072000091"></a>Of course that has an effect on the staff and their conditions of employment, which have to allow for it. We want to remain in charge of our arrangements of

It is most important that Peers can raise whatever points they wish on Bills, and the flexibility of our timetable is part of that. Yesterday, as frequently happens, the Government gave way on various points, no doubt because of the time pressure among other things; I would like to think that the arguments were persuasive, but the time pressure may have contributed to the decisions made. In another place, there is no need for the Government to give way at all these days. Permanent universal guillotines make that unnecessary. The conditions of the staff obviously reflect that difference in arrangements between the two Houses. If we were to be changed to a substantially or all-elected House, no doubt the timing arrangements for sittings might change too, because the pressures on Members would be the same at both ends of the Corridor&#151;but that is another matter. In any case, we should preserve the ability of each House to make the arrangements that suit them. The staff conditions should at any rate be able to be negotiated to accommodate that.</p>

<a name="70320-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="07032072000092"></a>This may not be so important in connection with the computer and IT staff but, as we know, the Bill can have a much wider effect. If it applies to some other departments, the issue could be particularly significant. I beg to move.</p>

If my memory serves me correctly, he made some reference to the matter on Second Reading. I assure him that the operation of PICT already takes account of the sitting hours of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07032072000094"></a>Clause 3(2)(b) relates to staff terms and conditions, and it is not anticipated that a joint department would require significantly different terms and conditions from those of either House. The matter will remain subject to consultation with staff representatives in connection with any joint department. As the noble Lord knows, a key purpose of the Bill is to protect staff rights&#151;that is precisely why we needed it&#151;and staff representatives have been assured of management&#146;s early intention to set up a Whitley committee structure for PICT.</p>

<a name="70320-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="07032072000095"></a>On the general issue of service levels and what might happen if the two Houses wanted different things, I do not think that we would get to the point of a lowest common denominator. For example, the two Houses have co-operated closely in relation to the IT strategy for a long time. Our House has made its own decisions about Members&#146; equipment and the levels of support required. If there are proposals for future joint departments, they will have to come to the Floor of the House, so I do not anticipate that we would agree anything that would mean that our House would not be in a position to make our service needs clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="07032072000107"></a>There has been considerable news coverage of Age Concern's Hungry to be Heard campaign, started in August last year. It showed just how serious the issue of nutrition for older people in hospitals is, with six out of 10 older people at risk of becoming malnourished or their situation getting worse in hospital, and patients over 80 admitted to hospital having a five times higher prevalence of malnutrition than those under 50, with all the accompanying horrors.</p>

<a name="70320-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07032072000108"></a>Age Concern came up with a list of seven steps to end malnutrition, including some fairly obvious things, one might say, such as listening to older people, their relatives and carers; all ward staff becoming &#147;food aware&#148;; hospital staff having to follow professional codes; assessing signs of malnutrition; introducing protected mealtimes; implementing a red-tray system to give staff warning that the patient has trouble eating; and using volunteers where appropriate. All those seem remarkably sensible, and I very much hope that the Minister will be able to tell us that many of them have come about, eight months on.</p>

<a name="70320-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07032072000109"></a>I want to take a longer look. In all the concern that there has been over recent years about malnutrition, particularly among older people in hospital, little attention has been paid to the enjoyment of food and to what older people like to eat. Long-stay wards for older people, which are not necessarily the sorts of wards that we would like to see come back, nevertheless often used to provide food that older people particularly liked. Steamed puddings, for instance, which we also get in your Lordships&#146; House, were an old favourite, and a traditional roast dinner was another. As chairman of a big community health services NHS trust in  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1210"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1210</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>central London in the mid-1990s, I was only too well aware of the likes and dislikes of many of the patients on the old long-stay &#147;care of the elderly&#148; wards. Steamed pudding was a great favourite and some of the older women, with bird-like frames, would lap it up in huge portions as though their lives depended on it. Of course, in a way, they did. Steamed pudding is easy to eat&#151;soft, sweet, nourishing and very familiar. It takes relatively little agility with cutlery for frail older people to manage it and, washed down with plenty of custard made with full cream milk, it probably provided most of the calories they needed for a day.</p>

<a name="70320-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07032072000110"></a>I certainly could not have managed the sorts of portions they were given as of course; nor would I have wanted them. But that is precisely the point. At that stage, on those wards we still had our own cooks preparing the food; wonderful men and women who would come in at 3 am on Christmas morning to get the turkeys into the ovens ready for a slap-up meal. They also knew, as they watched the carving or did it themselves, that cutting things up into small pieces was essential, even though what was being served was the favourite of all time&#151;a roast dinner followed by a steamed pudding.</p>

<a name="70320-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07032072000111"></a>In more recent years food in hospitals has been of varying quality, often pre-frozen and brought in ready to be thawed and cooked. There is neither the time nor the staff available to help older people to eat what has been provided. Anecdotes abound about older people in hospital being given a meal, it being left at the end of the bed and then cleared away later, with a cheery remark such as, &#147;Didn&#146;t fancy it, then, darling? Don&#146;t blame you&#151;don&#146;t fancy it much myself&#148;, without the realisation that the older person may or may not have &#147;fancied&#148; it but actually could not reach it. Had they been able to reach it, they could not have fed themselves anyway, and no nurse or care assistant seemed to notice. It is as though what patients eat is of no interest in a modern healthcare setting. Paying attention to what older people eat has not been high on the agenda.</p>

<a name="70320-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07032072000112"></a>In terms of what makes for successful ageing, old people rate diet and enjoying food very highly. They may well cook the foods they like for themselves when they are at home, but when they cannot do so, either due to frailty or because they are in hospital, questions need to be asked about how good it could be if real attention were paid to it. Since we know that older people rate food as a key part of successful ageing, it might be argued that hospitals and other institutions such as care homes have to catch up with the population&#146;s different views on food these days. If people, including older people, want organic and vegetarian food, they should have it without argument in precisely the same way as no one would argue with a demand for kosher or halal food.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07032072000113"></a>The English Community Care Association, one of the representative bodies for care homes in England, held a high-level symposium in July 2006 focusing on just these issues. The chief executive of ECCA, Martin Green, went on record as saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="07032072000201"></a>&#147;There are many elements to ensuring that a resident is well nourished, but there is no nutrition in a meal that a resident doesn&#146;t eat&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07032072000179"></a>All this comes in the wake of a report by CSCI entitled <I>Highlight of the Day?</I>, arguing for the likes and dislikes of care home residents to be explored and catered to, and for older people to be encouraged to participate in decisions about meals and their presentation.

The malnutrition advisory group, an expert group of doctors and other health experts, has warned that one in seven people over 65 in the UK is malnourished or at severe risk of malnutrition. Apparently, it is most pronounced in the north-west of the country, where one in five over 65 year-olds is undernourished. Despite a north-south divide in the case of general malnutrition, when it comes to nursing homes, where around one in four older people is likely to spend their last days, malnutrition rates are more generally one in five. Added to this, around 60 per cent of those over 65 admitted to hospital are found to be malnourished, and if anything it seems to be getting worse.</p>

<a name="70320-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07032072000115"></a>Some people have said that the figures that have been adduced in all of this in the various reports&#151;Age Concern&#146;s and others&#151;show special pleading on the part of the experts in the field. The counter-argument has come from Professor Marinos Elia and others in the group, who say that the statistics come from an analysis of data obtained from the national nutrition and diet survey conducted as long ago as 1998. More importantly, Professor Elia and others describe this as a public health problem costing the country anything between &#163;2 billion and &#163;4 billion pounds a year, mainly through increased or return hospital stays.</p>

<a name="70320-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07032072000116"></a>I have read a huge number of stories about people being neglected and simply not fed. I do not have time in this short debate to go through them, but you can read in the Age Concern report and elsewhere stories of people who weigh something like 7 stone when they go into hospital, but in a three-month stay lose something like a stone, anything between 2 and 7 kilograms, which is really quite appalling. Food and feeding are generally rather neglected, and we have not taken on board just how serious that is. People who visit older people at home, people who work in care homes, home helps, district nurses and family members all ought to be aware of the risk of malnutrition. As we are increasingly obsessed with obesity, we have somehow lost sight of malnutrition as an issue, particularly for older people. If someone is not overweight, we somehow perceive that as a good thing. That they might be seriously underweight, or not eating adequately, often does not cross even the experts&#146; minds, let alone the rest of us.</p>

<a name="70320-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07032072000117"></a>What can we do? Age Concern came up with a very good list of things that we could do. When I raised this in November, the then Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Warner, told me that,</p>
<ul><a name="07032072000206"></a>&#147;the better hospital food programme has improved the quality and availability of hospital food&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07032072000180"></a>but he was not clear precisely how that had helped older people. He also said that it was down to people at local level to make the best use of experience gained  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1212"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1212</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from allowing staff to focus on helping patients to eat, through the protected meal-times initiative. He suggested that it was up to local decision-makers to,</p>
<ul><a name="07032072000207"></a>&#147;put ward housekeepers in place when they think it is appropriate&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/11/06; col. 590.]</ul>
<p><a name="07032072000181"></a>I accept that it is down to local decision-makers; as a former NHS trust chair, I would have been very irritated if it had not been, but we need to see some central passion behind guidance and speeches. If it was clear that this was something that shocked Ministers, doctors and nurses, we would see a rapid change. If Ministers were pressing for it, we would see all trusts sign up to Age Concern&#146;s seven steps. If Ministers felt strongly, the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health would not have found the results of its survey of food in hospitals so disappointing, with a third of people abandoning their food and 40 per cent having food brought in by visitors. Until we get away from nine out of 10 nurses saying that they do not have time to help people eat properly, it will be impossible to get real changes.</p>

<a name="70320-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07032072000118"></a><I>Which?</I> magazine found that only 18 per cent of people surveyed over the past 12 months were satisfied with the food quality, compared with 57 per cent in private hospitals. It cannot be a coincidence that the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health food watch survey and the <I>Which?</I> survey show such different results from the Government&#146;s own patient environment action team survey compiled by hospitals themselves, and it takes some explaining. The Healthcare Commission reported in October that 96 per cent of hospitals were meeting core standards on hospital food, but that same commission is also adding a focus on food and help with eating in its dignity assessment programme carried out early this year, which suggests that it, too, was not wholly satisfied, especially as all this affects vulnerable people.</p>

<a name="70320-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07032072000119"></a>No one thinks that this should be a national programme, but the setting and monitoring of standards is something on which Ministers, doctors, nurses&#146; leaders and others could and should set a lead. There was an emergency meeting on malnutrition in hospitals last week, on 14 March, and it would be good to hear what came out of it. I know that encouraging an &#147;army of volunteers&#148; to help feed patients is one key idea that was discussed. As chair of the Commission on the Future of Volunteering in England, I would be very interested to know how the Government would propose planning the recruitment of such a large army, its training, supervision and retention and how they would recognise the contribution that such an army of volunteers would be making to the NHS in particular and to our public services more generally. I very much hope that the Minister will be able to give me some comfort as a result of this short debate.</p>

I welcome, as she did, the Age Concern <I>Hungry to be Heard</I> campaign and the Government&#146;s announcement of their own campaign last week.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1213"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1213</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="07032072000121"></a>We always have to remember that, as life becomes very narrow with old age, if someone is not well, is frail and has to go into hospital or into a care home, time for food is more and more important, choice of food is more and more important, and eating is perhaps the only remaining social activity of importance for many people. It is therefore appalling that so many people in hospital are malnourished. It is equally terrible that people going into hospital are malnourished. It means that this is a problem not just for the hospitals but for the whole community, and that it is seriously under-recognised. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that when she responds.</p>

<a name="70320-0011.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07032072000122"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, quoted many of the very important and distressing figures. I shall add only that four out of 10 over-80s are admitted to hospital when they are already malnourished. Malnutrition costs us more than &#163;7.3 billion a year, with more than half of that spent on the over-65s.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70320-0012.htm"/>


<a name="70320-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="07032072000123"></a>The risk of malnutrition increases with age. Another aspect of it which is usually forgotten is dehydration, which is a huge problem. Water is not always available and to hand. It is a very simple to correct, but it is not done. In both hospitals and care homes, huge numbers of people suffer from dehydration.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07032072000124"></a>We know that we will live longer as we get older, so all these problems will be exacerbated unless we change things now. Sadly, as with obesity, the attention always seems to be focused on the diet of the very young. We do not want to take away that focus; we just want to extend it so that all age groups are considered as we try to improve this situation, because the old people whom we are talking about are very vulnerable and require our attention.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07032072000125"></a>Malnutrition is also a key marker of inequality in health, social care and housing within regions and localities. It is one of the key reasons behind the shorter life expectancy in the north and Scotland which the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, mentioned. Life expectancy there is about 10 years less than it is in the south-east of this country. That is quite appalling.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="07032072000126"></a>As we know, the causes of malnutrition are complex and go far wider than just poor food. Among them are social isolation&#151;when you really cannot be bothered with food&#151;underlying disease, lack of mobility and a lack of diverse, accessible local food shops. Therefore, finding solutions in the community is even more complex than doing so in the clinical settings that we have described. They require input from a range of sources: the NHS&#151; particularly primary care services&#151;local government, the voluntary sector and families. One of the reasons why elderly people who are malnourished somehow slip between the cracks in the plaster is that nobody is quite certain who should take responsibility, so everybody pushes it on to someone else and the problem is easily and frequently overlooked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07032072000127"></a>Some months ago, I was privileged to launch the National Association of Care Catering&#146;s menu planner for care homes here in Parliament. I commend it on the great attention to detail that went into devising menus that were not only nutritious, but often tailored to specific conditions such as osteoporosis, anaemia and others; for example, when a person has difficulties  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1214"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>chewing or swallowing. The menus would retain a person&#146;s interest in eating. The menu planner is about 160 pages long, so it is not light reading, but it provides a very good model and is worth studying by many professionals in this field.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07032072000128"></a>I call on the Government to develop professional accreditation, filling gaps in training for people among the different professions who care for frail, old people. I have referred previously in the House to enhanced training for care professionals, and this seems to be a very good element to include in it.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="07032072000129"></a>We also have to ensure that screening for malnutrition is embedded in practice at all levels of older people&#146;s health services. The International Longevity Centre has been involved in a European study of malnutrition which shows that the problem is not limited to this country, but that it is worse here than in many other countries because we do not have a culture of taking food into our relatives in hospitals and care homes. The food is provided there, but it is often very poor.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="07032072000130"></a>I hope that the Government agree that we needto strengthen local government and community involvement, maximising the use of agencies such as sheltered housing groups, GPs&#146; surgeries, meeting clubs, leisure centres and voluntary organisations, as well to get across the message of how important nutrition is. We need in particular to ensure that families, which often do such a great job in caring, are aware of the signs. I hope that we will be reassured by the Minister that these issues will be taken forward by the Government.</p>

However, the more that one looks into this problem facing elderly people in NHS hospitals, the more horrifying is the picture that emerges. I was alerted to it more than five years ago. Ever since, I have checked and rechecked the facts and received letters, and what I have learned has angered and upset me a great deal, because the situation is worse than the report states.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="07032072000132"></a>Some old people are quite literally being starved to death. It is not more than &#147;some&#148;, but I worry about every single one of them. There is a growing realisation of this; there have been television programmes and newspaper articles. A recent BBC &#147;Look East&#148; programme elicited the biggest response that it has ever had. I have received more than 200 foolscap pages from the BBC, sent in by relatives or friends who have visited people in hospital and seen for themselves what has happened. I spent a long time putting together a dossier for the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. He has been most helpful, and I am quite sure that he means to do something positive to help in this regard. Every single person mentioned in the dossier has been contactedby me&#151;I have spent hours on the telephone&#151;andthe evidence that I have put forward is truly incontrovertible.</p>

<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1215"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1215</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>at it. I have submitted these details to the Minister. All this came out of the reports received by the BBC. I am convinced that the damage is done by the rule that states that giving people food and liquid is medical treatment. Doctors can withhold medical treatment almost at will, and this is what worries me. While backing this report to the full, we must surely make it our next step to try with the medical profession to alter this rule, so as perhaps to say that if &#147;nil by mouth&#148; is to stay on a bed for longer than a day, or two days at most, it has to be agreed by two or three doctors and a medical expert, because, so often, that &#147;nil by mouth&#148; sign is left on the bed day after day. Noble Lords should believe me when I say that people are dying while suffering, because to die through a lack of liquid is a terribly painful way to die.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="07032072000134"></a>We in this House have a huge responsibility, and I know that the Government are now alert to it. In backing this document, I ask that we take the further step of backing and saving our old people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="07032072000135"></a> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, for introducing this important debate. She raised some very important points, many of which I shall add to. I declare an interest as a healthcare provider. I expect that all of us in your Lordships&#146; House have heart-rending could relate experiences of our own or of family and friends. Age Concern&#146;s document <I>Hungry to be Heard</I> comes as no surprise to many noble Lords, as the issue has been aired many times. Sadly, little seems to have changed; here we are again discussing an issue so important to the welfare of our most vulnerable groups.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="07032072000136"></a>As other noble Lords said, six out of 10 older people are at risk of becoming malnourished or of their situation getting worse after coming into hospital. That adds approximately &#163;7.3 billion to NHS costs, as those patients take longer to recover or develop other complications or illnesses through malnutrition. Nine out of 10 nursing staff say that they do not always have enough time to ensure that patients eat properly.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="07032072000137"></a>However, it is not only about finding time for nursing staff to ensure that patients eat; there are many additional factors. The elderly may not be able to understand nurses. It is not unusual to find staff for whom English is not a first language. If patients are not English-speaking, it is difficult to express a problem with the full confidence of being understood. It might be that a patient suffers from learning disabilities, dementia or Alzheimer's disease. These patients need specially trained staff to encourage them to eat and, in many cases, support them in doing so. Above all, a well balanced menu must be fed to patients, one that takes into account the patient&#146;s ability to eat the meal.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="07032072000138"></a>I can give many examples. If noble Lords will indulge me, I will cite an example of an Asian lady who went into hospital and could not explain that she was a vegetarian and did not eat onions or garlic. In the end, her family had to bring food in daily. The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, referred to the fact  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1216"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1216</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that people do not always know that they can bring food in to their family, but this lady&#146;s family brought food in because she was not eating any meals at all.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="07032072000139"></a>Residential care, nursing homes and social services responsible for meal provision to clients in their own homes all have to follow minimum standards which offer choice and meet users&#146; differing needs. Surely it is even more important that such requirements are essential and followed in hospitals, as the same, if not better, standards need to be met.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="07032072000140"></a>The Minister will remind your Lordships&#146; House of <I>The Essence of Care</I> framework, which provides guidelines for nutritional assessments to be carried out on patients coming into hospital, identifying nutritional needs and devising care plans based on those assessments. Will the Minister say whether all hospitals are working to that framework, what monitoring has been carried out, whether results have been published and whether they are available to the public? Will she also assure the House that all patients coming into hospital are screened to identify those at risk from malnutrition so that appropriate action, needed to give staff enough time to help support individuals, is taken?</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="07032072000141"></a>We all are aware of the campaign led by Lloyd Grossman, which looked at the quality of food served in hospitals. The Better Hospital Food programme made much of menus becoming varied and offering more choices. However, if one is sick, elderly and finding it difficult to chew or swallow, as the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, said, it is not fancy menu choices that you want but familiar well balanced and easy, manageable food.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="07032072000142"></a>A spoon of mashed potatoes served in the middle of a plate does not constitute a meal, neither does a thick, salty bowl of soup that looks like wallpaper paste. We understand the practices of remote food preparation and reheating on hospital sites. Will the Minister assure the House that there will be a more rigorous inspection regime of monitoring the quality of food supplied to hospitals, assessing whether that food is of both nutritional value and cost benefit to hospitals and what distance it travels?</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="07032072000143"></a>In many cases, trays are left out of patients&#146; reach, even where hospitals use the red-tray policy. That is not always deliberate but the result of a lack of staff understanding or the inability of the patient to access the tray. The patient may not even remember whether he or she needs to reach out for the tray. Will the Minister assure us that, whatever the stresses that nurses and auxiliary staff are under today, time will be made in their day to feed vulnerable patients who cannot access a tray.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="07032072000144"></a>We know about the stresses that nurse and auxiliary staff are facing, especially with hospitals having to square ever-increasing deficits and make cuts to front-line staff. However, will the Minister assure the House that all hospitals have a full and proper policy in place to ensure that all ward staff are food aware, that appropriate training is given to staff and that they have a protected meal-times policy?</p>

I am very grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, for enabling this discussion to take place. It is an extremely important issue. I very much regret that it has not provoked the interest I believe it deserves. However, this evening we have quality here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="07032072000147"></a>The challenges of providing good nutritional care are huge. For that reason, last Friday, my honourable friend, the health Minister Ivan Lewis, announced a new national plan for older people and nutrition. He is passionate about the issue. The announcement followed a nutrition summit held on 14 March, which was attended by leading charities, clinicians, nutrition experts and care home representatives. That was not an emergency meeting. It was set up as part of the dignity and care campaign because feedback from the various listening events that have taken place showed that attention to food is so important to patients.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07032072000148"></a>The issues that were under discussion at the meeting included raising awareness, setting nutritional standards, streamlining guidance, training for staff and managers&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross stressed the importance of that&#151;and a clearer focus in inspections. Water UK was one of the organisations involved in the summit. I can assure the noble Baronesses, Lady Greengross and Lady Knight, that the important issue of hydration will be properly considered and dealt with. The action plan will be further developed in close consultation with frontline workers, including Age Concern and other organisations that attended the summit. We can expect the plan in the not too distant future.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07032072000149"></a>A great deal has already been achieved. For far too long food was not treated with the priority that it deserves and for too long food and feeding were neglected. In 2000, the NHS Plan accepted that, despite the sterling efforts of dedicated catering staff, food had somehow slipped off the agenda for too many NHS staff. More importantly, the plan acknowledged that food really matters to patients, not just as a source of fuel, but as a way of making their hospital stay more pleasant. It made it clear that improvements in food and nutritional care were needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07032072000150"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, is absolutely right to talk of the importance of enjoying food. We want to include roast dinners, steam puddings as well as the many other varied menus that are available. Of course, there is still a place for traditional dishes. Catering managers and dieticians are best placed to understand what their local populations need. They must talk to patients themselves to see what they want. We have to ensure that patients, such as the Indian lady cited by the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, are

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="07032072000151"></a>Soon after the NHS Plan was published, we evaluated the quality of hospital food, via Patient Environment Action Team Assessments&#151;PEAT assessments. We have continued to assess food quality ever since. Every year, things have got better&#151;from 17 per cent &#147;good&#148; in 2002 to over 34 per cent &#147;excellent&#148; last year. The Age Concern report acknowledges that, speaking of food that would grace any restaurant. Of course, we have to ensure that the food provided is the sort of food that people want to eat. If one is feeling poorly or ill, one has a very special palate.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="07032072000152"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, spoke of the Better Hospital Food programme. Its remit was not to provide fancy menus, but to do much more. It accomplished some very specific things; for example, more food is now available round the clock. We have introduced 24-hour services, snack boxes and daily snacks. For the last year in which statistics were collected, 2004, 89 per cent of hospitals had introduced ward kitchen services to provide light snacks, 80 per cent were providing snack boxes and 84 per cent were providing extra snacks during the day. In most cases, patients can now choose a hot meal in the evening, whereas before, many only had soup and a sandwich; 94 per cent of hospitals reported that they provided that service. Many hospitals have also improved the visual appearance of their menus, providing more information and a professional appearance.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="07032072000153"></a>Another key plank of the Better Hospital Food programme was the introduction of protected mealtimes. In partnership with the Royal College of Nursing, we introduced the concept of an oasis of calm at mealtimes; a period when all unnecessary activity on the ward stops, and everyone&#151;staff and patients alike&#151;can concentrate on the meal. Once patients have the time to relish their food, and staff have the time to help them to eat, food intake increases and so does enjoyment.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07032072000154"></a>Good food is important, but it is not enough. The best food is of no value if it is not eaten and for many older people, it will not be eaten if the requisite assistance is not there. That is at the very heart of the Age Concern report. Stories of food left out of reach, or taken away uneaten are shocking. Such care is unacceptable. When it happens, we must roundly condemn it. But it is not the norm. Most patients receive the help they need to eat. The Healthcare Commission in-patient survey found that 83 per cent of patients sometimes or always got the help they needed to eat. This is not good enough and there must be improvements, but the situation is not as disastrous as some would have us believe.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="07032072000155"></a>I warmly welcome the Age Concern report as a generally thoughtful and considered piece of work. In particular, I value the way in which it has identified its seven essential steps to improved nutritional care. We accept much of what it recommends, but already we are taking steps to make things better&#151;for example, Ivan Lewis&#146;s Dignity in Care campaign. Nutrition and support when eating were among the top 10 concerns that people raised when describing their experiences of being treated with dignity.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1219"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1219</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70320-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="07032072000156"></a>We have also focused attention on how nurses can improve the care of older people. There are now 85,000 more nurses in the NHS than in 1997 and67 per cent more nurses entered training between 1997 and 2004. More nurses means more nursing care, and it should also mean more time for patients.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="07032072000157"></a>The challenges identified by Age Concern are not unique to this country, hence the resolution from the Council of Europe on food in hospitals. We are actively supporting the Council of Europe Alliance, a group of interested bodies including the Hospital Caterers Association, the British Dietetic Association, the Royal College of Nursing and the British Medical Association, who have taken the recommendations of the Council of Europe&#146;s resolution on food in hospitals and translated it into straightforward, practical actions. Its 10 key characteristics of good nutritional care on the ward directly support much of the Age Concern report.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="07032072000158"></a>Step one of Age Concern&#146;s seven steps is about listening to older people. We are listening to older people. We have introduced the modern matron with the authority to take action to improve care. Nurse leaders in hospitals all over the country are taking the lead for care, listening to patients and their families and working with nurses and their teams to deliver better care. We have also increased the time students spend learning in practice settings so that they gain the necessary practical skills they need to be equipped to provide personal care for patients.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="07032072000159"></a>Step two is that all staff should be more food aware. We certainly accept the need for all ward staff to become food aware. Food is an essential part of treatment, and everyone needs to recognise it. Florence Nightingale spoke of the,</p>
<ul><a name="07032072000202"></a>&#147;thousands of patients [who] are annually starved in the midst of plenty, from want of attention to the ways which alone make it possible for them to take food&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032072000182"></a>We must not fall into the trap of seeing food as an add-on, a luxury, a nice-to-have. Food is a must-have, and we will continue to spread that message.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="07032072000160"></a>Step three relates to professional codes and guidance. The Age Concern report rightly charges hospital staff with responsibility for following their own professional codes and guidance. This, of course, is where the work of the Council of Europe Alliance could be so productive. Each organisation within the Alliance is jointly committed to the 10 actions, but each will work with its own members in the way that is right for them. The Government wholeheartedly endorse the need for good practice, but delivery of that practice lies in the hands of NHS staff.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="07032072000161"></a>Step four concerns screening on admission. As the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, rightly informed us, up to 40 per cent of hospital patients are at risk of malnourishment on admission. Studies suggest that it is even worse for admission to the social care sector. This is a problem for the community as a whole, not just for care homes and hospitals. I am therefore pleased to endorse Age Concern&#146;s recommendation that older people should all be screened on admission. Indeed, we emphasise the importance of screening within the Better Hospital Food programme and  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1220"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 1220</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>further work on this is still going on within the National Patient Safety Agency. Again, Age Concern itself is actively involved in this work.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="07032072000162"></a>Steps five and six cover the introduction of protected mealtimes and a red tray system. The National Patient Safety Agency is taking forward the work on protected mealtimes. We fully support allthe actions being taken in this area. Along with the red tray system, it offers a proactive solution to a long-standing problem.</p>

<a name="70320-0012.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="07032072000163"></a>I now turn to Age Concern&#146;s final recommendation&#151;the use of trained volunteers to support patients at mealtimes. We have long recognised the enormous value that volunteers make to patients&#146; experience of the NHS. We have supported the sector in developing its potential contribution through the Opportunities for Volunteering scheme, and by providing funding through the Section 64 scheme. I know that some trusts are already using volunteers to support patients at mealtimes, and I am sure they will continue to do so. In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, this is not something that we will act on centrally, but we are going to encourage all trusts to make better use of volunteers.</p>

<a name="70320-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="07032072000164"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Knight, raised some important issues in her contribution. I must respond to the point made about nil-by-mouth orders. The most common reason for a nil-by-mouth order would be for patients awaiting surgery, as it is important that a person has an empty stomach before an anaesthetic. Another common reason in older people would be if somebody has had a stroke and lost the ability to swallow. In this circumstance it is important that a dietician speech and language therapist is involved so that the patient gets the appropriate treatment.</p>

<a name="70320-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="07032072000165"></a>I know that the noble Baroness and the noble Lords, Lord Carlile and Lord Patten, have met the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and Professor Ian Philp, the national director for older people&#146;s services and neurological conditions, to discuss concerns about the deliberate withholding of food and drink and that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, has agreed to make a Statement on the Government&#146;s position. I do not wish to pre-empt that Statement.</p>

<a name="70320-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="07032072000166"></a>I endorse much of what the Age Concern report said. Its recommendations are sound and sensible, and with partners in the NHS, we have actions in place to maintain improvement. However, I do not accept the suggestion that nutritional care is currently in disarray. Much has already been achieved, but there is much more to do. As my honourable friend Ivan Lewis said last week,</p>
<ul><a name="07032072000208"></a>&#147;there is no excuse for vulnerable, older people not receiving the food they require and the necessary help to eat that food&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032072000183"></a>We have already done a huge amount to improve the quality of food in hospitals, but there are challenges in relation to the support of frail, elderly people who need encouragement to eat. We recognise that, and, as I hope I have demonstrated, we are not complacent and that, rather, we are taking action.</p>

<a name="70320-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="07032072000167"></a>Finally, I pay tribute to the many NHS staff who have worked so hard to bring nutritional care up the agenda and who continue to make it their priority.</p>

Before the Minister moves that the first order be considered, I remind noble Lords that in the case of each order, the Motion before the Committee will be that the Committee has considered the order in question. I should make it clear that the Motion to approve the order will be moved in the Chamber in the normal way.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="07032037000002"></a>Representation of the People (England and Wales) and the Representation of the People (Combination of Polls) (England and Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2007</h3>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000010"></a>The noble Lord said: With these regulations we are also debating the draft Local Authorities (Mayoral Elections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2007 In those regulations, I wish to ensure that Committee Members have before them the most recent draft, as there was a small but crucial drafting error in the previous version. The election timetable for mayoral elections will be governed by the regulations. Where polling day is 3 May 2007, that timetable would commence with a notice of election on 27 March. As there are authorities with mayoral elections this year, it is crucial that the regulations are in effect on 27 March. The earlier, incorrect draft of the regulations excluded from their effect elections that commenced on or before 27 March. That would therefore have excluded the very elections that we are especially seeking to capture, that is, those where polling day is 3 May. Accordingly, the most recent, correct draft of the regulations should exclude from their effect at Regulation 1(2) only elections where the last date for notice of election is on or before 26 March.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000011"></a>Despite having been read through by several individuals, that apparent typographical error in the draft was not spotted until after the instrument had been laid and scrutinised by the JCSI. As the significance is, by contrast, large, we have had to withdraw and re-lay the draft with the corrected date, rather than use a correction slip. Given the shortness of time remaining, I am extremely grateful for the assistance provided by the House authorities and the agreement of the chairman of the JCSI that the  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC156"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Committee debate on the re-laid draft can take place before the JCSI re-consideration. Of course, any subsequent Motion for approval on the Floor of the House will take place only after that JCSI reconsideration.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000012"></a>The purpose of the Local Authorities (Mayoral Elections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2007 is to implement the changes made for parliamentary elections by the Electoral Administration Act 2006, so ensuring consistency of electoral practice between the conduct of elections for local councillors and those for local authority mayors held on or after 3 May this year. These include changes to nomination procedures&#151;candidates may use their common names on nomination forms and papers. The rules on the use of authorised descriptions by candidates standing on behalf of registered political parties are amended to reflect amendments made to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Returning officers will be able to correct minor errors on nomination papers.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000013"></a>New security measures introduced by the 2006 Act are also provided for in this context and separate security markings and unique identifying marks are required for ballot papers. Ballot paper counterfoils are replaced by corresponding number lists, and postal voters and proxy postal voters are required to provide both their signature and date of birth when returning postal ballot papers.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000014"></a>Alterations are made to the circumstances in which a person may be given a tendered vote. New requirements are introduced as to the information and accessibility of information to be provided by returning officers to electors. Changes are made as to the persons who may be admitted to polling stations and the count to observe elections. Amendments are made to provide for the transmission of information to a presiding officer of alterations to the electoral register taking effect on the day of the poll. Amendments are also made to facilitate the introduction of a scheme for the anonymous registration of certain electors, which is due to come into force on 1 June 2007. Changes are made to the arrangements for the retention and inspection of election documents after the poll. A full set of forms is appended to the rules reflecting the changes made to implement the 2006 Act.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000015"></a>These regulations also increase the election expenses limit for candidates at mayoral elections. The limit is now calculated by taking &#163;2,362 as a base figure and adding 5.9 pence for every entry on the register of electors. This was to allow for inflation and the change was made on the recommendation of the Electoral Commission. The 2002 limit was based on a base figure of &#163;2,000 plus an additional 5 pence for every entry on the register.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000016"></a>When approved, these regulations will replace the Local Authorities (Mayoral Elections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2002 that currently apply to the elections of local mayors. The detailed rules for the conduct of mayoral elections are based on the rules contained in the Local Elections (Principal Areas) (England and Wales) Rules 2006. Throughout May 2006, advisory groups consisting of key interested groups with practical and in-depth knowledge of running

In addition, the Electoral Commission was also consulted on the detailed provisions in these regulations. Feedback on both cases was very useful and the vast majority of the suggested changes have been incorporated.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000017"></a>The purpose of the Representation of the People (England and Wales) and the Representation of the People (Combination of Polls) (England and Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2007 is to make changes consequential on the decision not to implement provisions in the Electoral Administration Act 2006 which require a voter in a polling station to provide a signature before being issued with a ballot paper. As a result of this, we are amending the prescribed forms in the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations to remove the signature column from Form L2, the corresponding number list to be used in a polling at a parliamentary election held on its own, and from M2, the equivalent of that form, to be used in polling stations where a parliamentary election is combined with another election or referendum, and remove references to electors signing for their ballot paper in the official poll cards. In these regulations we are also removing references to electors signing for their ballot papers from the guidance for voters that was issued at combined polls. In these regulations we are also correcting minor drafting errors in the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000018"></a>The Electoral Commission was consulted on the provisions in these regulations and its views were taken into account. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07032037000019"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Representation of the People (England and Wales) and the Representation of the People (Combination of Polls) (England and Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2007.&#151;(<I>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting</I>.)</p>

<p><a name="07032037000020"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07032037000153"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> I thank the Minister for that long introduction. I know that he sat through some of the debates on the electoral Bill although he was not the Minister in charge. It is nice to see him opposite, though I am sorry that I will have to be cross because we are not in a very happy situation. I have not scoured the mayoral elections regulations 2007 but, in the light of what has happened today, I probably should have. I am hoping that they are absolutely as expected.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000021"></a>It is the representation of the people regulations which we are being asked to approve today that cause us the most concern. Throughout the passage of the electoral registration Bill we had enormously long discussions on fraud and the prevention of fraud&#151;particularly by postal voting, where we made considerable changes to the Bill&#151;and the personation of people in polling stations. The Government&#146;s measure provided that people appearing at a polling station should have to sign for their ballot papers. It was generally agreed by everybody that that was an extremely sensible measure. The provision therefore did not command a great deal of attention at the time.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC158"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000022"></a>I am, however, bound to say that this is a fiasco of the greatest order. We have local elections coming up this year and local and mayoral elections next year. We have the possibility of a general election at any time after the retirement of the Prime Minister. Yet, these measures which would have ensured that people turning up at polling stations had to sign for their ballot paper are going to be rescinded and will not be available to provide that protection when the election takes place.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000023"></a>I cannot overstate the fact that this is a monumental blunder. The fact that the Electoral Commission, the administrators themselves, had to pick up the fact that there was a flaw&#151;that returning officers would have to give somebody a ballot paper even if they refused to sign&#151;just beggars belief. We have no alternative other than to let this matter go. But I must ask the Minister to tell us when primary legislation will be produced to rectify the matter. This is the second time that we have dealt with this order. We took it through and agreed it in December. Now we are taking it back in March and have to disagree it. So there is clearly a mega-problem. We must know when the primary legislation will be there.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000024"></a>It is not only the Electoral Commission that is concerned about fraud. The commission on standards has pointed out all along that personation at polling stations is one of the major ways of committing fraud in elections. We have spent weeks and weeks trying to tighten up the legislation to ensure that we build out of elections any possibility of fraud; and what happens? The Government have managed to build it all back in again. It is a shambles. I am sure that the Minister, who read the notes very carefully, will agree that this is not the sort of standard that one expects from the Government or from those who draft the legislation. Ultimately we have to agree to the removal of one of the most substantial bits of legislation to prevent fraud.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000025"></a>I have nothing more to say other than to ask when the primary legislation will be introduced. I reiterate that the Government should be very shame-faced over this.</p>

<p><a name="07032037000026"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07032037000154"></a>Lord Rennard:</b> I want to strike a more positive note about the regulations than the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, did. They bring about the things that we talked about at length during passage of the Electoral Administration Bill, now the Electoral Administration Act 2006, and bring about new things with which some of us who are concerned with electoral administration issues have been concerned for many years. I am therefore delighted to see most of the provisions. But I would have liked them to go further.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000027"></a>Now is not the time to reopen the debate on matters such as individual voter registration, but I would hope that the Minister noted the comments of the Committee on Standards in Public Life on that. That committee was unduly harsh and unfair to the Electoral Commission on this issue, because the commission argued strongly for individual voter registration, as did a number of us. However, I very much welcome these regulations because they provide for a requirement for a signature and date of birth on

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000028"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, pointed out, it is more than regrettable that we have failed properly to enact the provision for signing for ballot papers at polling stations. I do not believe that the problem of personation is widespread in Great Britain&#151;the position may be different in Northern Ireland&#151;but it does happen in some places. I recall fighting the Militant Tendency in the 1980s in Liverpool, where personation was a common tactic used at polling stations. Requiring a signature in return for the ballot paper would prevent that sort of abuse&#151;which might be much more widespread in this country if only people knew how easy it was to go to a polling station and impersonate someone. In general, people do not know how easy it is to do that.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000029"></a>I welcome other aspects of the regulations&#151;updating the electoral expense limits is long overdue. But perhaps the Minister will consider an annual system whereby parties would know further in advance whether there might be an increase in electoral expenditure limits. Perhaps in time the commission should be given the job of proposing something formally&#151;say, every December, in line with the RPI, rather than waiting for regulations close to an election. People might then know what the limits will be.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000030"></a>I particularly welcome the provision ensuring that when you apply for a postal vote, you will receive a confirmatory note from the returning officer saying that you have applied for a postal vote from a specific address. That was the subject of fierce debate in this House two years ago. I shall not rehearse all the arguments made in 2004, but some of us felt then that such provision would be an important measure against fraud. I am glad that the Government accepted it in the 2006 legislation and that it is now being implemented.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000031"></a>Finally, it is welcome that the measures required in the Act are to be financed by central government. I understand that there will be an extra &#163;12 million or so for local authorities in England and Wales. It is an important principle that local authorities should not have to choose between the costs of efficient electoral administration and perhaps more popular services. I simply note that &#163;21 million is a small price to pay for proper democracy. It also indicates that democracy costs money. In the wider debates which we will have over the year ahead we should note that we are spending a significant amount on electoral administration and that resources could also be found in the system for paying the other costs of democracy.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000033"></a>Paragraph 7.3 of the Explanatory Memorandum states that,</p>
<ul><a name="07032037000141"></a>&#147;there is a lack of a clear sanction to withhold the ballot paper should an elector refuse to sign&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07032037000137"></a>Tackling that issue was a central objective of the legislation. Has my noble friend an explanation of how the Government brought forth such defective legislation? Do Ministers know who was responsible for the mistake&#151;for the misjudgment? Was it one person? Was it several members of a legislative team? Should the 2006 Act have been subject to greater and more effective professional scrutiny? Was that the defect in the consideration of all these matters? Do we know the outcome? Have there been any consequences? Is parliamentary draftsmanship in decline? Surely not&#151;yet, as my noble friend said, there was a crucial drafting error and the system did not cope with it. When was the Welsh Assembly&#146;s First Minister informed of the defect? When did the Assembly know that it was not what they thought it was going to be?</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000034"></a>The Electoral Commission was the dog that barked. It did its duty, and its scrutiny was effective. But how did lawyers and draftsmen manage to bring forth such defective legislation? Has there been an inquest? Do we know how it happened? Who was responsible? I am not asking to be told who the people were, but does the system know? Have Ministers looked at it to ensure that that sort of thing does not happen again?</p>

<p><a name="07032037000035"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07032037000156"></a>Lord Norton of Louth:</b> I have two quick questions, but the Minister may be relieved to know that they have both been asked by my noble friend Lady Hanham and the noble Lord, Lord Jones. Before I put them, I shall pick up on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, on personation; it may not be as widespread as some think it to be, but the problem has always been that we do not have the means of actually knowing. Electoral registration officers have said, &#147;We do not think there&#146;s a problem&#148;, but they have no definitive way of knowing.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000036"></a>I reinforce what my noble friend has said. The Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee has drawn this specially to the attention of the House. It says at the end of its commentary that the consequence of this error is that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07032037000140"></a>&#147;An important measure to combat electoral fraud will not now be available for the May 2007 elections, and the Government's policy objective of reducing the amount of such fraud may, consequently, be imperfectly achieved&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07032037000138"></a>That encapsulates the point, and it is damning about how we have got into this situation.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000037"></a>As I say, the questions I was going to ask have been asked. One was that raised by the noble Lord, Lord Jones: how did we get into this situation? I mention in passing the fact that the Government are their own worst enemy. Had they accepted some of the amendments made in Committee, we would have avoided this by going for somewhat more stringent provisions than those the Government pursued.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000038"></a>My second point was simply that raised by my noble friend: when can we expect primary legislation? The Government state that they plan to clarify the

We need to know just how early that opportunity is, because the situation we are in now requires urgent rectification.</p>

Obviously they are serious matters. They are rectifiable, but they have happened. In all walks of life errors sometimes occur, and I stand here representing the Government apologising for these errors, remembering the debates we had on the Electoral Administration Bill and remembering well the points the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, made. I hope the answers I give will go some way to satisfying the anxieties expressed. I am not sure that today I can go all the way, but at least we acknowledge that there is a problem; it is a problem of our own making, and again I apologise for that.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000040"></a>The noble Baroness and other Members of the Committee have asked whether we intend to introduce primary legislation to solve the problem of signatures for ballot papers. Yes, we plan to clarify the matter as soon as possible in order to bring in a clear requirement for signatures in polling stations. As the noble Baroness said, that will require primary legislation. I am afraid that I cannot give a firm commitment on when that will happen, nor can I provide any details of the Government&#146;s legislative programme in future parliamentary Sessions. It is essential, however, that this should happen. It is clear that such an amendment, as I said in my opening remarks, will not be made before the elections in May 2007.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000041"></a>We continue to believe, as do other Members of the Committee, that requiring electors to sign for their ballot papers will bring a number of benefits. Many voters find it reassuring that they have to provide some sort of identification in order to vote. It will also help to deter opportunists&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, raised this point&#151;from defrauding the system. I know that that answer will not satisfy the noble Baroness but&#151;</p>

It is not a surprise because I had already been given the information that the Government had no idea when the measure could be introduced. It must be a one-line Bill. Both opposition parties would see it through quickly. We would not oppose it. We want this measure in. A lot of elections are coming up. If we leave this and the situation just drifts on, the Government having so much legislation that they cannot introduce another Bill, we shall never get it on the statute book. The opposition&#151;certainly the Official Opposition&#151;would co-operate with getting the measure through quickly. I should not think that it needed to be longer than a page with one clause.</p>

<p><a name="07032037000044"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rennard, was more positive about the regulations, for which we are grateful. He made a number of general points about what might be done on an annual basis, which we take on board. He asked about individual registration as described in the CSPL report. The Government note the findings of that report and will respond to it in due course. My noble friend Lord Jones asked how the effects came about. Legislation was constructed so that the issue of a ballot paper was conditional on signature. However, there was no specific sanction provision. This gave rise to doubt, a risk of inconsistent approach and a legal challenge. On the advice of the commission and the Association of Electoral Administrators, we have decided not to commence this measure yet, but we take on board all the concerns raised. I say to my noble friend that in any organisation and in any walk of life mistakes are made. I made a huge number in my career as a publisher. It happens. If I may go on the offensive for a moment, it is a bit hard on the Government to take one example and say that it is indicative of something more than a particular incident. I am not in a position, nor would I wish, to start attributing blame for this matter either to Ministers or in particular to civil servants.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000058"></a>The noble Lord said: As is well known, the purpose of the renewal order is to continue the temporary provisions&#151;I emphasise that they are temporary&#151;for the appointment of police officers and police support staff for a further three years with the aim of increasing Catholic composition in the Police Service of Northern Ireland to a level which is considered representative of that community. As many noble Lords are all too aware, the temporary provisions have been debated extensively both here and in another place on numerous occasions. Indeed, I anticipate an informed debate today following the Private Member&#146;s Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Laird, on this issue a year ago. The noble Lord is still laid up&#151;I do not know the details&#151;and is unable to be with us. I am certain that he would have wished to be here today; all he is able to do at present is send in lots of Questions for Written Answer.

<p><a name="07032037000059"></a>For those less familiar with this issue, the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 gives effect to the report of the Independent Commission on Policing for  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC164"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Northern Ireland, commonly known as the Patten report. This report made a number of recommendations on policing in Northern Ireland, including the need to address the religious imbalance within the police service so that it is representative of the society that it polices. It recommended that all candidates, either as police officers or support staff, who wished to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland and who reached a specified standard of merit in the selection procedure should be placed in a pool from which one-half of those appointed would be Catholic and one-half non-Catholic. This arrangement became known as 50:50 recruitment and is in place today for all trainee police officer recruitment campaigns and directly recruited support staff where six or more similar posts are being filled.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000060"></a>The report also recommended that Catholic police officers from Northern Ireland serving in the police service elsewhere, particularly at more senior ranks, should be identified and encouraged to apply for positions in the Northern Ireland police. This arrangement is commonly known as &#147;lateral entry&#148;.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000061"></a>The Government are committed to the need for this legislation and the opportunity it offers in giving the Northern Ireland community a normal police service which is acceptable to all. We are firmly of the belief that these temporary provisions&#151;I again emphasise temporary&#151;are one of the most significant reasons why public confidence in policing is increasing across the community. However, we are also committed to removing the legislation once the religious imbalance is addressed. As clearly set out in the St Andrews agreement, the Government&#146;s target is to increase Catholic composition in the Police Service of Northern Ireland to 30 per cent by March 2011.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000062"></a>Under the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 the temporary provisions may be renewed by the Secretary of State, for up to and not exceeding three years, following consultation with the Northern Ireland Policing Board. The provisions were first renewed for a three-year period in March 2004 by the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 (Renewal of Temporary Provisions) Order 2004. This renewal order seeks to keep the provisions in force for a further three years until March 2010. That is a year before the target date.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000063"></a>As recommended by the Patten report, the temporary provisions are an,</p>
<ul><a name="07032037000142"></a>&#147;exceptional measure to try to provide a more representative police service within a reasonable timescale&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000064"></a>I fully understand that many people remain opposed to the measures. However, the benefits that these provisions have had on increasing Catholic composition, as well as the positive impact on increasing community confidence in policing in general, justify the order in order to address this historical imbalance in the composition of the police in Northern Ireland. The order has also, as I shall go on to address in a moment, had the side effect of increasing the female composition of the police.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000065"></a>Since the Patten report&#146;s recommendations and the implementation of the temporary provisions, the Catholic composition of police officers has almost trebled. From a mere 8.23 per cent in November 2001,  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC165"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC165</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Catholic composition has increased to 21.43 per cent as of mid-February 2007. This progress is exceptional and reflects the support and faith in the process, including among the 73,000 applicants who applied to join as police officers during this period. Since 2001, 73,000 people have applied to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland, a police service with a total composition of fewer than 8,000 officers. This change has been made possible due to the example set by the courageous and dedicated men and women who have served the community as police officers over the years. But it has not been an easy task: 302 lost their lives serving their fellow citizens during the Troubles.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000066"></a>Patten highlighted the imbalance between the number of Catholics and Protestants in the composition of the police as &#147;the most striking problem&#148; and it is this that the temporary provisions are aimed at addressing. However, I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the importance of gender and ethnicity in the police service. In the Second Reading debate on the Private Member&#146;s Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Laird, the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, articulated her concerns about the effect that the temporary provisions may be having on ethnic minority applications However, one effect of the 50:50 process in increasing community confidence about applying is that representation of female officers within the Police Service of Northern Ireland has increased from about 12 per cent in November 2001 to more than 21 per cent as of the middle of February 2007.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000067"></a>With regard to ethnic minorities, while Patten recommended that every effort should be made to recruit them, given the very small population involved he did not set a target. However, the police have undertaken a number of positive outreach measures aimed at recruiting people from ethnic minorities. The current PSNI ethnic minority composition is 0.3 per cent, which compares favourably with the overall level of the working-age ethnic minority population in Northern Ireland of 0.46 per cent. The translation of advertisements has seen a significant rise in applications from the Chinese community as well as from foreign nationals such as those in the Polish community. For example, in the most recent campaign there were 968 applications from Polish applicants half of whom, I should point out, were still living in Poland. However, I want to take this opportunity to put on the record any concerns that these applications are automatically disadvantaged by being placed in the non-Catholic category.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000068"></a>All applicants to the Police Service of Northern Ireland are required to complete an equality monitoring form in accordance with the Fair Employment and Treatment Order (Northern Ireland) 1998 and the Fair Employment (Monitoring) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999, irrespective of their country of origin. The information given by applicants on this form is used in making these appointments under the 50:50 policy. Since Poland is a predominantly Catholic country, Polish applicants to the Police Service of Northern Ireland are generally treated as Roman Catholic. However, each  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC166"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and every one is assessed in terms of the religion they declare on the monitoring form.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000069"></a>When the temporary provisions issue was previously debated, it was done in a climate where elements of Northern Ireland&#146;s community remained uncommitted, unsupportive and unco-operative with their police officers. Crimes, regardless of how violent, remained unsolved all because of a lack of assistance given to the local police. I have said it many times: if you are not for the police, you are for the rapists, the muggers and the robbers. It is as simple as that in my terms. Today, in this critical period, the climate is notably different and continues to change for the better. I have come armed with statistics to show that this is the case, given the number of people applying for posts, where they come from and so on. Recently, Sinn Fein&#146;s decision to support policing, however much that might be criticised, shows that the word has gone over. Progress made by the Northern Ireland political parties in achieving a political settlement, which we hope will be a final and long-lasting one, provides an historic opportunity to support inclusive policing. With the aid of this order we fully anticipate that the Catholic composition of the Police Service of Northern Ireland will reach the Government&#146;s target of 30 per cent by March 2011. It is at this point that we believe the temporary provisions will have achieved their aim in providing a representative and inclusive police service, and these provisions will no longer be necessary. They are temporary until the target of 30 per cent is achieved. Our estimate, and it can be fairly precise with the recruitment processes taking place, will be achieved by March 2011. At that point, this legislation will lapse. I beg to move.</p>

My party has opposed 50:50 since day one. We never agreed with it and believed that there had to be a better way of tackling the problem of the overbalance of Protestant members of the RUC as it was then, and the PSNI as it is now. To put that into context, we have to remember the reasons why we reached that imbalance. It was because members of the nationalist/republican community were under threat of death if they were so courageous as to join the Northern Ireland police forces. Under those circumstances, it was probably understandable that not very many did so, except for those living in what might be called safe areas. Nevertheless, a number did and a number were killed. If the Government are determined to continue with this order, they are once again at risk of institutionalising sectarianism and religious discrimination in Northern Ireland, something that they, we and others have been trying to get away from for a very long time.</p>

<p><a name="07032037000072"></a>The legislation is now no longer necessary. The make-up of the population of Northern Ireland has changed significantly in the past six years; the  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC167"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC167</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Minister made the case about potential Polish entrants, who are Roman Catholics, as well as Chinese, Asians and many others. The population in Northern Ireland has changed, as has the security situation. There are better ways of correcting this imbalance, if that is the right terminology. There must also be a better system than that under which an enthusiastic recruit who has passed all his tests and is somewhere near the top gets a letter through the post telling him he has been turned down because there are too many Protestants and his place has to go to a Roman Catholic. We understood that in some ways at the time of Patten, six years ago, although we did not like it, but today it just does not make sense.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000073"></a>The Government are telling us&#151;and although we do not always believe them, we want to this time&#151;that Sinn Fein has embraced the criminal justice laws and police services of Northern Ireland. If it has, why are its colleagues and constituents frightened to join the PSNI? Why do they need a law which is totally biased and discriminatory in their favour? It makes a mockery of the world we live in today.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000074"></a>I suggest that for their own reasons, the Government want to have their cake and eat it. Why, at this late stage, does this legislation need to be extended, not for a month or two to see whether the Assembly will sit, but for another three years? The Minister&#146;s figures tell us that the target will not have been met until 2011, so we could well be facing another renewal in three more years. That has to be wrong, wrong, wrong.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000075"></a>I can see no logic in where the Government are going. I believe that they are institutionalising sectarianism and discrimination, both of which we are trying to get rid of. My party and I are seriously against the renewal of this law. We voted against it in the Commons, and I cannot tell the Minister what we shall do when it comes into the Chamber here.</p>

<p><a name="07032037000076"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07032037000171"></a>Baroness Harris of Richmond:</b> Yet again, I find myself on a hiding to nothing when dealing with Northern Ireland orders. I thank the Minister for introducing the order. We recognise that since the provisions were introduced in 2001, there has been a significant increase in the number of Catholics applying for the police. The Chief Constable&#146;s annual report for 2005-06 states that on average, since the provisions were introduced, 36 per cent of applications come from Catholics, compared with a high of 22 per cent before Patten.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000077"></a>I am particularly pleased that 37 per cent of applicants are women. As the Minister has said, the number of those who go on to become officers has increased from 12 per cent in 2001 to over 21 per cent now. That is excellent progress.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000078"></a>We have heard anecdotal evidence in the past of ethnic minority groups feeling that the 50:50 quotas had discouraged them from applying for the police. Because of the way the legislation is worded, candidates from ethnic minorities are considered in the non-Catholic pool of applicants, which is still larger in number than the Catholic pool. Some of those from ethnic minority backgrounds are reluctant  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC168"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to report hate crimes. They believe, rightly or wrongly, that the officer dealing with them may not fully understand or empathise with their situation and would feel more comfortable taking to an officer from a similar background to themselves.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000079"></a>Returning to the provisions of the order, which deals specifically with the recruitment of Catholic officers, we were pleased to see from the Chief Constable&#146;s report that the police service is on target to increase the representation of officers from a Catholic background in the regular service to 30 per cent by 2011. As of 1 April 2006, 19.59 per cent of the regular force is from a Catholic background, compared with 8.28 per cent in November 2001. That is significant in any measure. Given the recent declaration of support for the police in Northern Ireland by Sinn Fein at the Ard Fheis, we hope to see the number of applications and recruits from those of a Catholic background increase even further in the three-year period that this order covers.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000080"></a>As we have heard, the Patten report envisaged that these special measures should be exactly what they are called in the legislation and in this order: temporary. The report envisaged a 10-year model to increase Catholic representation in the police to 30 per cent. This must be the last time we expect to renew these provisions for a three-year period. We firmly believe that as the time frame established in the order comes to an end, the Government must seriously investigate whether it is necessary to renew the provisions or whether the goal of a police service that is representative of the community should continue to develop naturally. We are putting this as a clear marker for the Government: if, in three years&#146; time, they propose to renew these provisions for yet another three years, we will not accept it. We accept the renewal of these provisions only up to the 10 years envisaged in the Patten report.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000081"></a>I have one further question. In his opening remarks, the Minister mentioned lateral entry. Does he know if any Catholic police officers from Northern Ireland, especially any senior officers, have applied to return to Northern Ireland to become officers in the PSNI? If he is not able to answer that today, I will obviously accept a letter from him. Even though we accept a great deal of the concern that has been expressed about the 50:50 recruitment process, we will support this order today.</p>

<p><a name="07032037000082"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07032037000172"></a>Lord Kilclooney:</b> I was interested in the comment of the noble Baroness that in three years&#146; time her party will be opposing this 50:50 arrangement. That assumes, of course, that there will not be devolution in Northern Ireland, and that policing matters will not by that time have been devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly. That is my first question to the Minister. If devolution proceeds in Northern Ireland as planned, and if, eventually, there is a devolution of policing matters to Stormont, will the Government or the Executive, or whatever authority will be named, have the power to end that 50:50 arrangement prior to the date provided in this legislation?</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000083"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, rightly outlined the reasons why we had a low Roman Catholic membership of the policing institutions&#151;the Royal  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC169"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC169</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Ulster Constabulary and subsequently the PSNI&#151;and I shall not go over those issues; I know them in detail. There was tremendous intimidation of Roman Catholics; some of my friends who were Roman Catholic members of the RUC were assassinated by the Provisional IRA. Such people were even a priority target, compared with other members of the RUC. Roman Catholics were the number one target for assassination. That was one of the main reasons why we had a low Roman Catholic participation in the policing structures in Northern Ireland. As a Member of this House, I am delighted to see the progress in increasing the number of Roman Catholic members of the PSNI. That is what we really want to see in Northern Ireland&#151;full participation in our policing system of people from all traditions.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000084"></a>However, the Minister must recognise that the 50:50 rule has caused great offence to the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland. Young men who are Protestants and who are better qualified are being discriminated against because they happen to be Protestants; they cannot get a position in the PSNI, and that causes a lot of sectarian feelings within the community. This is sectarian legislation and it is causing offence. Therefore, the sooner it is removed from Northern Ireland, the better.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000085"></a>However, on the background, the Minister said that Sinn Fein had now accepted the PSNI. I find it difficult to accept that statement and I will be interested to see if other parties accept it by 26 March. The English press says that Sinn Fein supports the PSNI, without examining that in detail. My understanding is that if you look at the issue in detail, Sinn Fein accepts the PSNI in relation to ordinary day-to-day civilian problems&#151;such as traffic issues and rape which happen in civil society&#151;but did not make it clear that it would support the PSNI when terrorism was involved. That needs to be clarified in Northern Ireland. It was not sufficiently clear to satisfy someone such as me. It may have satisfied Dr Paisley, but I will be watching this matter closely before 26 March to see whether Sinn Fein is clear in its support for the PSNI and all policing matters in Northern Ireland&#151;civilian and terrorist.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000086"></a>There is one other problem in Northern Ireland and we must not run away from it. We still have the Real IRA, which, in my opinion, is an increasing threat in Northern Ireland society. It would be interesting to hear whether the Minister thinks that the Real IRA is in decline or whether it is increasing its presence and potential for terrorism in Northern Ireland. The PSNI has to operate in that context of modern policing, which, sadly, might mean that Roman Catholic members of the PSNI will still be intimidated by breakaway groups from the Provisional IRA.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000087"></a>Mention has been made of the Garda Siochana. Paragraph 7 of the Explanatory Memorandum goes further, saying that there will be,</p>
<ul><a name="07032037000143"></a>&#147;a wider degree of lateral entry&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07032037000139"></a>from the Garda Siochana&#151;not just the existing arrangements, but a &#147;wider degree&#148;. Can the Minister

I repeat the question I asked the Minister last time: has he read the oath of allegiance that members of the Garda Siochana take? At the time he replied that he had not. I hope that he has now read it because I suspect that it would not be acceptable to the vast majority in parts of Northern Ireland.</p>
<h5><a name="07032037000148"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000088"></a>I am glad to hear the clarification that Polish applicants will be accepted in accordance with whatever religion they state on their application forms. That means that in most cases, if they are telling the truth, they are Roman Catholics, although there is quite a strong evangelical Protestant Church in some parts of Poland. I hope that they will not be discriminated against because they happen to be Polish rather than being born in Northern Ireland and that as European Union citizens they will get the same consideration as local applicants.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000089"></a>On 50:50 recruitment, it must be remembered that it is not 50 per cent Protestant and 50 per cent Roman Catholic, but 50 per cent Roman Catholic and probably something towards 40 per cent Protestant. That is because the other 50 per cent is not just made up of Protestants but of people of no religion or of other religions. For that reason it is a further means of discrimination against the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000090"></a>The Explanatory Memorandum mentions the St Andrews agreement and the agreement to try and achieve a 30 per cent Roman Catholic composition by 2010-11. Was that agreed by all the parties at St Andrews, by just the two Governments, or did both Sinn Fein and the DUP agree to this target of 30 per cent? That needs to be clarified.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70320-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000091"></a>Will the Minister explain whether the target of 30 per cent by 2010 is consistent with the Patten target, or was that target something different? The memorandum does not make it clear whether they are the same thing. I shall leave it at that and I look forward to the answers from the Minister, especially those on the Garda Siochana and the Patten target.</p>

<p><a name="07032037000092"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07032037000173"></a>Lord Eames:</b> The trouble with any regulations or legislation of this nature is that when you speak from within Northern Ireland you will immediately be interpreted as extending sectarianism. When you voice any opinion on something such as what is known colloquially as the &#147;50:50 disposition&#148; you can be open to the interpretation that &#147;everything is right and you are going against what is wrong&#148;.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000093"></a>This afternoon, I suggest two things to the Minister in this context. First, in the light of what has already been said by previous speakers, the time has come to reconsider whether this provision should even be renewed for three more years. The situation in Northern Ireland has changed vastly since the initiating of this thinking, and certainly since Patten. I feel that it would be of tremendous encouragement to the whole of our community if it could be seen that that change is recognised in a tangible way, such as I am suggesting.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC171"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000094"></a>Secondly, it gives me no pleasure to be critical at this stage of the legislation and the rules, particularly as the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, is presenting this to us. I have always admired his contribution as a Minister during his time in the Northern Ireland office. He took endless trouble to become acquainted with the various briefs given to him about the conditions in Northern Ireland. However, in my professional live, involved as I was in the community of Northern Ireland for 43 years, I have had numerous representations made to me by parents and unsuccessful candidates, victims of the 50:50 legislation who did not just meet the preliminary requirements for membership but far exceeded them. It was acknowledged in explanations given to me in Northern Ireland that many of these candidates would have excelled in any police service in western Europe, but because of their religion they were not allowed even to enter training.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000095"></a>I speak as one who has devoted his life to opposing sectarianism in all its forms. Therefore, I do not want any of the Members of this Committee to interpret what I am saying as anything other than a feeling of frustration if the 50:50 position is not reconsidered, which would be tangible evidence of how far our society has moved in such a short time.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000096"></a>As the previous speaker said, it is not a case of 50 per cent Catholic, 50 per cent Protestant; it is a case of 50 per cent Catholic and 50 per cent others, made up of various ethnic groupings. Indeed, I say to my noble friend Lord Kilclooney that 40 per cent is quite large in terms of the Protestant population representation. I am certain that there is insufficient recognition in Government that in Northern Ireland this will be interpreted as saying one thing and doing another. They are saying that the situation has improved, yet they are putting on the table for three more years something which is perceived as a contradiction of the progress that we have made.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000097"></a>Finally, I do not believe that this is a party political issue; I do not believe that it is a question of party views. I accept that it was a genuine approach, as a result of the Patten recommendations, to allow a representation in the Police Service of Northern Ireland which was not possible in a voluntary way. But the time has come for serious reconsideration of whether it is correct to have this on the statute book once more, even for three years.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000098"></a>I pay tribute, from my personal knowledge, to the tremendous courage of Catholic families whose members joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary and, later, the PSNI at great personal risk. When the history of these times comes to be written, I hope that adequate tribute will be paid to that courage, for I have buried too many members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, too many members of my community, not to know what the Catholic community has gone through in the losses inflicted on it and its members who served in the police service.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000099"></a>As I said, it is very easy to interpret any criticism of the order as sectarian. I beg the Minister, to whom I have already paid tribute, to treat what I am saying in terms of reality rather than anything of that nature.</p>

I was a shop steward within the trade union movement, and it was a very difficult time. None the less, it was worked out, and today employers in Northern Ireland have a rule they live by.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000101"></a>I have never quite understood why the police force had to be sectarianised in this way. I had two friends from a Roman Catholic family who joined the police, and both were murdered by the IRA. Why did religion have to be the thing? All my life I have fought for people getting jobs on merit. I am a great believer in equality, so I cannot get my head round why we are looking at having this law in place for another three years when we are told on all sides that Northern Ireland is entering a new world and everything is different, with the PSNI going forward with legislation, and women and people from ethnic minorities joining the force.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000102"></a>I cannot understand why we still have to do this because back in Northern Ireland this is looked on simply as a sectarian issue. Many previous speakers mentioned that they had been approached by young people. As many Members of the Committee know, I live along a peace line and a number of Roman Catholic families have told me that their kids cannot join the force because of the 50:50 rule. They fitted all the criteria but they could not join the force. So it works both ways. In the light of what Sinn Fein has done and what the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, said, and if it has all been accepted, I do not really see why we are pursuing this measure for another three years. I find this very difficult. I have never understood why there are only two derogations on Northern Ireland in European law, one concerns the police and the other education&#151;two major pillars in building a new Northern Ireland and yet they are the two areas in which we can discriminate.</p>

<p><a name="07032037000103"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07032037000175"></a>Lord Trimble:</b> We would all do well to reflect on the two speeches that have just been made by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord opposite. It was welcome that they couched the issue in terms that departed from the narrow political and sectarian approach. There is much to commend in what they said. I understand the reservations of the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, about whether the republicans have gone all the way that they should to support policing in Northern Ireland. But for the purposes of my remarks I shall assume that if they have not yet gone the whole way in their language, they will, in short order, go the whole way in their conduct. On that basis I very much agreed with what the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said about the changed circumstances. We are now in a different situation.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000104"></a>Part of the reason that was adduced to explain these measures was that of the need to give Catholic applicants a helping hand as it was feared that there would be insufficient numbers coming forward as a result of republican hostility to policing. But we are in a different situation now in that respect. Republicans are clearly moving towards supporting policing even if they have not gone the whole way. We have heard  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC173"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC173</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>statements by the leadership of the republican movement calling on members of the Catholic nationalist and republican community to join the police. The Minister might find that he will become the victim of the law of unintended consequences. Nationalists and republicans have now moved to support policing&#151;nationalists in the shape of the SDLP have clearly done that; Sinn Fein is clearly moving in that direction&#151;and they are encouraging young nationalists and young republicans to join the police. Given that situation, is it not likely that we will now see a significant number of young republicans, who up until now have held back from involving themselves in policing, becoming involved in it and that there will be a surge in recruits, or applications to the police, from that quarter?</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000105"></a>If that is the case&#151;and there is good reason to expect that it will be the case within a short period if it is not now&#151;the order that the Minister is bringing forward tonight will start to disadvantage Catholic applicants. Young republicans and young nationalists might have held back in the past because the republican movement was hostile to policing. As was mentioned, at the moment we are still getting more applications to the police from people of a Protestant background than from people of a Catholic background. It is quite possible that within a matter of months or a year or so that will switch and we shall find more Catholic than Protestant applicants coming forward. The Minister should bear in mind that as regards the relevant age group&#151;young men aged 18 to 25&#151;there is a rough equality in numbers in terms of the demographics, so what I have described is quite likely to occur. So we could see a situation where more applications are coming forward from a Catholic background but this legislation limits recruitment to 50 per cent. You will find it working against Catholic applicants. I understand that the Minister said that he can calculate that with the recruitment that is taking place, the 30 per cent target will be achieved by 2011 without the order. It is perfectly possible that that target could be achieved earlier than 2011. I do not know whether anyone has bothered to think this out.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000106"></a>There is a general issue here. Discrimination is wrong in principle. I have never personally favoured discrimination or supported people who discriminate. Discrimination is wrong in principle, but it is also a bad thing in practice. I have given one example: how, in the change of circumstances that is likely to happen, we are likely to find that the untoward impact of the order, which will probably be approved shortly, will have a negative effect reverse to that originally intended.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000107"></a>It is also bad from the point of view of policing. The noble and most reverend Lord, Lord Eames, made the point about the high quality of people who have been turned down. Statisticians tell me that they can, from looking at the figures, work out that roughly one-quarter of the Catholic recruits to the police service during the past number of years are persons who would not have got in on pure merit&#151;if  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC174"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC174</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>recruitment was done purely on the basis of getting the best person for the job. The word merit is sometimes given a strange meaning in the legislation; I am not using it in those terms; I am using it in its real sense. The merit principle means that you go for the best qualified applicants. If we had been going for the best qualified applicants, one-quarter of the Catholics who have gone into the police service would not have got in.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000108"></a>It is not a wise thing ever, in any line of business, especially policing, not to be recruiting the best qualified people. That will obviously have a negative effect on the quality of the police service, but think about the consequences, think about the next stage. People join as constables. In a few years&#146; time, they will start to think about their chances of promotion. The legislation applies only to recruitment; it does not apply to promotion. Therefore, when it comes to promotions, if the promotions are done purely on merit&#151;the best qualified people are promoted&#151;we are likely then to see an imbalance in promotions.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000109"></a>If it turns out in the years to come that promotions are done on something roughly 50:50, that will be prima facie evidence of discrimination, which, this time, will not be protected by legislation. In our modern litigious age, you can be sure that there will be a significant number of complaints to the Equality Commission and actions brought on the matter. So there will be problems down the line. That reinforces my point that this is a bad idea in practice as well as in principle.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000110"></a>I shall not labour the point on the matter of principle, but I find it strange and wonder to myself sometimes what it is about the Labour movement, which trumpets its attachment to human rights and equality but has an itch to discriminate. We see that itch here. We were reading in the press in the past few days about university entrance. The desire to discriminate there runs throughout the Labour Party. I could also mention the way in which the Labour Party has shamelessly discriminated against everybody in Northern Ireland over the course of the past 80 years and denied them their political and civil rights. It continues to do so, despite being dragged to employment tribunals over it. The desire seems to lie within the Labour Party to discriminate.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000111"></a>The Minister's language was telling. He said at one stage that the effect, the consequences of the legislation certainly justifies the measure. It is not and it can never be justified. The Government&#146;s defence up to now has been that it is expedient, but not that it is justified. Discrimination is not, and cannot, be justified. The Minister&#146;s only defence is to say that it is expedient, but, as I have pointed out, he may find that it is no longer so.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000112"></a>Finally, to give him his own words again on that basic point, he said at one stage in his introduction, &#147;I&#146;ve got lots of figures here to show that the climate has changed&#148;. If the climate has changed, then the Government should recognise the change and get out of the mindset they have had for the past half dozen years. This is not necessary. If the Minister persists

Stop discriminating.</p>

<p><a name="07032037000113"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07032037000176"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I will do my best to answer the questions I have been asked, as well as addressing some of the myths and unfortunate&#151;how shall I put it?&#151;foresuppositions based on the figures. I genuinely mean that I will try to address every point. It is 20 March. The deadline is 26 March, and the one thing I will not do is change that. I cannot be certain what hour of the day the deadline is&#151;I presume it is the whole 24 hours from midnight, when the clock starts ticking. I do not intend to comment on or allude to anything here today that could be used in one way or another, and I do not think I would be expected to. Therefore, I will not be able to comment on who said what, who feels what or whatever. We are in a very sensitive period. We all understand that.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000114"></a>There are a lot of figures, I accept that. I do not accept that discrimination is necessarily a bad thing, if there is a policy purpose at the end of it which one seeks to drive to. Twelve competitions have been launched since the new Patten provisions were introduced. Each competition recruits 440 police officers. The lowest number of applications received in a competition&#151;not the number of those who got through the system, but of applications&#151;was 4,410, while the highest was 7,861. The grand total is 70,000-odd thousand. Each time there are only 440 entrants. As can be seen, the lowest figure was 4,410; that was for competition number four. The highest was for competition number 11. Competition number 12 in September 2006 gave the highest percentage so far of applicants from a Catholic background: 41 per cent.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000115"></a>I was very conscious of what I was saying earlier when I talked about Catholic and non-Catholic. I realise that I am not talking about 50:50 Catholic and Protestant, but about Catholics and others&#151;which, as the noble Baroness pointed out, includes ethnic minorities. I fully accept that, at 440 a go, with 70,000-odd applications in the past few years, there will by definition be an awful lot&#151;thousands&#151;of disappointed people. Some of them will have got through the threshold of being eligible for recruitment, and they will still have been disappointed. The police force itself is somewhere under 8,000 strong; I think it is 7,557, although I do not know if that is the figure for today or for the date when this note was written for me. The scale of numbers of people wanting to join the police force is so great that there will inevitably be disappointment for people, whether they are male, female, Catholic, Protestant or from an ethnic minority. Starting from that premise, there will be huge numbers of people who do not get in, for whatever reason. I suspect that that may be the case. There will be a limit on the numbers of police in Northern Ireland for a career structure.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000116"></a>We have not hidden at all the fact that this arrangement is discriminatory. Everyone understands that; I am not arguing otherwise. But there is a policy objective to be achieved at the end of it. It was thought in the Patten report that the scheme&#146;s single  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC176"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC176</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>most striking feature&#151;and I was quoting from the report at the time when I spoke on that&#151;was the issue of the numbers of Catholic and non-Catholic police officers.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000117"></a>The arrangement has received the support of the Equality Commission and the Human Rights Commission, but we do not deny that it is discriminatory. I will answer all his other points, but at one point I think that the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, referred to discrimination by my political party. I was not sure what the discrimination was. If it was the fact that we do not fight elections, that is tough, but there is no discrimination on membership anywhere in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="07032037000118"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07032037000177"></a>Lord Trimble:</b> Just to correct the Minister on that, the Labour Party stopped discriminating on membership only within the past year or two as a result of legal action taken by a shop steward from Northern Ireland, who is also now bringing a discrimination action over the attitude to fighting elections. Don&#146;t say &#147;tough&#148; to 1.7 million people whom you are discriminating against in terms of their civil rights. That is not the attitude to adopt.</p>

<p><a name="07032037000119"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07032037000178"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> No&#151;political parties are voluntary groups. We have a policy of not fighting against parties that are members of the Socialist International. It is as simple as that. That has always been the case. We make no bones about that; that is our policy; that has always been our policy. That is the policy in England, Scotland and Wales; it is the policy in Northern Ireland. There happens to be a party that is a member of the Socialist International there. I have not come here to debate this; I do not even know why this got raised. Nevertheless, I had to respond because I was not clear about the point being raised.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000120"></a>On the issue of people expected to score higher&#151;it will take me a while to go through this&#151;the fact is that the selection procedure of all applicants prior to reaching the pool, because there is a more than one-stage process, as Patten underlined, is based on merit. There is no requirement for members of one community background to score higher or lower than another as part of the process to get into the pool. The 50:50 provisions only apply once people are in the pool. There is no secret about that. Of course, by the time people are in the pool, they have met the United Kingdom requirements to be a member of the police force.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000121"></a>The other point was that it would happen naturally. I had to have this explained to me at some length, but that is not the case. If we consider the total numbers of the police force and its current composition, we know that there is a recruitment competition of only 440, so knowing what the endgame of the number of police will be with retirements and other movements, the best estimate is that it will be March 2011 before the 30 per cent target is reached. It is possible to make that calculation because the entry is fixed at 440 and the total number is fixed and we know the composition that we start with today. It cannot be done any quicker.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000122"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Trimble, is absolutely right&#151;two seconds before he raised the point, I satisfied myself on the answer&#151;that if the proportion  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC177"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC177</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of applicants is 41 per cent, the highest it has been, and rising, it will not be long before it is more than 50 per cent. I will then make the same speech to members of the other community supporting the 50:50 in order to achieve the policy objective as I must make today. The same situation will apply; there cannot be any difference. That will not mean that we achieve the objective faster.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000123"></a>I much regret that, looking at the demographics, if we approach March 2011 and the situation is still the same&#151;I will come to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, about devolution&#151;someone else will have to come to seek a temporary provision order for one year, because the target will be that close. I much regret that this is not a four-year order, but the legislation requires it to be for three years, because then it could be put to bed. That is the end date on these calculations with these entry numbers by which the policy objective of 30 per cent will be achieved. I will also cover the point about why the figure is 30 per cent rather than another one. A noble Lord has asked about that.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000124"></a>At the present time&#151;the post-Patten period&#151;over 93 per cent of all Catholic applications have been unsuccessful. Let me make that absolutely clear. Only those who meet the UK standards have been appointed, and even then we have had to turn away a significant number of those who have met the standard because the demand is so high. I go back to the original point: there have been 440 entries on applications running at an average number in the competitions of 5,000, 6,000 or 7000, with the lowest competition at 4,400. We are looking to address the imbalance of the community background so that the police service is more representative of the community that it polices. That is what Patten said; it was accepted at the time and it serves no useful purpose for me to go over the history. Patten said that it was the most striking issue relating to the police and that it ought to be addressed.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000125"></a>In respect of lateral entry which I referred to in my opening remarks, the wider degree of lateral entry as set out in the Explanatory Memorandum is based on the opportunity of opening lateral entry from other forces, not just the Garda Siochana. Entry is not narrowed to that one, it extends to other forces. I can also say to the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, that I have looked at the new oath. It is similar to the oath for the Police Service of Northern Ireland and it is certainly human rights compliant. If there is a point about it that the noble Lord objects to or if he feels that it fails in some way, I shall be happy to try to respond to that. Further, the oath can be converted to an affirmation so that the words &#147;Before God&#148; do not have to be used. I do not know whether that was the issue here, but I can confirm that it is human rights compliant and very similar to the PSNI oath.</p>

<p><a name="07032037000128"></a>On the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, about support for policing, I shall get into trouble if I start quoting who said what and giving weight to the statements that have been made by various members of the political parties. The noble Lord himself referred to the fact that within the next few days, political leaders in Northern Ireland are going to have to make up their mind about whether they have the confidence in each other and in the system to go into devolved government on a power-sharing basis. They have to do that by midnight next Monday. I do not think my quoting one leader as opposed to another or referring to one type of crime as opposed to another would take the matter forward. That is not for me as a UK Minister, it is for the political leaders in Northern Ireland. I wish them well in their decisions.</p>

<p><a name="07032037000129"></a>I accept that it is not easy for any of the parties involved because it is not an easy situation. But the prize here is the government of Northern Ireland by Northern Ireland people rather than having to keep coming here to Grand Committee to listen to Westminster Ministers&#151;commuting Ministers administering direct rule who cannot be full-time on the job. We cannot serve the people of Northern Ireland and we are less than second best. The best has to be local people in Northern Ireland; that is their prize. It is their choice, and it is six days away.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000130"></a>I was asked about discrimination on the other side. In the first 10 competitions, 4,507 suitably qualified non-Catholic candidates were not approved, but it is not true that they were rejected because of the 50:50 rule. We estimate that 708 of that number were affected by the temporary provisions. In other words, 4,500 suitably qualified candidates, fit enough to be UK police officers, have got through to the pool on merit and have not been appointed, but 708 of those were affected by the 50:50 rule. There will be a lot of disappointed people because the demand for places is so high.</p>

<p><a name="07032037000131"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07032037000181"></a>Lord Trimble:</b> The Minister has just confirmed what I was saying earlier; he has conceded that 780 people would have been appointed but for this. In other words, had the appointments been made purely on merit, those 780 would have been appointed. That, therefore, means a huge imbalance in terms of ability within the cohort that has been recruited.</p>

It is not possible to say that they would have been appointed because they were all suitably qualified above the threshold to get into the pool. However, I can say that they were not appointed because of the 50:50 rule, but  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC179"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC179</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that does not mean to say that if it were not in place they would have been appointed. It does not necessarily follow.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000133"></a>The ill feeling that results from these temporary provisions is due to people thinking that they have lost out and so-and-so down the road has got the job because of their religion. That is not true with the vast majority of people; it cannot be true on the figures I have quoted. It is simply because of supply and demand: the supply is so great and the demand so small. Thousands will be disappointed and it will be nothing to do with the 50:50 recruitment process.</p>

<p><a name="07032037000134"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07032037000183"></a>Baroness Blood:</b> I am a bit confused. I understand what the Minister is saying. He says that 708 got into the pool. The perception in Northern Ireland is that you are turned down because of your religion. Would it not be more honest to do away with this legislation and let people take their chances under normal recruitment practice? Or does the Minister think it fair that you get right through the process and then get a letter saying sorry, you fit the criteria but you are the wrong religion. That is what people are being told.</p>

<p><a name="07032037000135"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07032037000184"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I understand the discomfort that has been caused in the past by the drafting of the letters that have been sent out. I do not have such a letter in front of me but I understand that, as of the most recent competition or the one before that, the nature of the letter gives people a more accurate explanation of why they have not been appointed. In some cases, it is not because of the 50:50 rule. That is the point.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07032037000136"></a>Let me give the example of the 11th competition, held in March 2006. There was a merit pool of 504 suitably qualified candidates. There were only 220 posts available&#151;in other words, half the annual total. Five hundred and four suitably qualified candidates had gone through to the pool and there were only 220 posts. Therefore, a significant number of both Catholic and non-Catholic candidates were rejected, but not because they were not suitable and had not qualified. They were qualified; they were in the pool. The fact is that there were more of them than there were jobs available. It is as simple as that. There is no way round that while the numbers of the police service are fixed. We have no plans, as far as I know, for vastly increasing the police force. It is not justified.</p>

<p><a name="07032053000008"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07032053000135"></a>Lord Trimble:</b> The Minister is in danger of confusing himself, or maybe he is trying to confuse other people. As I said in my original comments, the term &#147;merit&#148; has a funny interpretation here. Five hundred people get into the pool, having met the minimum standards. What then should have happened is that the 200 odd places that were going to be filled should have been filled on merit by choosing the best 200 odd of those 500. It is at that point that the 50:50 rule comes in and causes discrimination. On the Minister&#146;s own figures, the cumulative number of persons who have suffered that discrimination is 700. Take that as a proportion of those actually recruited over that time and you begin to see the enormity of it.</p>

The noble Lord homes in on discrimination for that number. I freely admit that that is the inevitable consequence of demand for places being so high. You cannot alter the figures. I cannot manufacture extra police posts when they are not available. There are 440&#151;220 for each competition. Each place has 10 times the number of applicants. It is inevitable that qualified people will be discriminated against because they have got through to the pool, and the operation is trying to get a police service that is broadly representative&#151;I do not think anybody is looking for the last decimal point&#151;of the society it serves.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000014"></a>The totality of our estimate within the 50:50 provisions means that less than 1.7 per cent of all non-Catholic applications will have been rejected as a direct result of the 50:50 process. The others will have been rejected because the demand for jobs is so great and the supply of jobs is so small. So we are talking about a very small number who are affected by 50:50 compared to the vast thousands of qualified Protestants and qualified Catholics who cannot get a job because the jobs are not there.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000015"></a>Let us make a mountain out of this if we like, but let us be realistic about it: tens of thousands will not have got in from both communities and it is nothing to do with 50:50. That is the reality. A few qualified people will not have got in because of 50:50, and the 50:50 is the mechanism to achieve the policy objective of getting a police service that is broadly representative of the society it serves. That is not under the lateral arrangements.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000016"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Harris, asked about ethnic minority applications. Those are broadly in line with the population. The ethnic minority population in Northern Ireland is less than 1 per cent. When you are dealing with tiny numbers it can be difficult to get any targets. There have been, as I have said, positive decisions to translate advertisements. I made the point that some applicants for the Northern Ireland Police Service did not live in Northern Ireland&#151;35 Latvians applied; eight of whom were not living in Northern Ireland, but in Latvia, and half the Poles were still living in Poland. The point I wanted to make is that not all ethnic minority applicants are automatically classified as non-Catholics. That will come down to the monitoring forms they are required to fill in.</p>

<p><a name="07032053000017"></a>We are committed to achieving the 30 per cent. We broadly think that that can be achieved, although the estimate is that it will be achieved by 2011. The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, asked specifically about the Patten targets and what was in the memorandum. I am genuinely trying to answer the detailed questions. I fully accept that the matter is not that precise, but there is no play on figures. In recommending the recruitment of Protestants and Catholics on an equal basis as an exceptional measure to try to provide a more representative police service, the Patten report made proposals on compositional targets to be achieved within a reasonable time frame. With the help of consultants the report recommended the proposed 50:50 ratio. The proportion of Catholic officers could quadruple within 10 years to a figure of 29 per cent to 33 per cent. That was the estimate that was given at the time. As for the 30 per cent figure, I do not know who signed up to what at St Andrews but the matter was raised and the figure of 30 per cent by 2011 was set. That is the Government&#146;s target. We have put it on record that when that target is achieved&#151;and we expect to achieve it by March 2011&#151;these temporary measures will no longer be required and will lapse.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000018"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, asked a question on devolution, which I have not yet answered but am determined to do so. I have a form of words for this as I must get it right. If these temporary provisions are still in force at the time policing is devolved&#151;as everybody knows, we are not talking about next Monday&#151;it is the Government&#146;s view that responsibilities for the 50:50 policy, which are currently exercised by the Secretary of State, will transfer to the Northern Ireland Minister with responsibility for policing should the Assembly&#146;s vote requesting devolution of policing specifically include a request for these temporary provisions. Putting that the other way round, it will be up to the Assembly to seek to continue this. If it puts it in the request for devolution, it would go to the Northern Ireland Minister with responsibility for policing. That is the position. I do not know whether that response answers the question of the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, but I am not sure that it fully satisfies him.</p>

Apparently, the Assembly has to make a specific request that the 50:50 question be included. That is very interesting indeed.</p>

<p><a name="07032053000021"></a>I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify aspects of the policy. I hope that I have given more updated figures. The policy is very unpopular in certain quarters but the Government believe that it is wholly justified by the circumstances.</p>

<h5><a name="07032053000129"></a>5.18 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07032053000023"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0004.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="07032053000143"></a>Lord Rooker</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Modification) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000024"></a>The noble Lord said: A few weeks ago I warned that this order would be introduced either in Grand Committee or on the Floor of the House. It looks like a contradiction or Plan B, but it is not. We do not have a Plan B: it is devolution or dissolution on Monday. We are at a crucial point in the political process in Northern Ireland and minds are focused on the deadline for the restoration of devolved government on Monday of next week. There are no obstacles in the way of the formation of a power-sharing Executive on 26 March. It would be a tragedy beyond belief if the political classes in Northern Ireland failed to deliver what the electorate has just endorsed. The recent elections to the Assembly demonstrated a resounding desire for a return to stable and inclusive government. With the deadline so close, bringing this order forward now looks like an anomaly, so I will explain.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000025"></a>The main purpose of the order is to extend the power to legislate for Northern Ireland matters by Order in Council for a further six months. We do not want to do that. When the Northern Ireland Assembly was suspended in 2002, the provisions of the schedule in the Northern Ireland Act 2000 were invoked whereby the Government had the power to legislate for Northern Ireland by Order in Council. The power was initially limited to the first six months of suspension. Regretfully, it has been extended on eight previous occasions for a further period of six months.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000026"></a>This modification order would provide for a further extension of six months from 15 April this year to 14 October&#151;in other words, the current arrangements expire during Parliament&#146;s Easter Recess. The order is being brought forward purely on a contingency basis. We fully expect that devolution will be restored next Monday, 26 March, which would cause the power to legislate by order to fall away anyway. Devolution of powers will take place once the process has been undertaken at Stormont. If failure occurs, however, the Government will be left with no alternative but to proceed to direct rule, and the Secretary of State has made it clear that that would be for years rather than months.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000027"></a>Noble Lords previously raised concerns, and I want to put this on the record as well, that legislating in such a manner is democratically deficient. It is. We accept that, and we have done so for some time. We recognise those concerns, and we have made the commitment, which I am happy to repeat, that if for some reason devolution does not occur, we will move to introduce measures designed to increase accountability in this Parliament under direct rule. The measures would be discussed through the usual channels, and would constitute a distant, remote second best to Northern Ireland politicians doing

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000028"></a>As I said, the tightness of the parliamentary calendar dictates that there would be insufficient time to lay and pass an order before the Easter Recess. We cannot take a risk on leaving that until after next Monday. Believe you me, the best brains in the Government&#151;which do not include me&#151;and the Northern Ireland Office have thought long and hard about this. It looks like a plan B, but it is not. There is no plan B. We expect devolution to be back next Monday. However, we have to prepare a contingency. We could not automatically assume that in the few days at the end of next week, with the Budget debate and everything else, we could get both Houses of Parliament to pass what would look like unthought-out emergency legislation. That is not what this is; we have thought about it. Purely as a contingency, we are bringing forward this order. We hope and trust, of course, that it will never be operated and that the devolved powers will return to Stormont and a devolved Assembly some time during the hours of 26 March. I beg to move.</p>

I thank him too for ensuring that I got the very early warning that, and the explanation of why, we would be taking this statutory instrument today. I have little more to say, other than that I hope to God the Government do not actually need it. I thank the Minister for his undertaking, in the awful event that we need it after all, that the method of managing Northern Ireland affairs will be improved.</p>

After it had been laid in another place, the Minister responded to my colleague with an explanation that the order was laid on a contingency basis, and that is what we are talking about. We know that the current order runs out on 14 April. Given the Easter Recess, there was not a great deal of time to pass the order. We do not criticise the Government for laying the order and pressing ahead with the debate. It would probably be irresponsible to do otherwise.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000032"></a>However, I would like the Minister to explain a little more clearly why it would not have been possible to debate this order next Tuesday, 27 March, if it was necessary. By then, of course, we would have known on 26 March, the deadline, whether or not it would have been necessary: if an agreement was not reached by then, the debate could have gone ahead. But as things stand we are in an uncertain position because we do not know whether we actually need the order.</p>

So far as the business managers in this House and the other place are concerned, there simply is no parliamentary time next week. I suspect that in a sovereign Parliament, where there is a will, there is a way, but the fact is that we do not want what is in effect a contingency measure to look like emergency reactive legislation. Further, there is no time in the parliamentary calendar next week to deal with this business. That is the best advice I have; in fact it is the only advice I have because there is no other answer. It would not be possible to deal with this order next week.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000036"></a>The order has to go to the Privy Council, and that is where the problem arises. If I had known that in the first place, I could have said so.

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000040"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving the first set of social security regulations I shall speak to the other two sets grouped with it. In summary, the three sets of regulations provide for the application of a backdated national insurance contribution liability on the amount of employment income which is charged to tax by the provisions of Schedule 2 to the Finance Act (No. 2) 2005 and Section 92 of the Finance Act 2006. They also put in place rules regarding the recovery and collection of that national insurance contribution liability and ensure that those backdated earnings count for contributory benefit, occupational and statutory payment purposes. All the regulations apply to both Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and perhaps it would be helpful if I put the regulations into context by giving a short summary of the background to the National Insurance Contributions Act 2006.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000041"></a>The Paymaster General made a statement in the 2004 Pre-Budget Report that the Government were determined to ensure that all employees and employers pay the proper amount of tax and national insurance contributions on the rewards of employment, however those rewards are delivered, and on becoming aware of arrangements which were intended to frustrate this intention, we would introduce legislation to close them

To allow national insurance contributions legislation to be backdated to mirror retrospective tax changes, a National Insurance Contributions Bill was introduced on 11 October 2005, which became the National Insurance Contributions Act 2006 following Royal Assent on 30 March of that year.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000042"></a>The powers in the National Insurance Contributions Act 2006 enable the Government to deal effectively with any tax and national insurance contributions avoidance arrangements that emerge in the future which are designed to frustrate the intention that employers and employees should pay the proper amount of national insurance contributions on the rewards of employment.</p>

<p><a name="07032053000043"></a>The Social Security (Contributions) (Amendment No. 2) Regulations 2007 amend the principal Social Security (Contributions) Regulations 2001 to apply a backdated national insurance contributions liability on employment income from employment-related securities.</p>

<p><a name="07032053000044"></a>Provisions in Schedule 2 to the Finance Act (No. 2) 2005 and Section 92 of the Finance Act 2006 apply a tax charge to income from employment-related securities and securities options used in avoidance arrangements, backdated to 2 December 2004. The powers in the National Insurance Contributions Act 2006, being used here for the first time, allow for making regulations to apply a national insurance contributions liability to the same income, backdated to 2 December 2004.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000045"></a>The Social Security Contributions (Consequential Provisions) Regulations 2007 make provision to enable the recording, collection and recovery of the backdated national insurance contributions liability. Employers will be required to amend the pay records of those employees in receipt of retrospectively treated employment income for the years in which the income was actually received, applying the rate of national insurance contributions in force for the year in question. For national insurance contributions arising by virtue of the Social Security (Contributions) (Amendment No. 2) Regulations 2007, employers will have until 19 June 2007 to pay to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs the additional contributions due. Before 20 May 2008, employers must submit a separate return for each relevant year, setting out each affected employee&#146;s amended earnings and national insurance contributions. Where additional national insurance contributions due include primary contributions, employers will be liable to recover those contributions from the affected employees&#146; earnings during 2007-08 and 2008-09.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000046"></a>These social security regulations mirror the collection and recovery of tax provisions.

<p><a name="07032053000048"></a>Thirdly, the Social Security, Occupational Pensions Schemes and Statutory Payments (Consequential Provisions) Regulations 2007 ensure that payments subject to backdated national insurance contributions liability also count for contributory benefits, occupational pension and statutory payment purposes in order that employees do not lose out on their entitlements had the payments been earnings at the time they were paid.</p>

<p><a name="07032053000049"></a>These regulations and the collection regulations I mentioned earlier also provide the framework for dealing with any future payments which are retrospectively treated as earnings and not just those brought into liability by the Social Security (Contributions) (Amendment No. 2) Regulations 2007.</p>

<p><a name="07032053000050"></a>In keeping with the commitments given during the passage of the Bill last year, the regulations were published first in draft on 14 November 2005 and then on 16 August 2006 for comment. In general, the comments were helpful but did not suggest any substantial drafting issues. HMRC has published on its website a summary of the comments and responses. The majority of the comments focused on the national insurance contributions avoidance disclosure rules, which were also published at the same time. Those regulations are made under powers in the Act but are subject to negative resolution procedure. The comments received were exclusively points of fine detail and raised no issues of policy or principle.</p>

We debated the issues behind them at length when we considered the National Insurance Contributions Act 2006. While we have no desire to defend national insurance or tax avoidance, we did not then like the degree of retrospection that was involved in that Act and we have not much changed our minds since. However, I failed to convince either your Lordships&#146; House or the Government that this would all end in tears, so I will not revisit those issues today.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC187"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC187</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000054"></a>The regulations, so far as I can tell, produce the effect we expected from last year&#146;s Act when we considered it during its passage in your Lordships&#146; House, and to that extent they raise no new issues. However, I have some questions for the Minister, and the first relates to timing. The National Insurance Contributions Bill had its Third Reading in your Lordships&#146; House exactly one year ago today. At that stage it was merely sweeping up the provisions in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2005, but it has taken us a whole year to get to the stage where the regulations are finally working their way through the parliamentary process.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000055"></a>I understand that the Minister has said that the drafts were issued for consultation last August, but it seems incredibly laid-back of HMRC to take five months to put the regulations out for consultation, especially as the Minister said they were available in draft when the Bill was being considered. This does not seem an appropriate way for HMRC to behave; it seems arrogant. HMRC now has the ability to go back to 2004, so why on earth should it hurry to tell taxpayers how this will work in practice?</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000056"></a>Why has it taken so long to publish the regulations for consultation? The consultation took until December, and I do not suppose much new came from that extended process. It is now towards the end of March. That throws up questions about the commitment of HMRC to finalising such matters, or perhaps about its own efficiency.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000057"></a>My second question concerns whether HMRC is actually oriented to taxpayers&#146; needs. Paragraph 7.4 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Social Security Contributions (Amendment No. 2) Regulations says, and I paraphrase, &#147;It would take us an awfully long time to produce consolidated regulations and may even mean that we would have to go and talk to other departments, so we are not going to bother to do that. Who cares about the taxpayer trying to find out what he has to comply with? Certainly not HMRC&#148;.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000058"></a>One of the obligations that the Government and HMRC should have is to recognise that as they complicate and lengthen the tax code&#151;we debated this in connection with the Income Tax Bill last night&#151;and now a national insurance code, they have a corresponding obligation to ensure that taxpayers can easily access the rules that govern them. In this instance, HMRC has failed on that score.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000059"></a>Lastly, I shall return to the issue of consultation. What I had prepared to say was partly contradicted by the Minister&#146;s remarks. I was going to say that the regulations do not tell us much about the consultation process&#151;only, in paragraph 7.3 of the Social Security, Occupational Pension Schemes and Statutory Payments (Consequential Provisions) Regulations, that no significant comments were received. I was going to ask where those consultation responses had been published. I have searched the HMRC website and could not find them. Indeed, the Explanatory Memorandum does not say that they were going to be published. But what paragraph 7.4 of the Explanatory Memorandum states is that HMRC&#146;s response to the consultation comments will be published on its website. Does HMRC think it appropriate to publish the comments and its response  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC188"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC188</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to them before the parliamentary process, or does it regard the process as something that does not really trouble it? The Minister responded that they are published on the HMRC website.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000060"></a>I shall say two things: first, it is jolly difficult to navigate around HMRC&#146;s website using conventional search terms such as the titles of these orders&#151;I did not find them. If they are there and I did not find them, then clearly something has gone wrong, but I want also to make a more general plea that when documents are laid before Parliament and if important additional material relevant to their consideration is available, a clear signposting to precisely where they are located on the website would be helpful. That would aid those of us who struggle to find out what issues are troubling those who have responded to the consultations.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000061"></a>I am not an enthusiast of the regulations and the Minister will see that my principal concerns are related to HMRC&#146;s approach. It seems often not to care too much about taxpayers or even about Parliament. Perhaps I may suggest that HMRC displays qualities rather similar to those of its boss, the Chancellor, based on the fascinating analysis of the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, in the papers this morning. Does the Minister agree with me that the performance of HMRC in relation to these regulations leaves something to be desired? Do Ministers have any will to make improvements in this regard?</p>

<p><a name="07032053000062"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07032053000152"></a>Lord Newby:</b> In the debate in the House on the Income Tax Bill yesterday evening, both the noble Baroness and I took offence when the noble Lord, Lord Newton of Braintree, described us as &#147;docile&#148;. Having just listened to the debate on the statutory instruments relating to Northern Ireland, I suspect that the noble Lord must have been listening to Northern Ireland exchanges to colour his judgment of the way in which we approach these matters. While I am not sure that I will take any lessons from the debate we heard in Grand Committee earlier this afternoon, certainly the level of emotion which was evident is rarely exhibited by myself on statutory instruments or, indeed, on virtually any other matter that arises in your Lordships&#146; House on the Treasury brief.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000063"></a>We discussed the substantive Bill behind these regulations last year. At that point the issue of retrospective legislation was considered: we do not like it, is the best way of summing up our attitude. However, we accepted that we had to put up with it in this case, and these statutory instruments flow from that primary legislation. There are no further matters of principle arising here.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000064"></a>I agree absolutely with the comments of the noble Baroness regarding the consultation timetable because the sooner you can put through regulations that are retrospective, the less retrospective they will be. That must be a good thing. We often hear complaints about the timetable on consultation in other areas. People claim that they can be very tight. In this case the timetable appears to have been unduly relaxed and to have gone on for a long time. Given the  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC189"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC189</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>nature of the legislation and the fact that the number of people who would be likely to comment is clearly small because these issues are highly technical, the consultation could have been completed six months sooner.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000065"></a>I have only one question. In his introductory remarks the noble Lord mentioned that the purpose of the powers under which these regulations are being proposed is to deal with any arrangements which have emerged that have led to the avoidance of tax. What evidence is there that these regulations are necessary? Are they theoretically necessary or have specific cases been brought to the attention of HMRC which have proved that these regulations are needed? To the extent that they are necessary, is it possible to say, even broadly, whether these are major problems that have been dealt with here? Is there a lot of avoidance going on, or is it very narrow? I said yesterday evening that I thought it would be helpful in explaining the benefit of what was happening if we knew how many pages of legislation were being repealed. Here it would be useful to know how effective these regulations will be, simply because they are needed and there is a substantial problem. It would be helpful as a general rule when regulations of this sort come forward if the Government could give some assessment of the scale of the problem being addressed because it helps justify the regulations. With those caveats we support the regulations.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000067"></a>I recognise that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, starts from a significantly different point of principle from the Government; namely, she finds the aspect of retrospection so unacceptable that she does not like these regulations at all. I recognise that point.</p>

<p><a name="07032053000068"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07032053000154"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I should make it clear that, on the specifics, that was made clear when the Bill went through. That is what lay behind my comments. I did not like the regulations in the sense that it they had taken so long to get here, but the issue was made clear when the Bill went through. We need to keep as a separate issue how the Act might be used for further regulations. These regulations were in contemplation when the Act went through. When it is used later, you may get a slightly stronger speech from this Dispatch Box.</p>

Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof; so for the moment I will concentrate on the issues that the noble Baroness raised on these regulations. As I see it, these will not end in tears just yet but will in due course produce regulations that may cause us to relapse into tears. At the moment, it is just expressions of regret.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000070"></a>The noble Baroness addressed the delay of the regulations. I was a little concerned about the question on publicity, but I have the address. I would hesitate to read out a long and complicated website address, but if I find it I will certainly ensure that the noble Baroness has the address at the end of the sitting. That might satisfy the Committee. I can assure her that it has been put on the website. I am sorry that the signposts were not good enough to give her the assistance she needed. That is an important point, as we all know as we try to find our way round the complexities of websites. I will have a look at that and see whether it is in a more obscure corner than it should be. For the time being, and for the satisfaction of the Committee, the address is www.hmrc.gov.uk/employers/nicbill05.htm. I will furnish a copy of that address to the noble Baroness at the end of our deliberations.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000071"></a>The noble Baroness said that the consultation has been over-lengthy. She is bound to be critical about that because the regulations have a retrospective quality to them. I imagine that she would like them to take effect almost immediately the Bill becomes an Act. I understand that point. It is an easier demand to make in opposition than to fulfil in government, where it is quite clear that we have to go through the processes of consultation. These are not easy issues. If they were easy issues to handle, we would not need the regulations in the first place. The noble Baroness knows why we have the concept of &#147;future retrospection&#148;, if I can get my head around the tenses embodied in that. We have that because only after a time can we identify the nature of certain tax avoidance strategies that need to be dealt with. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked whether they were necessary.</p>

<p><a name="07032053000072"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07032053000156"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I am interested in the noble Lord&#146;s views on why it took so long to get the draft regulations out. Perhaps he could explain what changes were made between the point at which the first draft regulations were available, which was some time before the Bill was finally passed, and August, when they were finally published. Were there a lot of difficulties between the version that was produced before the Bill and the one that finally came out? It is my understanding that the issues were all settled.</p>

<p><a name="07032053000073"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07032053000157"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> Without going into the most abstruse detail, I do not know how I could identify the nature of the processes of consultation and effective changes, but I assure the noble Baroness that the coherent set of regulations we have today are the result of some considerable work. We took into account both the drafting refinements from the original draft regulations and the consultation process.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000074"></a>I was seeking to emphasise to the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that he will know that from time to time a range of strategies are pursued, in which remuneration is offered to often rather well remunerated individuals in any case by a whole range of stratagems to avoid tax contributions. We all remember the bottles of wine and the gold bars at one stage. We are now looking at  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC191"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column GC191</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>schemes that are different from those. Our strategy is designed to reduce the taxation impact of certain kinds of bonuses.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000075"></a>The Government&#146;s objective is quite straightforward. If an individual receives this remuneration by dint of their employment, they owe tax on that, and the employer also has an obligation to meet any payments with regard to contributions on it. That is an item of principle. I do not think we disagree across the Committee on this matter. It may be that the noble Baroness has a strategy for how one could anticipate such developments in a way that one would develop legislation that was all-encompassing, farsighted and all-foreseeing but still short enough for the noble Lord, Lord Newton, elsewhere to bring it within a compact Act with regard to the finance legislation as a whole, and all this would be encompassed by a skilful Government. We have the best skills to deploy at our disposal. We have very clear objectives, and we are prepared to put the resources in to reach them. But we do not find it quite as easy as the noble Baroness does; perhaps because she is putting the proposition from opposition while we are dealing with the reality in Government while also meeting all our requirements in terms of consultation and proper response.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000076"></a>I hear what she says. I agree with her entirely that regulations with a retrospective aspect to them are more urgent than may be the case with other regulations. We ought to seek to minimise the time factors involved, because by definition the aspect of retrospection is bound to increase as time goes on. I share that objective with her. I am merely indicating that it is no easy matter to produce regulations consequent upon legislation as significant as the 2006 Act.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000077"></a>I also emphasise in this context that the regulations are now in place. That has given us the chance to present with great clarity what we are seeking to achieve. That may help to meet the point that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, identified. Existing tax laws do not appear sufficiently comprehensive or well enough drafted to inhibit tax avoidance strategies. We have made it absolutely clear that we intend to be firm in this area. We have legislation on this, which the regulations reinforce. That sends a very clear signal to the wider world that no avoidance strategy is likely to be successful. We hope that we shall see a great deal fewer such strategies.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000078"></a>We all recognise that in the past year certain members of our society have received significant bonuses. Everyone wishes those who rise to a high position in society or in the City well. Nevertheless, we expect them to meet their obligations in full and not to become involved in stratagems to avoid tax, or for employers to avoid paying national insurance contributions.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000079"></a>I accept that the noble Baroness wishes that we had reached this point six months earlier. However, here we are on this day of grace with this coherent set of regulations which, if endorsed by the Committee, will enable us to act effectively to achieve the objectives that Her Majesty&#146;s Government desire.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000088"></a>The noble Baroness said: The orders before us are made under Section 104 of the Scotland Act, which allows for necessary or expedient changes in consequence of an Act of the Scottish Parliament. When Section 104 orders amend primary legislation, the Scotland Act requires them to be subject to affirmative resolution in both Houses.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000089"></a>The first order is the Tourist Boards (Consequential Modifications) Order. This is made in consequence of the Tourist Boards (Scotland) Act 2006&#151;an Act of the Scottish Parliament which received Royal Assent on 30 November 2006. The purpose of the 2006 Act was to put the new VisitScotland integrated network on a proper legal footing. The Scottish Tourist Board is already operating under the banner of VisitScotland, but it is the 2006 Act, which comes into force on 1 April, that will officially change the name of the organisation. This is why it is necessary to take forward this order now.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000090"></a>This order amends primary legislation by removing references to the &#147;Scottish Tourist Board&#148; substituting with &#147;VisitScotland&#148; in the following pieces of legislation: House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975; Race Relations Act 1976; Tourism (Overseas Promotion) (Scotland) Act 1984; Greater London Authority Act 1999; and Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Exemption) Order 2001. The order will also amend the Development of Tourism Act 1969 by replacing

The 1969 Act also contains references to the board of the Scottish Tourist Board and its maximum size. The order will amend these references to reflect the changes made under the 2006 Act of the Scottish Parliament.</p>
<h5><a name="07032053000133"></a>6 pm</h5>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000091"></a>The 2006 Act removed the statutory requirement that there be area tourist boards and changed the legal name from the Scottish Tourist Board to VisitScotland. The maximum size of the VisitScotland board was increased from six to 11 to take account of the wider role of the new organisation in promoting tourism in Scotland. The order before us will amend the UK statute book to reflect those changes.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000092"></a>I now turn to the second order, which is made in consequence of the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2006&#151;an Act of the Scottish Parliament which received Royal Assent on 4 July 2006. The 2006 Act introduced three new police organisations in Scotland: the Scottish Police Services Authority (SPSA), the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency (SCDEA) and the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000093"></a>The 2006 Act allows for police constables from Scotland and UK-wide police forces to be seconded to the SPSA and the SCDEA. Constables may also be recruited directly to the SCDEA. The order makes a number of modifications to UK legislation so that police members of the SCDEA may continue to receive pensions and so that constables from elsewhere in the UK seconded to the SPSA or SCDEA may continue to belong to the Police Federation.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000094"></a>The 2006 Act also establishes the commissioner, who will be responsible for overseeing the existing police complaints process in Scotland. The order allows UK-wide law enforcement agencies operating in Scotland to enter into agreements with the commissioner to extend the commissioner&#146;s remit to oversee civil complaints made against those forces, for which there are currently no oversight arrangements.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0005.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000095"></a>The order will also make provisions for UK bodies, such as the British Transport Police, which are regulated by reserved legislation, to disclose information to the SCDEA and the police complaints commissioner, without breaching any obligation of secrecy or other restrictions placed on the disclosure of information.</p>

<p><a name="07032053000096"></a>The 2006 Act extends the investigatory powers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Act 2000 to the director general of the SCDEA and revokes the powers exercised by the director general of the predecessor organisation, the SDEA. The order mirrors the 2006 Act by extending investigatory powers to the director general under the equivalent Westminster legislation, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. That will ensure that the director general of the SCDEA has parity with police forces and other law enforcement agencies when dealing with cross-border matters. The order

<a name="70320-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000097"></a>The 2006 Act also provides for football banning orders in Scotland to counter football-related crime. The 2006 Act allows Scottish courts to impose football banning orders on individuals convicted of a football-related offence, instead of, or in addition to, any sentence handed down by the court. This order will give police and courts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland powers to enforce Scottish banning orders. Where a person is subject to a Scottish football banning order and breaches it in England, Wales or Northern Ireland they will commit an offence. This mitigates the need for multiple banning orders to be taken out in each of the jurisdictions against any one individual and provides for a robust UK-wide regime for tackling cross-Border football-related crime.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000098"></a>I hope noble Lords will agree that these orders are a sensible use of the powers in the Scotland Act and that the practical result is to be welcomed. I commend them to the Committee.</p>

I gather that she is already an old hand at taking these Front-Bench presentation positions and I look forward to having my knowledge and understanding increased as we talk across some of the Scottish elements that come through these days.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000101"></a>One has to wonder why the legal name of the Scottish Tourist Board has to be changed when a new marketing brand is desired. It seems to me that marketing brands are a bit like the suburban housewife who likes changing the wallpaper. I wonder whether there is a body called &#147;VisitEngland&#148; with which the newly-named body will link up to make a more unified presentation for the United Kingdom. Perhaps England has area tourist boards, whereas the Scottish area tourist boards have been done away with.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000102"></a>The measure is fairly innocuous, but tourism in Scotland is an important topic, considering that 9 per cent of employment is in that industry and a great deal of investment and encouragement is directed at improving tourism. Noble Lords will know that tourism currently generates some &#163;4.2 billion for the Scottish economy. I was reading the current report of the consideration of these measures in another place; it was either a misprint or a slip of the tongue on behalf of my honourable friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby, when he said that the tourism industry generated &#163;46 billion for the Scottish economy. If that were true, I have a funny feeling that Mr Alex Salmond would not be looking, as he is, for the oil revenues to be added to the Scottish block grant.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000103"></a>In tourism we love the English&#151;despite many of the rather hostile things that Scots can be accused of&#151;because 86 per cent of our visitors come from the

I gather that overseas visits increased by 14 per cent in the first nine months of 2006. I wonder how much that was due to the name change. That makes the VisitScotland target of increasing visitors by 20 per cent by 2015 seem like a fairly laid-back approach. Perhaps the ambitions will be increased&#151;but certainly the quality should be increased.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000104"></a>The second order on the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act is a good measure and has generally been welcomed by Conservatives north of the Border. The successful separation of law and law enforcement has been a great feature of our Union, but modern crime and law infringement has become very sophisticated and powerful. As noble Lords are probably aware, drug crime is a great problem north of the Border and identified drug crime has increased by 46 per cent in the past few years. So we need measures that open up cross-Border co-operation and enforcement&#151;not just between Scotland and England, but between the United Kingdom and other countries. The ability to share information is important.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000105"></a>I thought perhaps that a few more interested bodies might have attended this Grand Committee, given that we were talking about football banning orders&#151;and I know that many noble Lords have much enthusiasm for football.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000106"></a>I was amused to notice in the order that if a person has,</p>
<ul><a name="07032053000127"></a>&#147;reasonable excuse for failing to comply with the requirement&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07032053000126"></a>of a football banning order, he can be excused. However, one wonders at that, given that there are many keen, imaginative minds in football; and while some of the excuses might be rather far-fetched, the provision states &#147;reasonable&#148;, after all. Someone could say that he just happened to be on a bus that was going in a certain direction. Much will depend on the extent of the banning order. It would be interesting to know if the Minister knows to what degree geographical areas will be covered by the banning orders, or will they just cover the area near the match itself?</p>

I have very few comments. Exactly as their titles state, these orders are consequential provisions and modifications on decisions that have been taken by the Scottish Parliament on devolved matters and simply make the adjustments that are needed in UK statute. We support them fully and see them very much as tidying up issues of Scottish devolved responsibility&#151;that is our only role.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000108"></a>I must admit that I was interested to see that the name change to VisitScotland affected legislation regarding the Greater London Authority and the exemptions list in the Financial Services and Markets Act. I wondered whether that was carte blanche for members of VisitScotland to go off to start all sorts of derivatives and options markets without interference by the Financial Services Authority. I am sure that that is not the case.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000109"></a>On the police order, I must admit that I did not realise that the Civil Nuclear Police Authority actually existed, so this has been a most educative process. I support these orders.</p>

<p><a name="07032053000110"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07032053000163"></a>Baroness Carnegy of Lour:</b> I agree with both of the previous speakers that these orders are benign and necessary. I want to ask the Minister one question, if she does not mind. The second order mentions agreements between the partners and agencies north and south of the Border in order to get the issues that arise from devolution sorted out. We are coming to a situation where it is possible that there will be a different political party in power in the Scottish Parliament to that at Westminster, which means that there will be considerable strain on such agreements&#151;much more than there is at the moment.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000111"></a>We all recognise that. Personally, I think that the Scotland Act is standing up well to the stresses and strains of events as they move forward; but as we develop such agreements it will be important that they stand. Can the Minister tell us whether those agreements are enforceable? Are they written agreements to which people have committed themselves? How will they stand up if there is a strain in the coming years imposed by having different political parties in power? She probably understands what I mean. It is important that the arrangements continue to work smoothly, particularly in relation to the police and the new police complaints commissioner in Scotland and how his or her arrangements will work south of the Border&#151;and in relation to police pensions.</p>

<p><a name="07032053000112"></a><b><a name="70320-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07032053000164"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> I thank noble Lords for their kind welcome and their kind words about my first appearance at the Dispatch Box on a Scottish matter. As a Celt, I am proud to be speaking on Scottish and Welsh matters and this has been a very interesting introduction for me, too. Like the noble Duke, I found this an instructive beginning.</p>
<h5><a name="07032053000134"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70320-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000113"></a>The noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, asked about &#147;VisitEngland&#148;. I am advised that there is no &#147;VisitEngland&#148; in existence, but there is an Enjoy England and a VisitBritain. I am not sure whether we will get secondary legislation if there are more name changes. The noble Duke also asked about the legal name change. The orders before us simply provide up-to-date references to VisitScotland to replace the redundant references to the Scottish Tourist Board; they are about keeping UK legislation neat and tidy, up to date and properly consolidated&#151;that might not be exactly the right word; perhaps &#147;properly in tune&#148;&#151;with Scottish legislation.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000114"></a>On tourism revenue, the noble Duke is right to stress the importance to the Scottish economy of tourism. I am advised that for 2006-07, VisitScotland has set a target of achieving &#163;30 for every pound it spends on tourism marketing in UK campaigns, and &#163;23 of additional tourism income for every pound spent marketing Scotland in Europe. Although those are very specific targets, I hope that the noble Duke

As to whether they can be attributed specifically to the name change, there are probably people doing PhDs and degrees in marketing on that very subject.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000115"></a>The noble Duke asked about football banning orders and the area that they apply to. It is fair to say that these banning orders apply to football matches, but they can also apply to areas that are known to be flashpoints where football hooligans, for want of a better phrase, gather in order to engage in violence and intimidation. The 2006 Act provided for football banning orders that would ban a person from all regulated football matches. It means that a breach of a football banning order imposed by Scottish courts will be an offence under English and Welsh law. Anyone subject to a Scottish FBO who attends a regulated football match in the UK will commit an offence, and can be fined and imprisoned for up to six months. I hope that answers his question.</p>

<a name="70320-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07032053000116"></a>I shall pick up on the noble Baroness&#146;s important point about agreements. In my introduction I talked about lots of different organisations and the importance of them sharing information in cross-border collaboration. It is fair to say that the Government believe that the current structure of devolution is working well, and fully expect agreements between police authorities to continue regardless of the political make-up of the Scottish Executive or the UK Government. We are talking about agreements that are set at an operational level, not a political level. The experience and the time put into developing these working relationships mean that they will stand the test of time. I hope that I can offer reassurance on that.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="07032036000012"></a>My Written Ministerial Statement of 29 November 2006 (<I>Official Report</I>, col. <I>WS 108</I>) contained an error. The first tiret of the second paragraph should have read:</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="07032036000013"></a><b><a name="70320-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07032036000057"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My honourable friend the Economic Secretary (Ed Balls) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="07032036000014"></a>As announced in the 2005 Pre-Budget Report, the Government have been working with the banking and building society sector to design an unclaimed assets scheme which both preserves the rights of the individual consumer and at the same time allows these assets to be reinvested in the community. The Government welcomed the commitment from the industry and since then we have been working together to design a scheme.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07032036000015"></a>The Government are today publishing a consultation document outlining a proposed scheme, including details of the banks' and building societies' proposed changes to the banking code and proposals for legislation.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="07032036000016"></a>The proposal is made with the support of the British Bankers' Association and the Building Societies Association and these organisations have signalled in the foreword to the consultation document their commitment to making the scheme work successfully.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="07032036000017"></a>A further consultation document will be released later in the spring to consider the most effective means of distributing the available assets, taking as its basis the statement in the 2005 Pre-Budget Report that the funds should be reinvested in the community, with a focus on youth services that are responsive to the needs of young people, and also on financial inclusion and capability.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="07032036000018"></a>The 2005 Pre-Budget Report also announced that there will be an option for small locally based financial institutions to focus on these needs in their local communities. These will typically be building societies, often playing an important role in these communities. It is proposed that small locally based financial institutions will be defined by reference to a threshold level of total assets as in practice this indicates both relatively small and local institutions.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS82"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column WS82</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="07032036000019"></a>In line with previous announcements, it is proposed that banks and building societies will participate in the scheme on a voluntary basis, but the scheme will be backed by legislation to resolve issues concerning financial liability for the participating financial institutions and their customers.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="07032036000020"></a>It is proposed that the unclaimed assets scheme will apply to bank and building society accounts where there has been no customer-initiated activity for at least 15 years. On this basis, the banks and building societies estimate that a stock of several hundred million pounds may currently lie unclaimed. They also estimate that a further flow of perhaps tens of millions of pounds may become available each year. These estimates are before the impact of a comprehensive reuniting exercise that banks and building societies will launch in advance of the scheme, building on their existing arrangements to help customers track down their accounts.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="07032036000021"></a>It is proposed that unclaimed assets falling within the definition will be transferred to a central reclaim fund. However, for customers the process for reclaiming the money will not change&#151;they need simply to visit their bank or building society, which will repay them as now. The reclaim fund will bear the financial risk for repaying customers who want to reclaim their assets after the introduction of the scheme. Centralising the risk in a single reclaim fund will allow it to be pooled and managed as efficiently as possible. The reclaim fund will need to be managed prudently so that money is available to fund applications for reclaim. Banks and building societies will be responsible for calculating the amounts to be transferred and for handling the interaction with those customers, so customers will not need to have a direct relationship with the reclaim fund. It is proposed that the reclaim fund will be a freestanding body, independent of government, the banking industry and the distribution mechanism. It could either be an existing body or a new body. The banking industry's representative bodies will take the lead in selecting or setting up the body, which will then be wholly independent.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="07032036000022"></a>The reclaim fund will hand over for reinvestment in the community those assets not needed to cover anticipated reclaim requests. The need to manage assets for potential reclaim at a later date in order to protect customers' interests will, of course, mean that the reclaim fund will need to hold back a proportion of the assets it receives from the banks and building societies. As well as effective and prudential management of the fund, it is also proposed that customers' interests will be further safeguarded by access to the Financial Ombudsman Service for any disputes between themselves, the fund, and their bank or building society on these issues, and changes to the banking code will clarify how the banks and building societies will themselves interact with the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="07032036000023"></a>Copies of the consultation document will be available in the Libraries of the House.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="07032036000028"></a><b><a name="70320-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="07032036000059"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Triesman):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs (Ian McCartney) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="07032036000029"></a>I am pleased to publish today the Government's report to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on the UK's progress with implementation of the OECD Bribery Convention. This complements the report my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) published on 12 March, <I>Combating international corruption: UK action plan 2006-07: interim progress report</I>, which summarised a wide range of activities we have undertaken to tackle international corruption. The report published today, which was a subject for discussion last week in Paris at the OECD Working Group on Bribery, accounts for the work we have done in response to the OECD's &#147;phase 2 review&#148; of the UK, published in March 2005. It outlines the achievements we have made in implementing the OECD Bribery Convention, as well as addressing some of the challenges we have come across in this work. Some additional developments post-date the Government's submission of the report to the OECD.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="07032036000030"></a>First, the changes we have made to UK co-ordination in this area are significant, allowing us to be more effective in our efforts across the board. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development's appointment as the ministerial lead on fighting corruption was important. But this is by no means the only development. On the law enforcement side, there has been major progress. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has made it clear to all law enforcement agencies in the UK what practical support it can offer to transnational investigations. On specifics, the Government have confirmed the lead role of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in handling foreign bribery allegations and the SFO has created a special unit to vet such allegations. Since March 2005, the SFO has received 53 allegations, launched six new  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS84"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column WS84</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>investigations and made four arrests. My noble and learned friend the Attorney-General (Lord Goldsmith) has stated that he will seek additional resources for the SFO's work in this area, should that be necessary.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="07032036000031"></a>With funding from the Department for International Development (DfID), the City of London Police created a new dedicated 10-person unit to increase law enforcement capacity to investigate foreign bribery allegations. Set up in November 2006, the unit has already taken on four investigations and made its first arrests in January. In parallel, DfID has funded extra staff for the Metropolitan Police Service's Proceeds of Corruption unit to increase the UK's capacity to counter the laundering of corrupt assets in the UK's financial system. The Metropolitan Police has &#163;34.6 million-worth of allegedly corrupt assets under restraint. The Met has responded to requests from the Nigerian Government relating to two former Nigerian state governors. In one case, &#163;1 million has been returned. In the other, property bought in London&#151;which was frozen by swift police action under the 2002 Proceeds of Crime Act&#151;will now be sold so that the funds can be returned to the people of Nigeria from whom they were stolen. We have worked hard on proposals for an International Corruption Investigation Support Centre; a facility which poor countries can use to obtain legal advice on asset recovery and mutual legal assistance. There have been discussions with other interested donors and key service providers. An international expert meeting will take place on 21 March to agree proposals. Furthermore, changes in the UK's mutual legal assistance mechanisms will result in faster execution of requests from other countries.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="07032036000032"></a>In addition, the FCO has assumed a greater co-ordinating role in awareness-raising activities. This has allowed us to make best use of our guidance materials&#151;a revised leaflet explaining UK anti-corruption law and a DVD, launched by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development and myself last November. There is more systematic training for officials working overseas and law enforcement personnel, the latter drawing particularly on the experience of the Ministry of Defence Police Fraud Squad. And the fight against corruption has featured in the FCO's regular dialogue with the trades union movement, to complement the rolling programme of sessions we hold for the UK business community, both in the UK and overseas. So, all in all, including inside the Palace of Westminster, there is much greater awareness in the UK of international corruption than there was a few years ago.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="07032036000033"></a>I should comment on legislative developments since March 2005, beginning with the question of comprehensive corruption legislation, which has been taken forward since we submitted this written report to the OECD last month. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (John Reid) published the Government's response to the Home Office's 2005-06 consultation on 5 March (<I>Official Report</I>, col. <I>WS 115</I>) and his Statement dealt with it in detail. Times have changed since the Law Commission first reported on this area of the law in 1998. Not only has the OECD published three reports  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS85"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column WS85</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on the UK's implementation of this convention and the UN convention come into force, our law enforcement agencies now have several years' practical experience of applying the UK's current legal framework. All of these have helped to inform the Government's thinking. We continue to believe that our law meets the requirements of the OECD convention. The objective of this exercise is to clarify and modernise our legislation. As my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department made clear last week, the consultation confirmed that there is broad support for reform of the Prevention of Corruption Acts and the Government remain committed to a fundamental reform. We shall bring forward legislative proposals as soon as we are in a position to do so. Ministers have asked the Law Commission to review the law of bribery and, in the light of their findings, to prepare a draft Bill, complete with extra resources to expedite the process. The Law Commission will have a broad mandate to consider the full range of structural options for a new modern and consolidated bribery law.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="07032036000034"></a>We have also been active in a number of other international fora. For example, the UK was a key participant at the first Conference of States Parties to the UN Convention against Corruption in December 2006, ensuring that we can take forward implementation on the crucial issues of asset recovery, technical assistance and review mechanisms. We also funded the participation at that conference of civil society representatives from more than a dozen developing countries to ensure that their voice was heard. And we continue to help to deliver on G8 anti-corruption commitments; for example, on asset recovery.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="07032036000035"></a>The report also outlines a good degree of progress in the crown dependencies and overseas territories. Guernsey and Jersey have both made progress towards implementing international anti-corruption treaties, as have several Overseas Territories. We have already extended the UN Convention against Corruption to the British Virgin Islands and hope to be in a position to extend this and the OECD convention to the Cayman Islands when it enacts new legislation later this year. We shall continue to raise the subject with the dependencies and territories at relevant opportunities, including at the highest level.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="07032036000036"></a>Following on from this week's discussions in Paris, the Government will continue to inform the OECD of further progress in this vital area. This co-operation will include our usual constructive approach to the preparation for and conduct of a future on-site visit to the UK by experts from two other OECD countries in the coming year and contributions to a further written report on the UK. The visit and report will focus on the operation of our legal framework and law enforcement capacity and systems. We fully anticipate further recognition of the high level of transparency that characterises the UK's activities in this field. And we welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the degree of our commitment to all aspects of the fight against international corruption. As well as work under the OECD Bribery Convention, we shall continue to pursue our wider efforts in this regard, including by pushing for

<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="07032036000038"></a>The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) set up the Clergy Working Group in 2004 to look at clergy working conditions as part of its review of employment status issues. The working group included representatives from trade unions and many faith groups and was chaired by the DTI.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="07032036000039"></a>Discussions within the Clergy Working Group have resulted in the development of a statement of good practice. The statement represents minimum standards which faith groups should aim to achieve, on a voluntary basis, in a variety of areas&#151;terms and conditions of work; resolving disputes; development and personnel support; and information and consultation.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="07032036000040"></a>As a first step, the DTI is asking faith groups to assess the current position in relation to the standards in the statement and in two years&#146; time will ask faith groups what progress has been made. Individuals will have an opportunity to contribute to this process at both stages. Based on the information and evidence provided, the DTI will consider whether any further action is appropriate, including legislative action. The DTI will encourage other faith groups, which did not participate in the working group, to consider joining this process.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="07032036000048"></a>Further to the Statement of 2 May 2006 by the honourable Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Office, announcing the proposed introduction of interviews for adult first-time passport customers, the House will wish to know that I am announcing today the opening of the first passport interview offices commencing in May with further offices to be added progressively throughout 2007.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="07032036000049"></a>Passport interviews are part of the continuing fight against attempted passport fraud and forgery and are being introduced alongside other counter-fraud initiatives. These changes are critical because of increasing levels of attempted passport and identity fraud. It is widely recognised that the very nature of identity fraud makes it difficult to be precise when estimating the scale of the problem in terms of the number of fraudulent passport applications. The Identity and Passport Service has sought to address this issue through special exercises that scrutinise a representative sample of passport applications.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="07032036000050"></a>During the period 31 October 2005 to 30 September 2006, a sample of several thousand applications was scrutinised by specialist Identity and Passport Service teams with support from fraud investigators. This found that 0.25 per cent of applications (equivalent to 16,500 fraudulent passport applications a year) were  


<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS88"></a><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column WS88</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>believed to be from people attempting to obtain a passport fraudulently. Almost half of these applications were stopped by existing Identity and Passport Service processes. The remainder had gone undetected. Our current estimate is therefore that the level of undetected fraud is about 0.15 per cent (equivalent to 10,000 applications against the planned 6.6 million passports issued per year).</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="07032036000051"></a>Although precise figures are difficult to obtain, it appears that the level of attempted fraud is increasing and getting more sophisticated. Analysis of the frauds shows that the main fraud threat is from first-time adult applications followed by first-time child applications.</p>

<a name="70320-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="07032036000052"></a>The Identity and Passport Service has developed a comprehensive counter-fraud strategy that will help to mitigate these patterns of fraud including:</p>
checking biographical information to ensure that the identity claimed on the application form is real, living, and can be linked to the customer through cross checks against a range of public and private sector databases;the development of facial recognition systems to check applicant images against a database of images of suspected fraudsters;checking applicants against increasingly sophisticated internal watch files including the database of passports reported lost or stolen;strengthening its business processes for identity authentication, and training and support for passport examiners and specialist fraud units; and interviews for all first-time adult customers.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="07032036000053"></a>The requirement to attend an interview will be introduced gradually, starting with modest volumes of interviews in a limited number of interview offices, from May 2007, with the Identity and Passport Service progressively adding further offices through to the end of 2007. This progressive introduction will enable the Identity and Passport Service to enhance the interview process for customers using feedback from the early interviews.</p>

It was introduced to replace the previous support scheme, the non fossil fuels obligation (NFFO), which was a form of a feed-in tariff, in 2002. A review of the RO, carried out in 2005-06, confirmed the RO was a successful mechanism for encouraging greater deployment of renewables generation, maintaining investor confidence and increasing value for money for the customer. Since its introduction, eligible renewable electricity generated under the scheme has increased to 4.0 per cent of total electricity sales to UK consumers in 2005&#151;up from 1.8 per cent in 2002. This makes it more successful than the NFFO, under which the proportion of renewables rose from 0.2 per cent of electricity sales in 1992 to 1.8 per cent in 2002.</p>

collect and share emerging good practice in the promotion of choice and diversity, including through the publication of an annual report that brings together data on parental satisfaction and school standards;work with local authorities, schools and other partners to help to identify the right reform solutions for poorly performing schools;champion trust schools and academies as key levers in raising standards, particularly in deprived areas;identify suitable potential partners for trusts and academies and facilitate the matching of schools to those partners;maintain a record of all proposals relating to trusts and make it available via the DfES website. This will allow a school interested in acquiring a particular trust to access information about it and to follow up any questions with the school or trust in question; monitor and promote fair access, including through producing a two-yearly national review of fair access based on national data and the annual reports provided by admissions forums;work with local authorities to build capacity to help fulfil the new commissioning role set out in the White Paper <I>Higher Standards, Better Schools for All</I> (October 2005); andwork closely with a range of stakeholders, including the directors for children and learners
