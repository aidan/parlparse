<A NAME = "51211-01_head0"></A><H3><center>National Health Service: Mixed-sex Wards</center></H3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What action has been taken and what progress has been made to eliminate mixed-sex wards in National Health Service hospitals following the launch of the new Patient's Charter on 18th January 1995.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Baroness Cumberlege): </B>  My Lords, we issued guidance to the NHS in March this year about implementing the revised Patient's Charter. We have carried out a survey into local policies, standards and design of wards. The results will be published shortly.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. However, is she aware that there is still a great deal of concern about mixed-sex wards, not only among individual patients but also on the part of the Patients Association? Will the Minister tell the House what methods are being used to monitor the elimination of mixed-sex wards? Can she say whether Nightingale wards have now been eliminated? If not, how long will it be before they are? Are separate toilet and washing facilities available? What about new hospitals: does their planning and construction take into account the need for single-sex facilities for everyone who wishes them?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I am very much aware that people are extremely concerned about mixed-sex wards. Nightingale wards were last built in 1948 and no new ones have been built since then. The present situation is monitored through health authorities and their contracts. We are also monitoring centrally through the survey that I mentioned. Regarding toilet and washing facilities, there is a requirement on trusts to ensure that these are separate.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, is it not a fact, however, that, under new hospital designs going back at least 20 years, there are adequate facilities? Is it not the older hospitals that lack such facilities? Will my noble friend confirm that, although everyone is concerned about mixed-sex wards and most people do not like them, there is a difference between a long-stay ward and a short transit stay in, for instance, a recovery room or in intensive care, where other matters are paramount?
<P>


<a name="column_1094"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1094</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   Yes, my Lords, my noble friend is correct. There are now "bays" in place which are, in effect, self-contained compartments. They are still described as single wards because there are a number of such bays within one ward. They provide the privacy and dignity that people want, although they are part of a single ward. There are areas, such as intensive care and day surgery, where it is perhaps inappropriate to ensure that the sexes are separated, since the length of stay is likely to be hours rather than days.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister agree with me that it is unsuitable for a young woman in her 20s to be the only female in a ward with five men? The person to whom I refer was asked if she would go into such a ward and was so frightened that her operation would be put back that she agreed. She said that she hated every single moment. That was at Odstock Hospital, near Salisbury.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, there are occasions when it is not possible to ensure that people have their wish to be in a single-sex ward. The situation is put to them and they can then choose to wait for the next available bed in a single-sex ward. They do not go to the bottom of the list; they are still treated very quickly.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-01_para0"></a>There is another side to this issue. According to at least one survey, some 20 per cent. of patients were not even aware that they had been in a mixed-sex ward.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew6"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   I know, my Lords, the mind boggles. Indeed, some female patients stated that they preferred a mixed-sex ward; they found it therapeutic and believed that it aided their recovery.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister agree that, although a minority of patients may feel as she describes, the vast majority are unhappy about this situation? Is she aware that at the recent AGM of the Patients Association that I attended I was surprised to find speakers from different parts of the country referring to new facilities that did not allow for single-sex provision, although I believe it was one of the understandings of the new Patient's Charter? Is it possible for the Department of Health to ensure, through the contracting process, that new facilities offer this choice? If it is not possible, is it not unfortunately another sign of the fragmentation of the NHS about which we on these Benches are so concerned?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, our guidance is quite clear: certainly new facilities should enable dignity and privacy. In that we include bays for single sexes. The guidance is issued. It is up to health authorities, when they let their contracts, to ensure what the position is. However, there are old hospital buildings where it is very difficult to accommodate people's wishes.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that, as the questioning continued, I have become more concerned about this issue? It seems that the National Health Service accepts mixed-sex wards as a norm. That, in fact, is completely outside the <P>


<a name="column_1095"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1095</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>recommendations of the Patient's Charter. Is she aware that of the 1,000 letters that I have received about this matter, not one single letter was in favour of mixed-sex wards? Certainly nobody suggested to me that it was therapeutic to be treated in a mixed-sex ward--quite the reverse. Will she accept that very many patients told me that being in a mixed-sex ward retarded their progress? Indeed, one family blamed the mixed-sex ward for the death of a relative.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I very much respect the noble Lord's views and accept entirely the contents of the letters that he received. But there is a balance to be maintained. We want people to retain their dignity and have their privacy respected. That is what it says in the Patient's Charter. They are told what the situation is and are allowed to refuse such an admission, in which case they will receive the next admission in an appropriate ward. However, in some hospitals which do not have such accommodation that would mean that the patient would have to move to another hospital. Toilet facilities are different and we are very determined that they should be separated. The other part of the equation is clinical care. In 1992 the Audit Commission's report said that it was more important to have a single specialty ward than a single-sex ward in terms of the delivery of care and the quality of care provided.

<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Hooson </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they support the series of Trans-European Network projects designed to give Europe an integrated transport and communications infrastructure.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew12"></A><B> The Earl of Courtown: </B>   Yes, my Lords, we do.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for that reply and note its brevity. I appreciate very much that these days in certain circles the term "integrated" is regarded as a dirty word. Nevertheless, do the Government agree that we need to have special transport strategies to enable us to take the greatest possible economic advantage of the single market? In particular, can the noble Earl say what steps the Government are taking to ensure that not only the south east of England but the whole of the United Kingdom can take advantage of, for example, the Channel Tunnel and the improved facilities in the Channel ports which are the gateway to Europe not only for south-east England but the whole of the United Kingdom?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew14"></A><B> The Earl of Courtown: </B>   My Lords, the Government have a clear transport strategy. One of their main aims is to strike the right balance between healthy economic development, protecting the environment and sustaining future quality of life. However, the Government's role is not to tell transport operators what services to provide or to tell people where and how to travel.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Earl aware that there is concern in Wales about the <P>


<a name="column_1096"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1096</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>implications of these network projects? Can he give the House an assurance that the projects will extend so far as Fishguard in South Wales and Holyhead in North Wales?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew16"></A><B> The Earl of Courtown: </B>   My Lords, the Fishguard rail link is not represented at present on the draft combined transport network as it is not used for the transport of unitised freight. British Rail believes that there is no immediate prospect of combined transport services being developed on that route.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Earl say whether this matter has been discussed with the Secretary of State for Wales and the Welsh Office? If it has not been discussed, does he agree that that is an extremely serious situation? There will be a great deal of dissatisfaction in Wales when they hear what the noble Earl has said.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Courtown: </B>   My Lords, the Ireland-UK-Benelux road link project consists of a number of schemes which are in the road programmes of the Department of Transport, the Welsh Office and the Scottish Office and which are at varying states of readiness. From this tranche of funds from TENs approximately &#163;1.6 million in funding was obtained for this route in 1995.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Mersey: </B>   My Lords, perhaps my noble friend will correct me if I am wrong. Am I right to understand that two routes were planned from Felixstowe, one to finish at Fishguard and the other to end at Holyhead? Is not there also a fast route planned from Stranraer down to the M.6 at Carlisle? Does my noble friend have any more specific details on those three schemes?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Courtown: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for his question. I should like to answer him fully. The priority projects for the United Kingdom will receive some &#163;22 million, which is just over 15 per cent. of the total funds available for priority projects in 1995 and more than any other member state will receive from the EC fund. In addition to the &#163;7 million for the west coast main line, the Channel Tunnel rail link will receive &#163;13.6 million and schemes along the Ireland-UK-Benelux road link will receive a further &#163;1.6 million. The United Kingdom will also receive another &#163;360,000 for road traffic management.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister accept that the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, were very appropriate for the part of the world from which I come? Is he aware that there was great argument 30 years ago about the Channel Tunnel and a great deal of support came from the north of England, Wales and Scotland because it was believed that it would break down the barrier so that industrial goods and railway passengers could take a route straight down from Scotland and those other areas right to the heart of Europe? If the idea of the Channel Tunnel had merely been to enrich the south east of England, it would not have been well accepted.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-02_para0"></a> Could I ask the noble Earl whether he is aware of the recent Motion carried in the European Parliament debate on the grand European network? That Motion <P>


<a name="column_1097"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1097</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>stressed the need for top environmental standards and emphasised the importance of upgrading the west coast line which serves the Midlands, north-east England and Scotland. Can he also tell us the Government's view of the amendment which was carried requiring that a minimum of 40 per cent. of investment should be in railways and no more than 25 per cent. in roads? Have the Government considered that Motion which was carried in the European Parliament?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Courtown: </B>   My Lords, I cannot answer the exact question asked by the noble Lord. An efficient transport infrastructure is essential to national competitiveness. The road network is at the heart of our infrastructure, but the size and content of a national road programme must take account of the Government's overall policy and circumstances. We must contribute to the Government's commitment to keep a firm control on expenditure.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend able to confirm that the Channel Tunnel was in fact built without any help from Brussels? Also, are not the projects addressed by the Question more the fruit of European corporatist ambitions to rebuild their economy after the distress brought by socialist policies? Finally, can he confirm that the cost involved is &#163;110,000 million and say how much of that the United Kingdom is expected to spend?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Courtown: </B>   My Lords, the Channel Tunnel was funded exclusively from private funds. The UK supports the objective of Article 129 of the Maastricht Treaty to realise the benefits of an efficient single market by developing networks in transport, telecoms and energy infrastructure.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Earl confirm that scope exists for private, public and European investment? It is necessary for the strategy of this country to be in tune with that of the Continent so that we have the benefit of an integrated--if that is the right term--transport system that will benefit the economy of the whole of western Europe.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Courtown: </B>   My Lords, Article 129c of the Maastricht Treaty states that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Community ... may support ... projects of common interest financed by Member States". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The Commission and member states agreed that the intention was to support large infrastructure projects of common interest whether they were provided by the public sector or solely or jointly by the private sector.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, the reductions to the World Service were almost entirely to its capital allocation. The private finance initiative offers scope to <P>


<a name="column_1098"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1098</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>make that up through greater use of private sector finance and expertise. There is also scope for greater efficiencies. The BBC World Service is a superb asset and will remain the world's leading international radio broadcaster. Meanwhile, BBC World TV News is growing rapidly, at no cost to the taxpayer.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his Answer, though he failed to come clean. The reduction must mean cuts in services because it involves a massive 20 per cent. cut in capital this year and further big cuts in both operating and capital next year in complete breach of the 1994 triennial agreement with the BBC. Is the Minister aware that one of his noble friends, when reflecting on his distinguished period as Foreign Secretary, concluded,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"When I was Foreign Secretary, I was told I had to save money on the Overseas Service of the BBC. I think that was really totally counter-productive and the money saved was trivial compared to the amount of damage done". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Does the Minister disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, that the reductions are the most foolish and false of economies?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, we have done everything possible to keep the reductions to a minimum. Next year's percentage reduction is lower than that of the Foreign Office--3.1 per cent. compared with 7 per cent. for the Foreign Office as a whole.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Wyatt of Weeford: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister realise that the importance of the World Service is that it is broadcast to 100 million listeners in foreign languages which most of our diplomats do not understand? It would be a great deal better to cut the diplomats, who are fairly useless in trade terms, and substitute for them the World Service. That would cost around &#163;5 million a year and save us supporting a lot of diplomats who do not add much to the price of tea.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, it is for the World Service to decide on the optimum mix of languages in consultation with the Foreign Office. We are confident that the World Service can maintain its essential front-line activity and further increase its audience penetration through the use of the private finance initiative.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, bearing in mind that the World Service makes a major contribution to international understanding and in doing so enhances the reputation of this country, can my noble friend confirm that the reductions will not in any way impair the service but there is simply a different way of financing it?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is absolutely right. It is merely an alternative method of financing the service.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that I do not often agree with the noble Lord, Lord Wyatt, but on this occasion I believe that he almost got it right? I agree with the Minister that the BBC World Service is superb, and widely recognised as such throughout the world. But if there must be a cut, would it not have been <P>


<a name="column_1099"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1099</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>better, in terms of value for money, for there to have been a modest cut of the same size in the Foreign Office budget rather than in the budget of the World Service?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, I agree that the World Service is a superb asset. There is no question of that. However, I pointed out that while there was a 3.1 per cent. cut in the World Service budget, there was a 7 per cent. cut overall for the Foreign Office.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, as someone who has been stopped no less than six times in the streets of Hangzhou by Chinese anxious to practise the very good English that they learnt from the BBC World Service, nevertheless, will my noble friend entirely discount the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Wyatt of Weeford? Over the 23 years that I have been travelling abroad commercially, I have recognised an astonishing improvement in the service of the Foreign Office which is now second to none in the world.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, I welcome that comment. We believe that the Foreign Office is doing an excellent job backed up by the BBC World Service.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I should declare an interest in that a member of my family works for the World Service. But are not the Government going back on a contract entered into by them with the World Service? Was not there an agreement 10 years ago between the Foreign Office and the Treasury on the one side and the World Service on the other, to carry out the funding on a three-year basis? Have not the Government unilaterally reneged on the final year of the present triennium and are they not setting the figure for the first year of the next triennium unilaterally without negotiation?<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199596/ldhansrd/vo951211/text/51211-03.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, that is not true. There cannot be any absolute guarantee of funding three years ahead. The World Service would be the only public body that had that benefit and we cannot guarantee a three-year agreement.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, in those circumstances is it not peculiar that the Government give a yearly guarantee by way of its vote in the Council of Ministers to millions being spent by the European Commission on propaganda throughout Europe, most of which does not rest on any discernible factual basis? That is at great cost to the taxpayer who receives literally nothing at all.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, that is a different question from the one appearing on the Order Paper. We were talking of a three-year, not a one-year guarantee.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, there is no suggestion that there will be a cut in services. The cut is in capital expenditure, and that cut will be made up through the PFI.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that in introducing the private finance initiative government Ministers on all occasions have said that it would not be a substitution for investment from the public sector? Is the Minister further aware that there is grave concern at the World Service? Can we read anything into the noble Lord's words that substantially the same programmes would be able to go out? That implied a cut.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, I believe I have already said that it is up to the World Service, in discussion with the Foreign Office, to decide what programmes go out. We do not believe that there will be any substantial reductions in the programmes broadcast by the BBC World Service.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, in relation to what he said about there being no cuts in services, is he aware that the chairman of the BBC has stated that this will result in cuts in services?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that is exactly what the chairman of the BBC said. What he said on 29th November was that he accepted that the BBC World Service could not be seen in isolation from the totality of the budget.

<A NAME="51211-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may thank my noble friend the Minister for what she was able to give us by way of reply and ask respectfully whether it is now accepted that the prospects of a fair trial in every one of these cases will be called in question on the application to stay proceedings for abuse of process of the court. In those circumstances, is it now accepted by the Government that, for the reasons advanced by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bridge of Harwich, on more than one occasion on the Floor of your Lordships' House, some appellate process should now be introduced?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the question of a fair trial will loom very large in the minds of the Crown Prosecution Service and of the judge at a trial. But whether or not to apply for a stay of proceedings on the ground that the delay renders a fair trial impossible is a matter for the defendant and his legal representative in each case to consider. However, it would not be surprising if such applications were contemplated in these cases. As to my noble friend's other point as to whether there should be an appellate process against decisions to refuse such applications, we believe it is essential to minimise the scope for further delays in criminal trials, especially where delays have already occurred. A right of appeal against abuse of process decisions would create additional delays and is unnecessary. The defence already has a right of appeal at the end of the trial if the defendant is convicted.

<A NAME="51211-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I cannot give the breakdown but I can say that from the beginning of this process to the present day &#163;5.5 million has been the total cost to the Metropolitan Police of pursuing these cases. The Crown Prosecution Service costs stand at &#163;1.5 million.

<P>
<A NAME="51211-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Beloff: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the question of whether there would be a fair trial has been raised almost exclusively by a small knot of people who, for reasons which remain obscure, desire to see these appalling crimes committed during the Second World War obliterated from the public memory? Does she not further agree that to raise these questions now, when we are contemplating similar prosecutions for <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-03_spnew18"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is absolutely right. These are horrendous crimes. The victims of such crimes and the families of the victims of such crimes have indelibly imprinted on their memories the horror of these crimes. It is essential that we never concede the principle that simply the passage of time should be grounds for acquittal.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-03_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone: </B>   My Lords, is it not a little unwise to describe crimes as "horrible" when they are still under investigation?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-03_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I do not think there is any conflict here. The crimes were horrible. As to who committed them, that is a matter for the courts.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-03_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Mayhew: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister recall that a substantial majority in this House declined to give a Second Reading to the War Crimes Bill and acted wholly out of a desire to see that unfair trials were not possible? Does she realise that not only are the alleged crimes at least 50 years old but that the time between the starting of these examinations and the bringing of cases to court is already excessive? Is it not time that this controversial and long drawn-out process was brought to an end?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-03_spnew22"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, it would be quite wrong to ignore the overwhelming view of another place in this matter. This ground has been well covered in almost every question that has been answered in the debate and indeed was well covered as the Bill processed through this House. On the point of unfair trials, that really must be a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service and the judge in the case. If it is deemed that a fair trial cannot take place, that must be a judgment of the Crown Prosecution Service in the first instance and the judges in the courts. If there is a conviction at the end of such a trial, anyone subject to a conviction is free to appeal.

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1103</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, as noble Lords will recall, the passage last month of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1995 paves the way for a new criminal injuries compensation scheme. The Act provides that a draft of the new scheme must be approved by an affirmative resolution of each House. The draft was laid on 16th November. It was approved by the other place on 6th December, and our task today is to decide whether this House should also approve it.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para3"></a>The criminal injuries compensation scheme was introduced in 1964. It provides compensation from public funds to blameless victims of crimes of violence and to those injured in attempting to catch criminals or prevent crime. Payment is made in recognition of the public's sense of responsibility for, and sympathy with, the innocent victim.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para4"></a>Under the current scheme, compensation has been assessed by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board on the basis of common law damages. That requires finely judged assessments of the degree of suffering and financial loss. That tends to make speedy decision-taking more difficult. It also makes it hard to predict and control the costs of the scheme. And those costs have been rising at an unsustainable rate, while the backlog of unsettled cases has, despite the best efforts of the board, continued to rise.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para5"></a>That was why we sought to introduce a new, tariff based scheme in 1994. That tariff scheme moved away from common law damages, and provided for payment to be made on the basis of a scale of awards for injuries of comparable severity, with the scale or tariff being based on awards made previously by the board.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para6"></a>However, in April this year the Judicial Committee of this House ruled that the introduction of the tariff scheme had been unlawful. That judgment, of course, related solely to the method of the tariff scheme's introduction, not to its intrinsic merits. The ruling necessitated the immediate withdrawal of the tariff scheme and the reinstatement of the former, common law damages based scheme. It also meant that some applicants were disadvantaged because they would have been treated more generously under the tariff scheme than under the reinstated scheme. These included, for example, some relatives of murder victims. The eligibility criteria in fatal cases were wider under the tariff scheme than under the common law damages scheme, allowing long term, but unmarried, partners of the deceased to qualify for an award, as well as the parents of a child of any age. But with the enforced reinstatement of the common law damages scheme, such applicants lost entitlement to award, an unfortunate consequence of the withdrawal of the tariff scheme necessitated by the Judicial Committee's judgment.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para7"></a>We remained firmly of the view that a tariff based approach was the right one. A tariff scheme is easier for victims to understand and is easier to operate. This means that applications can be dealt with more quickly. It also enables costs to be controlled and predicted more easily.
<P>


<a name="column_1104"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1104</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para8"></a>But the legal judgment did afford us the opportunity of taking a fresh look at the tariff approach. In doing so we took very careful note of the criticisms made of the earlier scheme, both in Parliament and elsewhere. We noted in particular the concern that too simple a tariff scheme could have a detrimental effect on those most seriously affected by their injuries. When, therefore, we invited Parliament to pass the Bill which would give statutory backing to a new tariff scheme, we sought to ensure that there were adequate powers to enable a number of very significant improvements to be made. Parliament clearly agreed with that approach; and we think the new, enhanced tariff scheme now proposed to be made under the new Act's powers fully addresses the major points of concern that have been expressed.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para9"></a>I think it might be helpful if I rehearsed briefly the principal features of the draft new scheme. All successful claimants will get a tariff award based on the injury suffered. But in addition, in more serious cases, victims will also receive extra compensation for loss of earnings and for special care. In fatal cases, payment will additionally be made for loss of dependency--that is, the breadwinner's income--and for loss of parental services. And reasonable funeral expenses will of course continue to be reimbursed.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para10"></a>We are doubling the maximum award under the old tariff scheme from &#163;250,000 to &#163;500,000, and we are making provision for recipients of higher value awards to opt for payment through the purchase of annuities: these arrangements are generally known as structured settlements. These can provide a stream of index-linked, tax-free payments, thereby considerably increasing the net value of the award. And your Lordships will recall that there was a provision in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act to extend the benefit of structured settlements to applicants under the current scheme whose claims had not yet been settled. The complementary change to the current scheme to permit that was made on 8th November, the same day as the Act received Royal Assent.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para11"></a>We issued a first draft of the new scheme in August. This was no small task. Because of the additional features in the new arrangements, such as loss of earnings, loss of dependency and care costs, we had to make it quite clear, and in language understandable to the layman, just what was meant by those rather imprecise terms and what would therefore qualify under the enhanced tariff scheme and what would not. That is why the new draft scheme has, of necessity, to be rather longer and more detailed than any of its predecessors.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para12"></a>The first draft of the new scheme was circulated widely to members of both Houses, and to interested individuals and organisations, including the police representative organisations, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, Victim Support, the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers, the Trades Union Congress, the Bar Council and the Law Society, the equivalent bodies in Scotland, and to many others. We then had meetings with a number of these organisations to discuss the proposals. We also received much useful feed-back in writing. The draft also helped to inform the debate during the Bill's consideration in this House where, as your Lordships will recall, discussion was accordingly <P>


<a name="column_1105"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1105</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>often not so much on the provisions in the Bill itself, but on the terms of the draft scheme. That too provided much useful feed-back.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para13"></a>In the light of that wide, and most useful consultation exercise, we made numerous changes to the draft scheme. Among the most significant changes are greater consistency in the terminology used throughout the draft scheme; the inclusion of a table of contents and the more logical presentation of the scheme's provisions; the clarification of the criteria for waiving time limits and the provisions relating to loss of income; the costs of special care and fatal awards; and the provisions dealing with appeals.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para14"></a>We circulated a revised version of the draft scheme on 1st November. That was, of course, in time to inform debate during the final stages of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Bill, enabling Parliament to complete its consideration of the Bill in the full knowledge of the detailed terms of the scheme which would subsequently be proposed under its powers. In our view the new draft represented a very significant improvement on the earlier one. I am glad to be able to tell the House that that view seems to have been shared but more generally, since we received very little additional feed-back, and most of that was in the nature of seeking either clarification on, or suggesting minor amendment to, very small, technical points of detail. Nonetheless, it did help us to make one or two more minor changes to the draft scheme in the interests of clarity. But essentially the draft now before the House is the same as the one circulated last month and which Parliament had an opportunity to consider before it passed the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para15"></a>The draft scheme now before this House gives effect to Parliament's wishes as expressed in its passing of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1995. It puts the necessary flesh on the bones of that Act and spells out clearly and unambiguously who can qualify for an award, how that award will be assessed and paid, and how dissatisfied claimants may appeal. It makes it clear how the scheme will be administered and sets out the lines of accountability. Once the draft scheme has been approved and the scheme made, the Act itself makes it clear that any subsequent change will also require parliamentary approval by the affirmative resolution procedure if the change affects a key feature of the scheme, and by the negative resolution procedure if the change relates to a more minor feature of the scheme. Thus, Parliament rather than the Executive, will always have the final say over each and every provision of the new scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para16"></a>We believe the draft new scheme provides the right balance between the needs of victims and the interests of taxpayers. It has the benefits of a tariff-based approach, which will enable most claimants to get their money more quickly and without undue fuss. But it also ensures that the more seriously injured are generously catered for, by paying for loss of earnings and the costs of special care, and by making provision for structured settlements. It will remain a generous scheme too; the most generous anywhere in the world. I accordingly commend the draft scheme to the House.

<A NAME="51211-03_spnew25"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure whether one is speaking at a birth or at a wake because we are, of course, at the birth of the new scheme, but equally we are seeing the final stages of the death of the non-statutory scheme, which has been in existence in this country, with all party support, since 1964.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para18"></a>I should like to place on record, as I am sure my noble friend the Minister will agree, that that scheme over those 30-odd years, has been an enormous success. Without doubt it has been the finest scheme in existence in the world for the compensation of the victims of crime. Its strength has lain in the fact that it was based on the common law principles where each case was reviewed individually and the individual was compensated for the effect that the injury had had on the victim. As my noble friend knows, it was an attempt to ensure that those injured in crimes of violence were compensated as if they were the victim of a similar injury which would have taken them before the civil courts.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para19"></a>Sadly, that scheme is now to go. I accept--I have always accepted--that some change is required. The fact is that a scheme which started in a small way is dealing in the current year with some 70,000 applications and paying out something like &#163;160 million in compensation. Over 1 million people in this country have received awards since the scheme began. I believe that there are two reasons for that growth. The first is, sadly, the growth in the volume of violent crime but there is now also far greater awareness of the victims' compensation scheme. The Government have encouraged that awareness and the police have been asked to let victims know their rights. Victim Support too has played a very important part. We should not witness the death of the non-statutory scheme without placing on record the fact that it has been enormously successful over those years.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para20"></a>So far as concerns the new scheme, I am sure that my noble friend the Minister will agree that the atmosphere in the House today is somewhat different from that prevailing when the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, first raised the matter after the publication of the original White Paper. Indeed, I remind my noble friend of the atmosphere here on the day the Government were defeated on this matter during the passage of the most recent criminal justice legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para21"></a>The reason that the atmosphere has changed is that the scheme has greatly changed. I, for one, welcome those changes--although, sadly, the Government still stick to an inflexible tariff. One does not have to repeat again all the arguments against such a scheme, but at least the present scheme gets rid of what to my mind were the totally unacceptable features of the Government's original proposals. If those proposals had gone through, all the savings that are intended to be made would have been made at the cost of those most badly injured in any assault. By refusing to pay for loss <P>


<a name="column_1107"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1107</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of earnings and earnings capacity, as the Government had intended, all of those savings would have been borne by the worst injured.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para22"></a>I believe that those trades unions which chose to challenge that scheme by judicial review have had their actions thoroughly exonerated. The changes that have come about as a result of the defeat of that original scheme which was ruled unlawful by the Judicial Committee of this House are to the great advantage of future victims. However, it is sad that that had to be achieved in that way. If only the Home Office had been willing at an earlier stage to consult, to listen, to reflect and to amend its own proposals, taking account of the criticisms that were being made, I believe that it would have been possible to achieve a system which would have been acceptable to all parties, which would have achieved the Government's aims and which would, I suspect, have saved a great deal more than the present scheme will save. I repeat that I, for one, welcome the fact that the scheme that we are to introduce today avoids the worst features of the original White Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para23"></a>Perhaps I may make three or four brief points about the scheme. First, I do not believe that the introduction of the scheme will be as simple and uncomplicated as the Home Office has implied from time to time. Although it is true that the tariff provides figures for a vast number of different types of injury, I still believe that it will be found in practice that many types of injuries are not covered by the current tariff. I hope and believe that my noble friend the Minister will ensure that the Government are willing to amend the scheme to take account of that fact.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para24"></a>Secondly, I still regret the fact that the Government have chosen a scheme which provides only one single amount for any particular type of injury. I accept that a large proportion of the work done by the present board can be achieved by a tariff scheme. I accept that the volume of work makes a movement in that direction necessary, but I still feel that if the scheme had provided a degree of flexibility by using bands of awards in some areas or allowing for differential movements around a central figure rather than providing only one figure for any particular type of injury, it would have been better able to take account of the different effects of the same injury on different people.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para25"></a>In particular, the Home Office should think again about the proposals relating to shock. It is difficult to deal with psychological injuries in the same way as physical injuries and by the provision of a single sum as is proposed in the scheme. I believe that it will be shown that those proposals are inflationary and will cost the Government a considerable amount of money.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para26"></a>Perhaps I may make two final points. I still believe that the proposals relating to those who suffer more than one injury are unfortunate. To say that because you receive two types of injury you should receive only 10 per cent. of the appropriate award for the second injury will in some cases be shown to be unfair. I hope that the Home Office will be prepared in any review to consider whether it cannot devise a system to ensure that a person who receives two totally separate injuries in the same assault is properly compensated for both.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para27"></a>On the scheme and the tariff, I accept that the new scheme is based almost entirely on the scheme that has been operating in this country since 1964 as far as the rules of eligibility are concerned and I accept that, as my noble friend the Minister has said on many occasions, the tariff is a generous one. Indeed, in some cases I believe that the amounts at the bottom end are more generous than the common law awards which are given at the moment. I wish the scheme well and hope that it succeeds. I hope that it succeeds in the interests of those who are the unfortunate future victims of crime. However, I repeat that I very much hope that the Government will not close their minds to a willingness to look again at certain aspects of it and that they will recognise that a degree of flexibility in the awards available under the scheme would make it a considerably better scheme than the one that we have at the moment.

<P>
<A NAME="51211-03_spnew26"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   My Lords, we are considering the scheme in the aftermath of the tragic death at the weekend of Mr. Philip Lawrence. To do so adds poignancy to the whole problem of criminal injuries and their escalation. It is a tragic fact that today we are all potential victims of criminal injuries. The scale of the tariff, to which I shall refer in a minute, shows the awful injuries that individuals can receive.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para28"></a>Once we had, in a sense, overcome the central question of the principle of the Bill--although, as the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, did, I want to make a passing reference to it--we concentrated in Committee on the details of the scheme. Of course we found that only by seeking to amend the Bill were we able to affect the outcome of the scheme. Even five weeks ago when we considered the Bill on Third Reading there were four important amendments--three moved by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, and one by the Minister herself--all of which have been incorporated in the scheme. I am grateful to the Minister for doing what one would have expected her to do and honouring the undertakings which she then gave.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para29"></a>I note what the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, said about the scheme, and I cannot in any way dissent from the view that the figures may be generous in comparison to common law damages or that the scheme as a whole is very generous indeed. But looking at &#163;15,000 for moderate brain damage, &#163;25,000 for the loss of an eye and &#163;30,000 for the loss of a leg below the knee, and reflecting upon someone who has been lucky enough to escape such injury, those figures still seem to be trifling. So in relation to those and other figures I hope that experience will be taken into account in bringing forward any amendments in due course.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para30"></a>Perhaps I may ask the Minister one question to which I have not been able easily to find the answer. It relates to levels of inflation. Paragraph 4 of the scheme says that it will be kept under review. The only word omitted from that familiar phrase is the word "constant". However, I assume that there will be a constant review. But that does not indicate to what that review will lead in respect of bringing forward another order at a future <P>


<a name="column_1109"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1109</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>date. How soon will the levels of inflation be reflected in changes to the scheme? Will it be annually when the rate of inflation is known or over a period of time? If there were no uprating for, say, three years then even with the present low levels of inflation the scheme would be devalued by about 10 per cent. It would be helpful if the Minister would tell the House how she expects that the uprating for inflation will take effect, and whether she can give an undertaking that at no time will the scheme fall significantly behind the current levels of inflation in terms of that uprating.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para31"></a>We on these Benches wish the scheme well. A tariff scheme has been agreed by the House. I, like the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, wish that there was more flexibility within it, a range of options open, or at least that it was a hybrid scheme whereby the great majority of items would be on tariff but there would be discretion for the others. But that is now water under the bridge. A decision has been made. I only hope that the Minister can say, not just with regard to inflation but with regard to experience of the scheme--it is bound to show, as the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, said, shortcomings over a period of time--that the scheme will be updated at significant intervals, so that if it is a good scheme it will not decline over a period of years.

<A NAME="51211-03_spnew27"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Minister opened the debate by giving a potted history of the sorry series of events that led us to this pass. I shall not go over that again, except to say that after all this is a new scheme, devised to replace the scheme which the Government had thought was too expensive. The effect of the scheme is to save, as I understand it, approximately &#163;200 million a year. That may be the right thing to do, but it does not sit well for the Government to make that saving and yet to claim in speeches at the Conservative Party conference that the Conservative Party is the party of concern for the victims of crime. The two are not compatible. We are here because the Government wanted to save money and because they introduced an illegal scheme which had to be replaced by the present scheme. That is the fact of the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para32"></a>Having said that, I echo the tribute paid by the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, to the existing scheme which has carried on for over 30 years and which, as he said, was without doubt the best scheme of its kind in the world, and his recognition of the improvements which have been made by the Government over the past few months since the illegal, simple tariff scheme had to be abandoned. Those improvements are not unimportant. They include provision for compensation for loss of earnings and for future loss of earnings, a new provision for dependency in fatal cases, and improvements in payment for costs of care. Of course the structured settlements improvement is very much to be welcomed.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para33"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, said, at the very end, improvements were introduced to this scheme over and above the draft scheme which was circulated last month. We are grateful to the Minister for seeing to it that her undertakings on Third Reading were <P>


<a name="column_1110"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1110</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>implemented, notably with respect to compensation for pension rights in paragraph 31(c); the inclusion of the Ogden Tables (the Government's actuarial tables) in paragraph 32; and for carers' loss of earnings in paragraph 35. Undoubtedly the Government have been responsive to parliamentary debate and criticism, and have behaved honourably towards the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para34"></a>But there are many things still wrong with the scheme. That the scheme is still inadequate is evidenced by the fact that it is not a scheme which could conceivably be generalised. It could not be adopted as a tariff-based scheme for other than criminal injuries. Surely the test must be that, if the scheme is right for criminal injuries, then it should be suitable for implementation for accidents at work, medical negligence, or any of the other accidents and injuries which occur. A superficial look at the scheme makes it clear that that is not the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para35"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, referred to the inadequacy of the provision for multiple injuries. To give just one example: if one loses one arm, the compensation is &#163;40,000; if one loses two arms the compensation is &#163;100,000; but if one loses an arm and a leg, which could be just as serious, if not more serious, the compensation is only &#163;40,000 for the first injury and 10 per cent., or &#163;4,000, for the second injury. That is clearly an anomaly which cannot be allowed to survive in the long term. The noble Lord referred to gaps in the tariff and the fact that there will be a considerable time before full payment is made, even if a gap in the tariff is recognised.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para36"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, referred rightly, when talking about fatal cases, to the tragic death of Philip Lawrence, the headmaster of St. George's School, on Friday last. If one looks at the scheme as it refers to compensation in fatal cases, it must be said that the scheme is not clear. Paragraph 37 provides:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where the victim has died in consequence of the injury, no compensation other than funeral expenses will be payable for the benefit of his estate".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Subsequent paragraphs go on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where the victim has died since sustaining the injury, compensation may be payable", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
to the spouse and children, and there are dependency allowances and so forth.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para37"></a>I believe that it is intended that the scheme will recognise the case of Philip Lawrence and that compensation will be paid. However, paragraph 37 does not state that. It may not mean what it states but it is not clear to the innocent observer and it may not be clear to those who are advising people under such circumstances. It would be helpful if the Minister could spell out exactly what is the situation in such cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para38"></a>Most important is the failure of the scheme to recognise differences between the seriousness of injuries as regards people of different ages and sex. We had many debates on that subject as the Bill proceeded. It became clear that, as evidence is available, it is physically possible to distinguish between the amounts in the tariff which would be payable, for example, in respect of the scarring of a young woman as compared with that of an old man. That could have been done <P>


<a name="column_1111"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1111</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because the evidence exists. The table would have been more complicated but it could have been in the tariff scheme. It is sad to discover that no response has been made to that absolutely vital element of flexibility to which the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para39"></a>There are many other less important defects of the scheme. It does not deal with the issue of dominance as regards right or left-handed people and the effect of that if a hand or arm is lost. There is still a two-year time limit on applications instead of the previous three-year limit. However, the conditions for late applications have been improved. There is still inadequate provision for the loss of parental services. There is still inadequate provision for the unexceptional risks that are taken not only by firefighters but by those in the rescue services who help after a crime has been committed. Not enough has been done about psychological injury and about shock. We await the report of the Law Commission and hope that the Government will implement any recommendations. There is still inadequate provision for the case in which a child of rape is not kept by the mother but is aborted or adopted. And, of course, there is still inadequate provision for the first 22 weeks of loss of earnings for the 12 million people who do not have access to the statutory sick pay on which the scheme is predicated.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para40"></a>Finally, there is the curious silence in the Act about the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, which is given legal status only in the scheme. The purpose of that has been made explicit; it is to provide for market testing and possible privatisation at a later date. We repeat that the thought of such an element of the criminal justice system being put out to privatisation is as repugnant to us as is the privatisation of prisons. A Labour Government will certainly not allow such market testing for privatisation to take place.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para41"></a>With thanks for what has been done and with renewed concern about what has not been done and what could have been done, I confirm that we shall not be opposing the Motion.

<P>
<A NAME="51211-03_spnew28"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for all the points that have been made. I am not entirely surprised because I know that the scheme, as seen by other Members of this House, is not perfect in every respect. I am pleased to see my noble friend Lord Carlisle back in his seat after what I know has been an uncomfortable time for him. The original scheme served victims of crime very well over many years. I take this opportunity to salute the work and dedication of my noble friend and members of the board over those years. As my noble friend suggested, some change was required and time moves on. Nevertheless, the new scheme will remain generous and will be fair both to victims of crime and to those who must pay.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para42"></a>I turn to the individual points made during the course of this short but important debate. My noble friend Lord Carlisle referred to a banding system and the introduction of more flexibility. We believe that flexible bands or other special treatment for special classes of <P>


<a name="column_1112"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1112</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>injury are not appropriate for a straightforward tariff approach. It would simply be common law damages in all but name and it would reintroduce delays for comparatively small variations and provide endless scope for argument and appeal as to where on the band a settlement should be made.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para43"></a>My noble friend also referred to the lack of flexibility and the difficulty of making payments for recognising shock. It is important to point to the note to this scheme on the final page. Shock is referred to and clarified. It may be taken to include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"conditions attributed to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression and similar generic terms covering such psychological symptoms as anxiety, tension, insomnia, irritability, loss of confidence, agoraphobia, pre-occupation with thoughts of self-harm or guilt, and related physical ones such as alopecia, asthma, eczema, enuresis and psoriasis. Disability in this context will include impaired work (or school) performance, significant adverse effects on social relationships and sexual dysfunction". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para44"></a>There are different categories for shock. There is a low payment of &#163;1,000 for disabling but temporary mental anxiety, medically verified; or for a disabling mental disorder confirmed by a psychiatric diagnosis, which would give rise to a bigger claim, lasting up to 28 weeks, or over 28 weeks up to one year, and lasting for one year but not permanent; finally, a much larger award for a permanently disabling mental disorder confirmed by psychiatric prognosis. I believe that that recognises shock in all its forms.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para45"></a>My noble friend made a further reference which is important. It was to descriptions of injuries which are not contained within the scheme. There are mechanisms for recommendations to be made to my right honourable friend. If there were no appropriate description in the scheme, my right honourable friend has a mechanism for bringing to Parliament a change to the scheme that would recognise a new description of injury.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para46"></a>Reference was made to the formula for serious multiple injuries being too mean. In cases of multiple injury, the sampling exercise used to set the tariff showed clearly that most of the award was made for the most serious injury, with very little added for additional lesser injuries. That approach is also recommended in the Judicial Studies Board's guide to damages for personal injury, and the tariff accordingly adopts that approach. Once again, it reflects what happens under common law damages. I have dealt with the point made by my noble friend Lord Carlisle about injuries not described in the scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para47"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, referred to the recent distressing case of the headmaster, Mr. Lawrence. Mr. Lawrence's family will be entitled to apply for compensation. They may do so at any time within two years of the offence. If they apply before 1st April 1996 the application will be dealt with under the common law damages scheme. If they apply after 1st April the application will be considered under the tariff scheme. Distressing as the case may be, I hope that that family will be well advised. It is a most timely reminder of the position of a victim in such circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para48"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, referred also to the scale of the award. Injuries in tariff are based on awards <P>


<a name="column_1113"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1113</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>made by the board and therefore reflect what actually happens now in common law damages. We believe that that objective approach is better than a more subjective judgment.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para49"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, and my noble friend Lord Carlisle referred to the fact that we need to keep under review the operation of the scheme. We recognise that. If in the light of experience it becomes apparent that change would be desirable, we shall lay proposals before the House. Those ideas may come from the authority itself as the scheme beds down.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para50"></a>The operation of the tariff levels was also referred to. The tariff levels have been left as they were when the earlier scheme was introduced on 1st April 1994. Those levels were based on board awards and they included an element for loss of earnings and special care, plus a generous allowance for inflation. Although we are now paying loss of earnings and special care in addition to the tariff award in more serious cases, we have not stripped away those elements from the tariff level, which are, therefore, higher than they would otherwise have been. Therefore, there is already a considerable cushion built into the tariff.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para51"></a>For the future, the intention will be to review the tariff bands every three years. We shall give further thought later as to how that review may be undertaken. The priority for now is to get the scheme up and running successfully. The elements of the award for loss of earnings and special care will of course increase automatically in line with wages and the cost of care.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para52"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, referred to the tariffs being unsuitable for other types of injury; for example, those at work. It is not meant to cover such situations. In other schemes someone is usually liable. There is a plaintiff and a defendant. In our scheme, the Government are not a defendant. They are merely making an award with taxpayers' money on behalf of society and our awards are based on what the board does. That is supposed to reflect common law damages.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para53"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, referred to paragraphs 37 and 38 and asked whether the Lawrence case was covered. Paragraph 37 merely provides that, apart from funeral expenses, no compensation shall be payable for the benefit of the estate; that is, as opposed to individual qualifying claimants. The last part of paragraph 38 makes it clear that where the victim dies as a consequence of the injury, compensation is payable to qualifying claimants. Paragraphs 39 to 42 would cover Mr. Lawrence's family.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-03_para54"></a>There seems to be a consensus that we have the broad parameters of the new arrangements right, even if there is some residual disagreement about one or two of the draft scheme's more detailed provisions. But I doubt that we should be able to devise a scheme to satisfy absolutely everybody unless funds were unlimited. It will remain the most generous scheme anywhere in the world. Given the constraints under which any responsible government have to operate, we believe that the new scheme is the best that can be devised. I commend the draft scheme to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office   (The Earl of Lindsay): </B>  My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para0"></a>The Bill contains provision in four main areas: the setting up of the Scottish qualifications authority; pre-school education; school boards and placing requests. It is a balanced package of measures ranging from important improvements in the existing policies on school boards and placing requests, through the restructuring of the qualification and assessment arrangements in Scotland, to measures facilitating the implementation of our policies on pre-school education.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para1"></a>Part I of the Bill provides for the establishment of the Scottish qualifications authority which will take over the existing functions and assets of the Scottish Examination Board and the Scottish Vocational Education Council.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para2"></a>It may help your Lordships if I relate some of the background to this proposal. The advantages of a single qualifications and assessment body for Scotland were examined as long ago as 1984. Responses to the consultation document School and Further Education in Scotland--A Single Examining Body? did not, however, provide a consensus in favour of this approach. The main argument against a combined body at that time was that other reforms should be allowed to bed-in before a merger was contemplated. SCOTVEC itself was then only in the process of forming.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para3"></a>The current major reforms of post-16 education in Scotland have provided a fresh impetus to examining this question. The "higher still" proposals envisage an enhanced and co-ordinated suite of qualifications for post-compulsory education in Scotland. They draw on the best practice of both existing organisations to provide a coherent, unified qualification system incorporating both academic and vocational strands of learning. This will improve the quality of education available to our young people. It will also promote parity of esteem between different branches of learning. It does, however, pose questions about the most appropriate structure to manage the system.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para4"></a>In March of this year we issued a consultation paper--Options for the Future Relationship between the Scottish Examination Board and the Scottish Vocational Education Council. The consultation showed strong support for a new single body from a wide range of interested parties. My honourable friend the Minister for Education at the Scottish Office announced in August of this year that the Government intended to bring forward the necessary legislation to achieve this.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para5"></a>I shall now explain in more detail the provisions setting up the Scottish qualifications authority--SQA. Clause 1 provides for the establishment of SQA and for the appointment of its members. Schedule 1 contains further provisions about membership, the chairman and chief executive and provisions on proceedings, staff and other matters. Together those provide most of the detailed constitutional arrangements for the new body.
<P>


<a name="column_1115"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1115</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para6"></a>One area to which specific attention was drawn in consultation, however, was the constitution of the board of SQA. We wish to ensure arrangements that will enable a balance to be struck between the wide range of interests involved in education, training and employment. At the same time, arrangements must also reflect the need for an effective and flexible board.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para7"></a>Having considered what would be most effective, it is proposed that the new body shall have at least 16 but no more than 25 members. The Secretary of State would appoint between 12 and 15 members, including the chairman, while the SQA will be able to appoint between three and five members.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para8"></a>Clauses 2 to 8 provide the powers necessary for SQA to undertake the existing functions of SEB and SCOTVEC, in addition to administering the "higher still" assessment and awarding arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para9"></a>Clause 2 contains what might be described as the core functions of the SQA. Its central purpose is to devise qualifications, assess performance against standards and award qualifications. To allow the SQA to carry out those functions effectively, and in the best interests of Scottish education, a range of other functions must be conferred. The quality assurance provisions in Clauses 2 and 4, for instance, are vital to the maintenance and enhancement of standards in education.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para10"></a>We are well aware of the importance attached to such provisions, both by the existing bodies, and by all those involved in education and training, including students and employers. We are determined that the new organisation will be able to build on the success and high reputation of its predecessors.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para11"></a>One current function of SCOTVEC is to "accredit" qualifications. An example of these qualifications is Scottish vocational qualifications (SVQs) which are designed to take account of occupational standards drawn up by the industry lead bodies. SVQs, along with national vocational qualifications  (NVQs), form part of a national framework of vocational qualifications. Special arrangements are made in the Bill for handling this work through the setting up of an "accreditation committee", of which a majority of the members will be neither members nor employees of the SQA. Arrangements of this type were envisaged in the consultation paper.  
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para12"></a>SCOTVEC and the Scottish Examination Board (SEB) draw their principal income from fees and charges for services provided. That will remain the case for the SQA. However, the Bill makes provision for the SQA to borrow money and for the Secretary of State to guarantee such loans. It also permits the Secretary of State to make grants and loans to the SQA. That will provide flexibility for the new body over the source of funding appropriate in particular cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para13"></a>In some areas, for instance, funding by grant will be appropriate, as in the five to 14 testing work currently undertaken by the SEB. The Bill also provides for the Secretary of State to determine the financial duties of the SQA. That was suggested in the consultation paper as a means of safeguarding the interests of the SQA's customers, particularly in relation to the level of fees.
<P>


<a name="column_1116"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1116</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para14"></a>The Bill also makes provision for the SQA to have regard to the interests of persons using its services. That clearly has much wider implications for the relationship between the SQA and its customers than the setting of fees, and encompasses a wider concept of the customer than simply one who pays for services. We see this important provision as setting a clear directive for the SQA to embrace the needs of its customers in all its activities.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para15"></a>I turn now to the provisions in Part II of the Bill, dealing with education for children in the year before they start primary school. The provisions would enable us to fulfil in Scotland the Government's commitment to provide, over time and by means of a voucher scheme, education on at least a part-time basis in the pre-school year for all children whose parents want it. That is a national commitment. As was pre-figured in the gracious Speech, a forthcoming Bill is expected to put forward for England and Wales provisions similar to those here proposed for Scotland. Indeed, the proposed launch of the pre-five initiative in Scotland in August next year is intended to be implemented in England as early as April.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para16"></a>The key aim of the initiative is to stimulate an expansion in pre-five education in a way that sustains quality, broadens parental choice and supports a mixed economy of provision with the public, private and voluntary sectors all playing a part. Choice and quality lie at the heart of the proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para17"></a>It is not, I think, necessary to persuade the House of the merits of pre-school education. The benefits to children--in terms of their intellectual, emotional and social development--are widely recognised. The Government believe it essential to develop provision in a way that puts the interests of the child first. Pre-school education must be qualitatively different from pre-school care.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para18"></a>We also believe it important to provide the opportunity for all parents to seek pre-five education for their children. For that reason, vouchers will not be means-tested but will be available to all parents of eligible children. The Government are also firm in their belief that parents, and not the providers of education, should decide what kind of pre-school provision is best suited to their child and to their own circumstances. Parent choice must be the watchword of the new system.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para19"></a>In July 1995, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland announced that the Government's commitment to expand pre-school education would be fulfilled in Scotland by means of a new initiative based on vouchers. A similar announcement was made for England. There followed extensive public consultations. The responses showed widespread support for the expansion of pre-five education.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para20"></a>However, at the same time, there was real concern about the possible impact of vouchers on local authorities' own provision, and on relations between local authorities and the private and voluntary sectors. There was also anxiety over the quality of the new provision stimulated by vouchers; and a concern that vouchers alone would not generate many new places.
<P>


<a name="column_1117"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1117</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para21"></a>I wish to acknowledge those concerns very openly. I also wish to comment at this stage on one of them and confirm the commitment of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State to use the pilot year of the voucher scheme, starting in August 1996 in Scotland, to address and resolve those concerns.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para22"></a>Our critics say that we are promoting growth in pre-five places at the expense of quality. That is a serious misrepresentation of the Government's position. The voucher system will be supported by rigorous quality assurance arrangements, which I shall develop in detail in our later discussions on the clauses in the Bill. Suffice to say, at present, that providers, other than schools, wishing to enter the voucher arrangements will have to satisfy certain key criteria, including registration by the local authority under the Children Act 1989. They will also have to show that they understand, and have the capacity to deliver, educational outcomes.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para23"></a>It is the intention of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State to consult local authorities and other interested bodies on the documentation for entry to the voucher system. Once admitted to the voucher system, providers will have to show that they are capable of self-evaluation and self-improvement. All establishments eligible for grant in respect of pre-school education will be independently inspected. Quality will not be sacrificed to quantity in the expansion of pre-five education in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para24"></a>I turn now to the clauses themselves. Clause 23 would enable the Secretary of State to pay grant to providers of education for children in the pre-school year. Categories of eligible children would be prescribed by order and thus open to parliamentary scrutiny. I note in passing that a much wider power to make regulations for paying grants to education providers already exists in Section 73 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para25"></a>To give Parliament an opportunity to debate the principle of this important new initiative, Clause 23 specifies the field within which grant is to be paid to providers, thus linking it explicitly with the provision of pre-school education.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para26"></a>Clause 24 would enable the Secretary of State to attach requirements to grants, including requirements relating to the quality of provision. Clause 25 would enable him to delegate his grant functions to cover the possibility that, at some future date, the Secretary of State may wish to assign certain decisions to another party--for example, to the voucher management company.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para27"></a>Clause 26 is a technical provision to enable the company issuing vouchers to obtain from the child benefit centre the names and addresses of parents of eligible children, so as to send them application forms for vouchers.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para28"></a>There are also two important provisions in Schedule 5. Paragraph 2, amending the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, would extend the inspection power of the Secretary of State so as to enable him to inspect any establishment which might receive a grant under Part II of the Bill. At present, the inspection power of the Secretary of State extends only to schools; the paragraph <P>


<a name="column_1118"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1118</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would bring within the scope of inspection any establishment entitled to redeem vouchers for pre-five education.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para29"></a>It is the intention of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State that HM Inspectors of Schools should play a leading role in conducting, supervising and advising upon such inspections.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para30"></a>Paragraph 3 of Schedule 5, amending the Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Act 1989, would facilitate the creation of nursery classes in self-governing schools, by ensuring that such a development did not trigger the complex requirements for consultation on changes to the characteristics of such schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para31"></a>I turn now to Part III of the Bill. Clauses 28 to 31, together with Schedule 4, amend the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988. Boards were introduced in 1989 following implementation of the 1988 Act. They consist of parents, teachers and co-optees, with parents in the majority. In only six years, boards have become an established part of our education system. We want to build on that success and incorporate the experience of education authorities and boards.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para32"></a>In April 1995, we issued a consultation paper on possible changes. Our proposals received broad support and are reflected in the Bill's provisions. In brief, they would simplify electoral procedures; they would make it easier for parents to join a school board; and they would amend and clarify a number of provisions either because they could work better or because they had been shown to be ambiguous.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para33"></a>As to electoral procedures, at present authorities have to hold elections throughout the year. That is inconvenient for boards, it can be unsettling for parents and adds to local authority costs. We propose to regularise matters so that from 1997, when the next round of biennial elections is due, elections will be held at the same time--between 1st September and 30th November every other year.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para34"></a>A number of further amendments to the 1988 Act are proposed to clarify and improve the existing arrangements. They include the introduction of provisions on declaration of interest; provision, as clarification, to the effect that a member of staff who is employed at more than one school may vote and stand for election provided that he teaches at the school concerned for more than 40 per cent. of his time; and, as an extra opportunity for a board to secure its full quota of parent members, provisions allowing boards in certain limited circumstances to co-opt at most two parent members to fill vacancies until the next appropriate round of elections.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para35"></a>Amendments to the 1988 Act also include the extension of local councillors' rights to attend and to speak at meetings of boards; and provision to make it explicit that boards should be able to use any moneys unspent from their expenses budget at the end of a financial year for the benefit of the school.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para36"></a>Part IV, Clause 32, amends the placing request provisions in Section 28A of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. The placing request system enables parents as of right to choose which school they would like their <P>


<a name="column_1119"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1119</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>children to attend. This Government believe firmly in maximum parental choice in schooling. Choice helps parents to fulfil their aspirations for their children and also acts as a driving force to improve standards.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para37"></a>Since the legislation on placing requests was introduced in 1981, the statistics show that the policy has been extremely successful. So far, over 270,000 requests have been made and over 90 per cent. have been agreed. We want this success to continue and will do nothing to detract from the underlying principle that parental choice should be maximised. Currently, places may not be reserved for children who are likely to move into the area served by a school after the usual cut-off date for decisions on admissions. Where a school is at capacity, pupils moving into the area during the school year, or before the start of a school year, may therefore find that they cannot get into their local school. This may not be a great problem where there is an alternative school within a reasonable distance, but it can lead to difficulties where the nearest alternative school is many miles away.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para38"></a>We therefore propose to enable education authorities to reserve a limited number of places for incomers. An authority would be able to retain only the number of places which would reasonably be required to accommodate pupils likely to move into the school's catchment area. We also propose that the Secretary of State should have the power to prescribe the maximum number of places which may be retained. In addition, it would be possible for places to be retained only where there was no other equivalent school within reasonable walking distance of the school for which the placing request had been made.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para39"></a>We also propose two other changes to the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. The first is the repeal of the word "general" in Section 2 of the Act and in similar regulation-making powers. Section 2 refers to regulations prescribing,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the standards and general requirements to which every education authority shall conform in discharging their functions under section 1 of this Act". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para40"></a>The change would make it clear that regulations could impose detailed requirements where appropriate and not merely to prescribe general principles. The second change, which local authorities themselves have sought, is to repeal the requirement for local authorities to seek the approval of the Secretary of State before commencing educational building works for new premises where the building cost exceeds &#163;1 million.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para41"></a>This Bill would undoubtedly improve quality and choice. These are the key themes in the Government's overall programme. The establishment of the SQA will improve links between schools, colleges and training for employment. The amendments to the legislation on school boards will simplify and improve the way in which boards work, and the provisions allowing the Secretary of State to pay grants to providers of pre-school education will provide the opportunity for all parents to seek pre-five education for their children. These improvements in quality and choice in Scottish <P>

<P>
<A NAME="51211-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the Bill. He will realise that the Bill requires a fair amount of elucidation, and more than is obvious from its published form. We shall take a great deal of time to examine what the Minister has said. I believe that the Minister accepted that the Scottish Examination Board is unlike every other quango in Scotland in that it has a representative structure laid down by Parliament under the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. Section 129(3) of the Act states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Regulations under this section shall make provision with respect to the membership of the Board and shall ensure that not less than four-fifths of the members of the Board are appointed by the Secretary of State from amongst persons nominated by, or by bodies appearing to the Secretary of State to represent the interests of, the universities of Scotland, education authorities, governing bodies of central institutions, governing bodies of colleges of education, directors of education and teachers employed in educational establishments.". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para43"></a>Under this constitution representative bodies are able to make nominations for appointment to the SEB in the knowledge that a number of these nominees will be appointed. The same principle applies to the committees and subject panels of the SEB.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para44"></a>While there is much in favour in principle of the merger of the SEB and the Scottish Vocational Education Council the amalgamated body should have a representative structure along the lines of the SEB and should not just be another quango, increasing by two the number of quangos. At present the SEB board is not a strict quango in the sense that the Government use that term. However, regrettably, the Bill does not deliver this measure. Clause 1(4) provides for a body where something like three-quarters of the members are appointed directly by the Secretary of State, with no obligation on his part to consult with representative bodies and no concept of "constituencies" such as exists with the SEB. Scottish teachers are unlikely to be comfortable with a body constituted in this way or to feel any sense of ownership of it. During the later stages of the Bill we shall certainly seek to provide for some form of representative structure. What is vital is that the Government must give effective guarantees to ensure that the highest possible standards are maintained under the proposed Scottish qualifications authority. We shall discuss that subject in Committee. I believe that the Committee stage will be informative and, I am afraid, lengthy.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para45"></a>Part II of the Bill has caused the most general interest among the public; it concerns nursery vouchers. I do not know whether the Minister explained this matter fully or whether I did not catch it when he spoke. I believe he said that there was a reference to this matter in Clause 23. When the concept of vouchers was proposed, it was widely expected that the Bill would provide the <P>


<a name="column_1121"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1121</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mechanism for the delivery of government proposals on nursery vouchers in Scotland. This does not appear to be the case, unless I have read the Bill wrongly. It is understood the Government believe that their proposals can be delivered through existing powers rather than through detailed primary legislation. I am not clear whether further legislation will be required. The Minister may have explained that. I shall read his speech with care.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para46"></a>One of the matters in the Bill which gives cause for unease is the question of education for children under school age. This matter is covered in Clauses 23 to 27 of the Bill. These clauses relate to the provision of grants to persons providing education to children under school age, together with details regarding the Government's powers to provide social security information to pre-school education providers. There are important issues here relating to pre-school providers having access to possible commercially confidential information on local families. I believe that members of the national insurance ministry, or whatever it is called now, are all bound by the Official Secrets Act and they would not dare to disclose details of families' income to outside bodies unless those were statutory bodies. They would not disclose such details to a company which was merely deciding whether to allocate vouchers. This borders on an important civil liberties issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para47"></a>The main issues regarding vouchers are hard, if not impossible, to tackle through seeking to amend the skimpy proposal in the Bill but are worth pursuing. I shall deal with one or two of them, and I hope that the Minister will take the trouble to reply to them at some stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para48"></a>The Government's determination to go ahead with the proposals, despite 80 per cent. rejection of the consultation document, needs to be explained. To date only four local authorities have expressed any interest in taking part in the pilot scheme which is to start in 1996. They are Argyll and Bute, East Renfrew, Scottish Borders, and South Ayrshire and Western Isles. Clackmannanshire, North Ayrshire, South Ayrshire and South Lanarkshire are still considering the matter. Not one of the major conurbations has agreed to take part in the pilot scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para49"></a>A further issue is the extent to which the pilot is a genuine pilot scheme. In England and Wales the pilot scheme is called "phase one". Will there be genuine monitoring of any pilot scheme, with the option of discontinuation if people's fears are confirmed?
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para50"></a>The provision of education for under-fives lags behind that of our competitors. We believe--and it is clear to most of the people in Scotland and certainly to those in the education field--that, unfortunately, the proposals contained in the Bill owe more to doctrinal considerations than to a realistic appraisal of what should be done to improve the provision of nursery education. There is an absence in any of the proposals of a clear curricular framework and a guarantee of quality provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para51"></a>The value of &#163;1,100 of the voucher is inadequate fully to meet education for a child for a year. For example, in Strathclyde the cost is estimated at &#163;3,000 for a year. <P>


<a name="column_1122"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1122</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Practical details concerning the operation of the scheme such as eligibility, identification of parents and flexibility of vouchers are required.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para52"></a>In respect of the administration of the voucher scheme, there is the question of the role and accountability of the private company. The introduction of a private company into an area where local authorities have had a major role through nursery education provision marks a substantial departure, with major implications for the education process.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para53"></a>The scheme is socially, and potentially educationally, divisive. I represented a constituency for many years where parents in one half of the constituency had little difficulty raising the money to send their children to nursery schools, whereas that was beyond those in the other half of the constituency and there had to be local authority provision. We are concerned that in better-off areas families will be in a position to top-up the voucher value, which is an option not open to many families.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para54"></a>The Government must therefore clarify how the proposals will operate in areas where there is currently no state nursery education and give assurances that the inspection and regulation procedures will be sufficient to produce high quality nursery education. I am thinking of areas where there is little or no nursery education at present with which to compare any new scheme which is introduced.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para55"></a>I want to raise a number of points on Part III of the Bill, but rather fewer than on Part II because the position set out by some organisations associated with education in response to the Scottish Office consultation document holds good. Those points should be considered in conjunction with some of the points that I shall make.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para56"></a>Clause 28 seeks to regulate the timing of elections to school boards across the country. In themselves the changes mean little, but they shift the political context of those elections away from an individual group of parents who are associated with their own school towards a national electoral event. That would bring politics into school boards with a great deal of press publicity. There could be a "them and us" situation among different groups. It would be much better if the date of elections was decided--obviously with the authority of the Secretary of State--in the local area and did not become a national event. Each board would have the power to decide the date of its own election rather than there being national elections with all the razzmatazz that that could involve, taking education into the political arena.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para57"></a>Clause 29 puts forward a mechanism to make terms of office, and hence electoral cycles, more systematic. That is not a bad concept if used wisely. However, there are a great many dangers.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para58"></a>Paragraph 9 of Schedule 4 seeks to clean up a number of anomalies surrounding the appointments and leeting procedure. We challenge the role of school boards in this procedure since it can create problems locally and relies on largely untrained and inexperienced people to make important career decisions affecting professional staff. We would prefer to see the local authority employer in the driving seat. If there are faults in this area--and I know enough about local authorities to <P>


<a name="column_1123"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>know that there are faults--I believe that the procedure should be more open than a board making these appointments to a school.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para59"></a>However, these proposals at least clean up what are at present a number of anomalies, particularly in situations where staff who have been acting in senior positions in a school are involved. There will be staff who are very involved with the school board, helping in many ways. They would naturally have an advantage over any people from outside who might apply for a situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para60"></a>I turn now to the question of placement and reserved places. This measure appears to be designed to solve the problem in rural areas, such as Balfron in Stirlingshire, for example, but the difficulties also apply in large conurbations. Therefore a great deal of thought has to be given to this matter. This is one of the important issues on which I hope we shall hear local opinion before we reach the Committee stage. A reserved place allocation of between 2 and 3 per cent. has been suggested to deal with any shortcomings. That is such a small figure that I cannot believe that it is not possible to accommodate such numbers of pupils without introducing such drastic powers in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para61"></a>I believe that we shall have a very interesting Committee stage. It may be a rather long Committee stage, so the Minister will need to clear his diary for the first few weeks after we come back in the new year, because he will be very much involved. Like many of us who deal with Bills such as this, he will become an authority on education. Sadly, you forget a lot of it by the time the next Bill comes along, but it is nice at the time. I look forward to a long and interesting Committee stage.

<A NAME="51211-04_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, education in Scotland is often held up to the world as a form of excellence. I wonder whether that is still the case. There is no doubt in my mind that, historically, Scotland's system of education supplied the former British Empire with technocrats. These were people whose education had prepared them to grasp the emerging technologies of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, to master them and to implement them. They were knowledgeable across a broad spectrum and, importantly, they were confident: they expected to be able to master the next technical challenge. This education was available across society and we are left with the legacy of the proverbial lad o' pairts. The implication here is that talent was to be developed, irrespective of birth. The foundation of that opportunity was the historic foundation of a school in every parish from 1566.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para62"></a>Today Scotland has an increasing need for an educated workforce, capable of meeting the challenge of an ever changing and improving technical workplace. Unfortunately there is a view, especially in the rural areas of Scotland, that education leads to emigration. How can that be reversed? I would suggest that the much heralded but not yet implemented move from tartan provincialism to greater autonomy would enable <P>


<a name="column_1124"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1124</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Scotland to control its own economy and provide a sustainable base for the exercise of talent in Scotland itself rather than in other people's economies.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para63"></a>It is in that context that I turn to the Bill before us. The proposals to amalgamate the Scottish Examination Board and SCOTVEC are encountering little fundamental opposition. What opposition there is is centred on the composition of the new governing board. While SCOTVEC is described as a typical quango, with little systematic representation from the industry, the Scottish Examination Board is atypical, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove, in that its board is made up from professional constituencies. I hope that the noble Earl will see the merit in reproducing that system when it comes to the detailed constitution of the new Scottish qualifications authority. Among others, I have two tasks for the new authority to tackle. The first is the process of establishing the status and equivalences of qualifications in Scotland so that those are universally understood. For example, how do you grade a three-year diploma in social work, a SCOTVEC certificate in building, a Scottish Higher National Certificate module in occupational psychology, a GCE A-level, eight GCE O-levels, and a SCOTVEC module in basic bricklaying? So task number one for the new Scottish qualifications authority will be to clarify the status of academic and vocational awards.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para64"></a>The second task will be to implement the new "advanced highers" and secure their place in the Scottish and wider British education system. I like the "advanced higher" concept for it extends the traditional Scottish higher system from one year's study to a more substantial two-year period. The "advanced higher" concept retains the broad base of five or six subjects and contrasts very favourably with the narrow base of two or three A-levels. This is likely to produce the kind of high-tech flexible workforce referred to earlier.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para65"></a>Part III of the Bill addresses problems which have occurred within school boards. The proposal to co-ordinate all their elections into an autumn period every second year may well draw greater attention to the school boards. The publicity certainly poses a risk of the politicisation of the school boards. That apart, there should be a better chance of school board members being given some training. There also seems to be a question about the powers of school boards to appoint head teachers. Do they hold too great a say in this, when the personalities on the school board are so transient, being dependent on their child remaining in school?
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para66"></a>Part IV introduces what are called "placing requests". That is a suitably obscure title for the proposed process of allowing a rural headmaster to keep 2 per cent. to 3 per cent. of the school places vacant at the beginning of the school year in order to meet the demand for places from families which move into the area during the school year. As a buoyant economy has a mobile workforce as one of its symptoms, the provision seems sensible to me. There is also a clarification of grounds for refusing a placing request. They relate to bad behaviour in another school. I wonder whether those grounds go against a family which somewhat desperately moves house to enable the child to have a fresh start in a new school.
<P>


<a name="column_1125"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1125</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para67"></a>In Clause 34, the Secretary of State clarifies that he has powers in regard to the Bill with the same versatility as the Cinzano girl. The declaration about the use of statutory instruments probably covers the non-appearance of the words "voucher scheme" and "pilot project" on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para68"></a>It is in Part II that the most controversial issue in the Bill lies. The proposal is to expand nursery provision to all four year-olds, on the face of it giving them a universal entitlement. I have no difficulty with the concept of expanding nursery education as, on these Benches, we advocate nursery education for both three and four year-olds, and, bravely, are prepared to pay for that by increased taxation if necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para69"></a>The Secretary of State proposes to take powers to make grants to anyone who satisfies the inspectors that they are appropriate people to provide nursery education. It is to be hoped that that means that they have suitable accommodation, adequate equipment and professional training. There is a big concern in Scotland about the quality threshold. I suspect that the minimum qualifying standards have not yet been published. The curriculum of those schools must be carefully devised so as not to disadvantage primary school entrants who have not been able to take up a place in such a nursery school. The curriculum should therefore be skills based rather than academic in any sense. I have in mind the ability of the child to recognise his name verbally and in writing, to fix shoelaces, to be independent of parents, to become familiar with the routine of the school day, and to go on visits with the class.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para70"></a>The idea of introducing the free market to educational provision concerns me. Is the start-up of many small businesses the way for the Scottish people to organise universal pre-school education? Anyone approaching a bank manager for a loan to set up such a business will be asked about the sustainability of the cash flow. Clearly the rumoured (or perhaps less definite) &#163;1,100 voucher scheme will be viable for at least 18 months, but will it be sustainable in the long term? Is it fair to encourage the setting up of small businesses when there may be a possible change of approach in policy quite soon? I hope that the noble Earl will consult widely about that. I wonder whether it is really the way to fund Scottish education.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para71"></a>My final point relates to the possible operation of a voucher scheme, and here I hope to be of some help to the noble Earl. A consensual approach is part of the Scottish Constitutional Convention's plans, so let me try it out here. I believe that a single voucher will be too inflexible, especially in the rural areas. Perhaps I may give an example. My nephew Euan currently attends a playgroup in his home village of Kilmelford on two mornings a week, and on two other mornings a week my sister-in-law drives him to Oban to attend another playgroup. The distance between Kilmelford and Oban is a far from straight 20 miles. The two return trips are a barely sustainable 80 miles. How will Euan administer his nursery school voucher in those circumstances? Will he be able to use the playgroups' safety scissors to cut it in half, presenting a half voucher in Kilmelford and Oban respectively? I offer the noble Earl a solution: that a rural voucher scheme would work only if the voucher <P>


<a name="column_1126"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1126</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>were a booklet of half-day individual payments. Those would be cashed in by the provider at the Scottish Office's private firm, probably in sackfuls.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para72"></a>I conclude with a plea that a Special Standing Committee be established to take evidence in Scotland. We shall be better able to proceed with the Bill in the light of Scottish opinion.

<P>
<A NAME="51211-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I personally have been looking forward to this Bill because the changes which it was predicted would be included--and which, it turns out, are included--are key parts of very important changes indeed which are now under way in our education system in Scotland. The setting up of the new Scottish qualifications authority in all the detail which Part I of the Bill sets out may on the face of it appear dull fare for the festive season. In fact, the bringing together of the work of the present examination board and the body overseeing vocational qualifications is, as my noble friend on the Front Bench explained, part of a much greater coming together. It is the next step in establishing new arrangements for courses and their constituent parts, for certificates and qualifications which should be of benefit to every young Scot engaged in post-16 education in the future. That is not dull fare at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para73"></a>In order to cater individually for every student, and after several reports and rounds of discussion over a number of years in Scotland, a comprehensive set of proposals is now out for consultation--I believe responses are due this month--on the suggested framework of courses and certificates that will be available. It is important for noble Lords who have not seen the document to appreciate that those units will be able to be combined to suit, and to challenge, any student, from the academic high-flyer, who will be able to end up with an award of esteem matching the French baccalaureate-type qualification, to the person motivated mainly by job-related and practical learning, and all sorts of students in between. There will be parity of regard for high standards, at whatever level and in whatever area. That is the plan.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para74"></a>It is clear to anyone studying these proposals that the separate working of the examination board and the vocational education council is no longer the best way. Their functions need to come together now in the proposed new body, which will administer a unified system. It seems from earlier speeches that there is agreement on the Front Benches about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para75"></a>It is not long since the Bill was published, but Part I seems so far to have been widely welcomed. The Committee of Scottish Higher Education Principals (CoSHEP) told me that it is happy with Part I. The initiative described is very important to the committee since in many ways it will set the standards for their Scottish entrants. The new body will, however, have no locus in degree courses. That is how the principals wish it. They wish the Bill to stay that way.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para76"></a>The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (CoSLA) told me--this was reflected in what has been said in our debate--that it is happy with the principle of <P>


<a name="column_1127"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1127</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the new authority. It has justifiable questions about how it will make its input. The new authority is to be self-financing, largely paid for by course and examination fees. I believe 70 per cent. of the authority's income will come that way. It will be paid through the local authorities. CoSLA's question is: how will the local authorities be able to have their say on the level of costs?
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para77"></a>The argument that we have had during the passage of every Bill over the past 10 years as to why everybody should be represented on such bodies and should not be appointed is, I presume from what I have heard, to be reiterated here. That is not necessarily the best answer. We shall see how we get on on that matter. However, the question is a justifiable one, and in due time, in Committee, we shall need an answer from the Government on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para78"></a>Part II of the Bill legislates to assist the expansion of nursery education and, importantly, to do so in a way that gives much needed encouragement to nursery schools and centres to pay attention to parents, and to parents to pay attention to what happens in their child's nursery school, as well as making it more likely that provision will materialise in areas where at the moment it does not exist, notably in the remoter rural areas of Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para79"></a>In welcoming the concept of the voucher scheme foreshadowed in the Bill, I declare a non-financial interest. I have the honour to be an honorary fellow of the Scottish Community Education Council. I am a past chairman of that body. In Scotland, as noble Lords who are based there know well, we have much excellent pre-school education, a good deal of it taking place in local authority nursery schools and classes. Over half of all four year-olds in Scotland attend those nursery schools and classes. There are also other local authority children's centres. In addition, though, there are private nurseries and many excellent pre-school playgroups. A number of those playgroups are partly funded by local authorities by way of the voluntary organisation, the Scottish Pre-school Playgroups Association. Some 80,000 children receive their nursery education through pre-school playgroups in Scotland, of which 5,000 four year-olds are eligible under the plans in so far as we understand them under the Bill. Those playgroups specialise in involving parents. They are seen in Scotland as part of community education, whereby many parents learn about bringing up their children by helping with and being in contact with the playgroup. That is an approach that is not always favoured, it has to be said, by professional nursery school teachers.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para80"></a>The importance of parental involvement in a child's education does not begin in primary school. It is even more important pre-school, as research is increasingly establishing. It is therefore critical that in expanding pre-school education in Scotland we do not lose the variety of provision that we already have. It is critical that those who are skilled in training pre-school educators to involve and teach parents, as the Scottish Pre-school Playgroups Association does, should be <P>


<a name="column_1128"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>enabled to expand their work, and that any professional teachers who at present pay scant regard to parents should find it necessary to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para81"></a>Many parents, armed with vouchers, will find themselves in a stronger position with their nursery school than at present. However, they may also find that they have more responsibility. That will be no bad thing. I am very sorry that the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Labour Party, and as it now seems even the Liberal Democrats, are apparently against the scheme. I believe that it is in the mainstream Scots tradition of community education, as well as giving a better chance to many Scots, particularly in remote rural areas, where there is no present provision at all, to have nursery education opportunities. I hope that when we discuss the question of a voucher scheme in Scotland, we shall have a very different sort of debate to that which will take place about England. The circumstances and the educational culture, and arrangements across Scotland, are quite different.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para82"></a>With regard to school boards, Part III of the Bill does not go so far as I had hoped but will certainly help. In Scotland our local authorities have, I believe unwisely, been very reluctant indeed generally to devolve power to schools. Being a school board member is, thus, not as interesting or worthwhile a job as it should be. Consequently, not enough able people are willing to stand. When too few people come forward or members resign for any reason, some authorities and the schools themselves make very little effort to find replacements. The Bill will make it necessary and easier to keep fully manned schools boards in place. That is good.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para83"></a>I believe that there is further to go before schools acquire the full benefit of a properly decentralised system. For some reason, people believe that something is wrong with that because it is English. There is something right about it for Scotland but we have not yet appreciated it. That is my view.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para84"></a>Unlike the other parts of the Bill, Clause 32 is an adjustment to changes already established, accepted and working well--the ability of parents to choose their child's school. All the same arguments were used when that legislation came before Parliament. Now, everybody accepts it and the parties opposite seem to have forgotten that they opposed it to the end. It works well and it is popular. I believe that that will happen to the voucher scheme; but be that as it may. Clause 32 should make it easier for popular schools which attract children from a wide area to ensure there is still room for new pupils who come to live locally. There may be details of the clause that we need to examine but in principle it seems sensible and desirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-04_para85"></a>I have looked forward to the Bill and now, like the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, I look forward greatly to its Committee stage. I support the Second Reading.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<FONT SIZE=3>this Bill. May I suggest to him that it might be better if he were to speak during the gap after his noble friends have spoken?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, it is with even more trepidation that I now stand to speak on the Education (Scotland) Bill. Perhaps I should declare and explain my interest. I declare my interest as a member of a local education authority in England and chairman of the Association of County Councils for England and Wales. We work on many issues in co-operation and discussion with our Scottish colleagues who are members of CoSLA. I declare my interest as someone who chaired a local education authority in the United Kingdom for 10 years. I feel less hesitant about raising the universal applicability of nursery vouchers having heard the introduction to the Second Reading made by the noble Earl, Lord Lindsay.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para0"></a>I feel that everyone is united in believing that there is a need to expand nursery education to all four and three year-old children whose parents wish them to have it. Any proposal which seeks to make that provision should have wholehearted support. I also, as a parent, make plain that my children benefited from the pre-school playgroup movement, toddlers clubs and a variety of provision, including early admission to school. Therefore, I have full and great respect for the complementary parts of provision for pre-school children.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para1"></a>However, I put before your Lordships the view that to lower the quality of nursery education, with its special complementary role, would be a retrograde step. The trained nursery teacher and the complementary and extremely important nature and role of the fully qualified nursery assistant/nursery nurse are integral parts of that pre-school provision which is unique, special and complementary to other forms of provision. Therefore, any proposal needs to be judged on whether it offers an extension of availability of that service to all children whose parents wish them to have it. There is no evidence. In fact, as I shall demonstrate, there is evidence that the Government's proposals will reduce the ability of those who make the current provision to continue to provide it in terms of quality, quantity and range of service.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para2"></a>The first question that I should like to ask on behalf of those in Scotland who are concerned is: which is the age group of children to which the Government refer? In Scotland, as in other parts of the United Kingdom, local education authorities make provision to enable children to attend school before the statutory school age and make resource provision in some cases to nursery level of resourcing. As my noble friend Lord Carmichael said, the figures from Strathclyde show that the Government's proposals will not allow parents to buy with the voucher value that provision which their child already receives.
<P>


<a name="column_1130"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para3"></a>My second question is: does the provision extend choice to a wider group of parents than at present? It is quite clearly the case that more people will have access to some funds. But not all people will have access to increased funds to the level that would enable them to purchase full and properly resourced nursery education. These proposals represent little more than a redistribution of the money that is currently spent.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para4"></a>We need to consider on whom the money is spent now. At the moment, in most areas there is a combination of factors which ensures that the incidence of nursery education provided through the local education authority is at a high level. Perhaps the most common factor is the recognition by local education authorities in areas of extreme social and educational disadvantage--areas in which non-statemented special needs pupils (those with moderate learning difficulties) are found in higher percentages than in the rest of the population. The needs of those children who require expansion of their literacy and numeracy skills and their ability to cope and develop should be met in that way, just as the needs of children who come from homes where the mother tongue is not English or Scottish are met in that way. The acid test is whether the Government's proposal protects those who are most vulnerable by ensuring that the parents will receive the resources necessary to continue to purchase and that the local education authorities concerned will retain enough resources to be able to continue to make that provision. So far the Government have failed on any public occasion to provide an answer.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para5"></a>A variety of provision exists within the area of nursery education in Scotland as it does elsewhere in the United Kingdom: within nursery schools, nursery classes, nursery education and children's centres and within reception classes, where additional resources are made available to meet the needs of children. This is a complex area. We are told that the Government are interested in piloting a scheme and monitoring the results. Can the noble Earl tell the House why it is necessary to introduce legislation before the first pilot scheme has even begun, bearing in mind, as my noble friend Lord Carmichael reminded us, that 80 per cent. of those consulted were opposed to it? Why is it necessary to introduce legislation at this stage?
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para6"></a>Many questions will need to be asked during further stages of this Bill. It is surprising that for the people of Scotland the Government appear to be proposing to take money that is currently spent in areas of greatest need in order to provide a universal non-means-tested benefit. I say that as someone who recognised, along with our partners, the Church authorities, and my local authority in the north of England, the need to deal with the most advantaged areas first. That has been one of the main features of the development of nursery education in Scotland. As a principle, that will come under detailed scrutiny at later stages of the Bill. On the face of it, it would appear to be a strange philosophy for this Government to follow.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para7"></a>Nursery education is extremely important. It is clear that the Government's vouchers will not buy nursery education in full nursery education facilities for all children whose parents wish them to have it; the amount <P>


<a name="column_1131"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1131</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is inadequate. It is also clear that wherever parents are consulted, in Scotland or elsewhere, and whatever other complementary provision they seek for their children, only a tiny percentage say no to the choice of fully-funded nursery education in a nursery school or class.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para8"></a>If the Government want a pilot scheme, surely it is in the interests of the children of Scotland that they evaluate that scheme and look at what it does to the existing provision before taking it further. The experience of my colleagues in Scotland has been somewhat bitter in the past when the Government failed to listen to early warnings. They suffered first from the poll tax. The Government have made many expensive mistakes in the United Kingdom by making decisions in advance of detailed knowledge. I hope that they will agree to withdraw legislation intended to enact provisions, the dangers of which have not yet been assessed and which 80 per cent. of those consulted said that they did not trust or want.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-05_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Baroness sits down, perhaps I may ask whether she realises that the pilot schemes are to begin in England first rather than in Scotland. I was disappointed about that. Scots are chary about something being tried in England before it is introduced in Scotland. Was the noble Baroness aware of that?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-05_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, yes. My point concerned the dangers of introducing legislation in advance of understanding the implications that arise during a pilot scheme, rather than the fact of it being introduced in any one region first. It is the danger inherent in the Government's policy of deciding on the back of an envelope what may appear to the uncharitable to be an exercise in electoral popularity rather than a genuine desire to see whether their policies work in the interests of all children.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_time1"></A><H5>5.5 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, first, I thank the noble Earl, Lord Lindsay, for the way in which he presented this Bill and explained its provisions to us. However, having concluded the niceties, I must register my anxiety about the pre-school provisions of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para9"></a>Originally I decided to speak essentially on three topics. The first related to the context of the Bill and how it is to be handled. That resulted from the comments of the Leader of the House in the debate on the Queen's Speech, which suggested that Scottish legislation originating in this House may be dealt with differently. From the speech of the noble Earl it appears that this Bill will not be treated in a special way, though there may be arguments to do so. My second point related to the Scottish qualifications authority and the third to education for children under school age.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para10"></a>When I read through the Bill, one of the matters that concerned me about the setting up of the Scottish qualifications authority, was that the vocational training and qualifications may be submerged into what may be described as a "sea of academia". We must recognise <P>


<a name="column_1132"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1132</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the changes that have occurred in practical education over the past 20 or 30 years have made it much more academic. The skills that children in our schools learnt 20 or 30 years ago--for example, woodwork or metalwork--are no longer effectively taught in schools. Craft apprenticeships that once existed in their thousands, now virtually do not exist at all. I feel that we need to ensure that vocational training and qualifications are recognised as important elements and do not become submerged by paper qualifications.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para11"></a>With regard to the Scottish qualifications agency, there is another element that we need to recognise; that is, the relationship between Scottish and English qualifications. In our modern society mobility has become necessary in one's employment career. It is necessary for the smooth working of society, for skilled and professional people in one field to be able to move around the country and work in different places. If there is not a comparability between qualifications obtained by young people in Scotland and those obtained in England, that mobility of labour, which should be present to enable our society to work more effectively and efficiently, will not exist. As far as I can gather no one has so far mentioned that important element and perhaps the Minister will comment on that point when he winds up.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para12"></a>I turn to my point relating to the education of children under school age--the nursery voucher scheme. As far as I can see, the scheme will initially be a bureaucratic nightmare. It is interesting to hear the Minister's explanation of some of the bureaucratic problems and systems that will need to be set up and uprated to make the scheme work. That is bad enough. But what I call the fundamental "evil", is that it is planned to take resources away from relatively poor people and transfer them to relatively well-off people. That is evil and it is something which the Government have perpetrated year in, year out.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para13"></a>The classic example was the poll tax where, again, Scotland suffered before England. The costs of relatively well-off people were reduced while the costs of poorer people were increased--a direct transfer of resources from the poor to the rich. The people of this country rose up and said, "We are not having it", and the Government, because of the pressure of circumstances, eventually had to change tack. They introduced something similar to the old rates system but in the process of doing so they have prevented the progressive element of the old rating system from operating effectively. Now the relatively well-off people in our local communities who pay council tax do not pay in proportion to their means, as they used to do under the old rating system; they pay less proportionately. One thinks of the local authority provision of pre-school playgroups and nursery places, paid for by increased rates, mainly in Labour local authorities, and built up over the years with capital investment, training for the staff and all the facilities that were required. What is horrendous is that the Government's proposal for a voucher scheme will take away hard earned money that has been invested by the community in such provision <P>


<a name="column_1133"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and give it to those local authority areas that have not seen fit to provide pre-school playgroups and nursery services.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para14"></a>I have some personal experience of how the system works in that when my wife and I were bringing up our family we originally lived in Stockport, which was a Conservative local authority area with no public provision for playgroups or nursery schools. We had to pay for pre-school playgroups out of our own pockets. The quid pro quo was that the rates were lower. We moved to Manchester where the rates were higher and there were free playschool services and free nursery services available for our children. I have seen the situation from both sides of the divide. It is totally pernicious that the Government should be aiming to take money from the less well-off areas that have invested in such provision and give it to those areas which, historically, have not.

<P>
<A NAME="51211-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Taylor of Gryfe: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for speaking in the gap and I shall speak briefly on the matters before the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, made an interesting comment on what is perhaps one of the less contentious parts of the Bill. I refer to the election of school boards. He made the point that to have a national election with a national election day would introduce a great political debate in Scotland and that it would be like having a local authority election, with all the elements of party conflict that are involved in local authority and national elections. He was in fact saying that we will be as helpful as possible in looking at the Bill and not introduce unnecessary political conflict. We will not look at it from a purely ideological point of view. However, that does not mean that we will not be critical of the Bill in certain aspects. We will endeavour in the course of the long Committee stage which has been promised by the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, to improve the Bill and we will try to be helpful in the light of our experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para16"></a>Like other noble Lords, I received a brief from CoSLA, the local authorities' representative in Scotland. It is very close to this business as it has had the responsibility of administering education in Scotland. I hope that the representations made by CoSLA will receive very serious consideration from the Minister. On the first page of its representations CoSLA states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We are concerned that the arrangements for quality assurance may not be prescriptive enough for students with special educational needs and the protection of these students' interests would be welcome". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Perhaps the Minister will comment on that, as it is an important area.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para17"></a>The question of vouchers will be dealt with by my noble friend Lord Ewing and has already been dealt with very thoroughly in the intervention of the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington. CoSLA makes two points on this subject. It says that it is certainly in favour of the extension of the provision of pre-five education in Scotland--we all welcome that--but it has doubts about the operation of the voucher system as the appropriate <P>


<a name="column_1134"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>means of delivering that education. During the discussions at the Committee stage I hope that we will have another careful look at that and listen very carefully to the CoSLA representations.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para18"></a>CoSLA makes the point that there will be a right to a voucher, but that is not a guarantee of a place. That point has to be answered. It would also like an assurance that if the pilot schemes are not successful the Government will guarantee that the vouchers approach will be abandoned. Those are serious representations. As I said, I address this Bill not in any party political spirit. We shall try to be as constructive as possible in the interests of maintaining the highest standards for Scottish education.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_time3"></A><H5>5.18 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-05_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, first, I must apologise to the Minister for not being present at the very start of his speech. However, I think I heard the bulk of it. The reason for my absence was that the aeroplane was somewhat late, to put it mildly.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para19"></a>I wish to say very little about Parts I and III in that the controversy and the interest will be in the voucher scheme and the extension of nursery education. I say to my neighbour, the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, that the Liberal Party has approved of the use of vouchers in certain circumstances, so that we are not automatically against the Government's scheme. I was delighted to hear from the Minister that pre-school education can make a tremendous difference to people. I wonder what it would have done for me if I had had it. I was sent to a primary school at the age of four because of a tendency to try out on hens' eggs the effect of putting them through the turnip hasher, so obviously I would have benefited greatly from pre-school education.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para20"></a>The rest of the Bill is not nearly as interesting or controversial. The Government are following their old trend in Part I by wanting to appoint everyone and keeping the local authorities in their place as regards the new authority. I am also interested in Part III of the Bill and the business of the maximum and minimum number of places. It appears to me that the real stipulation should be the minimum number of places that have to be kept because, obviously, if people are willing to come a long distance to bring their children to a particular school because of its excellence, then those pupils will be very desirable for that particular school to take. Therefore it is essential to have a minimum number of places so that people who actually live in the area will not be squeezed out from their old school.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para21"></a>The Government's intention to provide pre-school places for all children is of course wholly admirable, but I do not know if the voucher system is the right answer. To put it mildly, it bristles with difficulties. In my own parish of Kirriemuir, a number of parents have run admirable pre-school facilities in a hall there. That has been of immense benefit to the children and certainly to their parents. I do not know whether they have a properly qualified nursery teacher, but I do know that that voluntary effort did a lot of good for the children concerned. It broadened their horizons and everything else.
<P>


<a name="column_1135"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para22"></a>If the Government are looking at the use of vouchers and hoping that a great many private companies will spring up and compete for people, I cannot believe that that can be the right way to go about it. The Minister was very particular when talking about inspection. If one is really to have a wide field, then how many children are needed to make a group which would be useful and which would give them the necessary stimulus? Will it be a dozen? How will it be licensed and how is one to train the nursery school teacher, which is a profession of its own?
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para23"></a>There are a great many features which cannot be helped by the tendency to have a competitive system. It cannot be right for education. I would have thought that the privatisation of the prisons taught the Government a lesson. The motivation of profit is not the right way to run a prison or any nursery school.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para24"></a>Everyone can see that this scheme will benefit enormously the parents who desire to see their children having pre-school nursery education and who can afford to pay for it. It will be of great benefit to them, but it will not benefit the children of people who cannot or do not understand how good the scheme is, but whose children need the stimulus the most. All these things seem to be ignored by the Government in their thinking on these matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para25"></a>There was another point raised by the noble Baroness about local authorities, which are providing a great deal--not 100 per cent.--of first-class nursery education. They are spending not &#163;1,100, or whatever notional figure it is, but something like &#163;3,000. It may be possible for the scheme to be cheaper because local authorities are not very economical, but they will not be that far out. What are the Government going to do then? If the Treasury authorises the payment of vouchers, one can bet one's boots that it will be looking for blood from elsewhere. The Government will need to be quite clear on these excellently run and funded local authority bodies and their schools and that they do not suffer from the new voucher system.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para26"></a>The inspection and licensing of the schools or groups needs to be extremely well done. I do not mean that it should insist on every detail, but some competent person has to decide that the size of a group in a rural area, for example, is right. That has to be done not only by rules and regulations, but by a great deal of common sense. Obviously, the pilot scheme is enormously important in this matter. I hope that the experience from it will be of benefit to the Government. Fortunately, by the time this pilot scheme comes to fruition, the present Government may not be in power which, in my view, will be a blessing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-05_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, I shall come to the point on which the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, finished--that is to say, the vouchers. But before doing so perhaps I may join with all noble Lords and Baronesses who have spoken in the debate in congratulating the noble Earl the Minister on the way in which he presented the Bill. I have noticed that since he <P>


<a name="column_1136"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1136</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>came to the Front Bench he is one of the very few Ministers in Her Majesty's Government who, at least outwardly, gives the appearance of believing in what he is reading. He was most convincing today in his performance at the Dispatch Box.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para27"></a>However, I have to say that he is well supported. When I saw the troops trooping in to support the Minister in the presentation of this Bill, my thoughts returned to the D-Day landings on the beaches of Normandy. It is a salutary thought that it took only three support troops to land every fighting soldier on the beaches of Normandy, but there were more than double that number of support troops supporting the Minister today to launch this Bill from the Dispatch Box of your Lordships' House. So when I saw the support troops filing in, I realised then that there was much more to this Bill than I had originally anticipated and that I had better give it just a little more detailed thought. So during the course of the debate I took the trouble to have a second look at the Bill. I was delighted to hear my noble friend Lord Taylor of Gryfe say that he is giving up his annual holiday in Antigua in early 1996 in order to join the Committee stage which is going to consider this Bill. My noble friend paved the way for me to have a critical look at the legislation which is before us.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para28"></a>The first critical point I make is that this Bill does not cost the Government a penny piece: there is not a single penny piece of government money in this Bill. It is being funded entirely by local authorities; and I shall come to that point particularly as regards the voucher scheme. There is no new investment, but money is taken from local authorities to fund these proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para29"></a>The proposals in the Bill are divided into four parts. I shall deal with each part as briefly as I can. I turn first to the establishment of the Scottish Qualifications Authority. As the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, said, there is widespread agreement across the Floor of the House and in educational circles--the two are not necessarily related--that it is a step in the right direction. As the noble Baroness said, it is linked to the project Higher Still.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para30"></a>However, I have one criticism that the Minister should take on board. I refer to the fact that 70 per cent. of the expenditure of the Scottish Qualifications Authority will be funded by local authorities. When we hear of the proposed composition of the board, we find that the Secretary of State is to appoint up to 15 members, with the board itself appointing up to five members, so there does not seem to be much room for the involvement of local authorities in the spending of what is, after all, their council tax money. The local authorities will have to have a say, particularly with regard to the capital investment programme which is to be embarked upon by the Scottish Qualifications Authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para31"></a>I should like to put another point to the Minister in relation to the authority. It is right that we should aim for higher and higher standards--I support that--but we must never lose sight of the pupils in our education system who have special needs. If we were to allow children with special educational needs to be left behind so that we may achieve those desirable targets, <P>


<a name="column_1137"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we would be failing in our duty to the whole community and would merely aggravate the educational divide that has developed, particularly in Scotland, over the past few years. I leave the subject of the Scottish Qualifications Authority with those few critical observations.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para32"></a>Perhaps I may turn now to the question of school boards, and in particular to the relaxation in Clause 32 in relation to placement requests. Despite what the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, said, when the original legislation giving parental choice was put through both Houses, one of the warnings which was given to the Government, which the Government ignored, related to what happens when a school is full and when people moving into the area cannot send their child to the local school of their choice for the good and simple reason that it is full to capacity. That point was resisted. Indeed, our view was rejected, thrown out and treated with disdain.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para33"></a>However, time moves on and events have taken their course. The village of Balfron has played a notable part in our discussions today. It is what happened at the high school in Balfron which has led to the relaxation of the provisions in Clause 32. I am in favour of that relaxation, but it is better that we put the reason for it on the record. If the Secretary of State, in his capacity as constituency Member of Parliament for Stirling, had not received all those complaints about the inability of people moving into the area to enrol their children at Balfron High School, we would not have that relaxation. As I have said, I am grateful for it, but I think that it is important to have on the record the circumstances which have brought it about.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para34"></a>Another aspect of school boards which I should like to mention has been raised by my noble friend Lord Carmichael. I refer to single-day elections to school boards. I believe that we shall see a Scotland-wide campaign on the day of elections to school boards, which may comprise political parties or interest groups and, democrat though I am, I take the view that that would not be in the best interests of the governance of Scotland's schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para35"></a>One point which has not been mentioned during the debate is the change in the provisions relating to the way in which a member of a school board may be removed from the board. It is clear in the 1980 Act that a member can be removed from the board only if he or she is mentally unwell or is otherwise unwell and suffering from another illness. Under the changes proposed in the Bill, those provisions are deleted and merely the word "unfit" is to be substituted. That could mean anything; it could mean politically unfit; it could certainly mean medically unfit; it could mean a whole host of things. I believe that that widening of the definition will need to be explained. Until now, the definition of the circumstances under which a member of a school board may be removed has been adequate for the purpose. I think that we have a right to know why those provisions are being deleted and why the very wide power suggested by the word "unfit" is to be substituted.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para36"></a>So, I leave the subjects of school boards and the Scottish Qualifications Authority and come to the central issue of the Bill. It is interesting that the Bill <P>


<a name="column_1138"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>does not refer to vouchers. The Government must have received the very good advice to leave the word "vouchers" out of the Bill. They must have been told, "Vouchers are unpopular and if you use the word you will simply draw people's attention to what you are doing, so, for goodness sake, don't include the word 'voucher' in the legislation". However, as the Minister, to his credit, openly and honestly made clear in his introduction, the Bill is about the introduction of a voucher system. The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, said that we would oppose that. I must certainly express the strongest possible reservations about the introduction of such a system and I do so for a number of reasons. First, it is a fact that &#163;1,100 will not purchase a nursery place. The average cost of a nursery place in a local authority-run nursery school in Scotland is &#163;2,600, so &#163;1,100 will not purchase even half a nursery place.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para37"></a> However, we must also consider the questions of a top-up and of the way in which those local authorities which run nursery schools are to be discriminated against when compared to the providers of private nursery school places. Those points too will need to be explained.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para38"></a>Perhaps I may give noble Lords one or two examples. In a private nursery, parents who wish to top up the &#163;1,100 voucher will be able to do so, but if a parent chooses to use a local authority nursery school, that parent will not be allowed to top up the &#163;1,100 voucher. So we have discrimination right away. It is discrimination against local authorities. The net result is that local authorities which are already funding the voucher scheme--I shall give an example relating to Fife--will have to find more resources to ensure that the children who are enrolled in their nursery schools receive the level of nursery education which local authorities want to provide.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para39"></a>I refer again to private sector nursery education. I have nothing against private nursery education, but the Minister knows that a &#163;1,100 voucher, which is based on a &#163;2 per hour fee, will not purchase private nursery education in the area where we live. I have made inquiries about it. The voucher will not buy even half a place.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para40"></a>The other element of discrimination against local authorities is that in the private sector of nursery education the private providers are to be allowed to use the proceeds of the &#163;1,100 voucher to pay the interest on loans borrowed to finance capital investment. That is not a facility that is to be made available to local authorities. Indeed, the opposite is the case. Here I come to the superb example of Fife Region. Fife Region is a good example because, when the new authority comes into being on 1st April 1996, it will still be an all-Fife authority. So we do not have the fragmented approach that is taking place in Strathclyde or Central Region. In Strathclyde's case, one authority is being replaced by 16 and in Central Region by three authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-05_para41"></a>In Fife, 97 per cent. of all four year-old children have nursery places. It is quoted in government reports as having the best record throughout the country. Fife spends &#163;6 million a year (capital and current) on nursery <P>


<a name="column_1139"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1139</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>education. Of that &#163;6 million, the Scottish Office gives a grant, under the expenditure grants system, of &#163;1.5 million. Under option two for funding the voucher scheme contained in the Bill, Fife will have taken from it &#163;5.2 million.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   How much?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, &#163;5.2 million; in other words, the Government are taking back the whole of the grant plus a fairly large percentage of the capital investment that Fife makes in nursery education. I do not know whether or not the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, is looking for inspiration, but I say to her that when the Bill goes to Committee she cannot possibly support that situation. It is unsupportable. That is why when I saw the troops trooping in to support the Minister I realised that I had better have a much closer look at the Bill, and for the benefit of the noble Baroness in particular, I thought that I would bring out these detailed points. I am just giving her time to think about what she is going to ask me before she gets to her feet. I thought I would make those points in order to give her time to think about it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I was interested in what he said. I know that Fife has that great reputation. What would happen in Fife under option one, as a matter of interest? We do not know whether option one, option two or none of the options will be adopted.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, what will happen in Fife under option one is what will happen throughout Scotland under option one: the number of vouchers going to the private sector will be deducted from the government grant to the local authorities in the area where the vouchers are used in the private sector. It is as simple as that. Under option two it is much more severe.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-06_para0"></a>On topping up vouchers, here again it is important that the Government understand the hole that they are digging for themselves--the situation that they are creating. It is expensive to provide nursery education in a rural area, and in the rural areas there is little or no provision at present. The scheme will divide the community in rural areas, because one parent will say, "I'll get my cheque book out. I can afford to top up the &#163;1,100". I always remember Michael Forsyth, the Secretary of State, saying that he made his educational choices through his cheque book.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-06_para1"></a>So we will have some parents in the rural areas who will get out their cheque books. They will top up the &#163;1,100. There will be other parents in rural areas who just cannot afford to top up the &#163;1,100. We will create the situation where there are a dozen children at the same nursery school with one half of them receiving more nursery education than the other half. This myth--it is a myth--that the nursery voucher is a passport to nursery education is unsustainable. It is not a passport to nursery education. It is a voucher to buy &#163;1,100-worth of nursery education, but in the estimation of those who know about these things that amounts to only eight hours a <P>


<a name="column_1140"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>week. Those who can do so will buy their 20 or 30 hours a week while the rest of the community will have to make do with the eight hours.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-06_para2"></a>The whole scheme should be withdrawn. It is not even worth a pilot scheme. If there are pilot trials, I hope that when the Minister replies he will give the House an assurance that if the pilot scheme is shown to be a failure--I do not see how it can succeed--the Government will not press ahead with the proposal. I hope that the Government will have not just the courage but the wisdom to withdraw the scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-06_para3"></a> Finally, will the Minister give an indication of how the Government propose to handle the Bill's future stages, because there is some doubt about how they will he handled.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   Now answer that!
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-06_time0"></A><H5>5.46 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-06_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, there are lots of answers. This has been a wide ranging and interesting debate. I am grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part. They have all contributed a certain level of experience to the debate and a certain level of speculation, but I shall come to the speculation in a second. Noble Lords on all sides of the House have contributed a level of knowledge. The scrutiny of the Bill will be all the better for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-06_para4"></a>As was indicated at the beginning of the debate, the Bill, with provisions ranging from pre-five education to post-16 qualifications, will maintain and further enhance the high standard of education and training in Scotland. The noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, hinted that the traditional reputation for excellence that education in Scotland has enjoyed might not continue. That is not the case. I am not sure on what grounds he was seeking to undermine Scotland's current reputation in education.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-06_para5"></a>Many of the changes proposed in the Bill are proposed after extensive consultation, despite assertions to the contrary. I welcome the suggestions and questions which have been lodged today. I welcome also the expressions of support the Bill has received, especially from my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour who has great experience in this field.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-06_para6"></a>I shall pick up as many of the points as time will allow me. Because of the volume of points made, I doubt whether I shall be able to cover them all. The noble Lord, Lord Ewing, was surprised that there were so many troops here in support of the Bill, but in Scotland we regard education as being a central subject, as the noble Lord knows. That is why I did not bring a man and a dog; we brought the whole team, because of the fundamental value of education within Scottish life.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-06_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove, asked me a number of questions, some of which, but not all, I can answer now. The noble Lord, the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, and my noble friend Lady Carnegy asked about the representative nature of the existing SEB as regards the new membership of the SQA. We have consulted on the different options available for the composition of the SQA. It is vital that we have flexibility to represent the varying interests of education, <P>


<a name="column_1141"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1141</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>training, employers and industry. The large boards which run the SEB and SCOTVEC are doing so very well. Combined, they would lead to a board of unmanageable proportions.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-06_para8"></a>We are insistent on flexibility so that all those interests can be represented on the new SQA board and that the members of that board will be there as a result of individual merit rather than the mechanics of a nominee system. I stress that the Secretary of State, in making appointments, must take into account the interests of education authorities. More explicitly, the Bill provides for the SQA to have regard to the interests of those using its services, including the education authorities. Apart from the training and employer's interests, specific note will be taken of the education authorities involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-06_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, asked two questions about the vocational dimension of the new SQA. I can assure him that the SCOTVEC national certificate, which is available in schools and colleges, is geared to educational training and is widely accepted as such. This success will be part of the foundation on which Higher Still will be built. The vocational side of the SQA management and the application of its powers will not be lost in a welter of academia. I can also assure the noble Lord on the parity of esteem between the Scottish and English qualifications. Scottish vocational qualifications are recognised throughout the country. They are mutually recognised between England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. They are part of the national framework of vocational qualifications introduced by the Government. Similarly, the general SVQs and NVQs, which prepare young people and adult returners for employment, are broadly comparable and are accepted as regards equivalent employment opportunities.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-06_para10"></a>My noble friend Lady Carnegy asked about the financial side of the SQA and the role of CoSLA in considering estimates. The Bill provides for the Secretary of State to determine the financial duties of the SQA as a means of safeguarding the interests of customers, in particular in relation to the level of fees. The SQA would have the power to fix fees for its services but those must conform to criteria set by the Secretary of State. The Bill also provides for the SQA to have regard to the interests of persons using its services. That is most important because we fully appreciate that local authorities will be the significant customers of the SQA and therefore its most significant funders.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-06_para11"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, asked questions similar to those asked by the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, about the SQA and equivalent qualifications. The noble Earl also asked specifically about the implementation of the new advanced higher qualification. The SQA will have an important role in the Higher Still initiative, which includes the advanced higher qualification. The Government attach a high priority to that initiative. Despite all the derogatory chat about the Government's funding commitment to education in Scotland, today's announcement on funding in Scotland includes a continuing and increasing commitment to the Higher Still initiative.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-06_para12"></a>Perhaps Part II of the Bill exercised more of your Lordships' effort as regards what was and was not taking place. A stimulating proportion of myth and speculation came from various noble Lords. I must stress at the outset that we have always acknowledged that, although we fundamentally believe the voucher system to be right in principle, there will in practice be certain constraints, problems and unforeseen difficulties which must be overcome. We have consulted and considered the consultation to date already. The pilot scheme is about to take place and that will be evaluated extremely carefully. The pilot scheme will seek a representative range of the different types of community across Scotland. At the end of the day, the ability that the Bill provides to grant vouchers to pre-school providers is a power rather than a duty. In the light of our experience and knowledge of the subject, we can tailor the voucher system to best provide the benefits that we know it contains.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-06_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ewing, made assertions that the scheme would be particularly difficult to run in rural areas. I wish to take issue with that assertion now and probably when we reach some of the finer detail of the Bill. At present there are few providers in rural areas. The combination of that and the sparse scattering of potential pupils can make for an expensive service. However, a voucher system introduced into a rural area can increase the demand and make the provision of a service much more economic. The &#163;1,100 value of the voucher, which is being focused on by a number of noble Lords, is based on careful calculations. It is based on the results of studies and on our estimated average cost of part-time pre-school education across Scotland. It is an average cost and I as much as any other noble Lord can produce examples of where it might be higher. But there are examples of where the cost is lower. Local authorities which choose to spend more will have the chance to top up that funding, just as they can now. Parents sending their children to private providers will have a similar choice to top up. But there is nothing inadequate about the voucher value, as the noble Lord admitted when he acknowledged that in the private sector it would cover not just current costs but would also be able to cover interest on capital.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-06_para14"></a>At the heart of some of the misconceptions was the assertion made by a number of noble Lords that the entire voucher system would be funded by the local authorities. That is not the case. The Government are putting in new money; when the voucher system is up and running the Government will have put in &#163;30 million-worth of new money. Therefore, when local authority providers of pre-school education attract extra places they will be attracting extra funds to the provision of that service--<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I apologise for interrupting him. As I read the Bill, it is absolutely clear that there is no cost to public funds. It goes on to state:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an assessment based on available information will be made at the time when this is established". <P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2></UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para0"></a>That is hardly an indication of additional resources from the Government. Normally, legislation contains an indication of any additional resources and charges on public funds and staff. There is nothing about that in this Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-07_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I am pleased to enlighten the House. It is a matter to which we can return at later stages of the Bill. We expect that more than &#163;30 million of new public money will go to nursery education through the voucher system. I believe that that will be universally welcomed. It will also enable more money to flow into local authorities which, through vouchers, manage to increase the provision of pre-school education.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para1"></a>The assertion that the whole of Scotland was up in arms against the voucher system was also misleading. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, said that only four local authorities had expressed an interest. In fact, the number is eight. I shall not detail them tonight but I can in correspondence detail which they are. We are encouraging others to come forward--and there is considerable interest--to ascertain whether they wish to become part of the pilot scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para2"></a>Noble Lords asked why we are introducing the clause in the first place, given that there is an existing power under the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 to cover the nursery voucher system. I said in my introductory speech that we are offering Parliament an opportunity to debate this new initiative. Although there has been little thanks for the opportunity which we have provided for noble Lords, it has flagged up some of the concerns which exist. Under the present legislation, there is a general power to give grants. We wished to bring this forward merely to encourage greater debate.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for giving way. Perhaps we may return to the contribution which he says that the Government will make to pre-school provision. He mentioned a figure of &#163;30 million. In the preamble to the Bill, a figure of &#163;71 million is mentioned for payments under Clause 23 for 1998-99. Do we read from what the noble Earl said and from what is written in the preamble that the Government will be taking &#163;40 million from the local authorities, putting in &#163;30 million and then distributing that &#163;70 million? Is that a correct reading of the situation?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-07_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I think that we are making progress; that is a correct reading of the situation. That is why new money is coming into the system. Through the voucher system, new money will go to all providers of education whether they are in the private, voluntary or local authority sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para3"></a>My noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour asked about the powers of school boards and why we are not increasing them. The changes reflect responses to the consultation paper. School boards remain free to seek delegated functions from their education authorities where they wish. We are not changing that.
<P>


<a name="column_1144"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1144</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, asked about the absence of a curricular framework for the providers of pre-school education. The basis for a clear curricular framework was set out in our publication for pre-fives' education. That was prepared earlier this year by Her Majesty's Inspectorate and was summarised in the August consultation paper. Details will be worked out in the approach to the pilot scheme. That will involve much of the excellent work already done throughout Scotland but especially by some regional authorities--and I have mentioned Strathclyde in particular.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para5"></a>Quality is central to pre-school provision. I urge all noble Lords to concentrate on the emphasis which I placed on quality in my opening speech rather than merely going back over the same ground again. We are determined that quality should be assured and that parents and taxpayers can be confident about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para6"></a>The pilot scheme will be properly evaluated, which will reassure the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael. It is meant to be an illuminating exercise which should point to the solutions needed where problems arise. I should say also to the noble Lord that access to the child benefit register is necessary only for the names and addresses of those families with eligible children. No other information will be passed on to any agency from that register. Therefore, any details about the finances or economic status of those families will not be part of the information transferred. The information is needed only to identify those families which have eligible children.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para7"></a>The subject of special educational needs was mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, and the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe. That is an area of Scottish education which we take very seriously. No change is currently planned for the present arrangements. Children with special educational needs will remain with the same priority rating which they have today. However, if we can persuade a higher proportion of four year-olds into education, we should be able to spot earlier than would otherwise have been the case some of the children who fall into that category. That will be a continuing area of consultation. It is certainly an area in which we anticipate local authorities being able to provide us with a very useful response to the consultation.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para8"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, was concerned about his sister-in-law or another close relation on the west coast and the various options which she has for her child. We plan to make the voucher scheme sufficiently flexible to enable parents to buy a mix of places; for example, in both play groups and nursery classes, if that is their preference. Therefore, the scheme will cater for people in those circumstances. It underlines the fact that we want the scheme to meet the demands and needs of the parent rather than the whims of the providers.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para9"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Carmichael, Lord Taylor, and the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, asked why we are bringing together elections in all schools across Scotland. The 1988 Act was intended to lead to that happening but that has proved not to be the case in practice. Clause 28 seeks to rectify those matters and the proposal has been widely welcomed in consultation. <P>


<a name="column_1145"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1145</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Therefore, noble Lords should not be unduly worried about that, given the welcome that the proposal received in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para10"></a>The overall purpose of Part III is to save public expenditure and to enable education authorities to run elections more efficiently and therefore more cheaply. That will provide them with more money to spend on education rather than on bureaucracy and the mechanics of elections.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ewing, was concerned about the powers that a school board would have to remove a member being increased by removing a member who is unfit rather than:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"by reason of his physical or mental illness or incapacity". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para12"></a>That alteration is not intended to increase a board's powers to remove a member of the board. Rather, it is in recognition of the fact that this House has in the past in another context criticised references to incapacity by reason of physical or mental illness as being offensive to people with disabilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para13"></a>I should now turn to Part IV. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, that the suggested changes have been brought about as a result of pressures across Scotland and not merely from in and around one school or one constituency.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, suggested that we should reserve a minimum rather than a maximum number of places. That would merely restrict choice for parents who seek to place their children outside their own immediate area. A balance must be struck between the families of children moving into an area and those families with children living outside the area but who want their children to be educated within that area. The objective is that the Secretary of State will set maximum numbers and the local authorities, education authorities and providers will be able to make an assessment of what, in normal circumstances will be the number of places which need to be made available.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, fears that we may be discriminating against urban schools by specifying the distances which apply in relation to equivalent schools. That is just common sense. In an urban area there is often an alternative school within reasonable distance, whereas in a rural area that may not be the case. I should make a general point as regards placing requests: 270,000 requests were made and 90 per cent. of them have been met. That is a very successful proportion, which illustrates the importance of introducing choice into education.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para16"></a>For many authorities which have already made plans to expand their provision of education for under-fives, additional voucher values will represent grant aid towards the costs of expansion. Vouchers are not as hostile to public provision as has been suggested by various noble Lords. We are offering providers an approach based on partnership and collaboration which has been the basis for many of the Government's successful education reforms in Scotland. The challenge to providers, and especially to local authorities, is to work with government to secure lasting benefits for <P>


<a name="column_1146"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1146</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>children in their areas. In that context, we expect to be inviting local authorities to submit proposals for pilot voucher schemes very shortly.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para17"></a>The Bill reaffirms our continuing commitment to Scotland's distinctive education and training system. The future prosperity of Scotland relies on a good education and training system. The Bill takes forward proposals to enable our present system, with its high and improving standards, to cater for the challenges which lie ahead. I hope that those challenges do not include what the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, anticipates in the form of some sort of devolution. In fact, we would have a worse economy and fewer jobs. The basis of the Bill is to produce a better workforce for a better economy. I am convinced that the provisions in the Bill will bring benefit across all areas of Scotland and to all families in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-07_para18"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael--and other speakers--said that he was looking forward to a long Committee stage. To begin with, I should point out that we shall very shortly be publishing Notes on Clauses. Therefore, I hope that that will shorten the length of the Committee stage to which the noble Lord said he was looking forward. I trust that the noble Lord will come to see the error of some of the assertions that he made about the Bill. As my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour said, many measures have been fiercely opposed by the party opposite, only to be welcomed when they have become established and the benefits have become clear. They then become popular throughout the communities of Scotland. The voucher system is just one of those measures which will become popular once we have ironed out the problems.
<P>

<A NAME="51211-08_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding </B>  rose to ask the Chairman of Committees whether, in the light of the Annual Report and Accounts of the House, 1994-95 (HL Paper (1994-95) 93), he is satisfied that the new arrangements for the administration of the House are working satisfactorily.<P>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, perhaps I may say at the outset how grateful I am to the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees who is to reply to the debate. I must apologise for keeping him here this evening.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para1"></a>Although we are discussing the fourth annual report that has been produced on the affairs of the House of Lords (bringing such matters together in a single volume) and only the third in which not only do we have accounts but also a substantial amount of additional information in the form of a narrative, this is the first occasion on which the House has had a chance to debate such a report.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para2"></a>Last year, we actually spent some &#163;37 million of public money on the services and accommodation which we require. The House employs over 250 staff and is <P>


<a name="column_1147"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1147</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>responsible for 40 per cent. of the works staff and 40 per cent. of the security staff in the Palace of Westminster. The report discloses that we sat on 142 days of the year, spread over 36 weeks, for a total of 967 hours and 55 minutes. The average daily attendance--and I believe that noble Lords may find this slightly surprising--was 380 Peers. We took part in 135 Divisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para3"></a>The report now before us, like it predecessors, is a mine of information about the House. In my view, it is well written and produced. It records a huge amount of work done by the Clerk of the Parliaments, by Black Rod and by their staffs. Apart from anything else, tonight's debate gives the House the chance to say, "Thank you", to all those who serve us and make it possible for us to do our work. However, I hope that the debate is a little more than that. I always remember the moment in that amazing film "12 Angry Men"--the jurors--where Henry Fonda just held out for a moment and then said,"Well, I just think that we oughta talk about it". I believe that the House should talk about its own work for a moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para4"></a>Five years ago a review team headed by Sir Robin Ibbs reported on the management of another place. The Ibbs Report disclosed major shortcomings in the way that the affairs of another place were managed under a system which had evolved over many years. Lest any noble Lords might be tempted to be smug, perhaps I may say that exactly the same strictures could have been addressed to this House. The Ibbs team found a lack of clarity about how policy for services was decided and about where responsibility rested for policy and for its execution.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para5"></a>Honourable Members of another place seemed unaware of who to turn to solve problems or to get things changed. Good financial management systems, and control arrangements based on these, simply did not exist. Therefore, there was no confidence that the money being spent--indeed, it is much more in another place than it is here--was appropriate to needs or was being well spent. The fact that the management of the works expenditure actually lay outside the control of the House altogether was singled out for special criticism. The report concluded that there was no effective corporate management role.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para6"></a>Perhaps I may just quote one sentence from paragraph 17 of the Ibbs Report. I do so because it sums up the situation rather well:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"At a time when the need to demonstrate cost-consciousness is widely accepted, not least by Parliamentary Committees, arrangements in the House, far from setting a standard for others to follow, are a complex anachronism. A complete overhaul of financial systems is an inescapable necessity". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para7"></a>That was written in 1990.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para8"></a>The other place moved quickly to begin to put matters right and the authorities in this House were swift to follow suit. The annual reports for 1992-93, 1993-94 and the latest one that we are debating this evening for 1994-95 have set out in considerable detail the new structures, procedures and arrangements under which our affairs are now managed. It is not now the time or the place to go into detail. But perhaps it is sufficient if I say that, guided by successive Offices Committees and <P>


<a name="column_1148"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1148</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>successive Finance and Staffing Sub-committees, the Clerk of the Parliaments has now put into place a thoroughly reformed and coherent system of financial management, including proper costing and budgeting, with responsibility devolved to individual budget holders, themselves accountable upwards through a clear and logical management structure.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para9"></a>I turn now to the first question that I should like to put to my noble friend the Chairman of Committees. I call him my noble friend because he is sitting on this side of the House. Is he, and is the Offices Committee, now satisfied that this reformed structure is working well and effectively? Part of the purpose of the Ibbs reforms was to give control to the House of its own management. How far is it true to say that the House now has full control over its own affairs? In particular, does the new system really give us the chance to address the concerns of noble Lords?
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para10"></a>Finally, perhaps I may single out the question of accommodation. If one turns to paragraphs 38 to 41 of the annual report, it will be seen that they describe the new accommodation which is situated across the road at Nos. 6 to 7 Old Palace Yard--and it is indeed very splendid. They outline the plans for converting and renovating the south-east corner of the Palace. The purpose is also:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to provide refreshment facilities, a new Committee room and Robing rooms for Counsel". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para11"></a>If there is to be a substantial refurbishment of part of the House that has been vacated by other departments, why can we not have more rooms for desks for Peers? I believe that that point is now well recognised.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para12"></a>Paragraph 41 continues:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Administration and Works Sub-Committee remain very concerned that there is still not sufficient accommodation available for Lords and they have asked Black Rod and the Director of Works to explore ways in which new accommodation might be provided, including the relocation of the flats occupied by Black Rod and the Yeoman Usher to buildings outside". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para13"></a>It then goes on to mention other departments which might usefully be relocated.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para14"></a>I believe that I am reflecting a very widely held view among noble Lords that the lack of a desk and a telephone in the Palace is the most keenly felt want among many Members of your Lordships' House. When can we look forward to that want being met?
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para15"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that at the other end of the Palace over recent years there has been a great deal of imaginative in-filling of space in the upper floors which has provided large numbers of offices and new rooms for its Members. Therefore, it is now possible, as it never was in my day, for a new Member to enter another place and be allocated an office more or less straightaway. When will the same happen at this end of the Palace?
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para16"></a>However, it would be unfair not to draw attention to the number of improvements that have been made. I particularly commend the new entrance via what was formerly Black Rod's Garden. There will be a little garden left but I doubt that Black Rod will be much able to enjoy it. The work has been extremely well done and without doubt it enhances that end of the Palace and of <P>


<a name="column_1149"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1149</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>course improves security and the movement of vehicles. However, I am forcibly struck by the slow and cumbersome security arrangements at the new entrance which contrast markedly with the easy informality of the arrangements outside the Peers' Entrance. Perhaps at a time of relatively low security alert one must ask whether we have to wait for two slow moving barriers to be moved before we are allowed access at that entrance?
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para17"></a>I have three further questions for the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees. Paragraph 32 of the report describes the procedure for selecting the person who now serves in the Office of Black Rod. I think the selection procedure set out in that paragraph--though Black Rod himself may not have appreciated it--was a welcome innovation. It gave Members of the House a chance to have a say in who should be appointed to that important post. Paragraph 32 states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It was agreed by the Finance and Staff Sub-Committee, in order to clarify lines of responsibility, that, in future, Black Rod should report to the Clerk of the Parliaments as the Accounting Officer and Corporate Officer of the House of Lords".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para18"></a>Why was that thought necessary? In the past Black Rod has reported directly to the Finance and Staff Sub-Committee, to the accommodation sub-committee or to the Offices Committee itself. His is an ancient and honourable office. Why should he now report through the Clerk of the Parliaments?
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para19"></a>Paragraph 57 deals with the administrative vote. Noble Lords will note that there was a welcome underspending in the year under question. However, the report states that the estimate for the year 1995-96--the year we are now in--is 6.2 per cent. higher than the preceding year. That is to say it is around twice the rate of inflation. I suggest that that sounds a little excessive. Can the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees give some more details as to why that is necessary? Spending departments have just come through an extremely tough spending round under the public expenditure system and they have been under great pressure. It smacks of self-indulgence if the House treats itself to a significantly less stringent regime.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para20"></a>Paragraph 59 gives the information that pay and grading of staff will no longer be subject to national agreements but is to be delegated,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to all public bodies, including Parliament, from 1 April 1996". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para21"></a>Can the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees give the House a little more information as to how this is to work? In principle I welcome the move. There is not much sense in delegating financial responsibility to the House, as has been done under the new dispensation, if its single biggest cost remains effectively outwith the House's control. I believe we are entitled to ask how it is intended that the House should exercise its new delegated authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-08_para22"></a>I said earlier that the House is well served by its officers and staff and I wish them to know that we appreciate their efforts. I believe that particular thanks are due to those among our own number who chair the important committees through which all this work is done. I refer to the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees who chairs three of the committees; the noble Lord, Lord Peston, who chairs the Refreshment <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Sub-Committee, my noble friend Lord Gowrie who chairs the Advisory Panel on Works of Art and my noble friend Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn who chairs the Library and Computers Sub-Committee. They are involved in a great deal of work on behalf of the House. That work is often unsung and it goes on behind the scenes quietly, unobtrusively and efficiently. The House should be able to express its thanks to them. It is because I did not think we should take this all for granted and just let it go through that I have tabled this Question. I look forward to hearing the other speeches.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<A NAME = "51211-09_time0"></A><H5>6.25 p.m. </H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bancroft: </B>   My Lords, we are all grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, for this debate. It is extremely timely given the attention currently being paid to the role, the powers and the composition of this House. Despite the inordinate length of the speakers' list tonight I should like to see reasonably regular short debates on the report and accounts. It is important, of course, that the debates should not become a catalogue of housekeeping whinges on the one hand or a succession of self-congratulatory puffs on the other. If I may say so, the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, steered his usual neat course between the two.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-09_para0"></a>If there were to be regular debates I venture to hope that they would be reflective and perhaps mildly self-critical in character. I shall try to follow the noble Lord in that mode. As the noble Lord has said, the annual report and accounts are an admirable innovation and this is only the third year that they have been combined. The Clerk of the Parliaments and his staff deserve our thanks, together, of course, with the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees, the Offices Committee and the sub-committees to which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-09_para1"></a>I suggest that we need to look at the report in the context of the role of this House and the staff who support it. I would not even dare to pluck at the trouser of Bagehot, nor would it be appropriate in this debate to try to do so. However, Bagehot's description of the Queen's private rights, in relation to her Ministers, to be consulted, to encourage and to warn, has also come to be an apt description of the second Chamber's ability publicly to influence and, if need be, embarrass, Her Majesty's Ministers. We can debate, revise, initiate and, under strict limits, delay legislation on the Floor of the House. Through our debates we can encourage and warn Ministers more generally. Through our Select Committees we can scrutinise both government and European Union legislation and inform Ministers of our views. Now that we have regular ad hoc Select Committees to buttress the two permanent Select Committees, we can advise Ministers, the European Union, and indeed a much bigger audience, if it wishes to listen--on the whole it does not get a chance to do so because our proceedings are not reported to it--on a wide variety of issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-09_para2"></a>I now mention a small but, I think, not unimportant point. I suggest it might be preferable to refer to special Select Committees rather than to ad hoc Select Committees. The latter have an uncomfortable <P>


<a name="column_1151"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1151</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hand-to-mouth ring about them. Some of your Lordships know that I have a vision of this House, through the unique experience of its Select Committee membership and the talented clerks and specialist advisers who serve them, becoming, over time, the think-tank to the nation. This vision owes nothing at all to complacency or to self-congratulation. It derives from a profound belief that there is a deficiency in our national machinery of government, the notorious hole at the centre. By that I mean the lack of an intellectual counterpoise to the random sucking in of powers, but not responsibilities, to Nos. 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street and No. 70 Whitehall.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-09_para3"></a>I suggest that some of the in-filling of that hole might be provided by a development of our Select Committee system. It would give value for money, as the report before us demonstrates. Peers, as unpaid Members, come cheap. The report tells us on page 19 that the Committee Office spent, on all forms of support, under &#163;1 million last year and came under budget by &#163;0.25 million. Its total permanent staff was 21, of whom only eight were clerks. It would be difficult to conceive of better value for money. Is not that an area in which we might judiciously add to the resources available?
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-09_para4"></a>That brings me to costs, which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, rightly mentioned. As I said, Peers come cheap, certainly compared with our colleagues in another place or Members of the European Parliament. We also come cheap compared with our colleagues in other Commonwealth upper chambers. Figures published in 1993 show that the annual cost per Member of the Australian Senate was &#163;480,000; of the Canadian Senate, &#163;195,000; and of our own Chamber, &#163;89,000, assuming in our case a working House of only 404 Members. The figures also show that unelected Members, for example, British Peers and Canadian Senators, come cheaper than their elected opposite numbers in other second chambers, and even then we are only half the price of a Canadian Senator. That causes a twitch both to my value for money nostril and my constitutional nostril.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-09_para5"></a> I shall say a word about security costs. I am aware that to raise the subject here is akin to bearing stale buns and sucked eggs into the Chamber. Nevertheless, the sums that both Houses spend on security raises us to an unaccustomed top position in the international league tables of parliamentary costs. We usually come bottom. I find that this House spends more proportionately on security than any other chamber in the world, including Israel. Even so, the percentages of the total of each assembly which are devoted to security are mildly surprising. The latest figures that I have show that many countries come in at between 2 per cent. and 3 per cent; Israel at 14 per cent; the House of Commons at nearly 15 per cent; and the House of Lords at 20 per cent. I ask, with a polite Jeeves-like cough, whether that is perhaps an area where modest savings might be made to offset any increases to strengthen the Select Committee system. That complies with my Treasury background where one does not suggest increases in expenditure without suggesting also offsetting savings. I acknowledge that to some extent we are House of Commons <P>


<a name="column_1152"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1152</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>driven here, so our 40 per cent. share of security costs turned out to be just under &#163;5 million in 1994-95. The relevant paragraphs in the report are 10 to 16 and 22 to 25. That cost of &#163;5 million compares with just under &#163;1 million in the same year for the Committee Office.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-09_para6"></a>I venture a word about sitting hours, while recognising that that matter is already at the forefront of many minds. It has been said that the other place sits for more hours a year than any other parliamentary assembly in the world and, perhaps until recently, the dubious honour of the second place is taken by your Lordships' House. The hours which this House sat increased from 465 in 1959-60 to 1,213 in 1985-86, and fell to 1,077 in 1988-89. Since then, interestingly, they have fallen back further and now seem to average about 950 hours a year. In 1993-94, for example, we sat for 971 hours and last year for 904 hours--or 967, depending on the figures one obtains, as the noble Lord observed. Whether that is due to the remedial measures that we ourselves have taken or the gentle decrease in the amount of government legislation is a moot point, but probably the latter. It would be interesting, purely academically, to see whether a change in the political colour of the Government and a greater legislative load would increase our sitting hours again. That is perhaps an academic exercise which some Members of the House would not wish to take further than academia.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-09_para7"></a>We have to recognise that the greater part of sitting time is taken up by debating legislation--mainly government legislation--on the Floor of the House. Paragraph 10 of the report deals with that matter. Therefore, a large part of the responsibility for the workload facing the two Houses falls not on Parliament but on the Executive. Even so, the evidence seems to point to the need for yet more legislative work being taken in Committee and off the Floor of the House if there is to be any realistic possibility of further reducing sitting hours.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-09_para8"></a>We are all agreed that it is neither wise nor therapeutic for a House whose average age is in the mid sixties to be revising important legislation very late at night or in the small hours. The initiatives which have been taken in recent years, particularly following the admirable report of the group under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Rippon of Hexham, in 1994, are indeed welcome. They have substantially reduced late night sittings, but are they enough? Paragraphs 10 to 16 of the report are relevant here.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-09_para9"></a>Finally, I turn to the staff. We all acknowledge, as did the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, with deep gratitude the selfless efficiency, the kindness and dedication shown by staff at every level. Without them and their cheerful virtues this would be an inefficient and melancholy place. We all agree on the great improvements which have been made in the financial control systems in recent years. My concern is about the modish preoccupation with running the public service like a private sector business. I have some knowledge of both. That preoccupation is acceptable up to a point, but it can be all too easily pushed beyond the limits both of acceptability and credibility. I find some of the language unsympathetic--customers, contractors, market testing, transparency--a vocabulary which my noble friend <P>


<a name="column_1153"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1153</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Croham once memorably described as mid-Atlantic Cherokee. Are we to be referred to as "my noble customer"?
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-09_para10"></a>Then there are the obeisances towards gods which are suitable to the private sector and some parts of the public service. I have to remonstrate gently with those who believe that, for example, performance related pay is applicable to our tiny and devoted band of clerks. Here, co-operation, collegiality and transferability rather than financial competition are the essence. My own experience is that in very small public service organisations it creates extra work, worry and strained working relationships--and to what end? The same question might be asked, for example, of pay negotiations. Paragraphs 50 to 52 of the report are very relevant here.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-09_para11"></a>I must confess, too, to acute concern about the Government's apparent intention to privatise the Civil Service recruitment and assessment service. I still regard the suggestion with incredulity. That body recruits both the graduate entry and fast stream. It also recruits on an agency basis the clerks for both Houses of Parliaments, and, incidentally the staff for the security services. Many organisations, including perhaps this House, may sooner rather than later feel compelled to do their own recruitment in order to preserve public service attitudes and standards--more work, more costs. Some of us will wish to return to the general subject of public service recruitment on another occasion.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-09_para12"></a> I have detained the House too long. However, having exercised but not exorcised some antique and some mint-fresh King Charles' heads, I end where I began. I thank most warmly the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, for initiating the debate. I hope that it will be the first of many on this most important annual publication. I assure the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees that I do not expect him to comment on, let alone answer, all the questions that I have raised.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="51211-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   My Lords, from these Benches perhaps I may echo the remarks that have been made. We are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, for providing the House with an opportunity to debate the annual report and accounts. He may be disappointed that the opportunity has not been taken by more people. As we say in many other instances, if the customers are satisfied with the stewardship by the officers and members of the committees, they leave the matter to the practitioners.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has provided the opportunity for people who are deeply affected by the changes and by the work to listen to what is being said. The Motion also provides those like the Chairman of Committees who have a responsibility with the opportunity to debate the issue. I am delighted to see the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees in his place. I am also delighted to see the noble Lord, Lord Ampthill, in his place. He was a most distinguished Chairman of Committees before the present chairman. In a sense his responsibilities cover the period in the report, although, as the House will acknowledge, the <P>


<a name="column_1154"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1154</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Lord, Lord Boston, will reply. We on this side of the House certainly feel that the Chairman of Committees has had a good year. Those of us who have served on committees have served under a benevolent chairmanship. He has guided us through one or two sticky periods, and we are very grateful indeed.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para1"></a>It is not my job tonight, nor is it my intention, to deal with any of the points raised. However, having served on most of the committees over the year, I am well aware of the issues in the report and points raised.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para2"></a> I appreciated the tone of the introduction by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. He seemed to major on the deficiency in accommodation. I sensed that that might have a personal aspect. I do not know whether the noble Lord has a problem as regards a desk or a place. I am conscious that many others must be in the same position. Perhaps I may say to the noble Lord that over my period in the House--it is only 12 years, with five years as Chief Whip--there has been a remarkable change as regards the space found. The situation is not perfect. It will not be perfect until everyone who wants a desk, or even a room, of their own, as do colleagues at the other end of the building, is satisfied. However, space is found often through the ingenuity of officers. They see an opportunity and move people in or out. At the end of the quadrille, the committee is faced with the prospect of having two rooms with nine desks or four rooms with 12 desks. The usual channels have the difficult task of solving the situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para3"></a> I am always amazed at what appears to me to be a dead end, and the noble Lord, Lord Ampthill, will recall the number of times that he has reported and I have said, "In about two years' time we might see some result". Yet during the past two or three years, refreshingly, bits of accommodation have been found. Not all Members want facilities. Some Members do not use this House as much as others. But those who do so need a place from which to work.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para4"></a> Until that perfect situation is arrived at, there will always be deficiencies. Although not every Member on my Benches who wants a place has one, I would not major at this time on the deficiencies in accommodation which the report might expose.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para5"></a>The report is a mine of information. I wish to refer to the changes brought about by the sad retirement as Black Rod of Admiral Sir Richard Thomas. He was a brave man. He persisted perhaps longer than some of us thought it wise as regards his health. However, he left good order. He left with the highest compliments of this House. The report provides us with the opportunity of putting on record yet again that which I know the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees has already stated. In doing so, I also have the opportunity from these Benches to thank the new Black Rod, General Sir Edward Jones, for the swift way in which he has mastered the intricacies not only of the precise function that he performs but, almost as importantly, how to get on with people and how to weld together what could be a disparate crew--the usual channels, the leaders, officers, and so on. I congratulate General Sir Edward Jones and his senior colleagues, Brigadier Clark and Major Charlesworth. Perhaps I may mention, too, <P>


<a name="column_1155"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1155</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Major Horsfall. The House has been remarkably well served by the calibre of the staff in general and those who serve us at the highest levels. I honestly cannot recall complaints against members of the staff. If there may have been dereliction on the part of committees which failed to ensure that they carried out their remit, the officers have done a first class job.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para6"></a>I do not wish to intervene in any way on the points made. That will fall to the Chairman of Committees. It is an admirable suggestion that we consider the net product of the work of the officers, not least financially. The Clerk of the Parliaments and his colleagues are always reminding the committees of the budgets that have been prepared and the responsibilities that they have as accounting officers. That is absolutely right. However, I simply say this to the House. Members down the other end of the corridor seem to find with ease reasons for spending large sums of money which they always maintain is in the best interests of Parliament. When we compare the enormous amounts of money which, properly, are voted for the comfort and facility of Members in the House of Commons, I do not believe that we should be too upset at the amount of money that we carefully, not grudgingly, provide for ourselves. It has been well provided and well spent. We should, not be pleased with the year, but be satisfied that those who have the responsibilities have discharged them not just to the best of their ability but to the satisfaction of Members.

<A NAME="51211-10_spmin0"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees   (Lord Boston of Faversham): </B>  My Lords, I am sure that the whole House is very grateful indeed to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, for drawing attention to the 1994-95 annual report of this House. I am very grateful to him for letting me know the main points which he proposed to raise in advance of this discussion.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para7"></a>As the noble Lord said, this is the first time since the annual reports were instituted three years ago that we have debated them. I very much welcome this chance to have heard what your Lordships have had to say and to give the House something of an account of how the administrative arrangements put in place some four years ago are now working out.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para8"></a>I hope your Lordships will consider me neither frivolous nor complacent if I say that the short answer to the Question on the Order Paper is really, "Yes, in the main". I must confess that I was tempted to say, "Yes", and leave it at that, but I knew that noble Lords, and particularly the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, would not allow me to get away with that. Such an example of idleness certainly would not be tolerated by this House. So perhaps in giving something of an account, and in attempting to answer the questions that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and other noble Lords have raised, I could begin by referring to one matter which the noble Lord mentioned, namely the history of the Ibbs reforms.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para9"></a>It is of course the case that in 1990 the then Leader of the House of Commons, Sir Geoffrey Howe, as he then was, asked Sir Robin Ibbs to conduct a review of <P>


<a name="column_1156"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1156</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the way in which another place could improve its administrative structures so as to have more direct control over its own affairs. His report was concerned primarily with another place, although he and his team interviewed a number of officers of this House as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para10"></a>It might be worth reminding ourselves that the Ibbs Report made three important recommendations. The first was that Parliament should become responsible for its own buildings and accommodation services rather than having to ask the Department of the Environment and the Property Services Agency for moneys to spend on maintenance and future improvements. These moneys were never easy to get because expenditure on Parliament had to compete with spending on other public buildings. Next, the report recommended that Parliament should no longer receive its printing and publications free of charge from Her Majesty's Stationery Office on an allied service basis; and, finally, that Parliament should reform its financial management.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para11"></a>The implication of those recommendations is very far-reaching indeed. Neither House was properly equipped to assume responsibility for expenditure on such a massive scale. New administrative and control systems had to be created. Those were referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and also in passing by the noble Lord, Lord Bancroft. I should like to join with those noble Lords--and particularly on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton-- in paying tribute to the contributions which my predecessors made to these matters, the noble Lords, Lord Aberdare and Lord Ampthill. I am the fortunate beneficiary, simply that, of the matters that were decided upon and put into place and which were so greatly promoted by those two noble Lords serving as Chairman of Committees; and also with the support of successive Leaders of the House, the noble Lords, Lord Waddington and Lord Wakeham, and carried through now by the noble Viscount, Lord Cranborne, our present Leader of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para12"></a>Your Lordships' House began these reforms with the creation, on the initiative of the Clerk of the Parliaments, of the post of Principal Finance Officer, to be held by a Table Clerk, supported by a qualified management accountant from outside. The House was fortunate to obtain, in October 1991, the services of a secondee from Price Waterhouse. These two posts were instrumental in developing, with the support of the domestic committees of the House, the systems that are now in place.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para13"></a>Then, in May 1992, the domestic committee structure of the House was altered to streamline decision-making and to make the structure similar to the one that another place was adopting, so that the two Houses could, to an extent at least, proceed together. So the Administration Sub-Committee of the Offices Committee was renamed the Administration and Works Sub-Committee, with particular responsibility for the works programme. The Staff of the House Sub-Committee was combined with the Finance Sub-Committee and became the Finance and Staff Sub-Committee. These two, with others which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, mentioned, the Library and Computer Sub-Committee and the Refreshment Sub-Committee, mirrored arrangements in another <P>


<a name="column_1157"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1157</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>place. Day-to-day responsibility was devolved on these sub-committees by the Offices Committee, and indeed most decisions on expenditure and resources are in fact now taken in the sub-committees. The particular importance of the Finance and Staff Sub-Committee--our equivalent of the House of Commons Commission--was recognised by the appointment to it of the leaders of the parties.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para14"></a>One of the most fundamental developments of 1992 was the gradual delegation to heads of offices of their own budgets, a matter referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. Each head now has to set his or her own budget for the coming year, including salary and other staff costs, printing, computers and, in certain offices, the costs of committees as well, and to monitor expenditure during the year. That has been operational for the past two financial years. I can tell the House that this has proved a great success. It has resulted in real-terms reductions of expenditure, particularly on printing and publications, where care has produced worthwhile savings.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para15"></a>I should now like to mention the costs that the House assumed from HMSO in 1992. I understand that HMSO estimated the cost of the allied service of providing papers and office supplies to this House to be of the order of &#163;6 million a year. But I have to tell your Lordships it was not clear how that figure was arrived at. So all has not in fact been well from the beginning. Indeed, to start with, under the new arrangements HMSO invoices for printing and papers were far from satisfactory. I note that my immediate predecessor, the noble Lord, Lord Ampthill, nods his head, having been familiar with that at the time. These have, however, improved. Now that each office knows what it spends on printing and publications, budget holders have been able to reduce their costs, making the overall charge to the House less by some &#163;2 million. This saving will be taken a step further when a new supply and service agreement is signed with HMSO tomorrow. It shows how timely is the tabling by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, of this Unstarred Question.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para16"></a>I turn now to the responsibilities that the House has taken on for its own accommodation. That was also mentioned tonight. The Palace of Westminster is of course a building shared with another place. So a joint organisation was needed for its maintenance and improvement. The skeleton was there already in that the Property Services Agency had many staff working in this building. The agency transferred those staff to the two Houses and the Parliamentary Works Directorate was created from 1st April 1992 under Mr. Henry Webber, who became budget holder for the largest budget in Parliament. While each House has its own budget for works services, much of the work within the Palace is regarded as necessary for the Palace as a whole. So it was agreed that for maintenance projects and indeed for any other projects for the Palace as a whole, such as the Parliamentary Data and Video Network, the cost would be shared between the two Houses on a 40:60 percentage basis--that was referred to by the noble Lord--recognising the 40:60 split in the <P>


<a name="column_1158"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amount of the Palace occupied by the two Houses. Projects for one House only are budgeted for separately and paid for by that House.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para17"></a>The Administration and Works Sub-committee decides the works programme each year. Two years ago it also approved a 10-year rolling programme of works, so setting out for the first time a properly structured approach to maintenance and improvements. I can assure your Lordships that control of such a significant new area of expenditure has been satisfactory. That is due in no small part to the systems created by the director of works himself and, so far as this House is concerned, to a new post in Black Rod's Department--the administration officer who has already been referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Graham. The administration officer has provided a link between the Parliamentary Works Directorate and the House itself, both Members and staff. At this point I should like to thank all those noble Lords who have thanked the staff. I can assure them that their very kind words will be passed on to the staff. I should like to join those noble Lords who made those observations and congratulate all concerned on the massive works programme which was carried out during the Summer Recess.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para18"></a>Rather more specific questions have been asked about accommodation and I shall try to deal with one or two of those as well. I need to remind your Lordships that the balance of accommodation was decided in the first place by the Administration and Works Sub-committee. It decided that new refreshment facilities were required and that a new committee room was badly needed also.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para19"></a>Both the noble Lords, Lord Jenkin and Lord Graham, referred to the question of accommodation. With regard to accommodation and facilities generally for Peers, much has been achieved since 1992. We have gained rooms from the Lord Chancellor's Department on the South Front which provided some 36 desks; we have refurbished 6-7 Old Palace Yard, which gave us an additional 22 desks--when I say "we", I mean all noble Lords collectively and the staff as well--and recently we have provided rooms to Peers on the second floor with 17 more desks to be allocated by the Chief Whips and the Convenor of the Cross-Benchers. With other room conversions, we reckon that there are now some 90 more desks available to Peers than there were in 1992. Including the Law Lords, there are some 286 Peers' desks, many of which are shared.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para20"></a>In addition to the extra rooms and desks, the project in the South East Return which is due for completion by Easter will add two new dining rooms and a new grill room as well as the committee room. The improved Terrace awning is an example of our ability to enhance accommodation as well. I might mention that a computer training room has been provided for Peers. Black Rod is discussing with the Chief Whips and the Convenor possible future needs and a study on in-filling has just been carried out.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para21"></a>While we are discussing accommodation and in view of the fact that Black Rod's Garden and the works undertaken there have been mentioned, I should like to mention the security arrangements through that entrance and the matter of security generally, which was raised <P>


<a name="column_1159"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>by the noble Lord, Lord Bancroft, among other noble Lords. The security arrangements for car parking in Black Rod's Garden regrettably, at least for the time being, have to be more intrusive than is the case in the Peers' car park. That is because of the mix of private and commercial vehicles for both Houses which use Black Rod's Garden entrance. Arrangements are reviewed constantly to ensure that they are in line with the security threat.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para22"></a>Turning to security expenditure more generally, your Lordships would quite rightly accuse me of presenting nothing but good news if I did not refer to that matter, which does not contain quite such good news as indicated elsewhere in this debate. So far, we have had less success in controlling expenditure on security. It is a matter of the utmost concern that both Houses of Parliament should be properly protected. That is why large sums of money have been spent on physical protection and the development of the new entrance. However, the Finance and Staff Sub-committee has from time to time queried the level of charge made by the Metropolitan Police for providing police and security officers for the Palace of Westminster. That cost has stabilised but, in my view, is still too high. I should like to see an independent inspection into police manpower and rostering. Of course, in the end it is a political decision as to how high a level of security should be provided for your Lordships and Members of another place. In saying that, I must repeat that we are splendidly served by those police and security officers who look after us in this place despite problems of considerable difficulty when we have to achieve our democratic purpose of keeping this House as open as possible to people outside.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para23"></a>With regard to administration, it was recognised at the time of the Ibbs Report that Parliament and the two Houses had no legal identity. They could not own property nor enter into contracts. Clearly that position was not sustainable if Parliament were to assume responsibility for its own building and be able to sign agreements with bodies such as HMSO. The result was the Parliamentary Corporate Bodies Act 1992, under which the Clerk of the Parliaments became the corporate officer of this House. He now has the legal status to act on our behalf in matters of contract and so on with the Clerk of the House of Commons acting similarly there.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para24"></a>The Ibbs arrangements also required a much closer link between the Clerk of the Parliaments and Black Rod because, while Black Rod retains his position as agent of the Administration and Works Sub-committee and is responsible for the provision of accommodation and other facilities within your Lordships' House, the Clerk of the Parliaments assumed new responsibilities as accounting officer for the Works Services Vote which had not existed before. I quite understand the considerations lying behind the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, about the relationship between the Clerk of the Parliaments and Black Rod. But those new arrangements stemmed from the reforms which had to be instituted. So now we can say that a clear line of command, which was required, was agreed with the appointment of the new Black Rod. That also <P>


<a name="column_1160"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1160</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>recognises the position of the Clerk of the Parliaments as both accounting officer and corporate officer of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para25"></a>I hope that that, at least to some extent, even if it does not completely satisfy the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, will meet the point raised by him. Indeed, in another context I shall be able to refer to him (and he refer to me, I hope) as my noble and learned friend.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para26"></a>Let me mention just one other matter concerned with financing. In the Accountant's Office, every effort is being made to improve the professionalism of the staff. I am pleased to report that there are now two qualified management accountants there. As recommended by the Staff Adviser and Internal Auditor, there has been a reallocation of responsibilities between the Accountant's Office and the Establishment Office. The Establishment Office now authorises the payment of staff, while the Accountant's Office makes the payment.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para27"></a>I am conscious of the time, and from this Dispatch Box one must try to set something of an example. My prime duty is to set an example to myself. However, as I am not actually trespassing on your Lordships' speech time, it may be helpful for me to put one or two other matters on the record for your Lordships, both here and elsewhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para28"></a>The changes I described show that your Lordships' House has been willing, in a short time, to adopt financial management techniques which the private sector has used for a long time. I would have gone on to spell out in detail the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, in relation to the 6.2 per cent. increase in the 1995-96 estimate. However, I shall let him have the final details of that elsewhere and indicate in a headline form what contributed to it. It was partly Peers' expenses; partly staff costs (an increase of &#163;264,000; 4 per cent., while the previous increase was 15 per cent.); general administrative expenses (an increase of &#163;81,000; 2 per cent.); and retired allowances (an increase of &#163;180,000; 20 per cent.) to take account of retirements, particularly two notable senior early retirements.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para29"></a>I wish to touch briefly on two matters which the administration of the House must face in the near future. The first relates to delegated pay. As from 1st April next year, the Treasury will delegate to all public bodies responsibility for setting their own rates of pay within a given budget. That is something to which passing reference was made by my noble friend Lord Bancroft. It is something with which we shall have to come to grips, and it is already being approached.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para30"></a>The second matter relates to the introduction of resource accounting two years later, in the financial year 1998-99. That is being planned carefully and in good time to ensure as smooth a transition as possible from the present cash-based accounts to accounts based upon assets and accruals. It will be particularly relevant in relation to the Works Services Vote where such tricky questions as the value to be placed on heritage assets have still to be settled.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para31"></a>The basic purpose of the annual report and accounts is to provide as much information as possible to your Lordships and therefore more than was produced in <P>


<a name="column_1161"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1161</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>years gone by. That will enable your Lordships to see what is being done and to contribute suggestions more readily to what is needed. It will also give us ever greater openness. I share with my noble friend Lord Bancroft a dislike for jargon words, which is why I used the word "openness" and shied away from "transparency".
<P>

<A NAME = "51211-10_para32"></a>I conclude by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, <P>


<a name="column_1162"></a>

<B>11 Dec 1995 : Column 1162</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and others who have said kind words about myself. As I said, I am the mere beneficiary, and lucky to be so. I hope that, in placing on record some of the work that has been done, your Lordships will agree that it reflects great credit both on the committees of your Lordships' House and on the staff concerned.

<UL>Why, when Guidance Note MS17 from the Health and Safety Executive states: "Repeated absorption of small doses [of organophosphates] . . . has cumulative effects resulting in progressive inhibition of nervous tissue cholinesterase", there are no warnings to users of malathion based head lice preparations about these effects.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51211w01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   The Health and Safety Executive Guidance Notes refer to the biological monitoring of workers exposed to organophosphorus pesticides. The organophosphate based human medicines for the treatment of head lice infestations are different formulations, used only intermittently at low doses and with limited exposure. The guidance notes are therefore not applicable to human medicines use. Unlike workers exposed to organophosphates, there are no data on serious adverse reactions to human medicines containing malathion.

No product would be licensed or approved if, in the view of the expert committees advising the Government, it presented an unacceptable risk to human health.

<FONT SIZE=3>critical of the negative effect of traffic on the parks and the lack of facilities to enable pedestrians to gain access to the parks and to cross the roads within the parks. The group recommended that the agency investigate ways of reducing the impact of traffic in the Royal Parks. As a result, we commissioned traffic consultants and following their report, we have drawn up proposals for a number of traffic calming measures on West Carriage Drive.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211w02_para12"></a>The proposal you refer to is currently being considered by Westminster City Council under the provisions of Department of Environment Circular 18/84, which sets out the procedures for submitting planning applications for developments on Crown land. The procedures involve consultations with all relevant parties, including highway authorities and the Traffic Director for London as appropriate. Public transport does not run through the Royal Parks and we do not normally consult the taxi drivers' associations or the Garden History Society on this sort of proposal.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211w02_para13"></a>The agency is kept informed of progress on Crossrail and, according to current plans, our proposals for West Carriage Drive are not expected to affect the Crossrail project in any way.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211w02_para14"></a>The proposals currently under consideration by Westminster Council only concern the provision of speed tables, incorporating pedestrian crossings, at Temple Gate and in front of the Magazine on West Carriage Drive. The road width would not be reduced since the existing parking bays on either side of West Carriage Drive mean it is already single carriageway in each direction. Introducing the speed tables will in fact make it safer as they will prevent motorists travelling along empty parking spaces in the inside lane and then having to swerve into the outside lane when they meet a parked car, as frequently happens at present. It will also allow motorists to pull into and out of parking spaces at the road side more safely. If implemented, these proposals will result in a net loss of 12 parking spaces in Hyde Park, because they include the removal of the car park at the old Serpentine Restaurant site and its return to parkland.
<P>

<A NAME = "51211w02_para15"></a>We submitted our long-term proposals for traffic calming on West Carriage Drive to Westminster City Council at this stage for information only, in order to show how the planning application for the speed tables/pedestrian crossings in the central section of the park fit into the eventual plan for the road. We appreciate that we shall have to carry out traffic impact and any other environmental assessments that may be appropriate in relation to our proposals concerning Victoria Gate and Alexandra Gate and the right turn into West Carriage Drive. When we have identified funding for this stage of the proposed works, we will submit a formal application to Westminster Council under the Circular 18/84 procedures. The proposed crossings currently under consideration by Westminster are intended to slow down traffic at these points, but we would not expect them to affect the amount of traffic using the park and do not therefore consider it necessary to carry out traffic flow studies on these particular aspects of the proposals.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
