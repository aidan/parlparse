<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Why individuals born after 1961 to a British mother and a father who is not a British national are entitled to British citizenship but those born before 1961 are not.</p>

On 7 February 1979, a concession was announced that the children of UK-born mothers aged under 18 could apply to be registered as British citizens. In 2003, we introduced a provision to register the adult children of UK-born mothers who were born after 7 February 1961. Those born before that date could not have benefited under the 1979 concession.</p>

Thousands of people with no connection whatever with the United Kingdom have been granted British nationality but this group continues to be discriminated against, on the basis not only of which of their parents were British, but of age. What is the justification for continuing that situation? Will the Minister undertake to look at it carefully to see what can be done to change it, and at least deal sympathetically with any individuals with a clear British connection who wish to become British nationals?</p>

Many of those who will not otherwise have received the benefit of the 2002-03 amendment may well benefit from that.

Is it not clear from the letter, written by some of the most eminent medical authorities in the country, that all they are suggesting is that primary care trusts should look at the evidence on homeopathic remedies? Given that the National Health Service is short of funds and that NICE cannot recommend certain very effective treatments for serious diseases because of the lack of funds, is it not eminently sensible to suggest that the NHS should not spend its money on remedies for which there is no scientific evidence and whose effectiveness has never been proven? As homeopathic remedies are diluted infinitely, they have about as much effect as a glass of water.</p>

I say with respect that some eminent clinicians are in favour of alternative medicine and others are not. The Government believe that it is for local PCTs to decide.

Until that time, I had no idea what homeopathy was&#151;I thought it might be something almost illegal. However, I discovered that there is a place for homeopathy, just as there is a strong place for allopathy, which is the normal medicine that we know. I was concerned when the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, said that unofficial documents should not be allowed to be presented to PCTs. It is important that any group of people who think they have a case should be entitled to present it. The important point is to be clear what has an official imprimatur and what does not.</p>

Everyone has a right to see information, whether it is official or not. The important thing is the status of the document. The document carried the NHS logo, and what is at issue is whether it represents NHS policy.</p>

At the same time, the very violent PKK, the Kurdish workers&#146; party, should be brought to a more peaceful pattern and move away from violence and terrorism on an extreme scale. Are not those two moves necessary to prevent a new crisis over Kirkuk and new deals with the Iranians, whose latest threat is to say that they want to take Basra? These are very dangerous waters.

This means that there is no substantive change to the legal position under the existing EC treaty. Removing barriers to competition in the internal market, along with stopping uncompetitive mergers, fighting cartels and using strong state aid rules to tackle illegal subsidies, will all remain a fundamental part of the EU&#146;s task.</p>

That is confirmed by two senior figures. Neelie Kroes, the European Commissioner for Competition said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="07070332000291"></a>&#147;The Internal Market and Competition Protocol is a legally binding confirmation that a system of ensuring undistorted competition is an integral part of the Internal Market&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="07070332000292"></a>&#147;It is also worth recalling that, from a legal point of view, a protocol forms an integral part of the Treaty to which it is annexed and has the same legal value as Treaty provisions&#148;.</p>

That was done in 1992, 15 years ago. It was an absolutely correct objective, the attainment of which has not always been helped by all our European partners, particularly the French. Does he further agree that, if we are to get a fully functional internal market, we should not allow the majority to be held to ransom by the odd member state that wants to be against? This is one area where we should resist the use of national vetoes and encourage the development of qualified majority voting.</p>

Will he also confirm, as the noble Baroness the then Leader of the House did, that the protocol that has now been negotiated has the same effect as the treaty and therefore makes the situation slightly better than before?

As I am sure she and other noble Lords will totally understand, given the current terrorist situation, that is even more essential if, as the Secretary of State said in another place, the public are to remain safe and lead normal lives, and if we are to meet the Government&#146;s priority of reducing reoffending.</p>

<a name="70703-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="07070332000097"></a>Finally, proposed new subsection (1) in government Amendment No. 24 says that the Secretary of State &#147;may&#148; publish guidelines about any qualifications, experience or training required to perform the work of an officer of a provider of probation services. Yet proposed new subsection (2) says that the Secretary of State &#147;must&#148;, under proposed new subsection (1), publish guidelines on work involving the supervision of offenders. Will the Attorney-General answer that point when she speaks to that amendment? I beg to move.</p>

I take this opportunity to endorse heartily all that she has said about the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland. It is splendid news and we wish her well.</p>

<a name="70703-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="07070332000099"></a>The amendment highlights an obvious need. It is quite disturbing to think of the future of a probation service. I emphasise the word &#147;service&#148;, because I hope we are not slipping into a frame of mind in which probation is just about managing offenders. A probation service is based not only on experience, which is vital, but also on learning and insight. As the noble Baroness has said, some of the people for whom probation officers will be responsible are among the most complex and difficult members of society. To begin any effective work, it is necessary to have the perspective and understanding that leads those doing the work to take into account, right from the beginning, the sociological, the psychological and the economic pressures that have led to someone becoming an offender.</p>

<a name="70703-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="07070332000100"></a>At other stages of the Bill, others have said that we must not desert the word &#147;punishment&#148;. I completely

If someone has committed an offence, it is necessary to bring home to that individual, and to society as a whole, that it is an offence, that it is unacceptable and that punishment is therefore an appropriate concept. To leave it at that is, as we have said repeatedly in our deliberations, madness. It does not make economic sense, and it does not make humanitarian sense. It does not make economic sense because if people continue to reoffend, the cost to society in economic terms is still greater than the cost to society in human suffering. In a humanitarian sense, some of those people are the most disturbed, tragic examples of humanity that it is possible to imagine, living trapped, stunted lives. The whole purpose of successful probation work is to enable people to grow out of that, escape from that and become positive members of society.</p>

<a name="70703-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="07070332000101"></a>To think that that can be done casually or by people of unquestionable good will is very foolish. It requires a learning perspective and, I emphasise, experience, although the amendment does not deal with it. It is not just about training. I am one of those who believes that we gloss over the difference between training and education: training is vital but education is crucial. Those providing the education and training need to be able to resource it properly, to have the proper staff in place to do it and to plan ahead for their effective role in the operation. Hence the importance of referring to the need for them to have a clear and secure run in the work that they have undertaken.</p>

<a name="70703-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="07070332000102"></a>If we do not take on board what the amendment is about, we would be irresponsible and let down the whole Probation Service in the future. I support the noble Baroness.</p>

We all appreciate their hard work in trying to make sure that what happens under the Bill is against a background of high quality. I speak as somebody who was responsible for training in a big voluntary organisation for many years. It is important for us to remember that voluntary and not-for-profit organisations can produce high quality work and that they do it in their own way. They derive their expertise from different sources and cultures in their area of work. It is important that the legislation does not pin them down. I fear that if the approach of the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord were adopted, voluntary organisations would be pinned down into doing things in a common way, which would spoil their work. There have been many examples of that through the years in different areas of voluntary work. It almost always happens because of the intervention of the statutory into the voluntary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="07070332000106"></a>I want to ask two questions relating to the amendments. My noble friend&#146;s amendment refers to training being related to the provider of services in the hope that some of those providers might in the future be voluntary organisations&#151;I prefer &#147;voluntary&#148; to &#147;non-governmental organisation&#148;, as I know does the noble Lord, Lord Judd. I assume that we are looking for some change and difference in how services are provided, in the hope that we can find new ways of intervening in criminal behaviour. My hope is that, whatever is agreed, the training package is time-proofed. I would like reassurance in relation to the Minister&#146;s amendment. One of my great worries is that we shall build a framework so rigid that it cannot meet the changes that we are looking for. I would like the reassurance that, while we are looking for high standards, we are able to use alternatives. After all, there are many exceptional programmes&#151;I cite the circles of trust, where offenders are looked after in communities. That work has been extremely successful, overseen by highly qualified workers but carried out in the community by ordinary people on the ground.</p>

I wish her well in managing to balance between the independent legal position and the advice to the Government which the job entails.</p>

<a name="70703-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07070332000108"></a>We are discussing both amendments in the group, and we need to know more from the Government about their interpretation of Amendment No. 24. We take the point that what one wants from the voluntary sector may be a little different from what one expects from the private sector. One of the problems of the Bill is that we are talking about a mixed economy with a range of providers in which one may expect different backgrounds for different tasks. I note that the letter the Minister sent us on Amendment No. 24 sets out specifically that the Secretary of State will be required to,</p>
<ul><a name="07070332000317"></a>&#147;publish guidelines about any qualifications, experience or training required,</ul>
<p><a name="07070332000277"></a>for probation staff working directly with offenders.</p>

<p><a name="07070332000278"></a>We need to know what the phrase &#147;direct contact with offenders&#148; means in rather more detail. Is that intended to mean &#147;not very many&#148;, or does it refer to

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07070332000109"></a>As the Minister knows well, there are those outside who fear that the Bill is about cheap privatisation, putting in unqualified people working for for-profit organisations who will quote for work previously done by qualified people. Part of my problem with the Bill has been that the legislation promoted by the noble Lords, Lord Warner and Lord Filkin, was rather different from that being promoted by the Government. Indeed, the remark of the noble Lord, Lord Warner, on the last day of the Report stage, that the service had failed does not seem to be a good basis for saying, &#147;What we need now is to move towards a group of probation providers with fewer qualifications than is currently the case in the Probation Service&#148;. While we are sympathetic to toughening up the qualifications required by moving towards Amendment No. 23, what we want to know the most is how the Government interpret their own amendment. Indeed, it may be appropriate for us to take this back again and come back at Third Reading with the wording slightly amended to a form which we can all accept.</p>

It is a great source of encouragement to many of us that that particular and distinguished office can be held by someone as committed as she is to the rehabilitative and restorative nature of our criminal justice system. With regard to these two somewhat competing amendments, I have to say that on reading the material, I was somewhat agnostic about which approach I preferred. But I should like to make just one point about which I hope that the noble and learned Baroness will be able to enlighten me.</p>

<a name="70703-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07070332000111"></a>The problem seems to be that the Probation Service suffers from two alternative messages. On the one hand, we speak of it as thriving on localness and voluntariness, independence, imagination, innovation and so forth. This is the approach we all want to take until things go wrong. When they do so and the headlines roar, it is then very easy to talk of what happened as though it was a failure to adhere to the national standards we all expect. What is really important is that we should clarify the national standards we all expect and to which officers of whatever part of the service will be held to account and we should clarify the areas where genuine innovation and initiative will be encouraged. It would be most unfortunate if innovation and imagination were encouraged, but only to the point where people were sat on heavily if those innovations and experiments did not work out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07070332000113"></a>I come back to the question of the children of offenders.

I have had more than 40 years&#146; experience in a wide range of voluntary organisations and, yes, they can be excellent bodies&#151;full of good will and compassion, and ready to innovate and, sometimes, even to show entrepreneurial drive. Nevertheless, I do not think that, just because voluntary organisations happen to be established, their officials are the right kind of people to deliver reports that may make the difference between whether or not an individual goes to prison. That is why I come down on the side of Amendment No. 23A. It emphasises the important need for qualifications and for organisations to have continuity of provision of training and education so that people are qualified and fit and proper for the work that they have to do.</p>

First, the Leitch report on skills, which was debated by your Lordships&#146; House last Thursday, clearly laid out that the shortage of skills in this country has affected our productivity over many years and that, if we are to be successful as a global nation in the future, we need to address this area. This was recognised in the Prime Minister&#146;s reorganisation of departments when he put skills with education.</p>

<a name="70703-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="07070332000117"></a>The danger is that, while competition can have many beneficial effects, when one has different sectors competing against one another and there is not enough money available to fund the job adequately, sectors could compete downwards rather than upwards. For instance, voluntary organisations could train up staff and then those staff could disappear to the statutory sector because they would get more

That would not be helpful. Alternatively, the private sector could try to compete with the statutory sector and staff could leave the private sector to join the statutory sector because it provided more security. There would be a disincentive on the contracted-out sector to train staff because it would know that it would lose them to the statutory sector, and so it would pay less attention to the training of staff. There is also the question of releasing staff to spend time training and releasing senior practitioners to spend time training them. If attention is not paid to these matters, there could be unfortunate consequences.</p>

Although a number of people have simply told me that I should enjoy it, I suspect that my enjoyment will wane if it continues for much longer. I am assured that noble Lords believe that a change of colour in me is less visible, so they wish to see it more openly displayed.</p>

<a name="70703-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="07070332000119"></a>I am pleased to speak to the amendment. Amendment No. 24, which is tabled in my name, was very much to answer the pleas that were made on the previous occasion when we debated the need for training to be clearly put in the Bill and for there to be a better understanding of the nature and depth of training and education as they impact on the work of the different people who have come into the pool to assist us. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, that the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, has put her finger on it, as she always does. There is a tension between having the ability to encourage those who wish to do so to reach the highest possible professional standards and qualifications, while at the same time not discouraging the volunteer, or sapping their vitality and energy, when they can be so powerful in the contribution that they make simply by being able to walk with the offender through a very difficult time. The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, was therefore right to talk about circles of truth, which are an exemplar of the willing, innovative volunteer working in conjunction with the professional. The training that one would wish the professional to have would differ to some significant degree from the training and experience that the volunteer may have.</p>

<a name="70703-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07070332000120"></a>I also understand the concern expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, that in having this range one would go for the cheaper option&#151;the one with fewer qualifications. I say to him that the whole thrust of what we are doing is towards not cost-efficiency, but cost-effectiveness. We have to look at the outcomes. How can we band together those who will interdict the criminal behaviour of the individual so as to make them cease to behave in that way and grow better?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07070332000121"></a>I hear, too, what the right reverend Prelate said about the Probation Service hearing two messages. The two messages are important, however, because we are setting national standards. We are saying that this is the template against which people will be judged. The House should perhaps remember that&#151;I know that this is not a great comfort, but it is certainly of some comfort to me&#151;when we examine things that  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_912"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 912</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have gone wrong, we often find that it has been not because people have adhered to the highest possible standards of the profession, but because tragically they have failed to do so, for a plethora of reasons. It is important for us to have appropriate standards and for those standards to be assured and asserted. It is important, if those standards are met, for us then to be confident that those whom we entrusted with that role performed it to the best of their ability and in accordance with what we asked of them.</p>

<a name="70703-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07070332000122"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and to my noble friend Lord Judd for indicating that I should not focus on the precision of their amendment, but rather see this as an opportunity to test whether my amendment meets the challenge that it was set. I hope that I have given reassurances on our commitment to training. I explained on the previous occasion that we are working on a new qualification pathway that will cover all practitioners currently working at the levels of probation service officer and probation officer, in both offender management and intervention. I added that, under the new arrangements, we will award contracts to providers in the first place only if they are able to demonstrate that they will have staff who are appropriately trained for the services that they are delivering. I stressed&#151;and I stress again&#151;that contracts would set out with absolute clarity our expectations on this matter.</p>

<a name="70703-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07070332000123"></a>I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, with his rightful passion about the rights of children and their families, says about the draft document that I circulated. I emphasise what I emphasised previously: the document is in draft so that the House can have a taste of what is under consideration; it is not the perfected document. I agree with the noble Lord that the children and family issues are important and that we shall need to address them very carefully in the final document.</p>

<a name="70703-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07070332000124"></a>I hope that noble Lords will take those assurances into account. We have considered carefully all the concerns that the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and others have expressed. That is why, on reflection, we agreed that it would be sensible to provide such a commitment in the Bill. Amendment No. 24 is the result. It has been drafted specifically to meet the concerns that were raised in our earlier discussion and the concerns raised in the other place. Subsection (1) makes it clear that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="07070332000297"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may publish guidelines about any qualifications&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07070332000280"></a>I emphasise &#147;any&#148;&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07070332000318"></a>&#147;experience or training required to perform the work of an officer of a provider of probation services&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070332000281"></a>Subsection (2) clarifies this by stating:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="07070332000298"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State must&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07070332000282"></a>here is the impetus&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07070332000319"></a>&#147;publish guidelines ... in relation to work involving the supervision of offenders and other work requiring direct contact with offenders&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070332000283"></a>We hope that this resolves the issue with which we wrangled in Committee about how we should best define to whom the guidelines should apply.</p>

<a name="70703-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07070332000125"></a>We believe that those two subsections acting in conjunction&#151;particularly subsection (2)&#151;will cover

This covers the writing of court reports as well as risk assessments, the running of offender behaviour programmes and other such matters, particularly work with high-risk offenders, an issue about which the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, was particularly exercised. I hope that the House will appreciate that the importance of doing that is made absolutely clear.</p>

<a name="70703-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="07070332000126"></a>The amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, would mean that the qualifications for all staff, from the most junior administrative grade to chief officers, would have to be rigidly codified. I know that that cannot be what she intends. It would require the Secretary of State to accredit training providers for a minimum of 10 years. However forward looking we are, we cannot know what will be appropriate in 10 years&#146; time. The amendment would require providers to employ sufficient staff with &#147;degree level qualifications&#148;, which could have the unintended consequence of encouraging providers to employ staff with experience and degrees that are not the most important or the most necessary for the work that they have to do. Sometimes employing someone with a very old degree that has not been used for a very long time can be the cheaper alternative to employing someone who qualifies via the nationally approved route, or, indeed, to employing someone who has a wealth of experience by virtue of which they command a higher wage. I know that that is not what the noble Baroness or my noble friend Lord Judd would want.</p>

<a name="70703-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07070332000127"></a>If I may respectfully suggest so, government Amendment No. 24 is, on the other hand, a sensible and measured way in which to achieve what we all want. It will require the Secretary of State to publish guidelines about the qualifications, experience and training demanded of probation staff working directly with offenders. It also makes it clear that those guidelines should apply to all providers undertaking the work, so that we will have a really good parity of treatment for all those who come to work in the sector. As the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, would say, it gives us the innovation, the flexibility and the opportunity to grow and change as needs dictate.</p>

I very much hear what the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, says about competing upwards and downwards. He ably described the tension that there can be in that situation, but I think that our Amendment No. 24 enables us to respond appropriately.</p>

They are two very able people.</p>

<a name="70703-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="07070332000139"></a>Last autumn the former Home Secretary, John Reid, announced that a set percentage of probation work would have to be contracted out each year. Initially it was set at 10 per cent, but was to increase incrementally over subsequent years to a maximum of &#163;240 million of all work. At the time, that was controversial, in that it was believed to be arbitrary and bore no relation to the efficiency and effectiveness of existing probation work. We were therefore pleased to hear John Reid change that policy. At Third Reading in the House of Commons, he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="07070332000308"></a>&#147;I turn now to the question of targets&#151;a matter that has been raised constantly both with me and with the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South. People are very concerned, but we already have targets determining how much work must be contracted out of the public sector. In other words, they determine the outcome for services that must be put into the non-public sector by the probation board. In future, we shall abolish the existing targets and replace them with an entirely different type of aspiration. In future, the aspirations&#151;the targets&#151;will not be based on the a priori assumption that there is a level of non-public sector work that must be carried out, whether or not it gives best value or is from the best provider. That would be a dogmatic approach that could unjustifiably force work out of the public sector ... Let me make it clear: if a public sector provider is good enough, even outwith time scale or theme, or the assurances about ring-fenced areas that I shall give, it will have as much chance as anyone else to win the work&#151;some would say a better chance, given the history of some providers&#146; involvement and experience. Our aim is simply to ensure that the best provider delivers best value for the taxpayer. That is our purpose&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 28/2/07; col. 1019.]</p>

<a name="70703-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="07070332000140"></a>The proposed new clause would implement the former Home Secretary&#146;s concession. Essentially, it would place certain general duties on those authorities in the Local Government Act 1999, and is similar to the clauses in that Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="07070332000141"></a>Bearing in mind the time&#151;I know that there is to be a Statement at four o&#146;clock&#151;I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="07070332000143"></a>The proposed new clause places a duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that the probation trusts or boards act as best value authorities. That will ensure that the best provider of a service wins contracts, and that arbitrary percentage targets are therefore abolished. The amendment was supported by Napo, which was concerned that arbitrary percentages might be imposed on the service to the detriment of best value. I therefore hope that my noble friend will feel inclined to accept the amendment.</p>

There is some indication that we are beginning to get a contract-oriented type of NGO that is therefore out to cut corners. For all the reasons that the noble and learned Baroness put in answer to Amendment No. 23A&#151;I was impressed by her response&#151;it is important that we ensure that the message is clear that we are looking for quality and the best suited organisation. Of course, however, cost-effectiveness matters, and that can be tackled in negotiations.</p>

The list of best value seems an enormously helpful document because it sets out, for the first time that I have seen, a large number of those probation purposes that actually require contracting from whichever sector is concerned. I think that as a list, which will be developed over time, it is therefore an enormously helpful document to have in the hands of those who might be thinking of applying for the contracts to provide these services. Therefore, I am extremely glad that the amendment has been proposed.</p>

I begin with a few words about best value. Last week, my noble friend wrote to noble Lords setting out our approach to best value in more detail, but I emphasise that this is absolutely not about awarding contracts to the lowest bidder. Of course, value for money is important, but the emphasis is on value; we want to focus on outcomes, raising standards and cost-effectiveness, not simply cost-efficiency. We want to give other providers the chance to show what they can do, but only where they can demonstrate that they are better placed to deliver. The best value process will be used to improve the quality of probation services across the board, which I am sure is what all noble Lords seek to achieve.</p>

<a name="70703-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="07070332000147"></a>I will now address the position of staff. We have frequently paid tribute to probation staff and we have expressed our appreciation of the difficult, dangerous and often thankless work that they carry out on behalf of us all, and I do so again now. Probation staff have delivered the improvements in service delivery of recent years, and probation staff will carry on delivering the even greater improvements that we look for in the future. None of what we have in mind will be possible without them. We are determined to ensure that proper safeguards are in place to protect the position of staff. Many of those safeguards are set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill, which provides for terms and conditions to be protected in the transfer from boards to trusts and in any future transfers to alternative employers thereafter.</p>

<a name="70703-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="07070332000148"></a>My noble friend has raised a specific point in relation to the best value code of practice on workforce matters in local authority service contracts. I also highlight the code of practice on workforce matters in public sector service contracts, which  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_917"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 917</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>applies to contracts let by central government. As I am sure my noble friend will appreciate, it is almost identical to the local authority code, except where the latter makes express provision for local government matters. This code, rather than the local authority code, is in fact more relevant to contracts for probation provision.</p>

<a name="70703-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07070332000149"></a>However, the purpose of both codes is the same. They both set out an approach to workforce matters in public sector service contracts that involve a transfer of staff from a public sector organisation to a service provider, or in which staff originally transferred from a public sector organisation as a result of outsourcing are TUPE-transferred to a new provider under a retender of a contract. The aim is to protect the terms and conditions of the public sector staff transferring and to prevent the emergence of a &#147;two-tier workforce&#148;, dividing transferees and new joiners working beside each other on the same contracts.</p>

<a name="70703-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="07070332000150"></a>Both local and central government are required to ensure that the code that is relevant to them forms part of the service specification and conditions for all such contracts, except where specific exemptions have been announced. The codes recognise that there is no conflict between good employment practice, value for money and quality of service. On the contrary, quality and good value will not be provided by organisations that do not manage workforce issues well. The Cabinet Office code of practice on workforce matters in public sector service contracts does not have statutory force as such, but compliance with it is considered to be mandatory for all central government departments.</p>

<a name="70703-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07070332000151"></a>The National Offender Management Service already incorporates the code in those contracts which it lets directly for services that involve transfers of staff. It will also incorporate the code in the contracts with trusts, to ensure that trusts in turn incorporate its provisions in any relevant contracts that they enter into. There is therefore no need for further statutory provision in this regard and, with that reassurance, I trust that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

The Statement is as follows:</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_918"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 918</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;Mr Speaker, all Members of this House and all the people of this country have a shared interest in building trust in our democracy. And it is my hope that, by working together for change in a spirit that takes us beyond parties and beyond partisanship, we can agree a new British constitutional settlement that entrusts more power to Parliament and the British people. &#147;Change with a new settlement is, in my view, essential to our country&#146;s future. For we will meet only the new challenges of security, of economic change, of communities under pressure&#151;and forge a stronger shared national purpose&#151;by building a new relationship between citizens and government that ensures that Governments are a better servant of the people. &#147;Let me pay tribute to the contribution to our thinking and the wider constitutional debate already made by parliamentarians on all sides of the House. And because I want this process to be one in which we consult and involve not only all political parties but also all the people of this country, what I propose today is not and should not be seen as the final blueprint for a constitutional settlement, but a route map towards it. &#147;This route map seeks to address two fundamental questions: to hold power more accountable and to uphold and enhance the rights and responsibilities of the citizen. &#147;And while constitutional change will not be the work of just one Bill or one year or one Parliament, I can today make an immediate start by proposing changes that will transfer power from the Prime Minister and the Executive. For centuries they have exercised authority in the name of the monarchy without the people and their elected representatives being consulted. So now I propose that in 12 areas important to our national life, the Prime Minister and Executive should surrender or limit their powers, the exclusive exercise of which by the Government should have no place in a modern democracy. &#147;These are: the power of the Executive to declare war, the power to request the dissolution of Parliament, the power over recall of Parliament, the power of the Executive to ratify international treaties without decision by Parliament, the power to make key public appointments without effective scrutiny, the power to restrict parliamentary oversight of the intelligence services, power to choose bishops, power in the appointment of judges, power to direct prosecutors in individual criminal cases, power over the Civil Service itself, and the executive powers to determine the rules governing entitlement to passports and the granting of pardons. &#147;I now propose to surrender or limit these powers to make for a more open 21st century British democracy. Let me set out the measures, the details of which are included in a Green Paper published today by my right honourable friend the Justice Secretary.  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_919"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 919</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;While constitutional change should never limit our ability to deal with emergencies and should never jeopardise the security of our forces or any necessary operational decisions, the Government will consult on a resolution to guarantee that, on the grave issue of peace and war, it is ultimately this House of Commons that will make the decision. I propose, in addition, to put on to a statutory footing Parliament&#146;s right to ratify new international treaties. &#147;We will also consult on proposals that this House of Commons would have to approve a resolution for any dissolution of Parliament requested by the Prime Minister, and that while, at present, Members of Parliament cannot decide whether the House should be recalled, for the first time, a majority of Members&#151;and not just the Prime Minister&#151;should have that right, subject to your authority, Mr Speaker. &#147;The House of Commons should also have a bigger role in the selection of key public officials.&#147;I propose, as a first step, pre-appointment hearings for public officials whose role it is to protect the public&#146;s rights and interests, and for whom there is not currently independent scrutiny. This includes the Chief Inspector of Prisons, the Local Government Ombudsman, the Civil Service Commissioner and the Commissioner for Public Appointments. For public offices where appointments are acknowledged to be market sensitive, the Chancellor will set out today how pre-commencement hearings will apply to new members of the Monetary Policy Committee, including the Governor of the Bank of England, and the chairman of the Financial Services Authority. I propose that we extend pre-commencement hearings to utility and other regulators; that we review the arrangements for making appointments to NHS boards; and it is right that this House of Commons vote on the appointment of the chair of the new Independent Statistics Board. &#147;Mr Speaker, I can announce that from now on the Government will regularly publish, for parliamentary debate and public scrutiny, our national security strategy setting out for the British people the threats we face and the objectives we pursue. I have said for some time that the long term and continuing security obligation upon us requires us to co-ordinate military, policing, intelligence and diplomatic action, and also to win hearts and minds in this country and around the world. So, following discussions over the last few months, I have decided to establish within government a national security council, charged with bringing together our overseas, defence and security but also our development and community relations effort, and sending out a clear message that at all times we will be vigilant and we will never yield in addressing the terrorist threat. &#147;As the security agencies themselves recognise, greater accountability to Parliament can strengthen still further public support for the work they do. So while ensuring necessary safeguards respecting  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_920"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 920</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>confidentiality and security, we will consult on whether and how the Intelligence and Security Committee can be appointed by, and report to, Parliament. And we will start now with hearings, where possible, held in public; a strengthened capacity for investigations; reports subject to more parliamentary debate; and greater transparency over appointments to the committee.&#147;The Church of England is, and should remain, the established church in England. Establishment does not, however, justify the Prime Minister influencing senior church appointments, including bishops. And I also propose that the Government should consider relinquishing its residual role in the appointment of judges. &#147;The role of the Attorney-General, which combines legal and ministerial functions, needs to change. And while we consult on reform, the Attorney-General has decided, except if the law or national security requires it, not to make key prosecution decisions in individual criminal cases. &#147;To reinforce the neutrality of the Civil Service, the core principles governing it will no longer be set at the discretion of the Executive but will be legislated by Parliament&#151;and so this Government have finally responded to the central recommendation of the Northcote-Trevelyan report on the Civil Service made over 150 years ago in 1854. &#147;The frameworks for granting pardons and for issuing and withdrawing passports should also be set not by Government but by Parliament. And I propose that we reduce the advanced sight that government departments have of the release of statistical information from as much as five days currently to just 24 hours.&#147;Mr Speaker, even as we reduce the power of the Executive, we will also increase its accountability. Following my decision to revoke the provisions which previously allowed special advisers to give orders to civil servants, I am today publishing a new ministerial code which provides for a new independent adviser to supervise disclosure and who I can ask to scrutinise ministerial conduct, including conflicts of interest. &#147;I propose that we reinforce the accountability of the Executive to Parliament and the public with a Statement in the summer prior to the Queen&#146;s Speech on the provisional forward legislative programme and annual departmental reports debated in Parliament, beginning this summer.&#147;But just as the Executive must become more accountable to Parliament, Parliament itself must become more accountable. &#147;Given the vote in this House in March for major reform of the House of Lords as a second and revising Chamber with provision for democratic election, a Statement will be made before the Recess as we press ahead with reform; a Statement on the reform of local government will propose a new concordat between local and central government; we will fulfil our manifesto commitment to publish our review of the experience of the various voting systems introduced since 1998;

We will do nothing to put at risk the Union.&#147;The right of all the British people to have their voice heard is fundamental to our democracy and to holding public institutions to account. &#147;Britain is rightly proud to be the pioneer of the modern liberties of the individual, and I think it right to make it a general rule that in this area there is independent oversight of authorities and accountability to Parliament. I also encourage this House to agree a new process for ensuring consideration of petitions from members of the public. &#147;Disengagement is too often reflected in low turnout in elections. Britain is unusual in holding elections on weekdays when people are at work and my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Justice will announce a consultation on whether there is a case for voting at weekends. &#147;The Government will also bring forward plans to extend the period of time during which parties can use all-women shortlists for candidate selections and to give more time for all parties in this House to take up this new right if they choose. And while balancing the need for public order with the right to public dissent, I think it right, in consultation with the Metropolitan Police, Parliament, the Mayor of London, Westminster City Council and civil liberties groups, to change the laws that now restrict the right to demonstrate in Parliament Square. &#147;The measures that I have just announced represent an important step forward in changing the way that we are governed. But it is possible to do more to bring government closer to the people. While our system of representative democracy&#151;local as well as national&#151;is at the heart of our constitution, it can be enhanced by devolving more power directly to the people and I propose that we start the debate and consult on empowering citizens and communities in four areas.&#147;First, powers of initiative will extend the right of the British people to intervene with their elected local representatives to ensure action through a new community right to call for action and new duties on public bodies to involve local people.  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_922"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 922</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;Secondly, there will be new rights for the British people to be consulted through mechanisms such as &#145;citizens&#146; juries&#146; on major decisions affecting their lives.&#147;Thirdly, there will be powers of redress&#151;new rights for the British people to scrutinise and improve the delivery of local services. And, fourthly, there will be powers to ballot on spending decisions in areas such as neighbourhood budgets and youth budgets, with decisions on finance made by local people themselves.&#147;At the same time, we must give new life to the very idea of citizenship itself. All of us in this House would acknowledge that there are very specific challenges we must meet on engaging young people and improving citizenship education, and I hope that there will be all-party support for a commission to review this and make recommendations. While the voting age has been 18 since 1969, it is right, as part of this debate, to examine, and hear from young people themselves, whether lowering that age would increase participation in the political process. &#147;Consultation will take place with you, Mr Speaker&#151;and, through the Leader of the House, this House&#151;as to whether the Youth Parliament, and the Youth Parliament alone, should be invited here in this Chamber, once a year and on a non-sitting day.&#147;What constitutes citizens&#146; rights, beyond voting, and citizens&#146; responsibilities, such as jury service, should itself be a matter for public deliberation. As we focus on the challenges that we face and what unites us and integrates our country, our starting point should be to discuss together and then, as other countries do, agree and set down the values, founded in liberty, which define our citizenship and help define our country. There is a case that we should go further still than this statement of values to codify either in concordats or in a single document both the duties and rights of citizens and the balance of power between Government, Parliament and the people.&#147;In Britain, we have a largely unwritten constitution. To change that would represent a fundamental and historic shift in our constitutional arrangements. So it is right to involve the public in a sustained debate about whether there is a case for the United Kingdom developing a full British Bill of Rights and Duties, or for moving towards a written constitution.&#147;Because such fundamental changes should happen only where there is a settled consensus on whether to proceed, I have asked my right honourable friend the Secretary for Justice to lead a dialogue within Parliament and with the people across the United Kingdom by holding a series of hearings, starting in the autumn, in all regions and nations of this country. He will consult the other parties on this process.&#147;The changes that we propose today and the national debate that we now begin are founded on the conviction that the best answer to disengagement from our democracy is to strengthen our democracy.

It was a long Statement, and rightly so: the subject is massive and there have been enormous changes over the course of the past few years. Does she recognise that this House regards these matters with a great deal of importance and will she use her good offices to provide us with time for a debate on the issues and on the Green Paper at some stage&#151;perhaps after the Summer Recess?</p>

<a name="70703-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="07070332000157"></a>The Government have a new adviser on these matters whom they have found on the Liberal Democrat Benches. I assume that the noble Lord, Lord Lester, has advised on the Statement and perhaps even the noble Baroness discussed it before reaching conclusions.</p>

<a name="70703-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="07070332000158"></a>There was a great deal in the Statement that was welcome, but to listen to it, you would not think that the man who made it had been the second most powerful man in the country these past 10 years. The main message from the Statement was an attempt to distance the present Prime Minister from his predecessor&#146;s cavalier treatment of our constitution. That is why there is such a great need for change and thought as outlined in the Statement.</p>

<a name="70703-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="07070332000159"></a>Of course we welcome a willingness to reach out to other parties, which I hope will embrace some of the enormous experience of the Cross Benchers sitting here in your Lordships' House. We welcome the ending of the shameful Order in Council giving political appointees power to give orders over civil servants. We welcome ideas to give more power to Back Benchers in the House of Commons. That echoes the Conservative programme for Commons reform. We welcome also many of the controls on operation of the Executive through the prerogative, but there are practical considerations in issues as diverse as the declaration of war and the appointment of bishops which will require careful consideration. Can the noble Baroness say whether the extra powers to be given to Parliament over the ratification of treaties will cover the powers of this Parliament over EU legislation?</p>

<a name="70703-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="07070332000160"></a>There was much in the Statement about extra roles for the other place. I also welcome that. But as Leader of this House, can the noble Baroness say whether this House will be given any role in hearings before the appointment of senior public officials? This is a two-Chamber Parliament. Will the noble Baroness act to ensure that this House, with its unparalleled experience, plays its part in this and other new initiatives? One has only to think of the authority that the US Senate has in these matters to realise the potential importance of that to this House.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_924"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 924</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70703-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="07070332000161"></a>If the Prime Minister genuinely wants discussions with other parties, will the noble Baroness accept that we will take part in a practical spirit, just as we have in talks on the future of this House being led by the Secretary of State for Justice? The principles that should apply are clear but sadly have been ignored by this Government over the past 10 years. Change to the constitution should be based on consensus. It cannot be imposed by a one-party majority in one House. It cannot be designed to be to the benefit of one party or two; the interests of the country must come first. The consequences of every change must be carefully thought through before change is made. We want no repeat of the disastrous attempted abolition of the office of Lord Chancellor. Parliament must emerge stronger from any change, unlike too many changes over the past 10 years that have drained power from Parliament and given it to a range of other bodies, many of which are shamefully not even elected.</p>

<a name="70703-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="07070332000162"></a>The astonishing thing about the British constitution is that since the middle of the 18th<sup></sup>century we have, alone among advanced countries of the world, enjoyed over 250 years without civil war, without revolution, without overthrow of governments, except by a vote of the people in this Chamber or in another place. Yet, at the same time, we have accomplished massive social change. Change was made possible by an unwritten constitution, rooted in convention, that gave unprecedented flexibility, and by a doctrine of parliamentary primacy, the rule of law and constitutional government. This was a prize beyond belief. Now we are being asked to have a fresh look at all of this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07070332000163"></a>After 10 years of unilateral action the Prime Minister wants a multilateral approach to help sort out the mess. Well so be it, but can the noble Baroness tell us why this so-called new constitutional settlement fails totally to address the scandal of Scottish MPs voting on English laws when English MPs have no say on similar matters in Scotland? The Prime Minister says this will create a two-tier class of Members of Parliament. That two-tier class already exists today. Why does the Statement not consider apportionment of resources between parts of our kingdom? If, as Scotland&#146;s First Minister says, Scotland&#146;s resources finance England, or if, on the other hand, the Barnett formula works to the disadvantage of England, why should these issues not now be studied? Why is there no proposal to review use of referendums in the United Kingdom? There is talk of removing power from Government, so why will the review not look at who decides whether we have a referendum and what the rules will be? What is the noble Baroness&#146;s view on the right balance between the referendal principle and parliamentary democracy? If we cannot have a referendum on the transfer of power from this Parliament to Brussels&#151;something explicitly promised in the Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos&#151;is there any case for referendums at all?</p>

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07070332000164"></a>I welcome talk of a review of our damaged voting system, a system once trusted beyond doubt and understood by everyone, now riddled with confusion and tainted by corruption. Will it end the use of three  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_925"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 925</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or four different voting methods on the same day? This has demonstrated the weakness of proportional representation and we see no case for importing that system to Parliament.</p>

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="07070332000165"></a>We will take part in discussions on a written constitution and other ways of asserting individual rights. But as the Prime Minister says, this would represent a major change in the way things have been done in this country. Much recent constitutional change has been lawyer-driven and lawyer-made and it has not always been well made. Does the noble Baroness see any dangers in subjecting constitutional decisions of this Parliament to judicial oversight?</p>

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="07070332000166"></a>Surely what we need most of all is a fundamental reverse in the dragging of power to the centre. Where in the Statement is the real return of authority to local government and local communities? Where is the return of power from the quangos and unelected regional bodies to elected local authorities? Where is the scrapping of targets and controls from the centre, not only in local government but across the public sector as a whole? Will the noble Baroness confirm that there will be a full-blown Civil Service Act? Perhaps she might tell us whether it will be introduced in the next Session. If her answer is yes, we very much welcome it.</p>

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="07070332000167"></a>Before we define the new rights, should we not stop to consider what happened to the old ones, such as habeas corpus, privacy, a citizen police force, freedom of movement, freedom of speech, and the freedom to travel without signing up for an ID card, which once made this country the envy of the world? No one had to write down the freedoms of the British people then; they were inborn.</p>

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="07070332000168"></a>What we now need is a massive programme of repair to our constitutional arrangements. We will play our part, and with the conviction and resolution that this House and the noble Baroness would expect. Our conviction is rooted in a deep love of liberty and freedom, and our resolution will be twofold: to give back to every individual, every family and every local community more power and say in the things that affect their lives; and to restore to this House and to this Parliament their central place in the key decisions that shape the future of our society and our country.</p>

Some months ago, when we debated the reform of the House of Lords, I said that I detected the thunder of reform coming down the Corridor from the other place. There was some laughter from Members on the Conservative Benches when I said that. I hope that they will at least concede today that my hearing was not at fault.</p>

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07070332000170"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, said, the devil is always in the detail when it comes to constitutional reform, and I will not try to cover everything in the very long and detailed Statement. I note, however, that there are symbolic signs of momentum in any cause. I see three such signs here. First, this is a prime  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_926"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 926</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ministerial Statement. Constitutional reform cannot be carried through without the whole-hearted commitment from the Prime Minister of the day, so I find it very encouraging that the Statement comes from the Prime Minister himself. Secondly, it is also encouraging that Mr Jack Straw has been left in post. Others speculated that he might have wanted grander prizes. It is very encouraging that he has decided, and the Prime Minister wishes him, to stay the course in carrying through this programme of reform. Thirdly, it is also encouraging that the Prime Minister has asked the Leader of the House to come into the heart of these negotiations.</p>

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07070332000171"></a>I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, about the need for consensus. That is to be welcomed, but not at the expense of progress. If we had waited for progress, the Member for Old Sarum would probably still be sitting in the House of Commons and we would probably still have 700 hereditary Peers in this place. Constitutional reform, too, needs momentum and commitment, but, again, there are good signs. The Government can draw on the excellent power report that was produced under the chairmanship of the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, and an excellent paper that was published this week by Professor Robert Hazell of the Constitution Unit of UCL&#151;my old college&#151;which proposes a nice agenda for government. As the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, said, there is the <I>Power to the People</I> report by the Conservative Democracy Taskforce, which is chaired by Mr Ken Clarke. There is also the policy paper of the Liberal Democrat policy working group, chaired by my noble friend Lord Tyler, and I ask the Lord President to get off the shelf and dust down the excellent report on voting reform by my distinguished predecessor Lord Jenkins of Hillhead. It would make excellent reading for the Prime Minister. While making this list, I also include the excellent initiatives already taken by our Lord Speaker in her outreach role.</p>

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07070332000172"></a>I have a few questions for the Lord President. I see no mention in the Statement of the Freedom of Information Act. Can she assure me that that Act will not be amended unless there is post-legislative scrutiny by a committee of both Houses which allows both those who wish it strengthened and those who wish it weakened to put their case?</p>

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07070332000173"></a>I am interested in the references to Civil Service reform. Although the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, is not in his place, I am sure, like the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, that he would want me to ask whether that means a Civil Service Act. If so, we on these Benches certainly welcome that redemption of a pledge made by the first Gladstone Government.</p>

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07070332000174"></a>The interesting comments and proposals on security and the royal prerogatives give tremendous new powers to the House of Commons. In taking on those new responsibilities, will there be parallel reform in the House of Commons to make it fit for purpose? On House of Lords reform, will the noble Baroness ensure, as Leader of the House, that reform is not a euphemism for weakening the House? Seeing the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, in his new position does not entirely fill me with confidence. I would trust him

I quote to both of them the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart: unless this House retains the right to say no, it becomes a debating chamber and not a legislature. We must retain the right to say no.</p>

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07070332000175"></a>It would be churlish not to recognise the Statement for what it is: an historic Statement, a bold Statement and one that should give people in all parties, and in none, the opportunity to address some of the real challenges and worries about our society. We need democrats to make a democracy work. All of us involved in politics know of the shortcomings of recent years.

I am sure that, with the Leader of the Opposition and with the noble Lord, Lord McNally, we shall find time to do so, as noble Lords would wish. Part of that debate will be to take forward these proposals. As I said at the beginning of the Statement, it is important to see these in the context of genuine consultation, genuine proposals and by no means the end of the story. I agree too that the devil is in the detail. As the noble Lords, Lord McNally and Lord Strathclyde, said, we need to take forward practical considerations.

However, there are many ways of consulting the British people and involving organisations, politicians of all sorts, local government, voluntary organisations, local people, young people and Parliament itself. That is what we should do. As for judicial oversight of constitutional issues, those are important considerations, and in looking at what should be codified and written down we should consider the consequences for the role of Parliament and the judiciary.</p>

We have here a substantial and major Statement, on which a large amount of work will be needed over a long time.</p>

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="07070332000187"></a>I cannot speak for 205 independent Cross-Benchers and, in any event, I have only had a short time to look at this important Statement, but I would like to make one or two comments. Our Benches will certainly be favourable to the idea that power should be more accountable. That is the first point in the Statement. Some of the 12 points listed may be disagreed with, but the principle of making power

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="07070332000188"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, we will ask first whether Parliament means both Houses or one. We believe that it should mean both. That question will come up in due course. Also under that heading, I think that my colleagues will welcome the reinforcement of the core principles of the Civil Service not being at the discretion of the Executive but in legislation by Parliament. We will come back to the important point on whether there will be a Civil Service Act.</p>

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="07070332000189"></a>Secondly, I am sure that there will be strong support for enhancing the rights and responsibilities of citizens, including at the local level&#151;while it is often felt that they ought to be there, in practice they are not always. That will also be greatly welcomed.</p>

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07070332000190"></a>The third point is that this document rightly refers repeatedly to involving the public in a debate on important issues such as whether there is a case for a British bill of rights and responsibilities and whether we should move towards a written constitution. On this, the theme among my colleagues will certainly be, as the Government state in this document, that we must proceed only with a settled consensus. That is the vital element of such an important issue.</p>

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07070332000191"></a>I am extremely glad to see that the Prime Minister has carried through his reputation for prudence in the sense that there is very little in the Statement about this House. How prudent that is. None the less, we look forward to a Statement before the recess.</p>

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07070332000192"></a>I do not have many questions for the noble Baroness, but I think these comments are needed on such an important document.</p>

Both are extremely valuable as we consider this important document. I agree with the thrust of his remarks about greater accountability and that there is an issue about the two Houses of Parliament. But the Houses are different, so let us not begin by assuming that we have the same role as the elected place. We will have to consider what our role should be in an appropriate manner. That will form part of the discussions and deliberations from the Ministry of Justice, to be led in your Lordships&#146; House by my noble friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, whom I would certainly entrust with anything to do with a new constitution, or indeed any other aspect of government policy he was willing to take on. As I indicated, I will work closely with him. I am also pleased that the noble Lord mentioned the local dimension. There is much that we need to think about regarding engagement with people at the local level.</p>

The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Justice consulted the most reverend Primate about his intentions, which we believe are in accord with the declared wishes of the Church of England. Indeed, the church being the decisive voice in the appointment of bishops was called for by the General Synod of the Church of England back in 1974&#151;not quite 150 years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="07070332000195"></a>The Church of England is grateful for the Prime Minister&#146;s thoughtfulness and his overt support for the role of Her Majesty the Queen as Supreme Governor of the Church of England and the establishment by law of the Church of England, which has been quite strongly reiterated in the Green Paper. Further, the church is grateful for the way in which the Prime Minister has confirmed the valued relations between church and state.</p>

Is it not likely that no institution in the country will remain unruptured by the consequences of what has been set out? It amounts to material for a dozen or so Queen&#146;s Speeches and two or three general elections, put forward by a Prime Minister who may well be said to require a mandate before he starts on such a mammoth task. More seriously, and worst of all, does not this huge agenda risk overloading in general and in detail a Parliament that already struggles to handle competently its workload? I regret having to say it, but is this not an overambitious agenda from an understandably impatient man?</p>

However, I have to say that having a &#147;modish appeal&#148; is not something I associate with my right honourable friend the Prime Minister; indeed, that is not how he would wish to be seen. He has considered very carefully where he believes we need to strengthen and move forward our democracy and he has put those issues in a Green Paper today, at the beginning of his premiership, for consideration in Parliament and in the country beyond.</p>

<a name="70703-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="07070332000199"></a>I began the Statement by saying that this is not about one Bill, one year, one Parliament. Indeed, my right honourable friend has laid out the beginnings of a process, which I hope noble Lords will embrace, but not in a way that suggests that all this is about legislation or the things that Parliament has to do; rather it is an entire process of looking at how we can strengthen our democracy through the engagement of our young people, supporting people at a local level, thinking about our institutions more carefully and considering how best we can deliver for the people of this country. I believe that is what we have done.</p>

First, do the Government accept the unanimous recommendations of the Cunningham committee, which they and this House unanimously accepted, that there should not be legislation to lay down the conventions of this House? Secondly, do they also accept the unanimous view of every government spokesman on the subject since 1999, that the independent Members are a vital element of this House which must be preserved in any reform?</p>

We will take account of them in our considerations. As regards the independents, noble Lords will know that we have had several votes in your Lordships&#146; House and in the other place, and they will know in which direction my right honourable friend the Prime Minister voted. The issue will form part of my discussions in considering the future of the House.

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="07070332000206"></a>First, although it is rightly said that we do not have a written constitution, it is far more written than it was. Is this not a major step further towards a written constitution, which many of us would welcome? Secondly, this Green Paper of 63 pages does not have the space to mention the word &#147;devolution&#148;. Is this significant?</p>

As to a written constitution, I have made it clear in the Statement that there are issues to consider about what should be written down and what should be codified that will require the kind of consensus we have described.

In particular, his unrivalled 10 years&#146; experience of Government at the top makes him better equipped than any previous Prime Minister to introduce a comprehensive programme of constitutional reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07070332000209"></a>Is it recognised that transferring power from the Executive to Parliament is entirely welcome because that enhances accountability and so increases the potential effectiveness of government, reflecting better the will and values of the people? If power is to be transferred to Parliament, let it also be transferred to a reformed second Chamber. Otherwise, the risk of overload would be repeated in another form.</p>

I agree with his comments about my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, his 10 years at the top and his ability to consider what now needs to be done. I agree that this is about increasing the effectiveness of Government.

In the discussion on the Intelligence and Security Committee, I see that various things will be done in the future that will be considered and discussed. However, the Statement says that,</p>
<ul><a name="07070332000320"></a>&#147;we will start now with hearings, where possible, held in public; a strengthened capacity for investigations ... and greater transparency&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="07070332000212"></a>I suggest that that is an extremely dangerous thing to do without further consultation. First, what you say to your friends your enemies also hear. Everything that is said in public is heard by our enemies as well as our friends. Secondly, I assure your Lordships that the difficulty in recruiting agents will increase substantially. I can think of no agent who will wish to be recruited if they know that there is going to be public discussion of intelligence matters and operations. I seek reassurance that that too is for consideration, and is not going to happen at once. I am worried about the words,</p>

Surely it should have greater powers to protect the public from precipitated action by a Government with a temporary majority. That is one of the most important functions that the second Chamber can perform and any new constitutional arrangement should certainly include a prohibition on further curtailment of the delaying powers of this House without this House&#146;s consent.</p>

Regions may be much loved by governments but they often do not reflect any community of interest and they do not command the loyalty or affection of citizens in the way that local government does. If the Government are serious about devolution, devolution should be to existing local authorities and not to the regions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="07070332000228"></a>Last night we were due to have debated for the fourth time an amendment to the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill. Shortly before we were due to start I received a request from the Secretary of State for Justice to defer that debate until he had had time to consider the Bill as it stood. In discussion with the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats it was very easy to agree to that and to welcome it. Indeed, I took the opportunity to pass to the Secretary of State a suggested date which he might consider, which I would have mentioned on the Floor of the House. I welcomed the request because it seemed evidence of a willingness to engage in constructive debate. We have just listened to the

My amendment seeks further debate about the management of offenders within the criminal justice system.</p>

<a name="70703-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07070332000229"></a>This Bill had at its genesis a paper by the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, but that report was based on a false premise that there would be a stable prison population. Indeed, both he and the then Commissioner for Correction said that the National Offender Management Service, as suggested, could not come to pass unless there was a stable prison population&#151;and there has not been one ever since. Therefore, in many ways, NOMS had a flawed beginning. However, that is not to say that we do not agree with the principle of the proper management of offenders throughout the time that they are in the hands of the criminal justice system or with the partnership of the voluntary, private and public sectors in providing their treatment. We have agreed that throughout our discussion. However, the problem with this Bill is that it is not about the management of offenders; it is about the management of the management of offenders, and in particular the introduction of a new way of commissioning probation services. Therefore, it is a falsely named Bill. Why does that matter?</p>

<a name="70703-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07070332000230"></a>One of the reasons that the Government put forward for not being keen on including custody in the corporate manslaughter Bill was that they were sailing into uncharted waters and that they needed to test the temperature before they went further. We are in uncharted waters in the Offender Management Bill. The only country in the world that has gone down the route that has been proposed is New Zealand and that resulted in a gross increase in prison numbers, which worried their Government so much that it has been dropped.</p>

<a name="70703-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07070332000231"></a>Since this Bill was launched&#151;I forget which number it is; the number of Bills now reaches 54, which is more than there had been in the previous 100 years at the Home Office&#151;No.10 Downing Street issued a paper called <I>Building on Progress: Security, crime and justice</I><I>. </I>It is the fourth policy review on this matter and has six chapters, including one of reform of the criminal justice workplace. In addition, it announced a term of reference for another review by the noble Lord, Lord Carter. He has done Wembley, he has done a legal review and he is now reviewing prisons. One of the things that he has been asked to do is to assess the management and efficiency of public sector prisons. Surely that has a key part to play in offender management, which is allegedly the subject of the Bill, yet the Carter review will not be included in the conclusions of the Bill. The management of public sector prisons has a huge impact on the rehabilitation of offenders, which is what we agreed a lot of the Bill is all about.</p>

<a name="70703-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07070332000232"></a>If that was not enough, last week, as a leaving present, the former Prime Minister landed on the desks of those who cared to pick it up the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. It is a monster of 129 clauses and 23 schedules, and it included the suggestion that there might be a commissioner for

That has not come near the statute book. My case is that, frankly, this is the wrong time to take this Bill&#151;when it is taken in isolation&#151;because it does not take into consideration what is included in all the others.</p>

<a name="70703-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07070332000233"></a>I am currently a member of the Regulators Select Committee, and we are looking particularly at financial regulators. One of the things that has been brought to our notice is that the worst aspect of the whole process is something called the regulatory impact assessment, which is required to be done on every new piece of regulation, and they are very badly done. Indeed, the National Audit Office reviewed regulatory impact assessments and pointed out that they are badly done and that, because they are badly done, they have an impact on what the regulation is meant to achieve. I have drawn attention to the regulatory impact assessment on the Bill. We have not drawn up a league table of regulatory impact assessments but the one on this Bill would figure pretty near the bottom of the league. It says that the options are to &#147;do nothing&#148; which means that,</p>
<ul><a name="07070332000323"></a>&#147;we would be unable to realise the full benefits of the NOMS reform programme&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07070332000286"></a>or to implement in full, which,</p>
<ul><a name="07070332000324"></a>&#147;would allow the us to take forward the reform agenda&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070332000287"></a>But it does not explain at all the impact on costs, the impact on other services, the impact on the voluntary sector or the impact on all the people who are working to rehabilitate offenders, or whether this process would improve. It is merely about whether the Government&#146;s proposal would be taken forward. I do not believe that that is what a regulatory impact assessment is all about.</p>

<a name="70703-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="07070332000234"></a>I have been delighted to hear during the course of this debate that organisations such as the CBI and some private sector companies are very willing to come forward and be involved in the contracts. I am delighted that organisations such as Turning Point and some of the large voluntary sector organisations and the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations also want to take part. Of course they do, but that is not the whole story. There is a whole myriad of other small organisations, which do an enormous amount of work in this field. I have been associated with a number of them. I heard yesterday, for example, of a study 10 years ago into the provision of proper nutrition in a prison. It proved that proper nutrition and diet produced a reduction in offending behaviour in prison of 40 per cent. We spent 10 years trying to be allowed to replicate that&#151;10 very frustrating years dealing with people who say that they support the voluntary sector. Meanwhile, the Dutch came in, took our evidence, went away to Holland and published their reports yesterday showing that there was a 47 per cent reduction&#151;we had underestimated.</p>

<a name="70703-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="07070332000235"></a>I mention that because, over and again in the sector, the arts organisations and small organisations dealing with particular aspects do not feel included in what is happening. They want to be sucked into the dialogue. Therefore, the purpose of my amendment is not to stop what is happening but to say, in welcoming it and the arrival of a Ministry of Justice  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_938"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 938</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that has to focus on all these issues, &#147;You don&#146;t have to rush ahead with theBill. You&#146;ve got a crisis on your hands at the moment of too many prisoners and probation officers who need to be handled now by what you have. Introducing a long, drawn-out change to the commissioning process will not help you solve that problem today. Get on with today and, in the mean time, use the opportunity to look at all the evidence, all the things that have been said on the Bill, all the attention that has been drawn to the items that have been left out of the Bill, all the links to other services such as education and healthcare, and the detailed involvement of the voluntary sector. Then let&#146;s have a proper debate within the criminal justice system to see that what emerges as the national system for the management of offenders is robust because it consists of a coalition of the willing, who feel that they&#146;re willing because they&#146;ve been involved&#148;.</p>

<a name="70703-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07070332000236"></a>My amendment is designed to suggest that the new Secretary of State should accept that and seize the opportunity presented. Then he should conduct that inquiry and engage with the House, knowing that when he does so everyone&#151;certainly everyone whom I have spoken to&#151;is minded to go along with the general proposition, but is dissatisfied by the detail that has been presented. It is in the spirit of seizing an opportunity to get something right in relation to all the other things that are on the table, rather than in isolation from it, that I beg to move.</p>

I am unpersuaded by the argument. It is yet another example of looking for any and every reason to oppose the broad thrust of the reforms.</p>

<a name="70703-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07070332000238"></a>The argument is that, after we have been discussing these issues since 2003, we should find yet one more reason to go slower when we all face a level of repeat criminality in this country that we ought to be ashamed of. To believe that we should wait yet further to address that with considered, important and difficult reforms feels like an indefensible and embarrassing argument to have to make. The further argument that the House should, in a sense, second guess the Government in their executive responsibilities about moving forward with reforms when Parliament has given its proper consideration also seems inappropriate. We say that we support the reforms and respect the importance of developing a much more vigorous system that looks afresh at how all the constituent parts address reoffending. That is right&#151;I hope that we believe that&#151;so let us get on with it.</p>

<a name="70703-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07070332000239"></a>We argue at times that we should spare the staff from the changes. As someone who has spent far too much of his life seeking to reform public services, I say that where you believe you have a clear vision of reform you should get on with it. The staff do not welcome you dallying around and putting them through further agony, particularly because some will put blandishments in their ears and say, &#147;This further delaying mechanism might mean that reform will really go away and we can afford doing it&#148;.</p>

Therefore, I urge the House not to give succour to those who believe that we do not need change in this agenda when we desperately do, and to those who think that they can put off the evil day of change that they do not want to face by finding yet further reasons for delay. Let us give these measures proper scrutiny, but let us then get on with it and seek to reduce reoffending in our society and better protect the public from criminality, because we are not doing sufficient at present. These changes are needed; we should get on with them.</p>

I have struggled with the Bill to find the underlying, clear rationale behind it, and there have been points when I felt that there were two or three different Bills popping out from underneath it. As the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, will know, I have become increasingly sceptical about the mantra of public service reform, the employment of large numbers of outside consultants and the pressure to change for the sake of change and to push towards the private sector. </p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07070332000242"></a>We all agree with the principle of more integrated offender management, and we understand that the purpose is the reduction of reoffending and in parallel a reduction in prison numbers. When I read the Carter report&#151;which has a good beginning and a good end, but I missed the argument in the middle that links the beginning and the end&#151;I understood that one the major problems is that fines are not enforced. Nothing that we have read in any of the papers since then deals with how better to enforce fines, which might make a major contribution to a reduction in prison numbers.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07070332000243"></a>We talk about community penalties and community punishment, but that takes us into the question of which part of a mixed economy one is moving towards. There still seems to be confusion in the Bill about whether we are moving from public provision to largely private sector provision&#151;for profits and for large companies&#151;or to large non-profits that are commissioned centrally, or at the most regionally, or the voluntary sector, which is often much more local working with the community. I note that in the Government&#146;s paper <I>Reducing Crime, Changing Lives</I>, the implication is very much that we should be talking about local community involvement, local community punishment and working with the not-for-profit sector. I hope that is the direction in which we are moving, but I am not entirely clear.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07070332000244"></a>Today&#146;s very welcome Statement from the Government on constitutional reform suggests that we should be doing everything to move back towards local community and local engagement as far as we can. That is what we on these Benches support, and that is why we are so unhappy about the extent to which regional commissioning seems to be taking  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_940"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 940</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>over from local boards. That is why we were so deeply unhappy when the noble Lord, Lord Warner, suggested that one would have trusts, which one would set up and abolish every day of the week, if you like. Some noble Lords will recall him saying very proudly that he had abolished 200 primary care trusts in a year and set up 55 more and thinking that that was an excellent example of our process of public sector reform.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07070332000245"></a>We therefore think that there is still a case for a pause. We have not seen the Government&#146;s response to the many responses to their original proposals. I have read the Carter report, the Government&#146;s response and all those things, and I still do not see an underlying rationale passing through them. In this process, we have had a succession of different Home Secretaries offering different things. If we are to make a very important change in the management of offending, we need to be entirely sure that it makes sense, that it lasts and that everyone is happy with the lasting settlement. We need to make sure that we do not rush through yet another change that will be succeeded with yet another change in three or four years&#146; time, but only after a large number of outside consultants have said that the last one did not work.</p>

They will shape for perhaps a generation to come the future delivery of probation services to those who are in need of them. They are very important services, particularly for the security of this country. It is therefore important that we get them right. The noble Lord, Lord Filkin, went on to say that there was a clear vision of reforms. I disagree. In our five days in Committee and one day on Report, we have not seen clarity. We have seen an attempt to shield the truth. These are centralising reforms presented as being responsive to local needs.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07070336000002"></a>Last week, the mask slipped when we debated an amendment on which I divided the House and was fortunate in persuading it to support me. I argued that the Secretary of State&#146;s centralising powers to commission services should instead be devolved to the probation trusts. The Government&#146;s argument throughout has been to say to me, &#147;Don&#146;t worry, we are closer than you think. In practice, the majority of services will be commissioned locally&#148;. Last week, suddenly we heard from speaker after speaker on the Benches opposite, behind the Minister, the argument that if my amendment were passed nothing would change and that the local trusts cannot be trusted to deliver commissioning on the contestability basis to private companies and the voluntary sector.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07070336000003"></a>Clarity was there none. It is absolutely important, as the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, suggests, to give the new Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor the opportunity to look again and find the clarity that the public deserve. I support the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham.</p>

I agree with my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham and other speakers that unless we get that right there will be real difficulty for the service. However, I have a quite different view of where we are. I could be wrong and no doubt my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham will put me right in his response and the Minister may clarify for me where I think I stand, but I simply do not see us in the uncharted waters that everyone else is trying to show. </p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="07070336000005"></a>The framework of probation will be the same. I would have liked to see more radical reform, as noble Lords will know, not because I am a great one for change&#151;I have argued significantly against some of the health service and social services changes that have gone on and on and left the services in great disarray&#151;but I argue for this change because I believe that out there the probation services are in the middle of it and, having worked for most of my life in change management with organisations, I know that that is nearly the worst position we could continue to leave the probation services in.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07070336000006"></a>Not only is the framework of probation pretty much the same, I think that we have a clear rationale which, as I understand it in relation to the services in the voluntary sector in which I work that touch the probation sector, is trying to find new ways of intervening. I have heard lots of discussion during this debate about those interventions perhaps not being as &#147;high-class&#148; as others. The services that I have worked with have been exceptional, with highly trained workers intervening in a way that has set the standard for other probation services. If we had that kind of service we would see greater innovation and greater development. Of course I have the same fears as others about whether large companies will come in and undercut my services. Therefore, I ask the noble Baroness yet again to reassure us that what will count will be the quality and not low cost.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07070336000007"></a>The commissioning element is all that is really different. There are other small changes in the Bill but its central core is this commissioning element. I have said this before, but I am surprised that the Conservative Benches are not pressing this forward and that they do not see that commissioning and contestability are a way forward in changing and improving skills. They widen the scope of the skill set. At the moment the changes are proceeding at a very conservative pace. On the ground, services are being told that they cannot have the three-year contracts, which they thought they could have, because of the uncertainty. If we delay again, that uncertainty will go on, not just for the probation services, but for all the local voluntary services that are trying to deliver different but quality services on the ground. These groups are not huge. The one I know best, the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, is not a huge organisation; it is a specialist foundation. The circles, working with the Quakers, are small organisations. They have managed to hold their positions, and they will do even better if in future they are more able to get their contracts.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07070336000008"></a>In my view, the one thing probation does not need is yet another period of uncertainty; but it needs clear knowledge about how to move forward. I am quite sure that my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham will say  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_942"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 942</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that clarity is the one thing that is lacking. But I think that on the ground there is room to move forward. What we do not want is rigidity. We have got to get this right, but to get it right we have got to get on with it. We should not change for the sake of change but this is marginal change. Let us make sure that we do move forward, that we remove the uncertainty, build better services for the future, and, by improving services that stop offenders reoffending, make our country safer.</p>

I say straightaway that I too have been in a very privileged position. From this Dispatch Box I have expressed the views in relation to this matter of the previous Home Secretary John Reid and before him my right honourable friend Charles Clarke, the former Lord Chancellor, my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer, and now my right honourable friend Jack Straw as the new Secretary of State responsible for justice and the new Lord Chancellor. The last three have one thing in common: they all agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, that we must now get on with this and delay will not inure to anyone's benefit.</p>

The construct put forward by her on behalf of her party is, I respectfully suggest, one of no change. However, no change will not give voice to the needs both of the victims and the offenders, who demand that we change in order better to address the needs that they each have.</p>

Of course we have listened very carefully indeed to the debate that has gone on throughout the whole passage of the Bill. I recognise the genuine desire of those who have spoken to ensure that we have the best possible set of provisions. We all want to see a strong, confident and effective Probation Service able to play its full part in reducing reoffending and protecting the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="07070336000012"></a>I understand the anxiety that the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, has so cogently expressed in terms of the different tensions in this situation, but what is less clear to me is how this amendment will assist. I am puzzled about why the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, thinks that the addition of a further stage in the parliamentary process and the accompanying delay and uncertainty is necessary or how that uncertainty and delay would further inure to the benefit of those we all purport to serve. The import of what the noble Lord was saying was, &#147;Postpone this Bill and all its parts. Consider afresh again whether all or any of its contents need to be embarked on at all&#148;. Some noble Lords might say that what he is saying is &#147;Rip it up, put it in the bin and start again&#148;. That would not do justice to the hard work and dedication of all the sectors who have now engaged with such energy in making this change

I respectfully remind the House that it is not for nothing that the CBI, ACEVO and many others have said that they wish to see these provisions on the statute book.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07070336000013"></a>I was grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, for identifying the smaller organisations involved. The Lucy Faithfull Foundation is a specialist organisation, but it is not a large organisation. Circles of Support and Accountability, which is an effective organisation, is not large. Clinks, which, as I mentioned to your Lordships last time, is leading the work on how we can get smaller organisations better supported, is not a large organisation. Those organisations need continuity, and commissioning would enable them to have that.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07070336000014"></a>Perhaps this amendment is inspired by a sense that the Government have rushed these proposals and that a period of reflection is necessary. But if we look at the history of the Bill, we can see how it has changed, developed and deepened in the understanding of what is necessary. This policy has been evolving and in the public domain since December 2003. I know that some in this House think that it should go as slowly as the public sector reform that is contemplated in relation to civil servants for which we have had to wait for more than a hundred years, but I think that we can go little more quickly. We can hardly be accused of having rushed these changes.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07070336000015"></a>The amendment would require certain documents to be prepared and laid before the House. There is concern therefore that there will be insufficient opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny of these proposals. But I respectfully say that that can hardly be the case either. This is a modest-sized Bill&#151;just 34 clauses and five, mainly technical, schedules when it was first introduced. Yet in your Lordships&#146; House alone we have had six Sittings in Committee. Indeed, at the outset of Committee, our scrutiny was so considered and detailed that we were progressing at the rate of roughly one clause per Sitting.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="07070336000016"></a>I am sure that noble Lords would also agree that my noble friend Lord Bassam and I, with the full support of our colleagues at the Ministry of Justice, have gone out of our way to be very full in our responses to points raised, both on the Floor of the House and in the written material that we have regularly circulated outside. Where appropriate, those responses have extended to agreeing to amend the Bill itself. We have done a lot of good work in that regard with the valid contribution from all Members who have taken part, but I cannot see that further scrutiny is needed or what purpose it would serve.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="07070336000017"></a>Perhaps there has been insufficient opportunity for those outside Parliament to have their say. Your Lordships have had the advantage of hearing from many of those who made a contribution. The preponderance of that comment has been supportive of this Bill. The evidence is that the service is committed to change. As I mentioned in Committee, two-thirds of those boards eligible to apply for trust status in April 2008 expressed interest in being considered. The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, is right when she says that they want to get on with this. That makes 22 areas in which 13 have been invited to  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_944"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 944</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>apply to become a trust in the first wave. The applications are due to be returned by the 13th of this month. Any further delay and uncertainty risks undermining the plans for implementation and will have an adverse effect on the morale and serviceability to prepare for the future. I am sure that the House will agree that that cannot be in anyone's interests.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07070336000018"></a>I reassure the House that there is no basis for thinking that if there were a postponement significant or material change is likely. The Government's commitment to the provisions in the Bill remains undiminished either by the machinery of government changes on 9 May or the ministerial changes of last week. Once the parliamentary process has run its proper course, there can be no justification for or advantage in further prevarication. The Bill was on the agenda before the last election. We committed ourselves to bringing proposals forward once we were re-elected and that is what we are doing. It is a part of the democratic process which has integrity. I therefore invite the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, to withdraw his amendment and allow us to proceed in the normal way, confident that he has made a material contribution to the way that this Bill will leave this House.</p>

In particular, I thank the noble and learned Baroness the Attorney-General for the way she responded. She will not be surprised to hear me say that in the very first of my remarks I said that this was no attempt to kill the Bill. Never, throughout all our deliberations, have we had any intention of killing it, stopping it or being against change. One of my frustrations when I was Chief Inspector of Prisons was the number of recommendations for change that I put forward&#151;some 2,800 over the time of which only 70 were picked up.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07070336000020"></a>The noble and learned Baroness mentioned that this Bill first appeared in December 2003. That is when the problems started. At that stage, the Government clearly listened to the advice of the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, and rushed ahead with change without thinking. Because they rushed ahead and announced things without discussion, we have had this long drawn out period of uncertainty and retrenchment. Is the Probation Service national, regional or whatever? Will the services be united and merged? What is happening to the regional offender managers who have been in position for three years without budgets and so forth? This uncertainty spread because, right at the start, there was no consideration.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07070336000021"></a>I am not seeking to delay the Bill just to delay it. I am saying that, while this Bill has come within the context of the criminal justice system, other Bills have been launched and other proposals have been made. Other studies have happened that have an impact on it. Therefore, it is incomplete in context in terms of the criminal justice system and the way that offenders are managed. Unless offenders are managed properly, we will not get what we all require&#151;the rehabilitation of offenders and protection of the public. Nobody

Nobody is more concerned about the lack of morale and the uncertainty that exists in the services today. I was at a conference this morning listening to deeply disturbed members of the voluntary sector who do not know what is happening. Last Friday I was with the Probation Service and others in Newcastle where people were very disturbed about the lack of clear direction.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07070336000022"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said that the framework is the same. It is not the same. The headquarters of the National Probation Service has disappeared and the leader of the service is subsumed into a department in the National Offender Management Service. It is not the same. There is not an organisation that can drive change.</p>

<a name="70703-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07070336000023"></a>All I am saying is that to achieve the change that we all want, it behoves the Government to see whether, in the light of all the other things that are going on, it would be sensible to ensure that everything is taken into account, rather than rushing off in one direction. I am sure that the noble and learned Baroness will not be surprised that I therefore wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

It would remove a clause which has long needed to be reviewed. When we originally looked at the whole idea of private sector prisons in 1991, it was decided that there

<a name="70703-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07070336000030"></a>When I was chief inspector, I was often conscious that the relationship between the director of the prison&#151;in many cases, someone who had been a governor of a public sector prison&#151;and the controller was difficult because of one particular factor, which was that in the 1991 Act it was agreed that one activity should remain in the hands of the public sector: the adjudication of prisoners. That was because adjudication involved punishment, which was the responsibility of the state. I do not believe that has changed; nor do I believe that any suggestion that the requirement for controllers who are, in effect, contract monitors in private sector prisons has gone. In some of the reports of my successor as chief inspector, she says that she has been concerned about the number of times that private sector companies have been tempted to fudge figures to appear to comply with contracts and not be liable to sanctions. In the treatment of offenders, that simply must not be tolerated.</p>

<a name="70703-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07070336000031"></a>What does not appear in the Bill is the suggestion, which I hope the noble and learned Baroness the Attorney-General will be able to comment on, that there are two public sector monitors in each private sector prison at present. The number will allegedly be cut to one because it is assumed that adjudication takes a day&#151;it does not. Also, if done properly, contract monitoring takes more than one monitor. Therefore, rather than try to play around with words, it is appropriate to remove this clause and leave the status quo: leave the state responsible for punishment and leave contract monitors in place to fulfil their role of supervising what is done on the public&#146;s behalf by the private sector. I beg to move.</p>

Memories of our debates in 1991 were so sharp and poignant when I heard what was being proposed in Clause 19 that I felt I had to come, reluctantly, to your Lordships&#146; House to express my dismay.</p>

<a name="70703-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07070336000033"></a>As I recall, the support of wavering Conservative Peers like myself was solicited by the Government of the day&#151;and by their Home Office spokesman the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, whom we all hope to see back with us before too long&#151;for the proposal that two pairs of eyes from the public sector would see what was going on and that things that should not be known in public were not being done in secret. The focus of this concern was adjudication&#151;how fair and appropriate their punishments were to the people concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07070336000034"></a>When you take freedom from a citizen, you assume a terrible responsibility. When you take it from more than 80,000 prisoners, it becomes enormous. When a significant proportion of those are handed over to an organisation other than the state it becomes necessary to retain some hold on what is done. As I understand it, Clause 19, by transferring the right of adjudication to a governor, makes the monitor no longer necessary for the functioning of the prison. The monitor is

This reminds me of what the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said a moment ago about the danger of figure-fudging. Contractors have targets to meet&#151;haven&#146;t we all these days?&#151;otherwise they are in breach of their contract. Therefore, it is very important that the statistics, which reveal the performance against the target, are managed suitably for the contractor. In other words, there is a strong conflict of interest between the interest of the state in fairness and the interest of the contractor in profit. That may be an odd sentiment to express from the Conservative Benches, but we are dealing with matters of principle, and I believe that this House consented to this form of prison on the principle that there should be representatives of the public sector in it to act as referees and whistleblowers, and to protect the defenceless against injustice where the private sector was clearly motivated on occasion to commit injustice. For those reasons, I wholly support the amendment.</p>

I had the privilege of representing prison officers in Parliament for some years, and I visited many prisons, so I have had experience of the nature of prisons and the prison environment. I also have a deep respect for the dedication of prison officers and prison governors. The background against which the existing legislation was made is very interesting. I draw attention particularly to punishment being the responsibility of the state. In that context, although many things can be parcelled out, privatised or sub-divided, ultimately&#151;I am grateful for what the noble Lord, Lord Elton, said about his memory of the atmosphere and the intention at the time&#151;the Minister should be obliged to tell us where this is coming from.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07070336000036"></a>What consultation has there been, particularly with the Prison Officers&#146; Association and the Prison Governors Association? I would like to hear not only that there has been consultation with those two bodies but that they approve of the intention behind the clause. I do not think that they do; in which case, what is being gained? More than once, the Attorney-General has stressed that this is not driven by efficiency savings but is designed to make the system more efficient. How much more efficient would the system be if we were told that prison governors are burdened and that, in the absence of the clause, they would continue to have the responsibility to adjudicate; indeed, that they were screaming blue murder because of the weight on them? Whom have the Attorney-General and her advisers consulted? Someone told me that they had taken the views of the CBI. The Attorney-General can deny that&#151;indeed, I hope that she will be able to do so&#151;but I would be very worried if the views of industry were to reign over those of the people at the sharp end.</p>

We know that many people in prison should not be there, but a great many others should be and are determined to make the lives of other inmates bad. I was once asked at Wakefield prison to peep through the window in the door to the cell of a man who had murdered two prisoners while in prison. That is the kind of person with whom we are dealing. Prison officers are prisoners just as much as prisoners themselves, because they are locked in the prison estate and have a terrible job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="07070336000038"></a>On equity, it is eminently right to say that the persistence of the clause is a condemnation of the present situation, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Elton, said, was built 16 years ago on the foundation of a major step&#151;the introduction of privatisation into the prison estate&#151;about which many of us still have questions. It is, however, now a fact of life, and I hope that the Attorney-General can satisfy the House that the alarm bells are ringing without reason. If she cannot, however, I very much hope that she will say something to allay my concerns about being party to a situation about which I am not very happy.</p>

As an occasional but regular visitor to prisons, the prisons with which I have been most impressed, certainly in the past 10 years, have been private and have been of great benefit to the system as a whole. However, the atmosphere in a prison can very easily become difficult for both prisoners and staff, so the principle of a co-operative regime, particularly when sensitive issues such as punishment arise, is a good one. Even in private prisons, the principle of the involvement of state officials in the punishment of those who are in prison is at least to be considered and quite possibly insisted on.</p>

Indeed, I may have misunderstood it. If I have, it will become painfully obvious in the next couple of minutes. As I understand it, the clause intends that the director of a private sector prison should be in much the same position as a governor of a public sector prison when it comes to disciplinary issues, and that is what is objected to and what the amendment seeks to remove. If I have got that part of the amendment right, surely a director of a private sector prison would have to work basically under the same instructions and rules as a governor of a public sector prison would in exercising such powers. Presumably the training requirements would therefore be similar to ensure that the individuals concerned were competent to exercise these responsibilities. Presumably, then, this is almost a professional question of being able to exercise these powers appropriately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="07070336000041"></a>I also understand that private sector prisons are not exactly divorced from inspections. They are still subject to them, and must operate under the terms of a contract and in a particular manner. If they fail to do so, they leave themselves open to challenge. If my understanding of the position is basically right&#151;it may turn out to be wrong&#151;I really do not see what

I should make it clear that this debate is not about whether private prisons are a good thing, whether they are value for money or whether they should be more publicly accountable. It is, as the noble Lord, Lord Elton, said, about the propriety of suggesting that the power of punishing prisoners should be handed to a non-state agent, and about the possibility that handing this power to the director of a private prison will lead to conflicts of interest, whether actual or perceived. Justice must be done and seen to be done. If the procedures are not seen to be fair and legitimate, the state of a prison will suffer because of the unhappiness of the prisoners and the way in which they feel they are treated.</p>

<a name="70703-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07070336000043"></a>I remind the House that the punishments available for prison directors to impose after adjudication are substantial. Directors may no longer add days to a prisoner&#146;s sentence&#151;that has to be done by a visiting magistrate and applies to the more serious offences. However, prison directors can confine prisoners to their cells for 21 days; exclude them from work so that they get no wages for up to 21 days; stop their earnings or make deductions from their earnings for up to 84 days; remove them to segregation for up to 28 days; and institute forfeiture of any privileges under rule 8 for up to 42 days.</p>

<a name="70703-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07070336000044"></a>The significance of that is that prisoners can be demoted on the incentives and earned-privileges scheme and so may have their entitlement to visits from their families reduced. Furthermore, the imposition of those punishments can have wider implications for prisoners. The power to reduce family visits affects Article 8 of the ECHR, on the right to family life, as given effect to by the Human Rights Act. The frequency and level of punishments given in an institution will go on parole reports and will affect whether prisoners receive parole. The Parole Board takes those matters into account when deciding whether it is safe to release prisoners; therefore, there is an effect on the right to liberty.</p>

<a name="70703-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07070336000045"></a>Directors of private prisons are in a difficult and very different position from a public prison governor. They have to take account of the requirements of their employers&#151;that is, the company, which is usually far from the day-to-day concerns of the prison&#151;the requirements of the contract and the need to avoid fines and penalties that such prisons attract if they fail to carry out the contract. It also puts the private prison director under strong pressure and would make it very difficult for even the most well trained and longstanding prison director to be seen to operate fairly and without being accused of conflicts of interest. It seems to me that private prison directors would not want to be put in that position, and this House certainly should not allow that to happen.</p>

I have been approached by the Prison Governors Association, the Prison Reform Trust and the Prison Officers&#146; Association on this, and they all support the amendment. Very often, when the Prison Officers&#146; Association is mentioned one thinks only of state prisons, but it also has members in private prisons. I do not want to  repeat what others have said, but I support the amendment.</p>

An underlying principle, which we should not cross, is at stake. This is not a criticism of private prisons. We are all conscious that, on the whole, the introduction of private prisons has had a beneficial effect on prisons in this country. Next week, I am to visit a prison whose reputation is among the best of the private prisons in this country.</p>

<a name="70703-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07070336000048"></a>The principle at stake is the relationship between the state and the private sector: the proper management of public/private partnerships. The state should have the monopoly of force, and punishment is a use of force. Earlier, I spoke about the difference between the American model of privatisation and the Nordic model of a mixed economy of public/private partnerships. In the United States, they are very relaxed about private contractors carrying guns: mercenaries operating on behalf of the state. We are not happy with that. The state should retain the monopoly of force. If we cross that line we enter a very different world.</p>

<a name="70703-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07070336000049"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, said, there are potential conflicts of interest. The lines of authority and accountability of a private prison governor and his unavoidable concept of role and responsibility are, to some extent, necessarily different from that of a governor of a state prison. That is in the nature of a public/private partnership and, therefore, it is entirely appropriate that proper tension between the public and the private sectors should be built into the system. The amendment would retain that; Clause 19 would cross that line.</p>

I shall be interested to hear how my noble and learned friend replies. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, has just made a comparison with the United States, which has a more relaxed attitude towards private contractors carrying guns and the rest. That is about security; in the prison system, we are talking about justice. The amendment raises the issue of whether we want a system in which justice is operated by people with a commercial interest in the operation. I make no criticism&#151;I have no ground for making any&#151;of any director of a private prison at the moment, but a crucial principle arises about justice: how it should operate and how it can convincingly be seen to operate, as has already been said. My noble and learned friend should not dismiss the amendment lightly. In view of her new responsibilities, I shall be interested to hear how she deals with the point about justice.</p>

I want to clear up a few points as there may have been some misunderstanding.</p>

<a name="70703-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07070336000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Elton, is concerned that we are removing the role of the controller, as a third pair of eyes, from the process. I can reassure him that we are not doing that. Controllers will no longer conduct adjudications, but will still monitor the conduct of them by private prison staff; for example, they can even attend individual adjudications if they want to. That is not changing. We agree with him on the need for that scrutiny to be maintained.</p>

<a name="70703-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07070336000053"></a>The consultation process was raised by my noble friend Lord Graham. I know how seriously he addresses the issue. I can reassure him that we have consulted the Prison Governors Association and there has been further consultation with contractors and existing controllers. Plans have been developed in discussion with the public sector Prison Service to ensure parity with its procedures. My noble friend Lord Rosser was correct in the premise that he made about the way in which we seek to deal with the matter. These are sensitive issues. I assure the House that the Government recognise that sensitivity and the nature of the changes contemplated in the clause.</p>

<a name="70703-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07070336000054"></a>We are also aware of the need to ensure the proper and fair treatment of prisoners, as I made plain. With that in mind, we have taken careful measures to ensure that our approach is balanced by appropriate and robust safeguards. The powers proposed to be transferred by the clause are essential tools for governors in public sector prisons, used to maintain order, control and discipline. As part of our clearly expressed desire to ensure parity of performance between the public and private sectors, we feel that this is precisely the right time to extend the powers, so that they apply equally in private prisons. Specifically, the changes proposed will enable directors to be fully responsible for order and control within their establishments. Controllers, who currently undertake the task on behalf of directors, will then be freed up to spend more time monitoring the quality and value of the service provided by the contractor. Consequently, the change will ensure that the disciplinary system in private prisons operates as speedily and effectively as possible, but also that better oversight of the whole range of services is being delivered by the contractor. This will, I hope, bring real benefits to prisons and prisoners generally, and to the public, with better value for money.</p>

<a name="70703-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07070336000055"></a>I was much encouraged by what the right reverend Prelate said, because in his capacity he has had the advantage of going into a number of prisons, both public and private. His experience of a number of private-sector prisons reflects that of the noble Lords, Lord Elton and Lord Ramsbotham, and others.</p>

<a name="70703-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07070336000056"></a>The powers are already highly regulated by secondary legislation&#151;not least the prison rules and the detailed instructions in the <I>Prison Discipline Manual</I> and Her Majesty&#146;s Prison Service standards,  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_954"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 954</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which private prisons are, respectively, statutorily and contractually bound to follow, so that they exactly reflect those that apply in public sector prisons. We are simply creating a parity of powers between directors and governors&#151;neither will have any greater freedom than the other as they perform identical tasks. That is why my noble friend Lord Rosser was right.</p>

<a name="70703-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07070336000057"></a>We are also going to require contractually that, before directors can adjudicate, they must have passed the equivalent training course as their public sector colleagues. I know that this is a matter of complaint but, as most directors are ex-Her Majesty&#146;s Prison Service governors anyway, they are already likely to be very experienced in the task. My noble friend Lady Gibson has complained about the number of private prisons that have&#151;some would say&#151;purloined for the private sector some of the best from Her Majesty&#146;s Prison Service. That is always an issue of tension. However, the controller will ensure that the rules that apply to one are adhered to by the other.</p>

<a name="70703-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07070336000058"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, is right about a strong safeguard, which already exists, in cases of a disciplinary offence that may result in the award of additional days. The requirement, under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, is that such cases must be dealt with by an independent adjudicator rather than by the government controller, in both public and private sector prisons. This proposal does nothing to alter that. My noble friend Lord Judd asked me about my new role conjoined with my old role and my thoughts on that. I hope that he will be content that I believe that we are being consistent. This proposal does not in any way alter that. Such a safeguard was not in place in 1991, when controllers were first introduced. That would have been of concern to the noble Lord, Lord Elton&#151;that controllers were going to be adjudicating on issues where there might be a positive punishment&#151;but we do not have that difficulty now.</p>

<a name="70703-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07070336000059"></a>Some are also concerned that a director&#146;s impartiality would be jeopardised by commercial considerations, as we heard today. There is, however, no evidence in how they use their existing powers to support that. The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, rightly referred to perceptions, as opposed to the reality. But there is no evidence on which that perception can justifiably be found. Most notably, the incentive schemes, which often reward good behaviour, are much more imaginative than those in the public sector. However, even if a director were minded to adopt a commercial approach, the requirements of the <I>Prison </I><I>Discipline Manual</I>, the detailed procedures to be followed, the route of appeal, plus scrutiny from the controller, the IMB, the inspectorate and the ombudsman surely offer us all some reassurance that they would be immediately detected.</p>

<a name="70703-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07070336000060"></a>The powers of segregation and control are already available to directors in an emergency, when they simply seek retrospective approval by the controller. The clause will simply enable those existing powers to be exercised by the director acting alone, even where there is no emergency. There is no evidence whatever to suggest that directors have misused the existing  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_955"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 955</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>powers since the first private prison opened in 1992. Indeed, private prisons have been credited with a key role in improving decent treatment and the conditions of prisoners in both the public and private sectors over the past 10 years. Such a view is not my own, I hasten to add, but comes from no less a source than Martin Narey, the former director-general of Her Majesty&#146;s Prison Service.</p>

<a name="70703-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07070336000061"></a>I also urge the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, to reflect on his own decision, when Chief Inspector of Prisons, to tackle the press about their inaccurate portrayal of the privately owned and operated HMP Doncaster. He may recall that at the time he was so impressed on an inspection by the capability of the director and staff that he personally intervened to demand that the press recognise the excellent practice to be found at the prison. It must have had quite an effect on him, because as recently as January, at the Conservative evidence session for the Bill, he described HMP Doncaster as:</p>
<ul><a name="07070336000074"></a>&#147;a frightfully well-run prison ... staff had extremely good relationships with the prisoners and the organisation running it had done all sorts of imaginative things with education...work...and so on, which weren&#146;t happening in the public sector. And when I asked the Governor why he was doing this, which conflicted with what I&#146;d seen of prisons in the public sector, he said he&#146;s not allowed to do it in the public sector prison&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70703-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07070336000062"></a>I use not my words but those of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, to reassure the House that this is not something that we need to be frightened of. I will not pretend that private-sector performance is always excellent. There have been recent problems at Her Majesty&#146;s Prison in Rye Hill, for example, which the inspectorate has reported on and were the subject of the &#147;Panorama&#148; TV programme. My point is that similar problems occur in some public sector prison as well. Good or poor practice is not the sole preserve of one sector or the other. If further evidence of the quality of private prisons is needed, I would invite your Lordships to attend to the most recent prison performance ratings, published by the National Offender Management Service, which shows that eight of the 11 private prisons are rated at level 3 or above on the four-band system. This is a ratio that compares well with the public sector. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, has previously described private prisons as models of what prisons should be like.</p>

<a name="70703-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07070336000063"></a>That is a lot of reinforcement of what I hope is a safe and satisfactory move forwards. Restrictions may have been prudent when private prisons were first introduced; I believe that they were. However, considering the good operating record of the private sector since then, we believe that they are no longer justified. Finally, some would argue that these tasks are essentially functions of the state. That was said by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, and others. The arguments around the propriety of imprisonment being conducted by private companies were debated at length in 1991 and we all know the outcome. To rehearse them again now is perhaps unnecessary.</p>

<a name="70703-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07070336000064"></a>In conclusion, we have seen over time a great deal of evidence which reassures us that what we are doing is not a step too far. I hope that the House will feel that the safeguards I have outlined in some detail,

The proposals are safe and, I suggest, a logical next step in balancing the procedures between public and private sector prisons to the ultimate benefit of both prisoners and the general public. Further, for the avoidance of doubt, the term &#147;prison&#148; in relation to this clause also applies to young offender institutions, although at present no YOIs are being run privately. On that basis, I hope that noble Lords will feel that this is not such an avant garde move as they might initially have feared.</p>

To suggest that this will remove all benefits in transfer, however, would not be accurate. So there is

Noble Lords have considered every aspect of this problem in their contributions. It all comes back to the question of justice and punishment, and who is responsible for delivering it. With respect to the noble Baroness, I do remember all that I said about Doncaster, which at the time was being called &#147;Doncatraz&#148;, although it certainly was not. I also remember saying things about other prisons, including Altcourse, Blakenhurst and others which were doing extremely well. But with respect, that was not the point. It was not about adjudications, but about the way the prison was being run: the treatment of and conditions for prisoners on which I was required to report. I gave examples of why it was better, and I was intrigued about what was said about doing things which the private sector could do but the public sector could not. Personally, I think that this remains one of the issues which the public sector should keep a rein on.</p>

I hope that by raising this issue in that context, that this is another of the issues which will be looked at very carefully when the Bill is considered to see whether it needs to be strengthened and improved. I should like to withdraw the amendment at this stage, with the possibility of bringing it back at Third Reading. By then I will have seen the note. I say that because you cannot carry out the oversight we all would like to see if the number of controllers is reduced. With that proviso, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We recognise that there are times when both prison staff and those from external agencies may need to take certain otherwise prohibited articles into or out of prisons in order to carry out essential duties. The prohibited items are broken down into three clear bands grouped according to seriousness. While the legislation as currently drafted permits authorisation to be granted by the Secretary of State or by Prison Rules for lists B and C, only the Secretary of State can grant authorisation for list A items. The amendment seeks to allow authorisation to be granted for list A items by Prison Rules. As noble Lords will be aware,

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07070346000009"></a>Since 2003, boards of visitors have been known as independent monitoring boards, a title that more  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_959"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 959</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>accurately reflects their role as monitors and emphasises their independent status. Some 1,800 board members&#151;unpaid volunteers&#151;appointed from the local community visit their designated establishments on a regular basis to monitor the care and treatment of those held in prison. Their commitment to this difficult, vital and highly responsible role is quite inspiring. When I was the Minister responsible for offender management and, therefore, prisons, I had the privilege of meeting a number of board members and I have never failed to be deeply impressed by their commitment and energy.</p>

<a name="70703-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07070346000010"></a>The amendments give statutory effect to two important changes recommended by a working group established in 2000 under the chairmanship of Sir Peter Lloyd, to review boards of visitors. These recommendations were, essentially, as follows: first, to change the title &#147;board of visitors&#148; to &#147;independent monitoring board&#148; more accurately to reflect the role and functions of these bodies; and, secondly, to remove the statutory requirement that at least two members of the board needed to be magistrates.</p>

<a name="70703-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07070346000011"></a>For the avoidance of any doubt, let me make it clear that the removal of the requirement for at least two members of a board to be magistrates is in no way intended to erode the significant contribution that magistrates make to the work of boards. The Government fully accept that justices of the peace bring valuable experience and knowledge to the role of board members. The clause seeks only to remove a requirement that was introduced when magistrates had an adjudicatory function in prisons. That function was removed some 15 years ago and the requirement is therefore now obsolete. Magistrates will continue to be welcome on boards as members of the local community. All the amendment does is to ensure that the boards are not required to select a magistrate in preference to another applicant who may be better suited to IMB work and who can bring special knowledge and skills of which the board is in short supply.</p>

<a name="70703-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07070346000012"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, for proposing the amendment. I hope this version will receive her support and the support of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07070346000013"></a>I understand that the Magistrates&#146; Association was a little concerned about these issues. The boards have many excellent magistrate members, as I have indicated, and I am delighted that the Magistrates&#146; Association regards continued involvement in this area of work as a worthwhile activity for its members. I know that Sir Peter Lloyd, who is president of the National Council of Independent Monitoring Boards, has been in contact with the Magistrates&#146; Association to explain the difficulties with the current requirement and how it does little to help the many magistrates who are well suited to board work and make successful applications for places. The Government share Sir Peter&#146;s view that magistrates can bring valuable knowledge and skills to the boards. Applicants from the magistracy will always be welcome, especially those whose background and experience would help to make boards more diverse. I understand that Sir Peter has already invited the Magistrates&#146; Association to liaise with the IMB

She will know that when I saw the drafting of the Government&#146;s amendment I immediately contacted the Magistrates&#146; Association, as is my custom in these matters, simply to check that it was content and had been consulted. There were concerns that perhaps there had been an unintentional slip between the two sides and that, as a result, there was a misunderstanding that an agreement had been reached that had not been reached with the magistrates. I am delighted that the Government have taken prompt action and that Sir Peter Lloyd has ensured that the correct information has been made available to both parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07070346000016"></a>I heard the noble and learned Baroness say that the magistrates now regard their continued activity as valuable. They always thought it was vital to the work of the independent monitoring boards. Their original concern was simply that their right to have two places was being removed. I appreciate the way in which the noble and learned Baroness has made it clear that  Sir Peter Lloyd welcomes wholeheartedly&#151;and, indeed, encourages&#151;applications from magistrates, particularly from those whose background and experience would help to make boards more diverse. It is on the basis of the way in which the noble and learned Baroness has put her case that I am able to support the amendment today.</p>

<a name="70703-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07070346000022"></a>This issue was raised by my noble friend Lord Low in Committee and we were not satisfied with the Government&#146;s answer that they would bring back disability legislation by making provision through Prison Service orders. On reflection, we do not think that that is satisfactory. There is a similarity here to what happened with the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill when the noble and learned Baroness described it as a brave move by the Government that Crown immunity was dropped for certain activities. When I inspected Her Majesty&#146;s Prison Frankland in Durham I discovered to my horror a disabled man confined to the healthcare centre because he was wheelchair borne. Frankland was a new prison. I had seen the plans for Frankland, which included provision for disabled people to get around, including those in wheelchairs, but they were not included in the final build. When I questioned the Prison Service about this, I was told that because of Crown immunity the service was not required to conform to the disability legislation and had therefore excluded them. The man was denied access to work, education and everything else because of his disability, as he could not get out of the healthcare centre.</p>

<a name="70703-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07070346000023"></a>Therefore, in the spirit of lifting Crown immunity in the context of the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill, it is perhaps right to look at all the other aspects of this sort of legislation, including disability, where Crown immunity has previously been prayed in evidence. It was, for  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_962"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 962</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>example, prayed in aid as a reason why the conditions of the Children Act should not apply to prisons until that was overturned by judicial review.</p>

<a name="70703-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07070346000024"></a>The background to the amendment is explained clearly by what is required by the Disability Rights Commission, which is that there should be a disability equality scheme in every public place. There are already requirements on probation boards, schools, NHS trusts, passenger transport executives and many other public sector bodies to produce such a scheme. The Prison Service has one, but it is not one of its own; it is an adjunct of the Home Office disability equality scheme, and it applies only to staff, not to prisoners. That is not acceptable. The Prison Service must have a scheme of its own, applying to both prisoners and staff. In the context of lifting Crown immunity, the disability regulations must apply. A Prison Service order is not good enough. An explicit duty must be laid on the Prison Service, quite separate from anything connected with its sponsoring department.</p>

<a name="70703-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07070346000025"></a>That is the purpose behind the amendment. The current treatment of disabled people in prison is not adequate for a whole range of disabilities, as has been mentioned many times. Merely putting a requirement in a Prison Service order does not add any urgency to the requirement to put the situation right, but I believe a duty would. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Lords, Lord Low and Lord Ramsbotham, who did a very good job of bringing forward the amendment, have a very good point here. The prison population has a high number of disabled people, who are mainly unidentified.</p>

<a name="70703-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07070346000027"></a>My interest in dyslexia is probably fairly well established in this House. The number of undiagnosed dyslexics in the prison population is unacceptably high; the only question is how high. I have seen work recently that identifies them as being roughly 50 per cent of the prison population. The same study, at Chelmsford prison, which did a good job of identifying people who were avoiding education and thus not taking themselves forward, was also identifying a lot of people with similar types of problems due to head injury. The biggest problem they had was short-term memory loss, which tends to lead to language function loss and so on, which means bad organisation. Where that was identified and dealt with, the knock-on effects were surprising. One of them, I was told by a prison officer I spoke to, was that the number of assaults had decreased dramatically, because the amount of defensiveness among a large part of the prison population had dropped. Consequently, so had the touchiness and the number of flare-ups. I asked the prison governor how many people it took to deal with one assault. He said it took about nine people for half a day. The cost implications of getting a duty that allows you to take action, and which is suited to the environment, have to be massive. Why are we not introducing such a duty here?</p>

But disability runs across all sections of society. Unfortunately, certain groups in society have a slightly higher propensity to commit crime, according to the statistics. If you can identify them you stand a chance of breaking the offender cycle, before middle age basically knocks it out of them and you are left with an almost unemployable person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07070346000029"></a>This type of duty stands a chance of being able to deal with the situation. It is absurd, given the amount of time and effort we have put into getting legislation, that groups with more obvious disabilities, such as being in a wheelchair, should be excluded from the equality duty. We are not saying that they should be allowed out of prison earlier or that they should not be sent there in the first place, but merely that, once they are there, reasonable adjustment should be made for their situation. Surely the Government should embrace that. They have resisted it in the past, but I hope they are starting to think more coherently about the problem.</p>

I served on the board of visitors of a young offender institution, now a monitoring board, for 27 years. During that time I was often given disabled inmates. They had all sorts of disabilities; I remember two severely deaf boys, blind inmates, people who had cerebral palsy, and of course there were those with mental health problems&#151;they are in every single prison in the country. Also, sadly, we had one young man who had asthma. He told the prison officers that he thought he was going to die, and they did not believe him. The young man died. It was tragic; he was a young lad of 17.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="07070356000007"></a>I have visited many different prisons and young offender institutions. Like my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham, I once visited HMYOI Onley, but for a different reason: the institution was running a project where the young men were helping young people with mental problems who came in and used their gym. That was very good, because they were doing something to help other people. That, I feel, is rehabilitation.</p>

<a name="70703-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07070356000008"></a>At that institution was a young man who was paraplegic. He had committed a serious offence. He was housed in the hospital wing because of space, but the prison officers wanted to integrate him on a wing. He wrote to me and rang me because he was desperate. He was put in a cell but could not turn his wheelchair because the room was too narrow. In the end, he had to go back to the hospital wing, because there is always more space there, but the people there are not integrated into the whole prison. A lot should be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="07070356000009"></a>I am a member of the All-Party Group on Prison Health here in Parliament. We look at health problems and visit various prisons. Last year, we went to Leeds prison, which has become a sort of dumping ground for disabled people for the north of England because it has some facilities for them. That prison had a tetraplegic&#151;someone paralysed from the neck down&#151;who also had a problem with his leg, and he had MRSA. There were many other prisoners with different disabilities who were causing the prison a lot

They needed a special bed for the tetraplegic inmate, and they had managed to get one. Maybe, now that the NHS is looking after health problems in prisons, the situation will get better, but disability is often right down at the bottom of the list. When I served in the Yorkshire health region, I was always having to remind people about disability needs: people forget. Provision in the Bill is therefore necessary.</p>

As we know, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 gave the DRC the right to be consulted on additions to the specific disability equality duties, so it is important that it is in favour of the amendment. The Prison Reform Trust and Diabetes UK have reported cases of hypoglycaemia being treated as a disciplinary issue. I do not have my noble friend&#146;s experience of prisons, but as a member of the murder and life imprisonment inquiry in 1989 I visited a few prisons. My noble friend Lord Ramsbotham said that the existing Prison Service disability equality scheme covers only staff and he said that it should apply also to prisoners. He also put in a plea for disabled visitors. I found that there was nothing there for a disabled visitor. Parkhurst changed and improved its disabled loo because of my visit. One was discovered in Durham jail that no one knew existed. There was another upstairs but there was no lift to get up to it. I hope that that was changed, but I would put in a plea for visitors to be included under the scheme.</p>

We have had briefing from the Disability Rights Commission and my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham has explained the background. Had my noble friend Lord Low been here, I am sure that he would have added a few more vibrant descriptions of some of the horrors that are experienced by disabled people, but we have been lucky enough&#151;at least I have&#151;to have received a briefing from his assistant, William Moy, who has done an effective job in setting out a range of areas where there are clearly problems and a lack of awareness. This equality scheme must go broader than just staff and apply equally to visitors and families, but surely it must also apply to the training of staff, so they understand and can look for the points at which they may wish to refer to a doctor or call in some other form of specialist help. With all that as a background, I do not want to repeat everything that has been said. We had some poignant

The punishment of prison is to be deprived of one&#146;s liberty and disabled prisoners should not have an additional punishment of being treated unequally and having less favourable treatment. Only if every prison is required to produce a disability equality scheme will we ensure that they start to make progress in doing such things as ensuring that disabled prisoners have equal treatment and opportunity in taking part in education, in employment schemes, library services, behavioural programmes or visits. I hope that my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General will see her way to support the amendment.</p>

I will value each and every one of them. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, seems to have slipped one past me on this occasion. I take this opportunity to congratulate her on her new role. I feel a little distressed that because of the nature of that role we may no longer have her constant appearances at this Dispatch Box and I hope your Lordships agree that her party has therefore done this House a great disservice.</p>

<a name="70703-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07070356000015"></a>I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, for raising the issue. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Low, is not in his place, but it is an important issue and it does honour to this House that so many have spoken in the debate who have great knowledge and passion for it: the noble Baronesses, Lady Masham and Lady Darcy de Knayth, and my noble friend Lady Wilkins, together with the fine advocate for disability and dyslexia in particular, the noble Lord, Lord Addington. These are important issues.</p>

<a name="70703-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07070356000016"></a>We also have an opportunity to debate how we are responding to the issue. I hope that I made it in clear when we last spoke about it that the Government are firmly committed to tackling all aspects of discrimination and inequality across the criminal justice system. I hear loudly the comments that have been made by those who accurately say that disability should not form a secondary punishment in relation to the criminal justice system. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, is concerned about how disability issues are handled in the public and contracted-out Prison Service, particularly in relation to prisoners. The noble Lord, Lord Low, made that point. The noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, makes a good point about visitors, as does my noble friend Lady Wilkins.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_966"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 966</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70703-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07070356000017"></a>However, the amendment would require that each individual prison establishment, whether managed by Her Majesty&#146;s Prison Service or contracted out, has a separate disability equality scheme and that they each publish a report on the same. The Government consider that it would be disproportionate to make each and every individual prison a separate entity under the Disability Discrimination Act. We do not require the same under the Race Relations Act, nor do we require it of police stations, which stand in a similar relationship to the police authorities. I hope that my comments will in no way diminish the importance of this because I hope that I will be able to explain how we are going to respond. That said, I understand the basis of the concerns of all noble Lords who have spoken. As my honourable friend Gerry Sutcliffe made clear in his recent letter to the noble Lord, Lord Low, on the subject, the Government accept that there are shortcomings in the current Prison Service disability equality scheme and that it does not currently adequately address issues relating to prisoners.</p>

<a name="70703-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07070356000018"></a>That is why Her Majesty&#146;s Prison Service is currently drafting an expanded disability equality scheme to cover prisoner issues in greater depth. This is despite the fact that Her Majesty&#146;s Prison Service is not currently specified in the legislation as a separate entity. The Prison Service order on prisoners with disabilities is also being revised and updated, and will introduce a mandatory requirement for all prisons, both public and private, to produce an individual action plan detailing obstacles which need to be overcome and the necessary actions to be taken at local level.</p>

<a name="70703-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07070356000019"></a>All prisons, whether publicly run or contracted out, are required to abide by all applicable Prison Service orders&#151;of which I can assure the House this will be one. In publicly run prisons, compliance with the order is enforced by operational management. The Prison Service standard, which supports the Prison Service order, is auditable and will be revised to include the requirement to produce an establishment action plan. In contracted-out prisons, compliance is enforced through the management of the contract by the National Offender Management Service. Failure to meet the requirements of the order would have contractual implications for the companies managing the private prisons.</p>

<a name="70703-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07070356000020"></a>The Government believe that the revision of the Prison Service order and the requirement to produce local action plans is the most appropriate and the most effective way of meeting the concerns which were raised by the noble Lord, Lord Low, on the previous occasion and very ably by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and all those who have spoken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07070356000021"></a>I should point out that the amendment is technically deficient as the Disability Discrimination (Public Authorities) (Statutory Duties) Regulations 2005, as amended on 6 April 2007, already has a Part V. However, I do not think that should impede us doing our duty.</p>

I do not believe that this amendment will help us to achieve any greater compliance from prisons with the spirit and letter of the Disability Discrimination Act than the existing provisions, but I very much welcome the opportunity to have said what I have said, and put it on the record so that it can be returned to if it is found that the assurance that I have given to the House is not being properly complied with. I know that that will be used to good effect by all those Members of the House who retain an interest in these issues.</p>

At her request, I withdrew the debate because she said that she would produce a formal response to that and therefore it made sense to have a debate based on the government response. I accepted that and withdrew the debate. Since then, the noble and learned Baroness has moved to another position. I was told that I should instead contact Vera Baird in the Ministry of Justice, who is now the Minister responsible. I wrote to her. I have not had a reply, which is not surprising as she is no longer in that position either. Therefore, one of my purposes in tabling the amendment is to ask the noble and learned Baroness, before she moves from her position, what exactly will happen and when we can expect the matter to be debated.

The number of women prisoners has almost doubled in 10 years but they are still a small proportion of the prison population. I was enthused by the Corston report. Given the quality and the experience in your Lordships&#146; House, I should have thought this would have been an area on which we would be consulted, and that the appropriate department might take our views into account when thinking the matter through.</p>

<a name="70703-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07070356000037"></a>Unsurprisingly, the report suggests that if women should be in prison at all&#151;I shall say a few words about that in a moment in relation to my visit to Downview&#151;they should be in small, easily accessible units. Those units should, if possible, be situated in cities, although that may be a little unfair to those who live in rural areas. However, they should be situated in easily accessible areas to enable family members such as husbands to keep in contact. As we all know, families are likely to stay together longer if such contact is maintained, and, we hope, long enough for the children to get the full benefit of that.</p>

<a name="70703-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07070356000038"></a>The idea went through my head&#151;noble Lords might think it quite mad&#151;that, although a couple of women&#146;s prisons have already been sucked into the male circuit, if all of them became male prisons, that would provide places to resolve prison overcrowding and the new set-up could begin almost at once. The rather splendid idea of providing these sorts of prisons could be introduced. That may or may not make sense.</p>

<a name="70703-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07070356000039"></a>I visited many women&#146;s prisons while I served on the Parole Board, but on my recent visit to Downview I was struck by two things. First, all the women participating in an excellent course to train to be communicators and run a television unit were hard on me, asking why on Earth women had such long sentences compared to men. Only about a third of them, compared to many more men, had previous convictions when sent to prison. When one thinks it through, quite a lot of them were there for carrying drugs, maybe as mules, but then we need to think why and who sent them there. Were they subject to abuse? Were they in some form of slavery? I suspect that that side has not been sufficiently researched for some time, and it reinforced my thoughts about this range of issues.</p>

<a name="70703-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07070356000040"></a>At Downview it appeared that a number of good initiatives were going on. One brilliant woman won a prize from Asda&#151;I think I mentioned that to the noble and learned Baroness&#151;and the television unit made a film about it. She was given a great deal of attention by the local Asda. Out of all that came the interesting thought that Asda central office was not taking the view that all Asdas might take in offenders, think of them in this way and get rid of the awful feeling that anybody who has been in prison should not be recruited. It could have done that, but it has not. If the noble and learned Baroness, as I suggested to her, got Asda central and other companies likely to behave in the same way involved, you could extend enormously the number of employers&#151;when a lot has already been done to get them aboard&#151;that would take on the problem.</p>

I think the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, wanted a report in six months. Well, we have had another amendment passed that is looking six months hence. I would like some assurance from the noble and learned Baroness that the important and rather different role of women is being taken account of and that wider consultation is going on rather than just inward discussion.</p>

One of my reasons for suggesting that we have a commissioner for women right at the heart of any offender management planning is that that sort of issue could be better represented by someone who knows all the issues, knows what is going on and can fight the case to prevent the unnecessary destruction of a vast amount of good work specifically designed around the needs of women and young women to prevent their reoffending.

<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07070356000057"></a>Above all this debate is about the search for justice and fairness for the Palestinians and real security for the state of Israel.

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07070356000058"></a>I launch this debate above all as an enthusiastic friend of Israel of many years&#146; standing. It has become a great and impressive country in the effervescent near East cockpit, a normal country with major internal socio-economic problems as we have here in Europe and Britain, but a country none the less of great achievements. The economy is strong and the country is militarily completely safe other than from marginal and often futile bomber attacks, which have anyway declined markedly in recent months. The Hamas long-term hudna appears to be holding, for the most part.</p>

<a name="70703-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07070356000060"></a>Successive US intermediaries came and went over the years, including the highly distinguished Senator George Mitchell, all with sensible recommendations for peace, all ignored. Was there a secret Bush-Sharon agreement? Many people still think so, but the jury is out on that. On 14 June, I asked the then Minister&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Triesman&#151;whether the Government here would make a further request to the US Government to persuade the Government of Israel to follow international law in response to UN resolutions 242 and 338. He replied:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="07070356000323"></a>&#147;We ... have consistently called for Israel to follow international law with regard to its actions in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. We continue to work closely with the US and the EU on the peace process and agree that the road map is the way forward&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 18/6/07; col. <I>WA 17</I>.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07070356000301"></a>I welcome that Answer very much. Some sceptical observers think that the Blair Government here were pretending about all that, but I give them the full benefit of the doubt. Far too many years have been wasted already, and it is a total disgrace that the quartet exercise has never even begun because the Israeli Government will still not open proper negotiations with the Palestinians. I believe that the Minister&#151;I thank her very much for coming, listening and winding up the debate&#151;and the new Prime Minister are sincere in wanting a just solution to the Palestinians' hideous plight, and the even greater enhancement of Israel's security and civic safety that will result from that lasting settlement.</p>

<a name="70703-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07070356000061"></a>A bad moment ensued on 21 June at the special summit in Egypt with Israel and Jordan when Prime Minister Olmert still refused to start substantive talks with President Abbas, after all that the latter had done in recent times by way of deep co-operation and conciliation of Israel&#146;s perfectly legitimate security demands. What will Mr Blair&#146;s role be as some kind of putative peace emissary, not involved in negotiations? We wait to see the clear details of the mandate. Mr Wolfensohn gave up in disgust in spring 2006 and went home, so the jury remains out on that question as well.</p>

<a name="70703-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07070356000062"></a>Also, can we really trust the Americans after all the sad incidents that have taken place? The jury must be out on that too. When I was in the West Bank in November 2005 with Gerald Kaufman MP, Hillary Clinton was visiting Israel. She went only there; she did not go to the Palestinian territories at all, and she declared the new wall a very good idea. I am not sure you will get an even-handed approach from the Democrats, unless they miraculously bring back Jimmy Carter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07070356000063"></a>Meanwhile, the Palestinian territories seethe with huge rumours of US plots to split Palestine into two docile future parts. It is up to the Americans to  show that those rumours are unfounded nonsense.

<a name="70703-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07070356000064"></a>I understand perfectly that, for many Israeli citizens, it makes much more sense to concentrate on seeking the good life&#151;it is easily available if people work hard in Israel&#151;rather than be bothered with what is happening in the Occupied Territories. It is just like how we Brits used to shrug our shoulders at the unrest and the mistreatment of Catholics in Northern Ireland. Of course, that cosy stance is a fine piece of self-delusion for a people led by&#151;I am sad to say&#151;a short-sighted and narrow-minded Government under Prime Minister Olmert. For instance, the despair and anger expressed in the vivid report of Álvaro de Soto, the Middle East UN envoy, at his end of mission on 5 May emphasised that western-led peace efforts had failed completely. He also thought that the boycott of Hamas was extremely short-sighted. Sending Hamas into exile had, he asserted, &#147;effectively transformed the Quartet&#148; into a sanctions-imposing body, harming a,</p>
<ul><a name="07070356000388"></a>&#147;freely elected government ... under occupation as well as setting unattainable ... conditions for ... dialogue&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70703-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07070356000065"></a>Many international observers consider that all the quartet powers are in breach of international law and the Geneva Convention in allowing the Palestinians to be subjected to huge collective punishment in ghettos separated by often brutal Israeli checkpoints, apartheid roads and no-go areas in their own towns, with the Israelis still holding over 9,000 detainees, mostly without due process. For example, the French press on Monday reported that Said al-Atabeh had had 30 years in detention without any trial whatever. The sad situation goes on unless real action is taken by the international community and the immediate parties concerned: Palestine, the future state, and Israel, the present state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07070356000066"></a>I ask noble Lords to read the appalling details of Amnesty International's latest report on the misery of the occupied Palestinians and its accompanying letter of 4 June. The fourth paragraph of that letter read:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a><a name="07070356000324"></a>&#147;Our research has found that a growing number of Palestinians are suffering from malnutrition, anaemia, stunted growth, vitamin deficiency and other health problems as a direct result of measures imposed to restrict movement of people and goods. As the economy fails, poverty and food insecurity are growing. Farmers are prevented from reaching their land and foodstuff is left to rot in containers as checkpoints are closed&#148;.</p>

<a name="70703-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07070356000067"></a>Most of the assertions in that and other similar reports have been backed up repeatedly not just by the international NGOs of repute, but by the home-grown Israeli and Palestinian ones as well. Once again, I pay tribute to the wonderful work of Israeli groups such as Peace Now, B&#146;Tselem and the brave

The recent vicious civil war in Gaza and the West Bank has left the majority of thinking, civilised Palestinians in despair.</p>

<a name="70703-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07070356000068"></a>The West cannot leave the Palestinians to rot in this mess created by Israeli intransigence, American defiance and EU myopia. The situation remains a total disgrace. The real bilateral talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority should have started years ago. At least a miserable overall scenario is mitigated by the amazing courage of individuals, groups and organisations from both Palestine and Israel who still work together to promote coexistence, despite an atmosphere of deterioration. George Soros's criticisms of the activities of AIPAC in the USA with pusillanimous politicians there is relevant, too. I feel sad that I have to say that.</p>

<a name="70703-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07070356000069"></a>Why are the Palestinian missions in the capital cities, particularly Washington DC, so feeble and badly organised? I am sad to make that criticism as well.</p>

<a name="70703-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07070356000070"></a>Israel is an established and successful state, with wide international support. Palestine is fighting a despairing battle for statehood and recognition. Surely the established state has the moral and legal obligation to take the lead in ending its colonial occupation forthwith and asking the provocative settlers to move back to Israel proper, to a prosperous economy with plenty of jobs available in the future. That is the key to Israel's survival as a mainly Zionist-based state, otherwise the population growth statistics will confound the legitimate aspirations of millions of sensible Israeli citizens. That remains the reality.</p>

<a name="70703-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07070356000071"></a>It took years for the West to stand up to the nauseating evil of apartheid in South Africa. There are no direct comparisons to be made between that and what is happening between Palestine and Israel, but Israel needs to accept the overdue demand of the whole world community to do what is urgently needed. Israel has so much and Palestine so little, with only 22 per cent of the combined territory left if they return to the 1967 lines.</p>

Israel was under a dire threat from surrounding hostile armies poised for war. Israel expected Egypt and Syria to fight, which they did, Egypt losing Gaza and Sinai and Syria the Golan Heights. However,

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07070356000075"></a>I was in Israel in August 40 years ago and remember, in the weeks after the six-day war, the euphoria and high hopes of peace at last that permeated Israel, and the mad rush of Israelis to see places&#151;many of them holy to Judaism&#151;that they had not been able to visit since 1948. They fully expected that many of those places would, under any hoped-for settlement, not be in Israeli hands for long.</p>

<a name="70703-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07070356000076"></a>I would like to put on record that I visited Gaza then for the first time. It was a hellhole, and it was only a matter of weeks since it had been in Egypt&#146;s responsibility. We now know that the hopes for peace were dashed, and after some ups and many downs we are where we are now. There are some signs of hope again. First, on 25 June, Egypt hosted a summit at Sharm el-Sheikh of Jordanian, Israeli and Palestinian leaders to try to advance the peace process and to consider the Saudi initiative. The Saudi peace plan was first proposed in 2002, and it is now being reconsidered by all the interested parties. Israel has restated its commitment to withdrawals of West Bank settlements, and it is releasing funds for the Palestinian Authority under Prime Minister Salam Fayyad.</p>

None of us who know him doubt that he is capable of both, as he so amply demonstrated in Northern Ireland and throughout his premiership.

We have made it clear that we would be prepared to move forward on the quartet&#146;s three principles: renunciation of violence, recognition of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations. There are encouraging signs. At a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Ehud Olmert promised to release some $560 million in frozen tax revenues to the Palestinian Authority, to free some 250 Fatah prisoners from Israeli jails, to ease restrictions on the movement of Palestinians in the West Bank and to enhance Israeli trade with the Palestinians. Such actions are vital to the Palestinian people and will help to improve the humanitarian and economic situation, which is dire and critical. Greater freedom of movement would produce immediate and significant benefits. A lot of the violence is a result of frustrated Palestinians who are not able to obtain the basic necessities of life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07070356000086"></a>Among all the recent grim news from Palestine, why should we not be sitting back and letting matters take their course? We should not do so because the situation in the Palestinian territories is one of great instability, in a region that is already plagued by instability following the insurgency in Iraq and the fighting in Lebanon last summer. Things could easily spiral out of control again. The split between the West Bank and Gaza, if it continues and deepens, is a threat to the only viable basis for a solution to the Palestine problem; the two-state template to which all Governments and all Arab Governments and Israel are committed. Above all, a negotiated solution to the Palestinian problem is a necessary, if not a sufficient, element of any counter-terrorist strategy worthy of the name. Of course, a Palestinian settlement would not at a stroke bring terrorist attacks to an end; indeed any settlement and those who subscribe to it would no doubt be attacked with the greatest violence by the terrorists and their backers, but a settlement should drain away much of the support for extremism, which feeds on the present mood of helplessness and anger, and it would help to legitimise

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07070356000087"></a>What needs to be done urgently, if inaction is a poor option? First, Israel needs to release all the Palestinian money that it is withholding and loosen the stranglehold that its myriad of roadblocks is exerting on the West Bank. Outside donors need to resume structured efforts to build up the institutions of a future Palestinian state. That needs to be done in ways that do not deepen the split between the West Bank and Gaza and which do not deprive the inhabitants of Gaza of money that is rightfully theirs and of access to humanitarian aid. A policy of punishing the citizens of Gaza for the predicament into which they have fallen would be neither viable nor morally defensible. I would like to hear whether the Government share that view and, if so, how in practical terms they intend to proceed.</p>

<a name="70703-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07070356000088"></a>Short-term solutions will not be enough. There needs to be a resumed peace process that addresses not only the route to be taken but what is called the political horizon, which is current diplomat-speak for final status issues. Any such process needs to be inclusive, reaching out to and involving talking to all those parties, whether in government or not, who are involved in the politics of the region. I was really shocked to read in the fascinating report by Alvaro de Soto that he was forbidden by two successive Secretaries-General, no doubt under strong external pressure, even to speak to Hamas leaders. If we learnt anything from our experience in Northern Ireland, it was surely that exclusion does not advance the cause of peace. We must not fall into that heresy, which is so prevalent on the banks of the Potomac, that one only talks to one&#146;s adversaries when they have fulfilled a whole list of onerous preconditions; that contact with us is something for which they have to make substantive concessions. Should we not be putting that sort of appeal behind us? I can see the noble Baroness rising to her feet; I am about to sit down.</p>

They ignore Israel&#146;s unilateral evacuation of the Gaza Strip and their hope and expectation that various settlements in the West Bank will go. They ignore the discussions between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas, which are crucial if peace is to be procured. They ignore the dramatic and historic meeting on 25 June between the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Palestine and Israel, at which they agreed the release of 250 Fatah prisoners from Israeli jails, the remission to the Palestinian Authority of &#163;300 million of its funds and humanitarian relief to the people of Gaza.

But what has been advanced by the noble Lord who asked this Question and, in particular, by the previous speaker, is distorted, one-sided and cannot possibly play a worthwhile role in securing an enduring peace for the region. For all of these reasons, it is puzzling why the supporters of this Question have not backed the Saudi Arabian plan for peace, which only Syria, Iran and Hamas have declined to support.</p>

The bit of her speech to which I take particular exception is her comment that Israel is an apartheid state. Perhaps we have all forgotten what an apartheid state was like. But, let me say just this about Israel: it has an Arab Minister in the Government and in the Cabinet. There is no ban on races mixing with each other. If you go to any hospital in Israel, you will see Arabs, Israelis and Druze whether they are being treated or whether they are doctors and nurses. In particular, the Weizmann Institute, of which I am the UK chairman, has Arabs and Arab professors who mix closely.

Perhaps I may say a few words on the nature of peace. After the 1967 and 1973 wars, Anwar Sadat, a man of vision and strength came to Jerusalem and met with another man of vision and strength, Menachem Begin. They signed a peace agreement. Israel withdrew from Sinai. Another man of vision, King Hussein of Jordan, signed a peace agreement with Yitzhak Rabin. It is beyond dispute that Israel wants peace and will withdraw from the remaining occupied territories to get it. But, as we know, between the Palestinians and the Israelis, there is nothing but the hostility of which we have spoken tonight. They came close to peace in 2000, but Arafat walked away. He was not a man of vision and strength.</p>

In Gaza, there is a Hamas mini-state. It will not recognise Israel, abide by previous agreements or renounce violence. Until such time as a Palestinian leader can negotiate and deliver a deal that will endure, it is clear that neither the British Government nor any other Government will be able to make that happen.</p>

Though it is a generalisation of course, it is nevertheless being suggested that, with the more educated, advanced and secular Arabs living in the West Bank while Gaza is home to many radical Islamists, separate Palestinian entities may evolve into separate states themselves. That would surely be a road to disaster, with Hamas retaining support, as it does, in the West Bank towns of Jenin and Nablus, while there are more than a quarter of a million Israelis living in illegal, it should be said, settlements in the West Bank, as well as around 185,000 living in annexed East Jerusalem.</p>

Those Palestinians were then punished for that by the withdrawing of aid. At the very least, I hope that the Minister will signify how she intends to ensure that the inhabitants of Gaza are not deprived of the tax revenues, which are rightly theirs, as well as their share of the aid from the EU and other sources that is so vital for their day-to-day existence.</p>

We should also try to support organisations for coexistence such as One Voice, which is working very hard in hazardous circumstances with both Israelis and Palestinians.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="07070356000121"></a>Surely we should welcome the positive steps made at the Sharm el-Sheikh summit on the 25 June. Prime Minister Olmert agreed to take a number of measures to assist President Abbas. The measures include the release of 250 Fatah-affiliated prisoners held in Israeli jails, the release of &#163;300 million of Palestinian Authority funds, and the continuation of humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip, including water, electricity, food and so on.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="07070356000122"></a>Those are positive steps. I welcome what I thought was a balanced contribution by the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, who paid tribute to those on both sides who are trying to work towards a peaceful solution. I also recognise the importance of a Middle East peace settlement, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay. The difficulty, we all know, is how we work towards this settlement.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="07070356000123"></a>I was truly baffled by the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge. Does she really believe that in this debate, which has gone on for more than 40 years, all we have to do is to persuade one side&#151;just Israel; that we do not need to persuade any on the Palestinian side to stop making rocket attacks. It just will not work. No more than her suggestion that we should encourage boycotts and so on. Is that really going to promote dialogue in this complex and difficult situation? I do not think that anybody in this Chamber really believes, or very few believe, that that is the case.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07070356000124"></a>I, like many others, welcome the appointment of Tony Blair. He has taken on another difficult task, but he has the determination and resilience to try to succeed.</p>

It is even more absurd to try to sum up a debate of this kind in three minutes. As I am not a party spokesman, I make it clear that I am doing so only because of my long connection with this issue. For seven years I was the president of Medical Aid for the Palestinians, a charity which has done such wonderful work in the Palestinian communities.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="07070356000126"></a>I was also the first party leader to visit Yasser Arafat and to talk to him at a time when it was not fashionable to do so. In fact, it was not allowed by the Government of the day in 1980 because the PLO was treated as a terrorist organisation like the ANC. I have to say that I think he was a rather successful resistance leader but a pretty appalling administration leader, as the elections recently in the West Bank proved.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07070356000127"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, was right to remind us that the problem did not start in 1967. The Liberal Party was always &#147;blamed&#148; for the creation of the state of Israel because of the Balfour declaration. I use every opportunity to quote the 1917 Balfour declaration which envisaged the creation of the state of Israel. It said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a><a name="07070356000326"></a>&#147;It being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07070356000305"></a>Unfortunately, that has not been adhered to. That greatest statesman, Abba Eban, who was Israel's first UN representative, said after the 1967 war, when he was the country's foreign minister:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a><a name="07070356000327"></a>&#147;The Jewish people fail to understand that there was something contractual in our entry into the world. We promised to share the territory. The present position&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07070356000306"></a>that is, the occupation of the Palestinian territories&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07070356000389"></a>&#147;is a deviation from our birth. I never knew of a country that could successfully throw its birth certificate away&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070356000307"></a>We need to get back to those profound words in order to understand the current situation in the West Bank.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07070356000128"></a>I get particularly annoyed when I listen to Israeli Ministers dealing with the issue of the wall; to say, for example, that every nation has a right to build a wall to defend its security. That is not in doubt: I quite agree. The issue is the continued erosion of the Palestinian territory by the route of the wall. I cannot understand why we have been so weak on this issue. The Israeli Supreme Court itself has ruled that,</p>
<ul><a name="07070356000390"></a>&#147;only a separation fence built on the tenets of justice will afford security&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070356000308"></a>It ruled that the security wall caused &#147;unjustified hardship&#148; to thousands of Palestinians, yet we have done nothing in the wake of further encroachments on the Palestinian territory.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07070356000129"></a>The Question of my noble friend Lord Dykes, whom I congratulate on raising this debate, refers to the return of territories, but day by day we see more and more territory taken. That is the reality of the situation on the ground.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="07070356000130"></a>I hope that we will return to the Beirut Declaration of 2002, to which reference has already been made. The Arab states have offered collectively to give recognition to Israel in return for withdrawal from the territories. That is what we must hope for. We wish Tony Blair every success in his efforts as the new Middle East negotiator.</p>

Hamas seized power in the Gaza Strip through the brutal use of force. We welcome the quartet&#146;s prompt action in convening an urgent meeting and giving its support to President Abbas. We also welcome the United States and the EU lifting the boycott on the Palestinian Authority and resuming the transfer of aid. However, it is clear that those are only preliminary steps. Given that before the latest violence, 87 per cent of the population of Gaza was living below the property poverty line, what action do the Government believe is required to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza?</p>

The Arab League agreed to establish a fact-finding committee made up of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia,

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="07070356000133"></a>The whole House will be united in calling for the immediate release of Alan Johnston, the BBC journalist. Anyone who watched the chilling video of him will feel enormous sympathy for him and his family. Given the public demonstrations by Palestinians demanding his release, I trust that the Foreign Office is taking every possible step to press for his safe return.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="07070356000134"></a>Achieving peace in the Middle East and a lasting peace between Israel and Palestine, based on a viable two-state solution, is one of the most pressing issues of our time. The challenge for Tony Blair will be to show that he can command the confidence of all parties, which will not be easy. The former Prime Minister's mandate includes mobilising international assistance to the Palestinians and helping to develop their institutions and economy. Inevitably, his appointment has been condemned by Hamas, but we on these Benches wish him well in his new role.</p>

I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, for provoking a stimulating debate on this issue, and many noble Lords for putting it into its important historical context. Naturally, I share many of the concerns expressed today. The events of recent weeks have been shocking and we need a sober and measured response from all parties and from the international community as a whole.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="07070356000136"></a>The Government are pursuing a two-fold approach. First, we must respond to the humanitarian needs of the Palestinians, particularly in Gaza. But, the over-riding objective remains the resumption of negotiations, leading to a two-state solution with an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with Israel. That is the only realistic basis for a just and lasting peace and it is the very firm position of this Government. It is our position because it is right for the people of the Middle East. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said, it is also an important element of our global anti-terrorist strategy. At this stage, however, humanitarian work is our immediate priority.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07070356000137"></a>In addition to our extensive support through the EU and the UN, we announced on 19 June a bilateral contribution of &#163;1 million to the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza and the West Bank. Our current commitment to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency&#151;UNRWA&#151;stands at more than &#163;100 million over five years. I pay tribute to the work of those and other humanitarian organisations. Like the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, I applaud the bravery of those who have distributed aid and provided medical services in these conditions. My condolences go to the families of those who have tragically been killed while undertaking this work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07070356000138"></a>The senseless violence we saw in Gaza only disrupts humanitarian efforts, which in turn compounds the damage already caused to the lives and livelihoods of ordinary Palestinians. Along with EU and quartet parties, we understand why President Abbas had to dismiss the national unity Government. We support his decision to form a new Government. We are now working with that Government and support their efforts to restore law and order to the occupied Palestinian territories. President Abbas and his new Prime Minister face enormous challenges, but they are men of peace. They understand that peace can come only through negotiations, not violence. They deserve our support as they try to bring stability back to the occupied Palestinian territories&#151;all of the occupied territories.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07070356000139"></a>We are working with our international partners to help them in their difficult task. On 18 June, EU Foreign Ministers called for an urgent political solution of the crisis. They also expressed their full support for President Abbas and his decision to declare a state of emergency and to install an emergency Government. The EU agreed to resume normal relations with the Palestinian Authority immediately. We will now develop the conditions for urgent practical and financial assistance, including direct financial support to the Government, support to the Palestinian civilian police, the resumption of the EU Border Assistance Mission, and intensive efforts to build the institutions of the future Palestinian state. The noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, is right to point out the importance of a viable Palestinian economy. However, I agree with my noble friend Lord Mitchell that a description of Israel as an apartheid state is rather emotive and therefore unhelpful.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07070356000140"></a>I am delighted that Prime Minister Olmert has given President Abbas his support, and I welcome his decision to release $116 million of Palestinian tax revenues to the emergency Government. That is something that we and our European colleagues have consistently called for. It has been a long time coming and we have fought hard, but it has started to come. I say to my noble friend Lord Watson that for the first time in more than a year, all civil servants, including those in Gaza, will receive their full salary. We welcome that. We do not want a three-state solution.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07070356000141"></a>I attach the greatest importance to talks between Olmert and Abbas. We know that negotiations of this kind are difficult and often emotive. The international community can help, but success depends on Israel and the Palestinian Government working to resolve some of the contentious issues.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07070356000142"></a>My noble friend Lord Bernstein mentioned the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. They clearly remain contrary to international law and an obstacle to peace. The road map is clear that Israel must freeze all settlement activity&#151;that is settlement construction and the natural growth of existing settlements&#151;and dismantle all outposts built since March 2001. We will continue to press the Israeli Government on that point.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="07070356000143"></a>My noble friend is of course right to say that the Government of Israel have a responsibility to ensure the security of their people. They have a right to self-defence. If they want to build a barrier, as the  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_987"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 987</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Lord, Lord Steel said, they are entitled to do so. But that barrier must be on or behind the green line. Any barrier on occupied land contravenes international law and must come down. We have made that point to the Israeli Government on numerous occasions and we will continue to do so.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07070356000144"></a>We have given Israel consistent and clear messages on the need to respect and take forward the road map. Of course, Palestinian leaders must do the same. Some today have suggested that the international community has followed a misguided policy towards Hamas. I refute that. We have provided food, shelter and medical supplies to the Palestinian people. Militants have provided guns, violence and death.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07070356000145"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, made some telling points, but he will understand better than most the importance of a united position around the UN principles. Our policy has not changed. We expect Hamas to adhere to the principles set by the quartet in January 2006. Those are to renounce violence, recognise Israel and accept all previous agreements and obligations, as set out in the road map. I hope that it does that and that it takes the opportunity for dialogue and progress, but a political dialogue is impossible as long as Hamas dedicates itself to violence and destruction.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07070356000146"></a>The quartet's engagement is key. We support its statement of 15 June that called for: an urgent end to the violence; the co-operation of all parties to ensure security; and the necessary access conditions for the passage of humanitarian goods and personnel both within the Gaza Strip and at key crossing points. Indeed, as my noble friend Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale rightly pointed out, the engagement of all international partners&#151;the EU, the Arab League and the quartet&#151;is crucial.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07070356000147"></a>Like my noble friends Lord Clinton-Davis and Lord Young of Norwood Green, we welcome the ongoing dialogue between Israeli Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas, the efforts of the Arab League to take forward the Arab peace initiative and the quartet's engagement, and the appointment of a new special representative. The meeting last week between President Mubarak, King Abdullah of Jordan, Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas was also a positive step forward. The international community must work together to maintain that momentum. I was asked for further information in respect of that meeting. I regret that I do not have further information this evening, but if I receive further information, I will certainly inform noble Lords.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07070356000148"></a>As noble Lords have rightly said, the work of organisations such as the excellent One Voice is also a vital part of bringing together Palestinians and Israelis better to understand each other and to work for peace. Like my noble friend Lady Ramsay, the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, and the noble Lord, Lord Astor, I hope that everyone will join me in passing on best wishes to Tony Blair as he takes on his new role helping to build the institutions of a viable Palestinian state. That is vital work.</p>

The continuing unresolved conflict in the Middle East remains at the core of insecurity in the region. The 40th anniversary of the Six-Day War serves only to remind us of the urgent need to return to dialogue and secure a just, lasting and permanent solution. That means a viable and independent Palestinian state, alongside a safe and secure Israel. The British Government believe that the best way to help to achieve a peaceful resolution is to encourage both Israel and the Palestinians to take the steps necessary for progress through close engagement and dialogue at all levels. We will find peace in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories only through patient negotiation&#151;negotiation which looks ahead to a two-state future, which focuses on the tragedy of the death and poverty of today&#146;s Palestinians and the security of Israeli civilians, rather than old grievances which are no longer in our power to solve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07070356000150"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Astor, was right to remind us of the plight of Alan Johnston. I assure noble Lords that we will continue to work closely with the BBC and the Palestinian Authority to secure the safe release of Alan Johnston. We will continue to call on those holding Alan to release him unconditionally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07070356000157"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, this amendment will oblige the Minister to publish guidelines on qualifications, experience or training for those permitted to work as prison officers and to publish minimum standards for the supervision of prison officers. Its purpose is to probe the Government further on their plans for the prison officer workforce.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="07070356000158"></a>Last Thursday your Lordships debated the Leitch report on skills. The threat to our future prosperity posed by our comparative lack of development of low and medium-level skills was made clear. There is a recognition that we need to be more effective as a nation in this area. Our education system has disappointed young people and excluded them by not providing adequate vocational qualifications. We have not made available the apprenticeship schemes for young people to train. There is a gulf between the standard of development of our social care professionals and that of many continental countries; that is most apparent in our children&#146;s homes.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="07070356000159"></a>The social care workforce White Paper <I>Options for Excellence</I><I>,</I> published in October 2006, promised a move to learning organisations staffed by professional and reflective practitioners. While I recognise the important difference between work in the secure estate and that of social care, there is much common ground, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, pointed out. There is, I admit, also the problem of the churn of inmates in prisons, but I hope that the Minister can say that his ambitions to some extent overlap the <I>Options for Excellence</I> White Paper.</p>

<a name="70703-0013.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="07070356000160"></a>The Lord Chief Justice recently quoted Thomas Holmes, who wrote about young offenders in 1900:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a><a name="07070356000338"></a>&#147;The great majority of boys and girls go wrong ... because of the indifference, idleness, or worthlessness of their parents. I am persuaded that it is not the poverty of the parents, nor the environment of the children, not the possession of criminal instincts that lead the greater bulk of boys to go wrong, but the indifference and incapability of parents&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07070356000309"></a>Of course that is simplistic, but it must be an important part of prison officers&#146; work in rehabilitating offenders to provide the positive family role model that many inmates have never experienced, and to sustain constructive and clearly bounded relationships with offenders. Only a learning organisation with professional and reflective practitioners is likely to be able to deliver these rehabilitative relationships. Because the past history of inmates is likely to be a strong force in undermining those relationships, officers need to reflect and to be able to step around the pitfalls. Many officers also share the same background as the inmates, which complicates matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="07070356000161"></a>It is most welcome to learn that the first joint training between probation officers and prison officers has begun. Nevertheless, there is a glaring gap between the degree-level qualifications of one profession and the low level of qualifications required by the other. It is very troubling to learn that the prison officer induction training has now been reduced from eight weeks to seven; I would appreciate a rationale from the Minister for that. A prison officer is expected to train further as part of his development, but I am concerned that the current numbers of inmates may prevent prison officers  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_990"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 990</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>having the time to do so. I spoke to a senior officer in a private prison, who contrasted the level of manning in the private sector with that of the public sector, and complained that, as his prison lacks adequate staff, he cannot use his specialism in drugs work to train other officers. The significantly greater staff turnover again suggests that some private sector prisons may pay less attention to staff development. Will the Minister say whether private sector prisons provide their prison officers with similar opportunities for training and development to those with which prison officers in public prisons are provided?</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="07070356000162"></a>It is important to recall recent reports from the Chief Inspector of Prisons. In Committee, the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, quoted from those; they have been referred to earlier today, so I will not repeat them. However, I was prompted to table my amendment partly because of a letter from the Attorney-General in her previous role, which indicated that staff supervision was a matter for the private provider at Yarl&#146;s Wood immigration removal centre and was not covered by the contract. Supervision is a vital element of continual professional development. It is essential to developing reflective practice, and indispensable in the safe management of vulnerable but troubling people. In the social care sphere, it implies regular, one-to-one supervision by a senior practitioner. According to the minimum standard, each member of staff in a children&#146;s home must be managed individually by his line manager once a month, and new workers must have more frequent supervisory meetings. Such supervision consists of ensuring that the home&#146;s policy and procedures are followed to assist the practitioner through discussion to come to a clearer understanding of his relationship with the residents. Hitherto in the prison estate, supervision has been understood to be the simple presence of a senior officer while officers are on a wing. I hope that this notion of supervision is changing.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="07070356000163"></a>All this costs money. One needs to free staff from their daily work for development. One needs to free senior practitioners from their important tasks, or hire expensive consultants. My concern is that inertia may win, and the Government may not attain their goal of reducing reoffending by 10 per cent by the end of the decade, unless such requirements are made explicit. We need to raise our ambitions. Norway provides its prison officers with a year&#146;s training at a college after their first probationary year in a prison. It requires officers in training to do months of community service, and enables them to visit and observe services overseas. Indeed, they often come to this country.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="07070356000164"></a>We in this country are notorious for our failure to invest in skills. Our productivity remains stubbornly low in many areas as a consequence. I look to the Minister for reassurance that his eye is firmly on a steep improvement in the training and supervision of prison officers. I beg to move.</p>

In some ways, one can make a comparison with

It responded to many of the similar arguments and decided to take a significant step forward which I commend. The logic continues into this sphere.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="07070356000166"></a>We are agreed, and the Minister assured us at earlier stages of our deliberations, that everyone in the Prison Service is involved in rehabilitation. If we use the arguments about the challenges of rehabilitation in the context of the Probation Service, they would certainly apply to prisons. That underlines the importance of training, qualifications and relevant experience.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="07070356000167"></a>I am sorry to split hairs&#151;if it is splitting hairs&#151;but I have one query on the amendment. That concerns of the wording of new Section 8C(2)(a). I think it is too rigid. While experience and authority, which go with seniority, are terribly important, we do not want to slip into a Buggins&#146;-turn culture. Occasionally, there will be outstanding people, who can be moved into positions of responsibility earlier than might be the usual practice, and there should be room for that. It should not just be an exception, which might cause a cultural curfuffle in the institution concerned, but it should be accepted that that is the case.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="07070356000168"></a>Otherwise, I am very much with the noble Earl in all that he is arguing. Apart from the logic of the Government accepting the arguments on the Probation Service, to which they responded in Amendment No. 24, the important point is that increasingly very valuable work is being done in higher education in preparing police officers. At the outset, there was a certain amount of cultural suspicion about the process in the police force, but it is now recognised, more and more, that the right sort of people, with the advantage of more training and education behind them, can increase the effectiveness in the role that they play. That underlines the importance of the amendment, but I am sorry that I have a reservation on that one point.</p>

<p><a name="st_194"></a>
<a name="07070356000169"></a><b><a name="70703-0014.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07070356000457"></a>Baroness Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Lords, I, too, support the amendment of my noble friend Lord Listowel. As far as one can see, with end-to-end management, one would expect very little to be done without involving prison officers in the scheme. I noticed how few references there are to prison officers in the Bill, and yet they must be absolutely crucial to the whole set up. I see one on page 3, in Clause 3(5), which gives some indication that prison officers might be involved in carrying out and making arrangements for probation services. However, I could not agree more with what my noble friend has said.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="07070356000170"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Judd, commented on his concern about new Section 8C(2)(a), which states:</p>
<ul><a name="07070356000391"></a>&#147;the level of seniority required for the supervision of another officer&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070356000310"></a>From an earlier discussion I had with my noble friend, I believe that that referred to the need for more support for probation officers and the same should apply within a prison. You need someone in whom to confide, to whom you can talk about your troubles. There has been far too little of that. I think I am right to follow up that point.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="07070356000171"></a>Coming back to this end-to-end management, it is crucial that we see all the members as part of the process. Hence the idea of the overarching training, which could involve different levels, with people taking it at different times and maybe for different services&#151;even social services could take some part&#151;but also, of course, with different levels of people. Perhaps people would want to stop at some stage, but otherwise they could go on higher and higher, getting more responsibility for dealing with the really difficult cases, which we need to concentrate on.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="07070356000172"></a>If and when the amendment is accepted&#151;I hope that it will be&#151;there will be a much greater role for prison officers in helping the young particularly. I want to get back to the possibility of concentrating rather more resources on some of the offenders, who we could get out of the cycle of deprivation and back into the world, where they would be more use to themselves and, indeed, to the rest of us.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="07070356000173"></a>I hope that this can be taken rather more seriously to heart&#151;even better to hear from the noble and learned Baroness the Attorney-General that it is already well under way and that we do not need to worry.</p>

<p><a name="st_195"></a>
<a name="07070356000174"></a><b><a name="70703-0014.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07070356000458"></a>Lord Ramsbotham:</b> My Lords, I support the general intention of Amendment No. 33. I absolutely agree with new Section 8B, but I have a concern about new Section 8C. I accept the minimum standards for supervision as an idea but, when the qualifications for a prison officer are set, I am concerned that the qualifications and training of middle management are frequently missed. The performance of middle management is one of the weakest things in the conduct of imprisonment. Individual prisons sometimes train individuals, but for anyone who knows anything about leadership the worst place to practise leadership is among your friends. People should be moved somewhere to learn the trade.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="07070356000175"></a>It would be sensible for the Prison Service to have central training&#151;or at least a central training syllabus&#151;with perhaps regional centres for middle managers. Untrained middle managers can undoubtedly undermine all the work done on the coal face with prison officers and prisoners. Therefore, in setting down a national framework, the professional qualifications must include the guidelines&#151;the guidelines and training going back to the earlier amendments on training.</p>

Training for prison staff has arisen several times during our debates on the Bill, and it is helpful to be able to address the concerns in a coherent and joined-up fashion. Perhaps before  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_993"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 993</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>considering the amendment, it would be wise to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the staff who work in our prisons. Their work is difficult, dangerous, thankless and very much hidden from public view, and of course they face particular challenges at the moment when the prison estate, as we know, is under great pressure. Yet, as all contributors to the debate have acknowledged, they have a crucial role to play in reducing reoffending, and one of the aims of this legislation is to make it easier for them to work more closely with probation staff in the community to that end.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="07070356000178"></a>The amendment itself deals with two distinct issues, training and supervision. I shall deal first with training. The Prison Service takes the training of its staff very seriously indeed. Prison officer entry level training is delivered over an eight-week period, as the noble Earl understands, with weeks one and five spent in the officers&#146; establishment. During the course, officers are trained in the purpose of the Prison Service, interpersonal skills, diversity, security, self harm and suicide, radio use, and control and restraint. Officers may then go on to train in any of a range of specialist areas according to their skills and, of course, the needs of the service. All establishments are required to produce a training plan which is integrally linked to an overall business plan.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="07070356000179"></a>Staff working with young people receive specialist training as specified in the service level agreement between the Prison Service and the Youth Justice Board. In 2006, the Prison Service management board approved funding for a new initiative called Professionalising the Prison Service. This is a three-year initiative that is designed to transform training across the service to ensure that staff are equipped with the right skills at the right time in their prison career. A key element is the introduction of a professional development framework. This defines clearly recognised development and progression routes for all staff employed by the service so that they have a clear understanding of the available career pathways. Learning will be competence-based and staff will be able to develop and extend their skills, knowledge and experience in order to maintain continuous professional development and, in many cases, progress to higher levels of responsibility.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07070356000180"></a>From September of this year, the achievement of a level 3 national vocational qualification in custodial care will become compulsory for new prison officers. Failure to achieve this will lead to termination of employment as a prison officer. An optional level 2 qualification will be introduced for support grades wishing to make the transition to prison officer.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07070356000181"></a>I do not think that it is necessary to make provision for this in the statute. Comprehensive information about the qualifications, experience and training required by a prison officer is already widely available in the public domain. We have agreed to make express provision in the Bill for probation training in response to particular concerns raised in the context of the new arrangements for the delivery of probation services. But the situation is very different in relation to the more established arrangements for prison training. There is no such statutory provision now and I do not think it is necessary for the future.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_994"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 994</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70703-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07070356000182"></a>I turn now to the second part of the amendment, which proposes setting out the seniority of supervising officers and the length and frequency of supervisory meetings. This degree of operational detail does not need to be set out in such a rigid way or, for that matter, to be underpinned by statute as the amendment suggests. But I will seek to address the concerns which lie behind the amendment by setting out how supervision arrangements work in practice. Unlike staff in other parts of the offender management service, few prison officers work on their own, or out of sight of other officers or senior members of staff. Because of this, the supervision they receive is continuous, flexible and less dependent on formal procedures such as supervisory meetings. It is difficult to see how the publication of standards would provide any improvement in the current situation. Supervision and oversight differ according to local conditions and are presently managed well within such a framework. Standards in these circumstances would be difficult to establish and then to measure, and any increase in formal procedures is likely to add significantly to the burden of bureaucracy and the cost to the service without necessarily offering any corresponding increase in the quality of service delivered.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="07070356000183"></a>As to the seniority of supervision, which the amendment also seeks to prescribe, again it is difficult to see how such a standard could be effectively constructed or implemented. The Prison Service is already a very well structured organisation with a strong tradition of grades and seniority, and there is little day-to-day question about supervisory authority. But it is equally the case that the Prison Service has developed a strong reliance on multi-disciplinary teams, often led by managers who are not senior officers or any part of the officer grading structure but who provide supervision, oversight and, in some instances, even direct management of prison officers.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="07070356000184"></a>The purpose of the amendment is well understood and much appreciated, but its implementation and operation would be fraught with difficulties of definition and scope. For those reasons and the reassurance I have given, I hope the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="07070356000185"></a>Let me deal with a few other points that came up during the course of the debate. The noble Earl thought that prison officer training was going to be reduced to seven weeks. I can knock that one on the head. I made it clear from my speaking note that prison officer training is eight weeks; there has been no reduction and no reduction is intended. He also suggested that private prison staff were perhaps lacking in experience and poorly trained. Private prison staff undergo a thorough training programme, which is equivalent to that in the public sector Prison Service, and successful completion is a condition of employment. The course offers a variety of modules which are tailored to the needs of the learner and the post to ensure that at the end of the course the person has the necessary technical and general skills to perform their duties. The course they undertake is approved by the comptroller as being fit for purpose.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_995"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column 995</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70703-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07070356000186"></a>Course content, training standards and procedures are specified within the terms of each individual contract, which is an additional pressure point in raising standards. The comptroller is able to attend any training module he may wish and can request copies of all training materials given to staff to ensure that proper quality training is provided. The first private prison was opened, of course, in 1992, as has been much discussed today, and there is a significant amount of operational experience now within the system at all levels. This has been recognised by external bodies, such as the prison inspectorate, and the former head of the Prison Service, Martin Narey. I cannot accept that private prisons recruit people of lower calibre. They are delivering the standards which we require within the service and which we seek to set in contracts.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="07070356000187"></a>The noble Earl also referred to the Norwegian experience. The problem is that it is not easy to compare prison systems across Europe because the roles and duties of prison officers differ widely from state to state. Offender management arrangements have grown up on national lines and responsibilities in respect of offender management are often very different. I was interested when the noble Earl said that Norwegian staff came over to the United Kingdom. I can only assume that was because they thought they had something to learn from us, which is a good sign. We are keen to examine best practice; we certainly examine it from across Europe. There is considerable regard for UK Prison Service practices and we have attempted to share with our European partners our best practice. I was entertained to find out, for example, that in Bulgaria prison governors are being led by the experience drawn from an English prison governor who has advised them on their reform programme. That, too, is a good sign.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="07070356000188"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, made the point that there was a lack of reference to or mention of prison officers in the Bill. That is because the Bill seeks to change the arrangements for delivering probation services and increase the involvement of other providers; legislative change is not required for the Prison Service in the same way. Where it is right, however, the Bill makes provision particularly to clarify the role of probation staff in prisons and to enable prison staff to deliver programmes in the community, so it creates that necessary flexibility. That, in essence, explains why there are fewer references to the Prison Service and its particular needs and problems.</p>

<a name="70703-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="07070356000189"></a>I have provided a rather long explanation but, I hope, a reasonably comprehensive one, and I hope that the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

One might argue that they are being more efficient in what they are doing, but there is a drawback. As a senior officer, a man who runs a wing, said, &#147;I can&#146;t get off to train other people elsewhere, unlike those working in public prisons, because the ratio of inmates to staff is not as favourable in our settings&#148;. But I will study carefully what the Minister said. I also appreciate the contributions from across the House&#151;well, from this side of the House&#151;on this matter. I did not intend anything by saying that.</p>

That is why I read so closely from a speaking note. What the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said about training is what is spelt out in the White Paper on social care, <I>Options for Excellence</I>. To achieve the aim of raising the standard of professionalism of those on the front line, one has to concentrate on developing the first-line managers to ensure that, when they move from working on the front line to their first management position, they get a good start. One also has to look at the senior management to make that work. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="07070356000199"></a>The key to the amendment is the duty to ensure that a child&#146;s well-being is considered. We know from a great deal of research that a large proportion of young children who receive detention and training orders have themselves suffered maltreatment and have a range of psychological and other vulnerabilities. We therefore wish to make sure that those are picked up at an early stage. We know very well that investment at this stage which may help to break the downwards spiral into adult offending is extremely important. We are concerned that suicide or harm to others is also a high risk for young people in safe accommodation and we are also uncomfortably aware that problems with young offenders are a gift to the tabloid press and therefore the mix of accommodation provided, not too strong but also not too weak, requires careful assessment as they come in.</p>

<a name="70703-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="07070356000200"></a>The amendment&#146;s purpose is to place as strong a duty as possible on those at an early stage of dealing with young offenders to look beneath the surface of the immediate problem, to look at a special educational needs assessment and a mental or physical health assessment to make sure as far as possible that we can pick up some of the underlying causes before it becomes too late. I beg to move.</p>

I know that it is a matter that we have discussed on several occasions on Criminal Justice Bills in the past. That does not mean that it should not be raised again because it reflects the proper concern that noble Lords have with regard to the welfare of children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="07070356000202"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, will be all too aware that yesterday in the context of the UK Borders Bill I raised an amendment that would impose within the immigration system the duty to promote the welfare of children as under Section 11 of the Children Act 2004. I welcome the way in which the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, has moved the amendment, because it is right that we should continue to press the Government to try to work out the ways in which the needs of children and promoting the safety of children within the criminal justice system can be balanced against what we all want, which is maintaining the safety of the public. That is a theme of the later amendments to which the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, referred. This matter cannot be resolved at present, but we must continue to press it until we are able to find a solution.</p>

<a name="70703-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="07070356000203"></a>I approach the matter from the point of view that children are children first and that at some stage they must come out of the criminal justice system and be responsible adults. If they come out in such a

That is a glib thing to say, but it lies at the heart of what we are trying to achieve. Having made that point, I will not take part in the debates on the later amendments because that reflects my concern. I am going to try to pursue the matter, particularly through the UK Borders Bill, because there is a discrete matter there to which I hope we may be able to find a resolution. Within the context of this Bill, we will not find the answer.</p>

I am extremely glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has made those points because their great importance is having them in the Bill to remind people that our children must be treated as children. I say that bearing in mind my experience in trying to make this point as chief inspector when the provisions of the Children Act did not apply and it was alleged that they would be added to be applied in principle. That was not good enough and time and time again one found that it was not happening. Therefore it is hugely important that it should be in the Bill and as the noble Baroness said it is right that things will flow from that if it is there, so I would like to see the amendment included.</p>

I well recall the late Lady Lester telling me how she had visited a child in prison who had been involved in one of the most hideous crimes that had happened in many years. It was a really horrible story. She said that what really distressed her as she got to know the child through visiting her in prison was the discovery that that child had never ever been loved.</p>

Children&#146;s well-being is still not stressed as much as it ought to be even though we know increasingly that the child&#146;s well-being and involvement in their own process needs to be taken much more seriously. Other points will be raised later, but I make that one now.</p>

We send her our best wishes because we know that she has difficulties with which to deal.</p>

<a name="70703-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="07070356000208"></a>I very much agree with the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, about the difficulties that we have in relation to children. They are children first but on occasion we have to deal with some of the most heinous offences which one or two of them commit. My noble friend Lord Judd is right to say that many of these children have never ever been loved by anybody. That is a tragedy for them. Therefore, we should pay the most acute attention to their welfare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="07070356000209"></a>Courts dealing with children and young people are required to have regard to their welfare. That is provided for by Section 44 of the Children and Young

This amendment would additionally require them to have regard to the young person&#146;s well-being, in the light of the factors listed in Section 10(2) of the Children Act 2004.</p>

<a name="70703-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="07070356000210"></a>The distinction between welfare and well-being is an interesting, important and rather subtle one. The House will have extensive opportunities to reflect on it during consideration of Clause 9 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, referred, which was recently introduced in another place. I agree with her that that is probably the better place for these issues to be more fully debated. Clause 9 seeks to define the purposes of sentencing as regards young people under 18. It covers not only detention and training orders but all other forms of sentence for under-18s and therefore provides a more appropriate opportunity for consideration of this issue than the Bill we are considering today.</p>

<a name="70703-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="07070356000211"></a>The amendment would also apply the duty to the provider of the establishment in which the young person was to be accommodated. Under Section 11 of the Children Act 2004, governors of young offender institutions, directors of secure training centres and local authorities are already required to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. We consider that this clear duty, which covers all young people in custody and not only those who receive detention and training orders, is sufficient in itself. There is no case for a separate duty covering a less extensive range of young people in custody.</p>

<a name="70703-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="07070356000212"></a>Therefore, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment. However, I commend him and the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, for always ensuring that this children&#146;s issue&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said&#151;is raised because it is important for us never to forget the importance of these issues. We shall deal with the other age groups on later amendments.</p>

Perhaps we can discuss between now and Third Reading whether any small adjustments in the language of the Bill can meet some of these points. In the interests of not delaying the House on the next three amendments, I simply say that we must remember, with regard to this amendment and the three that follow, that the underlying purpose of the Bill is not just more effective offender management but also the reduction of reoffending and the size of the prison population. This applies in particular to the various special categories that we are dealing with and most to children coming into the offender management system for the first time.

I was not present then and I read with considerable care the comments of the noble and learned Baroness the Attorney-General. I fully understand that there will not yet be a full examination of how 18 to 24 year-olds as an age-group might be considered because that will need establishments for 18 to 24 year-olds and only them, which will obviously take time and expense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="07070356000217"></a>In the mean time we have the problem of 18 to 20 year-olds. I accept that there are possible emergencies &#151;something may happen and somebody has to act&#151;but, bearing in mind that they are young offenders, it is not good enough to suggest that they may still go to prison without special being provisions made. I suggest that the Minister should consider requiring that no 18 to 20 year-old may be committed to an adult prison unless ministerial clearance has been given. In other words, if the Prison Service wishes for a particular purpose to put an 18 to 20 year-old in prison, it should do so only for a minimum period and must explain to the Minister why, and must seek ministerial permission to do so. That is one way of controlling the situation.</p>

<a name="70703-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="07070356000218"></a>I say that because I will never forget my first visit to Holloway when the governor told me that there were four 15 year-olds in there but that they did not know where they were and that there were no provisions for them. Every time I went into Holloway I saw that there were children there who should not have been there and we have to prevent that. Such as suggestion, which that might not be included in the Bill, could be considered within the Ministry of Justice. It is worth considering. In view of the amendment on which we voted earlier this afternoon, I am glad this amendment has been tabled again. I beg to move.</p>

My noble and learned friend has repeatedly reassured us&#151;and it is good to have heard her say it&#151;the whole task of everyone involved in the legislation is rehabilitation. We know that there are too many examples where young people in the age group referred to have been sent to prison and that no progress with them is possible&#151;in fact, there is a negative effect. I need not go into all those arguments now because my noble and learned friend knows them better than I do and I am sure that she shares the concern. Sometimes in public policy, if it becomes clear that something should not happen, so long as there are arrangements in place which say that in exceptional circumstances it can happen, a process of rationalisation can begin and that approach becomes the easy option. Sometimes one just has to say, &#147;It will not happen&#148;. The amendment does not say that; as the noble Lord has explained, prison could still happen in extremis, with ministerial approval. This is a desperately needed and long overdue measure. I support him completely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="07070356000221"></a>It is important for us to look at the consequences of removing the power to place such people in prison. They would be far-reaching and unacceptable. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, understands those consequences, and that he very much wants us to have a workable system. At the moment, I do not think that this is workable. I entirely agree that we need to give proper consideration to the needs of young adults; that is obviously what lay behind my Statement on 8 May. However, just as there is not much difference between a 17 year-old and an 18 year-old&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, who is not in her place, said in Committee&#151;there is little to separate the 20 year-old from the 21 year-old. It is of course necessary to have thresholds distinguishing &#147;children and young people&#148; from &#147;young adults&#148; and &#147;young adults&#148; from &#147;adults&#148;. The points at which we draw those lines are a matter of judgment and may be subject to change. We should not regard the age of 21 as a perpetually fixed point. The measures that I announced on 8 May cover 18 to 24 year-olds, so it would be odd if I were now to say that under-21s should never come into contact with anyone aged 21, 22, 23 or 24. That would put in tension and conflict the concept that we have just agreed&#151;that that bracket is sensible for us to look at.</p>

<a name="70703-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="07070356000222"></a>Of course we have to take steps to safeguard vulnerable young adults but the amendment, if enacted, would do nothing to achieve that. It would simply make the whole system unworkable. That is because, in a technical sense, all young people over 17 who are remanded to custody are &#147;in prison&#148;, though in reality they are likely to be in part of a young offender institution that has been formally designated as a prison for the purposes of the law. While the House shares the noble Lord&#146;s concern for the welfare of young adults in prison, I am sure that it would not wish to add to existing operational difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="07070356000223"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, raises an interesting suggestion as to whether there could be some form of ministerial oversight. I do not have the numbers at my fingertips at the moment, but I think that they might make that unworkable. However, I shall raise that with the Ministry of Justice. I recall that I would often ask for certain categories of cases to be referred to me, so that I had an overview of what had happened. It was not necessarily a case-by-case basis, but a report on how many and when, so that I could get a flavour. Maybe that could be in the contemplation. At the moment, the noble Lord&#146;s suggestion does not simpliciter seem workable, but maybe we could look at something from a practical point of view that might assist, to hone in and make sure that the eye is kept on this ball. I would be happy to convey that to the Ministry of Justice.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_90"></a><a name="07070356000362"></a>&#147;The courts already have powers under the Mental Health Act 1983 to divert offenders to hospital for treatment.

We are interested in the provision of a diversion scheme in courts and in police stations to make certain that the mentally disordered are diverted to get the treatment that they deserve and need and are not then confined unnecessarily in custody. The Mental Health Act, which the Minister quoted, offers the way ahead. The Mental Health Bill has just been through this House, and diversion schemes were mentioned during its passage. I would have thought that that was the way of taking this ahead, and I commend it to the Ministry of Justice. It must be responsible for seeing that something happens; it is responsible for the courts. I know that the Home Office is still responsible for the police, but all this joined-up government that we hear about should be able to bring that about.</p>

<a name="70703-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="07070356000231"></a>Under the Mental Health Act, a requirement should be placed on local authorities. There will not necessarily be a one-size-fits-all provision, but it has to be laid down that it must happen. It must have legislative means of some kind, because if it is non-legislative that usually means that it will not happen. It has not happened up until now. When I tried to find out how many diversion schemes there were, I could only get information from the national schizophrenia society. Neither the NHS nor anyone else had a list of where the schemes were, which is unfortunate. As everyone has been paying attention to the needs of people with mental health problems, it behoves us to make certain that this provision to prevent them going into custody and to get them treatment is considered and not just put in the &#147;too difficult&#148; tray, when the Mental Health Act probably offers the way ahead. I beg to move.</p>

It would be odd to have on the statute book an Offender Management Act that did not seek to make effective provision for a situation in which 70 per cent of those in the criminal justice system have two or more diagnosable mental illnesses.</p>

Why do I say that? It is because the prisons and the dedicated staff who try to work with these people do not have the resources, training or qualifications to do the work necessary with people with mental problems or mental illness.</p>

<a name="70703-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="07070356000235"></a>I said in Committee or at Second Reading that during my visits to prisons I have been impressed by the exasperation of some of the very best prison officers who, because of their general qualifications and insight, recognise that they are not doing any good. It is not just that they are not doing any good, but they are often aggravating the mental condition of the person in prison and increasing the likelihood of reoffending&#151;it is not just a passive role with no impact. For that reason, the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, seems absolutely right. I am glad to support him in saying that this issue urgently has to be addressed, as the right reverend Prelate said, and I hope that my noble and learned friend will have something reassuring to say.</p>

It is crucial, as the right reverend Prelate pointed out, to deal with this matter urgently. A high percentage of offenders have some form of mental illness, and this is yet another area where women suffer more than men. The degree of mental illness, often more than one type of mental illness, is higher among women offenders than men. I hope that this matter will be given the urgency it needs.</p>

We recognise that this issue overlaps with other legislation currently going through Parliament: the Mental Health Bill and the criminal justice Bill. The number of prisoners with mental health problems is part of the overcrowding problem. If we are to reduce prison overcrowding it must be dealt with. We would like to hear a clear message from the Minister about how the Government intend to give this much greater priority.</p>

Both have now become genteel suburban housing areas. We all recognise that too much of the mental health accommodation that was there until the 1970s has gone. That is one of the reasons we have ended up with people being misclassified into prisons. We need to reverse some of that. Part of that involves greater mental health provision, which this Government have not yet invested enough in, but it partly involves what we are talking about here; that is, ensuring that people whose problems are very much matters of mental health do not go straight into the prison system.</p>

I made clear in Committee that, although we agree with much of the intent prompting this amendment, we do not agree that a legislative approach is the right way to achieve the outcome the noble Lord desires. We also desire that outcome, and other noble Lords who have contributed to the debate patently wish to see it.</p>

<a name="70703-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="07070356000240"></a>I cannot agree with the noble Lord&#146;s assertion that there is no way that the proposal can be properly implemented as it is. I shall explain why.</p>

<a name="70703-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="07070356000241"></a>We want to have effective court diversion schemes, and we plan to work towards improvement in this area. There can be no doubt that people who come into contact with the criminal justice system and who suffer from a mental disorder should be given the treatment they need.</p>

<a name="70703-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="07070356000242"></a>However, we do not believe that this should be achieved through legislation. The amendment is overly prescriptive and would not allow local arrangements to reflect local needs. With the creation of a devolved National Health Service, we moved away from a top-down, centrally prescribed system. Local communities and local NHS staff have welcomed that change. We have committed to reducing the number of central targets and have concentrated instead on providing a framework in which local arrangements can flourish and meet the needs of communities.</p>

<a name="70703-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="07070356000243"></a>We fully accept that the court liaison and diversion schemes currently in operation vary in the quality of the support they can provide. There are areas of best practice, but there are also areas where schemes are failing to thrive. We also know that the better diversion services provide a range of multi-disciplinary team activities across the whole spectrum of the criminal justice system, and support the police earlier in the path to custody for those vulnerable patients who repeatedly come before them. We applaud these schemes and would wish to see more such services. However, the way to get there is not through legislation.</p>

<a name="70703-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="07070356000244"></a>We are fully committed to publishing central guidance this year to the NHS and partner agencies, which support the development of local services that build on the best of what already exists. We believe that it is much more likely that schemes will develop out of this and be well supported if local benefits are clear to local commissioners, and if a strong evidence-based message is given by the centre. To be really effective, we argue, these schemes need buy-in from all the relevant agencies. We believe that the way to win hearts and minds is by demonstrating the evidence, providing examples of best practice and setting out a framework through guidance. As I said, we shall produce that guidance later this year.</p>

<a name="70703-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="07070356000245"></a>We already know that the evidence from places where schemes work points to the importance of good governance, shared ownership, multidisciplinary working and schemes operating in an integrated system of offender care rather than in isolation.

<a name="70703-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="07070356000246"></a>The benefits may include support for local community safety targets, targets to reduce reoffending, improvements in the appropriateness and timeliness of treatment and earlier intervention&#151;I sense that that was where the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, was coming from on this issue. If those who actually provide services on the ground understand the benefits, the support and enthusiasm will be greater and it is more likely that the services will prosper.</p>

<a name="70703-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="07070356000247"></a>Statutory arrangements are already in place to enable the courts and the police to divert people into treatment for mental disorder. I made this point in the previous debate but I will make it again. The courts already have powers under the Mental Health Act 1983 to divert offenders to hospital for treatment. Under Section 35 of that Act, they may remand an accused person to hospital for a report on their mental condition, and under Section 36 they may remand an accused person to hospital for treatment. Also, the police have the power under that Act to remove a person who appears to be suffering from mental disorder to a place of safety. This is to enable him to be examined by a doctor and interviewed by a social worker, and to allow any necessary arrangements to be made for his treatment or care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="07070356000248"></a>The Government fully accept that more should be done in this area but believe that we should work within the existing legislative framework and seek to bring change through other means. It is far better to convince communities of the need for these services rather than dictate from the centre. We should allow local health commissioners to make their own assessment of the needs of their local communities and provide the right people and services in the right configuration to meet those needs. We take very seriously the concerns of the noble Lord who introduced this amendment and all those who have spoken in favour of it today. I hope that the reassurance that I have offered will provide a good reason for the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, to withdraw his amendment. I was particularly surprised that&#151;</p>

However, as I understand it, it will always be simpler and, from the point of view of the local community and its budget holders, cheaper to allow the custodial solution to be adopted. It will always be difficult to defend, in a local community, the provision of mental health services for offenders when they are not available for non-offenders. I therefore think that, against the Minister&#146;s arguments against a legislative approach, is there not a case for some central setting of a direction and a real tendency to get us to move in the direction of more adequate provision in the urgent situation that we face?</p>

Secondly, we are prepared to give leadership and guidance in this. I made two references to the value of bringing forward guidance, and I remind the right reverend Prelate, who I know is greatly experienced in the field, that we are committed to improving that guidance during the current year.</p>

<a name="70703-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="07070356000251"></a>I shall take up one of the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. He said that he had great difficulty and had to go to the Schizophrenia Society to find out how many diversion schemes there were. The number of schemes increased during the 1990s, when some &#163;10 million of pump priming was provided by the Home Office. We have worked with NACRO, and the database that we have jointly put together currently shows 143 schemes. We can identify other schemes as a product of the <I>Revolving Doors</I> report of 2006. So there is clearly a large number of such schemes in operation, and I am sure that they are doing extremely valuable work. NACRO&#146;s survey says that most of those schemes operate for four or five days a week. Fewer than 20 per cent operate across the spectrum of police station, court and prison, but almost 50 per cent had some joint funding arrangements in place, usually with social services. Some are provided by the voluntary sector.</p>

<a name="70703-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="07070356000252"></a>So there is a lot of data there and a lot more information that I am sure can be taken from the NACRO survey. That shows that progress has been made; it shows also that there is much more to be done. It is important that we persist in developing this. We are trying to ensure that the schemes work without the need for recourse to a centralist, rather bureaucratic framework. We want to encourage them through the adoption of best practice and effective guidance, as I just said to the right reverend Prelate.</p>

<a name="70703-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="07070356000253"></a>I think that I have covered all the other points that were raised during the discussion. In conclusion, I tell the noble Lord that I understand the spirit behind the amendment. Clearly, we are going in the right direction. Much good work is being undertaken; the survey demonstrates that. More be done, more can be achieved. I certainly see the need for it to develop, but we think that the legislative straitjacket that the noble Lord suggests in his amendment is unnecessary and may inhibit the development of good quality schemes. For those reasons, I urge him to withdraw the amendment, but I have found this a useful debate, and the points made have been very valuable to us.</p>

They must be given guidelines and a framework. The Minister mentioned 143 schemes. How many courts are there in which there is no scheme? How many police stations are there where there is no one available on call to come to help? All that links with provision. Is there provision? Is there provision for children? Is there provision for women? What are the arrangements for that? This has been a crying need for goodness knows how many years, and it has failed through lack of overall direction. In a lot of the Bill, the Government have been keen to bring in direction on the grounds that provision has not worked, yet here they are refusing to introduce direction to something that has not worked. That is inconsistent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="07070356000256"></a>Part of the problem is that ministries other than the Ministry of Justice and the Department of Health are involved. The Home Office is involved, because it controls the police. The sense of urgency that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester rightly mentioned is needed in this area, because the problem is not going away; it is getting worse. When I went to Winson Green prison, I discovered that they had a diversion officer in the prison to pick up those who had slipped through the diversionary net to make certain that, if possible, they did not get further than the first night, for which there were special arrangements. That shows that prisons are recognising that the system is not working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="07070356000257"></a>I am glad that the Government are thinking about it, but I wish and hope that the new Secretary of State for Justice will consider the matter with the urgency that it deserves. I anticipate that he will; I know that he understands the problem because I spoke to him about it when he was in his previous post. I am happy to withdraw the amendment, which is not to say that I will not return with it on Third Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="07070356000261"></a>This amendment is to some extent redundant in terms of existing statute. Its intention is to probe Her Majesty&#146;s Government on what steps are being taken to remedy the identified flaws in co-operation between local authorities and prisons and to ask how the proposals in the recent White Paper on children in public care may influence this relationship.</p>

<a name="70703-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="07070356000262"></a>I am most grateful to my noble friend Lady Howe of Idlicote for prompting the amendment and putting her name to it. Her Majesty&#146;s Government funded the National Children&#146;s Bureau to produce a guide for practitioners looking after children in custody. Written by Di Hart it was published last year and entitled <I>Tell Them Not to Forget About Us</I>. From her research Ms Hart concluded:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_97"></a><a name="07070356000369"></a>&#147;The picture that emerged was one of fragmented planning and poor outcomes. There was a tendency for the welfare approach of local authority children&#146;s services to be marginalised whilst youth justice processes took centre stage ... There were examples of effective joint working but these were achieved in spite of, rather than because of, the systems within which practitioners were operating. The children themselves expressed a real fear of being forgotten in the midst of this confusion&#148;.</p>

<a name="70703-0016.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="07070356000263"></a>I welcome the recruitment of social work teams to young offender institutions. I am grateful for the replies to my parliamentary Questions on this issue. Can the Minister provide further reassurance that information on a child&#146;s care status is being captured and shared between social care and youth justice agencies or with the adult secure estate? I hope that the Minister can assure me that staff in both the adult and juvenile estate are adequately informed to take appropriate action. I am sure that the Minister will agree with me that looked-after children or young people who are care leavers should not feel abandoned or forgotten by outside agencies. I hope she will recognise that these children and young people value, above all, relationships and need to feel that someone is taking an interest in them. Does the Minister agree that children&#146;s services must remain involved and be the key agency as they have first responsibility for safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children in a way that other agencies do not? I am putting several questions to the Minister and I would be happy to receive a letter in response because of the late hour and the detail required.</p>

<a name="70703-0016.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="07070356000264"></a>Has the fit between sentence plans and care/pathway plans been improved so as to avoid the sentence plans undermining the ultimate success of children in public care and care leavers? How are contacts between children and their local authority social worker maintained? What progress is being made in ensuring the duty of local authorities to maintain contact with care leavers is delivered for young people in custody?</p>

<a name="70703-0016.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="07070356000265"></a>One of the most welcome proposals in the White Paper <I>Care Matters</I>, which was published last month, is the introduction of a veto by children leaving care before the age of 18 and making available foster care placements to the age of 21. What guidance is there for local authorities on how long they should keep a placement in foster care or a children&#146;s home open for a young person who has entered custody?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="07070356000266"></a>Government departments have recently been restructured. Where does the ministerial responsibility for young people from public care in custody now lie? The role of personal officers is particularly crucial to young people who have been in care as they are most likely to have an unsatisfactory family experience. The Chief Inspector of Prisons has often reported that the personal officer role is insufficiently developed. How is the Minister addressing this? Where there are 60 young people to three or so officers in the wing of a young offender institution, the personal officer role may be particularly difficult to implement. While recognising current constraints, will the Minister be seeking to improve that ratio as soon as possible?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="07070356000267"></a>I have one further point about supervision. I am not sure that I expressed my gratitude well enough but I was most grateful when the Minister responded to my questions about the training and supervision of prison officers. I recognise what he says about supervision and the informal manner in which prison officers are with each other much of the time but these people are very vulnerable&#151;especially in view of the context of the recent debate on mental health issues and concerns about women in custody as well. Senior officers and junior officers need private time to talk, for example, about how an officer feels when a young person self-harms and how one carries on in one&#146;s job. How does an officer deal with being scared by someone with whom they are dealing? How can they talk in public about something like that? Sometimes they may simply feel like hitting an inmate because they drive them up the wall. How does an officer say that publicly to another officer? Such discussions need to have a place, and I am not sure whether they do at the moment. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response, and I beg to move.</p>

My noble friend Lord Listowel is absolutely right that these are the most vulnerable children. They may have committed some pretty heinous offences. Equally, however, we know that their backgrounds were almost certainly a major contributory factor. <I>Care Matters</I> was a brilliant White Paper, and we very much hope that it will deal with most of these children&#146;s needs. If my interpretation of it is right, it will apply at least as much to children who have ended up in prison, even though they were originally in care. The important thing is that the local authorities do not forget them&#151;indeed, are not allowed to forget them&#151;and see them as a continuing responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="07070356000269"></a>Brilliant voluntary organisations such as Home-Start, and certainly the churches, which are involved in many activities such as mentoring and really befriending a child in this situation who has probably never really had a loving, caring parent, are absolutely essential. It is absolutely crucial that extra special attention is paid to seeing that there are proper arrangements for accommodation, training and jobs. May we be reassured that the children who have ended up in prison will be at the top of the list? For goodness&#146; sake, let us use the resources that we hope will be saved as the cycle of deprivation continues unless stopped, with children ending up yet again in

One example of good practice comes from Northern Ireland. Lay representation for young offenders in institutions has been pioneered by Nacro, which has provided trained volunteers with whom young people in custody can share their personal problems and complaints. The representatives have been able not only to befriend them, which my noble friend Lady Howe mentioned, but to present their cases at disciplinary and other hearings. Is there an equivalent scheme in England and Wales? If not, could something similar be piloted, at least in a few areas?</p>

We have had a very powerful exposition in support of the amendment from the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and some very helpful comments from the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. I know of a few pilot schemes that are similar to that described by the noble Lord, but I do not know whether any match it precisely. He made some very interesting points about how a peer group can assist young people to heal and change. That is an important consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="07070356000272"></a>The noble Earl&#146;s interest in this issue is well known. I commend him for it. His amendment draws attention to the disproportionate number of young people in the youth justice system who are looked after or who have previously been looked after by a local authority. I agree with him about the quality and nature of the Government&#146;s White Paper. I could not have been more pleased by its contents and I share the warmth and enthusiasm that many people have expressed about it. Your Lordships know that that was published only a week ago. We set out how determined we are to improve the plight of children in care. We committed to the fact that the aspiration of the state for such children should be no less than each parent&#146;s aspiration would be for their own child. We set out firm actions to make that happen. Therefore, the noble Earl is right to say that that aspiration&#151;that responsibility&#151;goes beyond the literal legal limit as regards their age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="07070356000273"></a>In the White Paper, we recognise that, despite improvements to the outcomes of the lives of children and young people in care in recent years, there remains a gap between the outcomes of those in care and the outcomes of all children. For example, 9.6 per cent of children in care, aged 10 or over, were cautioned or convicted for an offence during the year&#151;almost three times the rate for all children of that age.</p>

<p><a name="0707045000013"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0707045000223"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Viscount Ullswater):</b> Before the Minister moves that the first order be considered, I remind noble Lords that in the case of each order the Motion before the Committee will be that the Committee consider the order in question. The Motion to approve the order will be moved in the Chamber in the usual way. If there is a Division in the House, the Committee will adjourn for 12 minutes rather than 10 because the House has now given itself 11 minutes to get into the Lobbies.</p>

<p><a name="0707045000014"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0707045000224"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Working Time (Amendment) Regulations 2007.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000015"></a>The noble Lord said: Over the past decade the Government have put in place a framework of employment rights that provides decent minimum standards in the workplace while ensuring labour market flexibility and competitiveness. In 1998, we introduced a statutory entitlement to four weeks&#146; paid holiday for the first time, yet we are aware that some employers count time off for bank and public holidays against that four-week entitlement. We believe that that is unfair, and in our 2005 election manifesto we proposed to address this anomaly by increasing the current four-week entitlement to 5.6 weeks&#151;from 20 days to 28 days&#151;for those working full time and pro rata for part-time staff.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000016"></a>These proposals will be good news for the 6 million workers who will benefit from increased holiday as a result, particularly the low-paid, women and part-time workers who currently receive the least holiday. The benefits of holidays are clear: time away from the workplace reduces stress, increases quality of life and supports family life. However, we recognise that proposals that benefit so many will impose additional costs on businesses that currently give the bare minimum holiday entitlement. We have proposed a number of measures to help employers adjust their practices to comply with these regulations. First, we propose that the increase will be introduced in two phases with a holiday entitlement rising to 24 days this October and to 28 days from April 2009. We had intended to introduce all the additional holiday by October 2008, but on further consideration of the costs, particularly for the health and social care sector, we have delayed it until April 2009.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000017"></a>We are aware that some employers, particularly in the social care sector, face challenges in recruiting and training staff and are required by statute to maintain  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC92"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC92</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>certain staffing levels. The increase in holiday entitlement may place particular strain on employers and staff in providing cover for the additional holiday, and we therefore propose a transitional period until April 2009 during which time payment in lieu of the additional holiday will be permitted. From April 2009, workers must be able to take their holiday as holiday, as our intention is to enable people to have more time away from the workplace rather than to receive additional payment instead.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000018"></a>Most employers already give their staff 28 or more days&#146; holiday a year. During the extensive consultation process on these changes, such employers expressed concern that they would face uncertainty and administrative costs as a result of these regulations, even though they may already comply. We are clear that we want to support such good employers while protecting vulnerable workers. We have therefore proposed an exclusion to these regulations. Where employers already provide staff with 28 days holiday, pro rata for part-timers, they will be excluded from the regulations. This incentive for early compliance will remove an uncertainty or administrative burden from good employers resulting from this regulation, while ensuring that vulnerable workers get the benefit of the increased entitlement.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000019"></a>In developing these proposals, we have consulted widely with employers and workers. These measures, along with the detailed guidance we will be providing for employers and workers shortly, balance the demands of workers for a better quality of life with the needs of business for a productive and motivated workforce. The proposals have been welcomed by the TUC and employer organisations such as the CBI, the Institute of Directors, the British Chambers of Commerce and the Engineering Employers&#146; Federation. A modern economy can thrive only by adopting employment practices that recognise the central contribution made by individual workers in the business&#146;s success and rewarding their efforts in such a way that demonstrates that they are valued and respected.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000020"></a>These proposals deliver further fairness at work while advancing our economic competitiveness. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</p>

As my honourable friend in another place has already said, striking the right balance between family and working life is vital to the interests of the employer and the employee. In families where, often, partners are both working, holiday time is essential for people not only to recharge their batteries, but to have quality time with their children. For employers,  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC93"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC93</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>staff are often the most important asset. Therefore, ensuring that staff are properly rested makes good business sense. We have seen in the regulatory impact assessment that stress is one of the critical drivers of sickness-related leave in this country. I suspect that we could debate the cause and effect between this measure and reducing such leave, but anything that helps to reduce sickness-related leave and boost productivity has to be welcome.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000023"></a>Working hours are generally a matter to be agreed between employers and employees. Britain must retain its opt-out from the working time directive. To put it on the record, employers across the UK should see and take advantage of the benefits of offering flexible employment. Government should not be regulating to require flexibility but, rather, deregulating to permit it.</p>

<p><a name="0707045000024"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0707045000226"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> Like the noble Baroness, I welcome the regulations. As somebody who has sat through the debates on working time and related matters since I first took this opposition job in 1997, I must comment on the remarkable change in the atmosphere of these debates. It is to the credit of the Government that they have changed the culture, with an acceptance by all three political parties that these changes and the protections given to workers are essential.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000025"></a>Reading the Committee deliberations in another place&#151;which, as we all know, tends to be much more confrontational than this House&#151;I thought that the way that all three political parties, particularly the Conservative Party, have now completely changed their attitude to these issues was quite remarkable. That is welcome for the good of the country, and the Government need to be congratulated on sticking to their guns in this area.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000026"></a>The regulations, which provide for four weeks holiday, amend the 1998 regulations. When they were brought in, no one assumed that employers would take the view that bank holidays should be included in the holiday entitlement, particularly for low-paid workers. I have seen an estimate that roughly 6 million workers&#151;particularly the lower paid&#151;suffer having bank holidays deducted from their statutory requirement for holiday. For that reason alone the regulations are welcome. By comparison with most of our competitors, we do not have as many bank holidays: we have eight days, whereas many of our competitor countries have 14 or 15. Indeed, the United States of America will have a major holiday tomorrow. So that provision is welcome.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000027"></a>I also welcome the fact that it will be made more difficult for employers to force employees to take payment in lieu of holiday, which is another reform in the regulations on which the Government should be congratulated. I very much support the regulations.</p>

<h5><a name="0707045000215"></a>3.41 pm</h5>

<p><a name="0707045000030"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0707045000228"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Companies (Political Expenditure Exemption) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000031"></a>The noble Lord said: As part of the implementation of the Companies Act 2006 the Government have laid the draft Companies (Political Expenditure Exemption) Order to replace the existing order, SI 2001/445. This order is drafted in simpler language to correspond with the simpler format and drafting of the 2006 Act. It is being made under Section 377 of the Companies Act 2006, and its content was debated in a previous form in this House in 2001 in a very short debate. I am hoping that we will be able to follow the same form today.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000032"></a>I make it absolutely clear that this is not an order relating to party funding or party governance. It relates to corporate governance and how companies manage their affairs between the shareholders and the directors. Under Section 366 of the Companies Act 2006, companies must seek prior authorisation from their shareholders for political expenditure. This draft order exempts companies such as newspapers and other companies whose ordinary business includes the preparation, publication or dissemination of news material from having to seek authorisation. The only substantive change from the existing order is to extend the exemption to independent election candidates. Political expenditure under the 2006 Act is defined as any expenditure incurred on any publicity material or activities that may be intended to affect public support. This now includes public support for independent election candidates as well as political parties and political organisations. The exemption applies only to political expenditure. Companies that fall under this exemption will remain subject to the full requirements of the Act in respect of political donations.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000033"></a>The Companies Act 2006 has simplified and modernised company law. It has substantially rewritten company law to make it easier to understand and more flexible, especially for small businesses. This exemption order supports the objective of the Act, which is to pursue the principles of better regulation. It would be impractical to expect companies involved in journalism and news to pass resolutions to publish editorials or comment of a political nature. This draft order maintains a framework of company law that is proportionate and does not impose unnecessary burdens on business. As was also highlighted several times in the debates held on the existing order in 2001, the draft order supports the important principle of press freedom enjoyed in British public life. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000034"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Companies (Political Expenditure Exemption) Order 2007. <I>20th report from the Statutory Instruments Committee.</I>&#151;(<I>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting</I>.)</p>

I thought that I was going to get up and save the unions, as it were, but then I discovered that it did not apply to them at all. So I can only agree that this is an administrative measure, designed to replace the Companies (EU Political Expenditure) Exemption Order 2001 with one relating to the Companies Act. As such, we have no substantive points to make and I am happy to sit down.</p>

<p><a name="0707045000036"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0707045000230"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> Having heard my intervention on a question from the noble Baroness in the Chamber on the previous occasion, the Minister might not have expected me to have another swipe at those who will benefit from this change. If we were being awkward, we might well ask why we should not make it more difficult for quoted newspaper groups to influence voters in a referendum on European matters, which would of course be the effect of the order not being passed. As I understand it, were there to be a referendum on the treaty, which it does not look as though there will be, then the quoted newspaper groups&#151;I think that there are probably two whose editorials on the referenda we could write&#151;would have constraints imposed on them under the Companies Act 2006. Having said that, that is probably not the way to constrain what I like to refer to as the foreign-controlled press, but I should be interested to know the genesis of this order. Who has complained? Who has said that there is a problem? Reading the previous legislation, one would assume that it was covered anyway. Therefore, is this a case of people gearing themselves up for a campaign on issues where we would probably disagree with them, and have the Government been lobbied to bring in this order to that effect?</p>

<p><a name="0707045000037"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0707045000231"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> I am advised that the order is very similar to the one passed in 2001. We brought it forward again due to changes in the Act. I absolutely take on board the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall. When I was being briefed, I thought about the role of book publishers in this regard, because they publish political books. Would it be sensible to go to the shareholders every time you published Peter Mandelson on the Blair revolution? The answer is no. For me, the bottom line is freedom of the press. Going back to the earlier question in the Chamber, one may not like what the papers say but it is essential that they have the right to say it.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000042"></a>The noble Lord said: This draft order will deregulate archaic legislation that dates back to the 19th century legislation. In fact, today I am introducing the policy that was announced by Michael Howard in 1994; it has taken that long to get this through. After that, the Better Regulation Task Force established by the noble Lord, Lord Haskins, and the Cabinet Office&#146;s Better Regulation Team have considered this an area long overdue for reform.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000043"></a>I understand this draft order is not controversial and has been warmly welcomed by relevant industry bodies that represent game dealers and retailers, and also by those who shoot game. Indeed, last July at the president&#146;s lunch at the Game Fair, I announced that we were going to do this, and I shall go back later this month and say that I have delivered in one year something that took 17 years to get through.</p>

<p><a name="0707045000044"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="0707045000235"></a>Noble Lords:</b> Hear, hear!</p>

<p><a name="0707045000045"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0001.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="0707045000236"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> Full and proper consultation on this draft order took place in 2006, and respondents overwhelmingly supported the three proposals for change to game licensing. The draft order applies to England and Wales only. In broad terms, it will reduce bureaucracy for those shooting or dealing in game and will prevent unnecessary restriction of their otherwise lawful activities. It will also save central government resources, which are currently being put into the administration of a licensing system which is not serving any useful purpose whatever.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000046"></a>The three key changes that the draft order will introduce are as follows: it will remove the requirement to hold a game licence in order to take or kill game; remove the requirement to hold a local authority licence and an excise licence, commonly known as &#147;dealing licences&#148;, in order to deal in game; and remove the restrictions on dealing in game birds and venison during the close season, permitting game to be sold by everyone all year round, providing that the game was lawfully killed.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000047"></a>The draft order will also ensure that necessary protections are retained. For example, it will make it a criminal offence to sell game birds which you know or have reason to believe have been unlawfully killed or taken. The new offence is necessary to maintain the protection afforded to game birds during the close season while allowing the sale of game lawfully taken during the open season to be sold all year round. That was brought about by refrigeration&#151;we are just catching up. Noble Lords should be reassured that protections for wildlife during close seasons are not linked to the requirement for a game licence and these protections will be retained. Provisions relating to poaching game and shooting it outside the relevant open season will also be retained.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC97"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC97</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000048"></a>These new regulations will make the selling and dealing of game less bureaucratic and will benefit consumers, retailers and game shoots. Game shooting interests will also gain as there will no longer be a licence required to kill or take game. The original intention of the licence to kill or take game was probably to limit hunting to those who were able to pay a significant amount for an annual game licence&#151;and in those days it was a significant annual amount, which is no longer the case. Game shooting is now enjoyed by people from a cross-section of society. Some 480,000 people shoot game, which is an incredible number, creating some 70,000 full-time jobs and bringing to the economy some &#163;1.6 billion. Two million hectares of land are preserved for game, so it is a big business in that sense, but it is also very costly in terms of regulating licences. Some local authorities do not charge in terms of dealers, while others charge a large amount. The game licence itself costs between &#163;2 and &#163;6. If that had been raised in line with inflation from when it was introduced, the cost would be &#163;1,600, which shows how out of date it is.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000049"></a>For the avoidance of doubt, the Crown post offices, which issue the main licence, will not really lose out, as they do not make any profit or get income from the licences. We pay them some &#163;300,000. In fact, abolishing this will probably save the post offices money rather than make them lose out. The rural or sub-postmasters are not involved in this process anyway, so there will be no effect there. I beg to move.</p>

We support this game order which, as he said, catches up with the commitment that was made. I have one or two questions on it, but in the first place I shall make one or two general points.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000052"></a>Refrigeration has made a difference. It will mean that game will be able to be sold commercially, which we welcome. Hitherto it has been restricted to a certain season. The Minister also said that 480,000 people are employed in game and that it is a very important part of the rural community.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000053"></a>I recognise the role which the various shooting organisations play in the conservation of wildlife. It seems strange that we always talk about killing animals, when those organisations help conserve and protect other species of wildlife. We put on record all too infrequently our thanks to all those who are involved. If my noble friend Lord Peel were not occupied with his duties as Lord Chamberlain, he would certainly have participated in this debate, because he has reflected over many years the enormous contribution that gamekeepers in particular have made on moorland&#151;the Yorkshire Moors, for example&#151;and in many other places.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000054"></a>I think that all Members of the Committee will welcome the removal of burdens and red tape. Why

It is perhaps because Scotland is devolved, but it will surely raise issues in cross-Border territories. If one is domiciled in England, the English law will apply, but it might be that one shoots in Scotland.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000055"></a>I understand the reason for retaining the provisions for those likely to be involved in poaching; that is, unlawfully taking game when they are not entitled so to do.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000056"></a>It may be that Sundays are already covered in the Act and I have missed it, but does the order cover six days or seven? While certain members of the community would welcome it covering seven days a week, there may be others who consider Sundays to be precious.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000057"></a>In recognising the contribution that those involved in the shooting of game have made to the broader conservation of wildlife, I thank the Minister for introducing the order.</p>

It will be sad to go into a shop selling game and not see the provisions of the 1831 Act prominently displayed on the wall, but that is part of the deregulation and follows on from what the Minister said in the House the other day about removing regulations.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000059"></a>Regulation 5 discusses the sale of game birds. Will the burden of proof be on those who transport game birds to say where they obtained the birds, because that might be problematic? Perhaps the onus will be on the police to prove where the birds originated, because, in many cases, there will not be a bill of sale on such birds.</p>

<p><a name="0707045000061"></a>I think that I am right in saying, if your Lordships will excuse the most appalling pun, that I started this hare running some 14 and a half years ago, on 10 November 1992, when I berated my noble friend Lord Ferrers, then my late and much missed friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrechnish, and finally Lord Annaly. On 21 July 1994, I finally extracted from Lord Annaly the following statement:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0707045000204"></a>&#147;My right honourable friend has decided that the licensing requirements for those who stake or kill game, contained in the Game Act 1831 and the Game Licences Act 1860, should be abolished&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707045000194"></a>There was one very important sentence after that which I will come to in a minute.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000062"></a>I was told, back in the early 1990s, that game licences for those who shoot game&#151;I am concentrating entirely on that&#151;were only just positive in net terms. Some 98 per cent of the cost of a licence was spent on getting the revenue in. I disputed that but, be that as it may, 12p out of &#163;6 did not seem an awfully good return on the money.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000063"></a>There is a point that I think is very important, which my noble friend Lady Byford raised, but in a slightly different context. The final sentence of the quote from <I>Hansard</I> read:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0707045000205"></a>&#147;Such abolition will also apply in Scotland&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>21/7/94; col. <I>WA</I> 45-46.]</p>

<p><a name="0707045000195"></a>I fully understand why it no longer applies in Scotland, because this is a devolved matter. However, there is a very real problem&#151;at least, I think there is, and I hope that the Minister can put me straight on this. Let me use myself as an example and suppose that I was asked to shoot in Scotland on a Saturday but was unable to leave your Lordships' House, or wherever else I happened to be, until the Friday afternoon. As the law in Scotland stands, I would require a game licence, but I cannot get one in England and by the time I get to Scotland, the post office is closed. At that stage, I am about to shoot illegally in Scotland. I imagine&#151;again, the Minister may put me straight on this&#151;that it is not permitted for my host to buy a game licence for me since this is a personal licence with my name on it. I simply do not understand how one could get out of this jam other than Her Majesty's Government persuading the Scottish Parliament as strongly as possible that it should follow the example of this quite excellent order.</p>

<p><a name="0707045000064"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0707045000240"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I hope I can answer the noble Lord&#146;s final point by saying that during the course of this year, of which half is left, the Scottish Executive will be reviewing the situation regarding game licences in Scotland. I hope that they will arrive at a sensible conclusion, as I am sure that they will seek to do, as we do not want any cross-border issues like this. I suspect that the position is exactly the same in that it is not cost-effective to issue game licences. The legislation would be the original legislation. The money would be chickenfeed&#151;it is an excessive piece of bureaucracy and an archaic piece of law.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000065"></a>The consultation for the order included the question of Sundays, which proved incredibly controversial. This is not to say that it was good or bad, but it was so controversial that it would not be suitable for a regulatory reform order. The reason the House has approved the regulatory reform order process for changing primary legislation is because, generally speaking, it would not be done on a controversial issue, for which primary legislation would be required. In the consultation, support for two of the three issues to get on with it was over 90 per cent, while support for the other one was in the 70s.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000066"></a>The noble Baroness referred to poaching. That part of the law is not being changed; taking game illegally is still illegal. I hope that Scotland will review matters. On the sale of game birds, the burden of proof will be on the prosecuting authority. I understand from my background notes that the policing of the legislation will be done by the police. The prosecuting authority, whether it is the local authority or other such body, will need to prove whether the birds were taken illegally. That is in response to the point of the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000067"></a>I hope that we can reach a satisfactory outcome regarding the Scottish situation. A similar range of legislation applies there, and a review will be under way during the course of this year. I think I have answered all the questions, but if not, I will try again.</p>

<p><a name="0707045000069"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0707045000242"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> No, it is not possible to shoot on a Sunday, although there are some quirks in relation to this. During my year at the Northern Ireland Office, some of the situations there were explained to me. It is quite surprising what you can and cannot do on a Sunday. Some things can be shot but I do not remember the classifications and I am not going to guess them. As I said, the issue was raised in the consultation and there was feedback, both for and against, but it was too controversial for an order of this nature. Therefore, if there were a procedure on this, it would probably have to be done by primary legislation.</p>

This order covers three areas, which I delineated at the beginning, where there is a massive consensus for change and where a regulatory reform order would be the way to get it through in view of the lack of parliamentary time. There was a time when newspapers were not published on Christmas Day, but I think that that has long since gone, so things are changing. However, we have not legislated for any change in respect of Christmas Day or Sundays. The only changes that we are legislating for are the three set out in the order.</p>

<h5><a name="0707045000217"></a>4.07 pm</h5>

<p><a name="0707045000073"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0707045000245"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Regulatory Reform (Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000074"></a>The noble Lord said: The Government believe that proportionate and risk-based regulation is key to encouraging an innovative and flourishing financial services sector in the UK. The role of the Financial Services Authority is important in this regard. The Government recognise that the FSA, and business, would benefit from the reduction or removal of certain burdens to support such a regulatory approach. As a result, we propose a number of amendments to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 that will also enable the FSA to operate more efficiently.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000075"></a>The Treasury consulted extensively on the proposals&#151;twice, in fact. Indeed, some of the proposals originate from a stakeholder consultation into the effectiveness of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 two years after its enactment. Those consulted on the draft order included key  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC101"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC101</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>stakeholders within the FSA&#146;s jurisdiction, as well as consumer bodies and trade associations. The first consultation exercises consulted on a broader range of proposals than contained in this order. Three measures proved somewhat controversial and were not pursued as a result of concerns expressed by stakeholders. That aside, there was broad support for the proposals put forward in the second consultation.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000076"></a>There are a number of measures in the order but I shall try to run through them as briefly as possible. Article 3 would make it easier for partnerships to continue trading and remain authorised by the FSA following a change in membership. Such an amendment would benefit small businesses in particular.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000077"></a>Article 4 would remove the requirement on the FSA to consult EEA regulators in certain, limited circumstances. The current arrangement over-implements various EC directives, and the proposed amendment would remove this element of gold-plating.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000078"></a>The amendments outlined in Articles 5 to 8 would simplify a number of procedural requirements that the FSA is obliged to fulfil, even when an issuer himself seeks to discontinue or suspend the listing of a security. This includes the FSA giving reasons for its decision, and the right of the issuer to make representations and to refer the matter to the tribunal. Clearly, these procedures are entirely appropriate when the discontinuance or suspension has been initiated by the FSA and the issuer is resisting such action. However, when the discontinuance or suspension is initiated at the request of the issuer, these procedural requirements appear to serve no useful purpose.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000079"></a>The reforms impose some new procedural burdens on the FSA in order to protect the rights and freedoms of the issuer in cases where the FSA decides not to grant a request to de-list or suspend the listing. These include a right for the issuer to apply to the Financial Services and Markets Tribunal if the FSA rejects its application. The additional burdens are judged by the Government to be proportionate and fairly balanced, and I emphasise that when the order was considered by the Committee in the other place, due agreement was given to this point.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000080"></a>Article 9 would simplify the procedures that the FSA has to undergo when cancelling a sponsor&#146;s permission. This will take effect only in cases when the cancellation is at the request of the sponsor. The amendment will deny access to the tribunal to those who make an application to cancel their permission to act as a sponsor. However, I emphasise that the cancellation will be by consent. As such, the Government do not consider that anyone will be prevented from exercising any rights or freedoms that he could reasonably expect to exercise.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000081"></a>At present, the FSA is able only to waive or modify a certain number of its rules for people and firms it authorises. The amendments contained in Articles 10 to 12 would enable the FSA to waive or modify its rules for unauthorised persons as well if, for example, it believes the rules concerned are unduly  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC102"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>burdensome. This amendment requires the FSA to satisfy itself on a number of issues before using this power.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000082"></a>The final two amendments relate to the provision of FSA guidance. Article 13 would reduce some of the requirements placed on the FSA when consulting on its own guidance. Article 14 would enable the board to delegate the task of issuing guidance to a committee or sub-committee of the board.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000083"></a>The Government believe that these measures, taken together, will enable the FSA to take a better targeted, more streamlined and risk-based approach to its work. Firms will benefit indirectly from this more flexible approach and directly through the changes in the scope of FSA waivers and modifications.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000084"></a>The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has considered the proposals and regards them as making proper use of the powers under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. I thank the members of the committee for their opinion and for their work in scrutinising the draft order. The Committee in the other place also considered that the proposals were within the vires of the 2001 Act and has given its assent to the order. As the order was unanimously approved in the other place, I have hopes in commending it to the Committee today. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000085"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Regulatory Reform (Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) Order 2007. <I>11th report from the Regulatory Reform Committee.</I><I>&#151;(Lord Davies of Oldham.)</I></p>

As he said, it was considered by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in another place and by the same committee in your Lordships' House and, as he implied, it passed with flying colours. It might seem that there is therefore little to add, but I never like to pass up an opportunity to talk about deregulation with the Minister.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000087"></a>The order contains a number of eliminations or reductions in regulatory burdens. As the Minister knows, my party believes in reducing regulatory burdens and we do not object to the order&#151;indeed, we support it. However, it is worth pointing out that only two of the eight measures in the order actually reduce regulatory burdens on businesses; most of the rest relieve regulatory burdens on the FSA. I am not saying that that is a bad thing but it is not what my party yearns for when we talk about reducing regulatory burdens. Reducing the burden on bureaucrats is fine but it does not have a real impact on what we should be trying to do&#151;reducing the impact of regulatory burdens on businesses.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000088"></a>I have a couple of points of detail for the Minister. I was surprised that during the consultation there was no pushback against the proposal to amend Section 157, which would reduce the requirements on the FSA to consult on guidance. I have always seen consultation as a fundamental part of good regulation. It is part of the better-regulation guidelines. Having removed the requirement on the  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC103"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC103</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>FSA, there is the possibility that some guidance will be issued without full consultation. Are the Government satisfied that the FSA has processes in place to ensure that it consults when appropriate, and do they have processes in place to keep an eye on what the FSA will be doing with its new freedom to avoid consultation?</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000089"></a>The other surprising aspect of the lack of pushback from the stakeholders, whom I freely admit were consulted, was the issue of guidance being delegated to committees. That is proposed in the amendment to paragraph 5 of Schedule 1. I am sure that much guidance is routine and therefore capable of being delegated. However, the Minister has already referred to the possibility of gold-plating, an issue we often discuss when considering regulatory burdens. People do not usually set out to gold-plate; it is something that enthusiasts tend to do. Having appointed what will doubtless be enthusiasts and anoraks to the committees and sub-committees that will approve the guidance, how will the Government, with the FSA, ensure that those well-meaning individuals do not end up creating new gold-plating after taking the opportunity of this regulatory reform order to reduce some from the past?</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000090"></a>Finally, how many pages of the legendary five-foot rule book are being eliminated by the order? I suspect that it will make no dent in the rule book. When does the Minister expect the FSA to deliver a significant reduction in its rule book? We know that the FSA has for some time been talking a good story on reducing the size of the rule book and moving to principles-based regulation but it is my understanding that the regulation rule book would, if printed out, still come to nearly my height.</p>

<p><a name="0707045000091"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0707045000247"></a>Lord Newby:</b> I thank the Minister for his detailed explanation of the order and congratulate him on still being in his post. I think that this is the first time that the three of us have had the delight of debating since the new Prime Minister came into position and the reshuffle took place. We are delighted that the noble Lord remains in the Treasury brief.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000092"></a>This is by any standards a fairly minor measure; its individual components are acceptable to us and we support it. My question follows on from the noble Baroness&#146;s last comments. Can we envisage further measures to reduce regulatory requirements in the financial services sector or are those who have been toiling in the vineyard to produce this measure hanging up their boots for another season, so that we should not expect anything else? The noble Lord said that a number of further proposals originally contained in the measure have been dropped, two of which relate to consultation. Have they been dropped for good or is there an intention to bring them back? The fact that the controversial matters related to consultation underlines the difficulty of deregulation. The easiest thing to suggest stopping is consultation. It is very easy to say, &#147;Oh, let&#146;s not bother consulting on all that again&#148;. Of all the regulatory burdens, the burden placed on companies to be consulted is probably the one that they worry about least. So my question is narrow: will the three elements of the

Subject to that, we support the regulations.</p>

I did not doubt that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, would take the full opportunity that this modest measure offers to talk further about reducing the burdens of regulation. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Newby, for his kind words. It is an absolute delight for us to be engaged in our usual places with regard to this order and, I imagine, on more substantial matters in the months to come. As the Committee will recognise, I canvassed vigorously for our relationship to remain as it has been over the past year or eighteen months. I shall be working hard at the next election to make sure that our arrangements remain exactly the same.</p>

<p><a name="0707045000094"></a>The noble Baroness asked about one or two issues. The FSA is still obliged to consult, but, attached to that, a cost-benefit analysis on the matter is removed from the consultation, which makes the issue that much more intensive. We are seeking to reduce the levels of consultation. I bear in mind what the noble Lord, Lord Newby, said on consultation. Of course, the Government will keep under review the working of the FSA with regard to consultation. The noble Lord said that businesses worry least about that element of regulation. I am not sure that that is altogether true. We have all heard complaints from time to time about the excessive amount of material that descends on companies to which they are expected to make some response. But I hear what he says and I assure him that we dropped the proposals because it was clear at that time that what was being identified did not meet the response of the stakeholders. That is why we have taken that position. The noble Lord will recognise that this measure is a product of the very exemplar that he is enjoining me and the Government to follow with regard to necessary consultation.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000095"></a>The noble Baroness was perhaps a little less generous than is her wont on occasions. She is right that the main proposals reduce the procedural obligations on the FSA. I think that, wearing another hat and on other occasions, she is often quite enthusiastic that the problems of bureaucracy should be reduced. Therefore, she should welcome this measure, which seeks to streamline the work of the FSA and make it more the owners and stakeholders with whom it has relationships.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000096"></a>Some of the proposals will benefit firms directly and indirectly. They will remove administrative inconvenience and the time taken to apply for reauthorisation if a partnership or unincorporated association is dissolved. They will also benefit from the FSA being able to produce guidance in a somewhat more flexible manner. I recognise that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, is hinting, but the trouble with flexibility is that it may not meet everyone&#146;s requirements. It is helpful that we seek to build on good practice and see the FSA relating to its stakeholders effectively. The proof of this pudding will be in the eating.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000097"></a>There are also cost savings. The Government anticipate that the total administrative saving for firms is likely to be between &#163;7.5 million and &#163;9.3 million. The total administrative saving for the FSA, which the noble Lord contended would be the chief beneficiary from these proposals, is perhaps less: we can see savings of between &#163;50,000 and &#163;115,000 for the FSA. So there are direct benefits for firms and the FSA on which we can put figures.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000098"></a>The noble Baroness always questions me about reductions in the rule book and in the weight of legislation. I am never able to respond to her as accurately as I would like because they are very difficult questions, such as how many pages we have effectively reduced the book by. We are making a dent in the rule book with this issue. We are concerned to reduce the rule book. The work we are doing to reduce the book with regard to money laundering is evidence of the Government&#146;s intention. However, the noble Baroness makes an entirely proper point, and I always sound a little less forthright than I would wish because I am never able to answer her. One day I will be able to count not the pages but perhaps the lines that we have withdrawn on some very small measure&#151;I imagine it will be a microscopic measure, if I am ever given that opportunity. I look forward to that day hugely.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="0707045000007"></a>Official Secrets Act 1989 (Prescription) (Amendment) Order 2007</h3>
<h5><a name="0707045000218"></a>4.27 pm</h5>

<p><a name="0707045000100"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0707045000249"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Official Secrets Act 1989 (Prescription) (Amendment) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000101"></a>The noble Lord said: This order is made under the Official Secrets Act 1989. Under that Act, it is an offence for a Crown servant or government contractor to make a damaging disclosure of any information within particular categories which is or has been in his possession by virtue of his position, unless he has lawful authority to do so. People who are not Crown servants can be treated as such for the purposes of the Act by being designated in an order. The order before us does that for the members and employees of two separate organisations: the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and the Independent Police Complaints Commission. I will deal with each of them in turn.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000102"></a>First, I shall deal with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. One of the categories of information protected by the Official Secrets Act is that relating to defence and security, including information about nuclear technology and nuclear materials. The boards and employees of existing companies with access to such information&#151;British Nuclear Fuels and the UK Atomic Energy Authority&#151;are already designated under the Act.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000103"></a>The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is an executive non-departmental public body set up on 1  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC106"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC106</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>April 2005. It is responsible for the decommissioning and clean-up of the UK&#146;s civil nuclear legacy and has responsibility for nuclear sites previously operated by British Nuclear Fuels and the UK Atomic Energy Authority. It owns the plants and facilities of British Nuclear Fuels and manages clean-up operations at the UK Atomic Energy Authority&#146;s sites.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000104"></a>British Nuclear Fuels and the UK Atomic Energy Authority have been restructured so that they now operate their facilities, both for clean-up and continuing commercial operations, under contract to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, rather than as principals. Employees of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority therefore have access to the same information as those of British Nuclear Fuels and the UK Atomic Energy Authority. So it follows that members and employees of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and employees and board members of any future subsidiary should also be treated as Crown servants for the purposes of the Act. The draft order will achieve this by designating them as such. This is a necessary extension of existing designations, which will ensure the continued protection of information relating to defence and security.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70703-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000105"></a>Additionally, the order will designate members and employees of the Independent Police Complaints Commission as Crown servants for the purposes of the Official Secrets Act. The nature of the commission&#146;s work is such that its members and employees may have access to one or more categories of information protected by the Act, in particular information which, if disclosed, is likely to result in crime or impede the investigation or prosecution of crime. The IPCC has responsibility for, and is guardian of, the police complaints system in England and Wales. All instances of deaths or serious injury following police contact must be reported to the IPCC. It has the power to investigate independently, using its own trained investigators, or manage or supervise investigations by the police into complaints, conduct and death or serious injury recorded under the Police Reform Act 2002. When investigations have been completed, the IPCC will decide whether a file should be submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions for a decision about prosecuting serving police officers. The IPCC also has the power to recommend or direct that disciplinary action is taken against police officers when there is a case to answer.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000106"></a>In discharging these responsibilities, the IPCC commissioners and employees become the holders of confidential and sensitive information that must be used appropriately, particularly where criminal action may potentially be taken. Leaks of such information could prejudice criminal proceedings, either against the officer concerned or against others, and could involve the disclosure of information about police techniques which could prejudice future police operations. While there is a legitimate public interest in the accountability of police forces and their officers for their actions, the interests of justice cannot be served if such information is used inappropriately. In order to conduct effective investigations, the IPCC needs to maintain the trust and confidence of the public and the police service. Witnesses to serious  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC107"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC107</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>incidents, whether from within the police service or the public, may be reluctant to provide evidence if they do not have the confidence that such information will be appropriately protected. Bringing the IPCC commissioners and staff under the Official Secrets Act 1989 will provide reassurance that there is a strong deterrent to unauthorised disclosure of information given in confidence to the IPCC. It is therefore appropriate and necessary to put the IPCC under the same duty of confidentiality as applies to Crown servants under the Official Secrets Act 1989. The draft order will achieve this by designating members and employees of the IPCC as Crown servants. Crucially, the IPCC has requested this change.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000107"></a>Additional categories of &#147;Crown servant&#148; were last designated in 2003, when subsidiaries of Urenco, the uranium enrichment company, were added to the list. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, agreed at that time that references within the Official Secrets Act had to be kept up to date. The order will do that, taking into account the responsibilities which the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority has taken on and ensuring the effectiveness of the restructured police complaints procedure under the IPCC. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000108"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Official Secrets Act 1989 (Prescription) (Amendment) Order 2007. <I>19th report from the Statutory Instruments Committee</I>.&#151;(<I>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting.</I>)</p>

<p><a name="0707045000109"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0707045000250"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I thank the Minister for explaining the order. Perhaps I may say how pleased I and my colleagues are to see him still with his shoulder to the wheel.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000110"></a>We understand and agree that both the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and the Independent Police Complaints Commission regularly handle information, sensitive in its different ways, public disclosure of which would bear serious risks. The Minister will appreciate, though, that while we support the general thrust of the order, we are concerned to avoid an unnecessarily secretive approach. We ought to guard against a situation in which a blanket approach is taken towards a manageable risk. The order leaves open to doubt the exact nature of the information which is not to be disclosed. Will the Minister say precisely what information may not be disclosed?</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000111"></a>Paragraph 4.3 of the Explanatory Memorandum, to which the Minister referred, states in relation to the NDA:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0707045000206"></a>&#147;One of the categories of protected information is information relating to defence and security&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707045000196"></a>That is one of the categories. So what are the others? To what sort of defence information does it refer? I can see that there are security implications in respect of some information of which the NDA will come into possession, but of what information relating to defence that is not also information relating to security could it possibly come into possession? If that has not been fully explained already, I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s explanation.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000112"></a>Paragraph 7.1 refers to disclosure of &#147;certain types of information&#148;. Will the Minister explain exactly  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC108"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what that information is? Specifically, what rules will be applied in determining whether disclosure is permissible?</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000113"></a>Paragraph 7.6 refers to the risk that information gathered during the course of an investigation could impede a prosecution if disclosed without authority. We understand this. Equally, details of unfounded allegations against any person, such as a police officer, should not be allowed to be made public.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000114"></a>Paragraph 7.7 states that any unauthorised disclosure could lead to prosecutions having to be abandoned. Did a particular case or cases cause the Government to decide that this order was necessary? It seems rather surprising that people in the position of members of the IPCC would even contemplate making information of this nature public and risking a case. Equally, it seems surprising that the perceived risk of leakage of sensitive information was not contemplated at the time of establishment of the IPCC. Will the Minister explain why this was?</p>

<p><a name="0707045000115"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0707045000251"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> I add my congratulations to those already offered to the Minister. I am pleased to see him in his place, and I am very pleased to see that he is still dealing with Welsh affairs, which I know from my previous incarnation he handled sensitively and with great talent.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000116"></a>I hope your Lordships, particularly my fellow countrymen who are eagerly awaiting the final matter today, will forgive me if I take some time on this order, because official secrets is a sensitive area, and it is necessary to fire something of a shot across the bows of the new Ministry of Justice.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000117"></a>All Governments love secrecy. I remind your Lordships that it was the Liberal Government of Mr Asquith who introduced the Official Secrets Act 1911, but they included in it a public interest defence; that is, it would be a defence to a prosecution that a disclosure had been made in the public interest. However, in 1989, largely due to the Clive Ponting case, who your Lordships will recall was a civil servant who had leaked details of the course of the &#147;Belgrano&#148; at the time of the Falklands war and revealed that it was heading out of the exclusion zone and not into it as had previously been said, the Official Secrets Act was amended and the public interest offence was removed. One thing introduced at that time, among others, was the removal of a defence for newspapers. Under Section 5 of the 1989 Act, it was made a specific offence for newspapers or journalists to publish secret information that had been leaked to them by a Crown servant in contravention of Section 3 of the Act. Therefore, under pressure, it was a Conservative Government who tightened things up.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000118"></a>Recently, following the Shayler decision, to which I shall refer later, the Intelligence and Security Committee revealed in its report for 2005-06 that the Home Office had bid for a legislative slot to amend the 1989 Act so as to remove the common law defence of duress of circumstances in order to address unauthorised disclosure by members or former members of the intelligence and security agencies. Indeed, the Government have said that they intend to  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC109"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC109</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>remove the defence of duress of circumstances in order to clamp down on the increase in unauthorised disclosures by members and former members of the agencies and to increase the jail sentence. Mr Blunkett, the then Home Secretary, said that he wanted to place a gag on blabbers. That is perhaps an easier way of understanding the Government&#146;s intention.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000119"></a>I turn to the matters with which we are concerned here. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is, it says, an organisation responsible for managing the clean-up of Britain&#146;s civil nuclear legacy. It is a complex task, costing many billions of pounds and involving a wide range of expertise, and it will last for well over 100 years. What sort of secrets is it seeking to maintain? There are areas&#151;for example, leaks from nuclear installations&#151;where one can envisage that there would be a considerable public interest in disclosure. There has already been substantial publicity in Scotland about leaks from the Dounreay installation. Another important area for consideration is the transport of nuclear materials around the country by train. There have been accidents and concern has been expressed in many quarters. Therefore, it is not likely that there will be agreement over imposing what is essentially a criminal gag on everyone working in that industry or that particular organisation. We do not oppose the order but we want to call attention to the fact that there are instances where the public interest may well be in the disclosure of things that are going on within that industry which the industry might well wish to conceal. As I said, we do not oppose the order but we draw attention to its implications.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000120"></a>The reference in the order to the Independent Police Complaints Commission results from the leaking of information concerning the death of the Brazilian, Jean Charles de Menezes. Your Lordships will recall that the initial explanation for the shooting of that very unfortunate man was that he had leapt over a barrier, run down the stairs and shown signs of being a considerable danger when he was shot. It came to the attention of an employee of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which looked into that shooting, that that was a false picture and that the statements that had been obtained by the police were to the effect that the Brazilian electrician was already being restrained by armed officers when he was shot seven times in the head, that he had not run away or vaulted over the barrier and that he was not acting in any suspicious way. It was as a result of that that the Leicestershire Constabulary was asked to conduct an inquiry into what had happened. The woman in question was arrested in connection with the unauthorised disclosure of IPCC documents and the person to whom she disclosed them, an ITV news editor, was arrested and charged with theft. Then, as happened on a number of previous occasions, the prosecution was dropped.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000121"></a>Your Lordships will recall the case of Miss Gun, which was dropped three days before the trial was due to take place in the Old Bailey. We had a considerable exchange with the former Attorney-General, the  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC110"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, over that. That lady, seeing it as her public duty to ensure that the truth be told, disclosed the matter, and all sorts of things fell upon her head. She was, of course, dismissed from her job. That is, I suppose, how a responsible employer should behave and how the two employers with which we are concerned in this order could behave, without the necessity for bringing criminal charges under the Official Secrets Act.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000122"></a>One should understand the background to these orders. On the one hand, with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, there are dangers that will exist over a long period of time and the possibility of things going wrong being concealed; on the other hand, with the IPCC, a specific case went all the way to court before it was thought that it should not proceed any further.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000123"></a>A review of security within the IPCC was carried out by Mr Bill Taylor. His fifth recommendation was that a specific arrestable offence be created for the unauthorised release of information by a member of IPCC staff in relation to the IPCC role. That was the solution that the review into the security of that organisation put forward. In fact, the outcome was that after consideration,</p>
<ul><a name="0707045000211"></a>&#147;the IPCC decided to pursue an alternative strategy involving an amendment to the Official Secrets Act. The Home Office has been asked to include the change at an appropriate opportunity&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0707045000197"></a>This is that opportunity, and that is what is being done today. It is acceptable only on the basis that the defence of necessity, which was outlined by the Court of Appeal in the Shayler case, be maintained. If the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office or whoever is responsible for this comes forward with proposals to remove that defence of necessity, just as the Conservative Government removed the defence of necessity before, I give notice that we on our Benches will strongly oppose any such attempt. I apologise for detaining your Lordships for rather longer than might have seemed necessary, but we are dealing with an important topic.</p>

<p><a name="0707045000124"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0707045000252"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> I thank the noble Lords, Lord De Mauley and Lord Thomas of Gresford, for their kind words and for congratulating me rather than commiserating with me on standing here today. The speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, was not too long; it was extremely interesting and provided a context that should always be there when discussing matters such as this. I shall attempt to answer some of the questions that he asked, but I am grateful to him for saying that today he will not oppose this order, although he will be watching very carefully in future to ensure that what he hopes will not happen does not in fact happen. The points that he made were very well made.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000125"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked what information would not be disclosed. On the nuclear side, it is commercially sensitive information about stocks of used uranium and plutonium. On the IPCC side, the Official Secrets Act makes it an offence to make an unauthorised disclosure of information in various general categories, which are information that  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC111"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>damages security and intelligence, defence or international relations or information that impedes the prevention or detection of a crime. These are generalised categories that apply to disclosures that have damaging consequences and are unauthorised. However, this is not a blanket ban on disclosure as decisions on what to disclose can be challenged in court, which is an important protection.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000126"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, asked why an extension was being made to the IPCC now. In the Stockwell investigation, there was an unauthorised leak of information from the IPCC, which led to a review of security that caused the IPCC to request the change. It was not originally included because the previous body, the Police Complaints Authority, had a specific duty in the Police Act. It was decided to make the complaints system more open and therefore not to include its effects. The leak of information from the Stockwell inquiry caused this request for a change. It was not considered appropriate to leak a specific offence, as with the previous authority. That is not absolutely clear, and I should like to write to the noble Lord with a fuller answer on that.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000127"></a>The question of the public interest defence, which the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, raised and discussed, was debated by Parliament at some length during the passage of the Bill in 1989. A public interest defence would allow a damaging disclosure to take place and then, when the damage was past recall, there would be an argument about whether the disclosure was justified. Members or former members of the security services cannot be expected to make a fully informed decision of the damage that an unauthorised disclosure may do. There is no need for a public interest defence, as a Crown servant can seek authorisation from his or her organisation for any proposed disclosure. Members of the security and intelligence service have access to the independent staff counsellor, who can report on any matter to the relevant Secretary of State or directly to the Prime Minister and can therefore deal with any allegations of impropriety within the services.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000128"></a>For members of the security services, the OSA imposes a blanket ban but, for the reasons above, a public interest defence is not appropriate for them. For those governed by this order, disclosure is an offence only if it is damaging in some way and it is not in the public interest to disclose information that damages defence, international relations or impedes the investigation or prosecution of a crime. If a whistle-blower still has concerns, he can ask for authorisation to disclose and challenge any refusal in court.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000129"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, also asked what secrets are to be maintained. The NDA is committed to openness and transparency in its activities and is not seeking to hide matters, but there are security matters in protecting sites from terrorists.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000130"></a>Finally, I have a fairly long brief on extending the Official Secrets Act to the IPCC, headed &#147;additional briefing&#148;. It is three pages long and I shall not read it out, but the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, may be

<p><a name="0707045000133"></a>The noble Lord said: During the passage of the Government of Wales Bill, the Government gave an undertaking to Parliament to ensure that Schedule 7 is complete and accurate, which is reported at col. 193 of the <I>Official Report</I> of the House of Commons for 18 July 2006. In the process of drafting this order, the Wales Office facilitated discussions between other UK government departments and the Welsh Assembly Government to confirm the content of Schedule 7, and this draft amending order is the product of those discussions.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000134"></a>The amendments brought forward by this draft order seek to define the boundaries of the devolution settlement and not to extend it. The Government of Wales Act 2006 received Royal Assent on 25 July 2006, and since then this Government, together with the Welsh Assembly Government, have worked on a series of orders designed to bring the Act into force. The Government, noble Lords will be delighted to hear, are nearly at the end of this process.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000135"></a>The Act provides the new Assembly with the power to pass legislation known as Assembly measures in relation to matters authorised by Parliament on a case-by-case basis. However, the Act also provides for the situation in which, subject to endorsement by a referendum, the Assembly would acquire primary legislative powers. Under Part 4 of the Act, the Assembly would be able to pass Acts of the Assembly in relation to the full range of devolved subjects without further recourse to Parliament. Those subjects are listed in Schedule 7.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000136"></a>This order fulfils that commitment. It amends Schedule 7 to the Government of Wales Act 2006, Section 108, which will define the primary legislative competence of the National Assembly for Wales in the event of a successful referendum. By virtue of Section 109(4), the first Order in Council under Section 109 must be approved by a resolution of both Houses of Parliament, whereas subsequent orders must also be approved by the Assembly. This is the first order to be made under Section 109, so the approval of the Assembly is not required. The reason for this difference in procedure is that the first order amending Schedule 7 is intended to ensure that Schedule 7 is a complete and accurate description of  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC113"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Assembly&#146;s current devolved responsibilities. It is not intended to give effect to any substantive change in policy.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000137"></a>In contrast, the purpose of subsequent orders is to provide a mechanism whereby Schedule 7 can be updated if any changes to the boundaries of the devolution settlement are agreed in future by Parliament. Future amendments to Schedule 7 will therefore properly require Assembly assent. The purpose of Schedule 7 is to define the Assembly&#146;s competence to pass legislation&#151;Acts of the Assembly&#151;in the event of a &#147;yes&#148; vote in a future referendum. The Government have no current plans to hold such a referendum, which could only be triggered with the approval of both Houses of Parliament and a two-thirds majority of the Assembly.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000138"></a>Schedule 7 lists the subjects which would be within the primary legislative competence of the Assembly, based on the current executive functions of the Welsh Ministers. If a subject is not listed, it will not be within the Assembly&#146;s primary legislative competence, but the schedule also contains general restrictions and exceptions from those restrictions. In particular, the Assembly will not be able to legislate so as to modify any Minister of the Crown&#146;s function without the consent of the Secretary of State. This means that, where there are isolated Minister of the Crown&#146;s functions within subjects which are generally devolved, the protection of those functions need not be expressed by a specific reservation.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000139"></a>I do not wish to detain noble Lords any further by going through and explaining all the modifications individually. The Explanatory Memorandum explains what each of the modifications does. I commend the draft order to the Committee, and beg to move the Motion standing in my name on the Order Paper.</p>

The contents of the SI, a refinement of the terms of Part 1 of Schedule 7, were promised, as the Minister said, by the Secretary of State on 18 July last year, during the passage of the Act. Schedule 7 only becomes operative in the event that a referendum is held in accordance with Part 4 of the Act and the National Assembly is empowered to make laws, as Section 107 has it,</p>
<ul><a name="0707045000212"></a>&#147;to be known as Acts of the National Assembly for Wales or Deddfau Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru (referred to in this Act as &#145;Acts of the Assembly&#146;)&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70703-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000142"></a>The SI amplifies the areas where the Assembly may not legislate. It points out the forbidden apples in this Garden of Eden, even those hidden by the leaves. The first question that occurs to the casual observer of

Are we not very far&#151;years away&#151;from a referendum? I remind the Committee that that can only result from an order laid by the Secretary of State after such consultation as he considers appropriate and approved by two-thirds of the membership of the Assembly and by both Houses of this Parliament.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70703-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000143"></a>I supposed until last week that the possibility of a rainbow coalition of Plaid Cymru, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats governing in place of the minority Labour Government who now control the Assembly had suddenly brought nearer the possibility of a referendum and concentrated the minds of the United Kingdom Government on the need to safeguard what are commonly called reserved areas against infringement by poacher legislators. Well, how wrong I was. It was not the possibility of a rainbow coalition that had brought the referendum nearer, but the agreement between Labour and Plaid Cymru that Plaid Cymru would support a minority Labour government on condition that Labour would give a joint commitment,</p>
<ul><a name="0707045000213"></a>&#147;to use the Government of Wales Act 2006 provisions to the full under Part III and to proceed to a successful outcome of a referendum for full lawmaking powers under Part IV as soon as practicable, at or before the end of the Assembly term&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0707045000198"></a>as the press account of the coalition document reports. So there we have it: the price exacted by Plaid Cymru for its support is clearly a referendum on full legislative powers. I cannot but wonder what the Secretary of State, Mr Peter Hain, thinks of that agreement. After all, he has spoken about his doubts about, and almost antipathy to, such a referendum. Of course, he has a powerful say in whether the referendum goes ahead.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000144"></a>However, the story continues. Both political parties, the Welsh Labour Party and Plaid Cymru, have to approve the coalition document over the coming weekend. We shall therefore watch that space carefully.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000145"></a>All the articles in the SI deal with what are described as &#147;exceptions&#148; to the areas where the Assembly may legislate. Articles 7 and 8 do not, but they, too, trim and curtail the permitted legislative area: Article 7 defines housing finance more narrowly and Article 8, under the heading &#147;Public administration&#148; defines inquiries more narrowly. I have no criticism of the tighter definitions inserted by the SI; indeed, I welcome them. The SI makes it clear time and again that the Assembly&#146;s legislative power is confined to the areas where it has functional duties and responsibilities and that it is excluded from areas that are the prime responsibility of other departments of state.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000146"></a>Nevertheless, the public would be surprised at some of the subjects that are excluded from the Assembly&#146;s legislative remit, particularly nuclear energy and nuclear installations, of which Wales has substantial experience through the nuclear power stations at Trawsfynydd and Wylfa. The latter is a candidate for an extended life and possible renewal. Local people and their representatives will wish to have their say, and there will be a great deal of discontent if the matter is completely out of their  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC115"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC115</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>hands. This is a fresh addition to the exceptions listed under &#147;Economic development&#148; and will undoubtedly be controversial in Wales. Arguably, some aspects of nuclear developments are covered by subject 6, the environment, in Part 1 of the schedule, which covers environmental protection, pollution, nuisances and hazardous substances. The Assembly has legislative competence in those areas. There are obviously nuclear aspects to those matters. What happens in the event of a conflict of views on whether it is permissible for the Assembly to legislate? I presume that it becomes a matter for the Counsel General or the Supreme Court.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000147"></a>It is also surprising to note that the registration of local bus services and traffic regulation conditions related to those services are beyond the legislative reach of the Assembly, as is transport security generally, as opposed to rail transport. The Assembly Government surely decides matters relating to bus service subsidies and, with its responsibility for the building and maintenance of roads in Wales, must have concern for security on those matters. I would be grateful if the Minister could enlighten us further on these points.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000148"></a>I am not surprised by the exclusion of occupational and personal pensions, social security payments and various benefits from the scope of Assembly legislation. These matters require parity of treatment and a uniform UK approach. The rewriting of the section on water and flood defence is a welcome improvement and clarification.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000149"></a>There are no fewer than seven references to fish&#151;fish products, fish feedstuffs or fish health&#151;in this SI. All are intended to ensure verbal consistency with various other references in legislation which clearly distinguish between fish and other animals. It is a pity that the original draftsman was not familiar with the late Bing Crosby&#146;s rendering of &#147;Swinging on a Star&#148;, which clearly defines a fish:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0707045000207"></a>&#147;A fish won&#146;t do anything but swim in a brook,</p>
</ul>He can&#146;t write his name or read a book&#148;.
<p><a name="0707045000199"></a>However, I have no objection to the amendments, or to the SI as a whole.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000150"></a>It is interesting that this is the only occasion when the schedule can be amended by order by this Parliament on its own. If the schedule is to be changed again by order, it must be done, as the Minister explained, by resolution of the National Assembly, as laid down in Section 109. We are grateful to the Minister for his comments on this unique aspect of the SI, and trust that the Government have included all the necessary amendments to the schedule.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000151"></a>This may well be my last speech as a Conservative Front-Bencher since I have asked to be retired from that position and my request has been granted. However, I have also agreed to carry on until my successor is appointed, and I do not know when that will be. I have enjoyed my decade on the Front Bench, and I thank colleagues of all parties for their kindness, which has helped to make these 10 years so eximious a part of my life. I particularly thank the Minister on this occasion. We have always had a very

As far as I am concerned, he certainly well deserved to survive into the new Government.</p>
<h5><a name="0707045000221"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="0707045000152"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0707045000255"></a>Lord Livsey of Talgarth:</b> I am pleased to see the Minister still in his place. As the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said, he has served the requirements of Wales extremely well, particularly in a legislative sense. I am particularly sad to think that we are to lose the expertise of the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, who has made a massive contribution to Wales and to legislative matters affecting it, not least those surrounding the Welsh Language Act. That was quite a long time ago now, and an epoch-making piece of legislation. In his typically lyrical way, he has made most of the speech that I was about to make. I do not think that it is my duty to repeat the points in my contribution for my party, so, by way of illustration, I shall build on some of the points that the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, made. </p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000153"></a>The Minister said that the order makes amendments to Schedule 7 to the Government of Wales Act and sets out the subjects in relation to which the National Assembly for Wales would be able to legislate if it were given the power to pass Acts of the Assembly. As the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said, that is subject to a referendum under Part 4 of the Government of Wales Act 2006, and he is right to refer to the agreement that the Labour Party in the Assembly and Plaid Cymru appear to be coming to about the importance of a referendum. That is particularly topical in relation to this order.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000154"></a>Some aspects of the order have already been referred to, but I shall bring out some points that have not already been covered in detail. I agree with Article 3, which looks at the health of fish, fish products and fish feedstuffs. There is a lot of disease around in fish, particularly in freshwater fish, and it is important that we have secure and detailed legislation to protect them from some of the diseases that are rife in other countries.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000155"></a>I understand why there is an exception for pensions. However, nuclear energy and nuclear installations are of particular interest. I feel very strongly that, in the longer term, the Assembly should have the ability to legislate on energy. When one looks at the massive opportunities in Wales for alternative energy production, whether tidal, wind or solar, even with the kind of weather that we have had recently, there is massive capacity to produce a surplus of renewable energy, yet it appears from the order that the Assembly will not be able to legislate on energy. I find that extraordinary. However, the sensibility is in nuclear energy. It is highly controversial. My interpretation of the order is that, if the Assembly were to declare itself a nuclear-free zone&#151;and one can envisage that in certain circumstances&#151;it could not do that so far as concerns energy production from nuclear sources. That limits the competence of the Assembly to legislate. I am not surprised that the order has been produced at this point in the legislative cycle and that the Assembly cannot approve it, because it can be approved only here in both Houses of Parliament.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC117"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC117</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000156"></a>There are other matters of particular interest. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, mentioned most of them, and I shall not repeat what he said. I agree with a great deal of his analysis but Article 8 of the order, for example, states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0707045000208"></a>&#147;Under the heading <I>Public administration</I>, after &#145;Inquiries&#146; insert &#145;in respect of matters in relation to which the Welsh Ministers, the First Minister or the Counsel General exercise functions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707045000200"></a>In respect of inquiries, the gas pipeline which goes across Wales from Milford Haven to Gloucester carries gas which gets the energy gap down with imported gas. It is not possible to have a public inquiry. Most of us have seen that pipeline and its devastating effect on the environment in parts of rural Wales, but the Assembly will not be able to have an inquiry. It will be a continuous situation. Not only that but, so far as I can see, we cannot have an inquiry into nuclear waste disposal. Perhaps the Minister will correct me on that, but that could be a very live and controversial topic in the future. There are a number of issues of that kind.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000157"></a>Finally, Article 11 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0707045000209"></a>&#147;Under the heading <I>Town and country planning</I>, for the words after &#145;Water supply&#146; substitute&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707045000201"></a>a number of things. It continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0707045000210"></a>&#147;Appointment and regulation of any water undertaker whose area is not wholly or mainly in Wales&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707045000202"></a>That means that the Assembly will not be able to legislate, for example, for anything within the Severn Trent Water area, which affects large tracts of mid-Wales where the reservoirs collect water for the second, I believe, most profitable water company in the United Kingdom. There are other issues as well concerning the lease of the Elan Valley water resources to that company.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000158"></a>There are quite controversial matters in the order. We are not here to oppose them, but I hope that the points that I make expose some of them. I do not expect the Minister to be able to answer all my points but these issues need to be exposed. When the Assembly looks at these matters, it will see that this order will have restricted its room for manoeuvre, albeit after a referendum, and restrict when the Assembly may get legislative competence to do so.</p>

<p><a name="0707045000159"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0707045000256"></a>Lord Jones:</b> We are in the Moses Room and heavenly thunder fills this biblical room. The Minister gave a felicitous introduction and I, too, congratulate him on his reappointment. I am very glad to follow the informed comments of my noble friend Lord Livsey of Talgarth and to see in his place the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, who I calculate has spoken on Welsh affairs for more than a generation. He and I entered the mother of Parliaments together. He always put the interests of Wales first and today he was on his best and well known biblical form when he alluded to the apples hidden by the leaves, followed by a crooning reference to Bing Crosby. That was 5,000 years beautifully encapsulated. I remember his serious contributions to the establishment of the Welsh Language Act and of Channel 4, which was quite an important development in the history of Wales.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC118"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000160"></a>The relevance and topicality of this statutory instrument could not be greater because the Welsh general election was in the first week of May. Even now, the First Minister, Rhodri Morgan, is still negotiating with other political parties for an agreement that would safeguard the existence of his Cabinet and its measures and proposals. So the words &#147;legislative competence&#148; are the very issue for the Wales Assembly. The words &#147;law-making powers&#148; and &#147;referendum&#148; are at the heart of the political drama being played out at Cardiff Bay more or less at this very moment.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000161"></a>Noble Lords have referred to the referendum. When it comes, as it surely will, it will be won, whether for good or bad&#151;of that I am certain.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000162"></a>I acknowledge the success of the Welsh Assembly, which is not yet 10 years old. The miracle was how powers were transferred from Westminster to Cardiff Bay and how legislative competence was planned for, and how the changes were administratively seamless, without any major dysfunctions. On establishment, the public services continued miraculously as before and were delivered, literally overnight, most efficiently by the new Assembly. It said a lot for the Whitehall mandarinate and even more for the old Welsh Office Civil Service, which served my noble friend Lord Rowlands and myself in the Wilson and Callaghan Administrations in the 1970s and late 1960s.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000163"></a>The statutory instrument is an indirect compliment to the Welsh Assembly Government, their First Minister and their Cabinet&#151;a compliment that they truly deserve. It is an important proposal, concerning the future governance of Wales. Can my noble friend the Minister state that it has been prepared carefully in conjunction with the Prime Minister&#146;s Statement in another place today? Does the Prime Minister&#146;s Statement in any way enhance or diminish the impact of this statutory instrument on the governance of Wales? Has my noble friend the Minister, in the process of reading himself in, had access to, seen, looked at or truly contemplated that before introducing this statutory instrument? I hope that he has&#151;surely he has&#151;for the relevance of the SI is then much greater.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000164"></a>Very briefly, Article 4 proposes pension matters under the heading,</p>
<ul><a name="0707045000214"></a>&#147;Economic development&#151;(a) after the eighth exception&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0707045000203"></a>That enables me to ask, as the Liberal Democrats asked, what connection if any is there with the recent merging of the Welsh Development Agency into the machinery of the Welsh Assembly Government? Were the pensions of the excellent WDA employees safeguarded? Does the proposed amendment in any way safeguard or enhance the position of those excellent employees? The agency was a great success and delivered the goods on inward investment, expansion and rejuvenation across Wales, and for regeneration. It enabled Wales to cope with the loss of her manufacturing industries, specifically in the late 1970s and early 1980s. What assurances can the Minister give on that?</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000165"></a>Similarly, I want to refer to nuclear energy. At Article 4(c), after the 15th exception, a reference is  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC119"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>proposed to nuclear energy and nuclear installations. This leads me to pose a question which has already been put from a different angle. What effect does this have on the future of the Trawsfynydd plant, which is now dormant and unused? Also, what is the future of the Anglesey plant at Wylfa? It currently has massive economic and employment implications for the whole island and the sub-region. Can the Minister throw any light on plans to build a new plant at Wylfa?</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000166"></a>My last point of detail concerns Article 11, referring to the heading &#147;Water and flood defence&#148;. Can the Minister list the water undertakings that are, as it were, half in and half out, as was referred to in relation to Severn Trent? I think that the Committee would be pleased to have a response on those matters. </p>
<h5><a name="0707045000222"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="0707045000167"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0707045000257"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> The Minister will be relieved to know that I do not propose to ask him further questions, but I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without paying my own personal tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000168"></a>For seven or eight of the 10 years that he was the spokesman on Welsh affairs for the Conservative Party, I fulfilled the same role for the Liberal Democrats. Throughout that whole period, we worked together very closely and very rarely disagreed. Having regard to the way in which the Conservative Party opposed a referendum for a Welsh Assembly, I was particularly impressed by the way in which the noble Lord steered his party along lines which I am sure he deeply supported in the direction of a positive and constructive attitude towards setting up a Welsh Assembly and its Government. He referred to a rainbow alliance. Unfortunately, at the moment the sun is not shining on a part of our rainbow and therefore it is not complete, but with regard to the rainbow that existed between the noble Lord and me over the years, I can say only that, at one end of it, there was certainly a pot of gold.</p>

<p><a name="0707045000169"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0707045000258"></a>Lord Rowlands:</b> First, I, too, congratulate my noble friend on his return to office. Last year, I immensely admired the way in which he piloted the Government of Wales Bill through this House, and he has always been open and approachable towards Back-Benchers. </p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000170"></a>Secondly, in one sense, I was saddened to hear the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, say that he is to leave the Front Bench. His parliamentary life and mine have almost paralleled each other, and we both go back a very long way. I give him one word of comfort, although I do not think that he needs it. There is life on the Back-Benches. Indeed, I have found it rather enjoyable in some respects and I am sure that he will enjoy it too.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000171"></a>I want to ask one or two brief questions about the order. In the Explanatory Memorandum, which has been laid before Parliament alongside the order, we are helpfully taken through the legislative background and told the distinction between orders under Schedule 5 and those under Schedule 7 to the Government of Wales Act. Naturally, we have not yet had any orders under Schedule 5 because the powers have only just been brought into being. However, that  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC120"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>means that the Assembly has not been gaining legislative competences. I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the fact that two Bills which have been before this House&#151;the Further Education and Training Bill and the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill&#151;carry various clauses with a substantial transfer of legislative competences which I should have thought in future should be brought before us in the form of orders.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000172"></a>I raise this with my noble friend because I wish to register concern. As we laid down very clearly how orders of this kind&#151;either under Schedule 5 or, now, Schedule 7 of the Government of Wales Act&#151;were going to be the subject of considerable pre-legislative scrutiny, neither of those sections have been subject to that scrutiny. Although we are told that we can amend them in this House and the other place, that is not a substitute for the proper kind of pre-legislative scrutiny that we established was going to be the norm for future Orders in Council. In future, if legislative competence is brought forward in the form of clauses in Bills, they should be subject to the same kind of pre-legislative scrutiny as we expect of orders.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000173"></a>Briefly, on this schedule, my noble friend mentioned that the Welsh Assembly Government had been consulted. Was the National Assembly consulted? Did this order at least go before one of its appropriate committees for clearance and approval? Perhaps I am now a natural Back-Bencher, but I see it not through the eyes of a government these days, but the eyes of a parliament or assembly. Has the Assembly had the opportunity to comment or make observations on this order?</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000174"></a>Finally, I turn to the fact that, oddly, all those who have spoken have fastened on to one aspect&#151;I shall go a slightly different way: the maintenance of the exception of any formal legislative competence in the area of energy. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, said energy; I am not sure that it is energy, but it is certainly electricity and nuclear installations. You cannot possibly have a different health and safety regime on nuclear in England from Wales or anywhere else. That has to be a UK responsibility, but it is now totally accepted that the Assembly will have legislative competence over electricity. The way in which electricity is going to be commissioned and developed is changing dramatically and rapidly. There are very small schemes, combined heat and power schemes, the wind farm issues and all the rest of it. I cannot see that somewhere, somehow, that total exception is going to hold. I ask my noble friend whether we are right in saying that the Assembly Government do not have any formal legislative competence at all, even around the fringes of electricity generation.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000175"></a>How does that lack of competence compare with the planning powers it has in certain respects? As the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, pointed out, the strategic decision to commission a power station is often involved in planning. He made a reference to the LNG pipeline. I do not share his view. I live near where that pipeline is going, and can see what he called &#147;devastation&#148;. I have North Sea gas in my house. A generation ago, people on the northern

We cannot be so curmudgeonly on these issues as that. I suggest to my noble friend that the issue of electricity generation and the legislative competence that the Assembly does not have but may need at some time in the future is one that we will return to.</p>

<p><a name="0707045000176"></a><b><a name="70703-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0707045000259"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> I pay tribute to my friend, the noble Lord, Lord Roberts. When I started in this job about three or four years ago, he was incredibly kind to me, supportive and generous with his time. It was not until I read his excellent autobiography that I realised that I was dealing with somebody who had been the longest serving Minister in a government department&#151;the Welsh Office&#151;since the beginning of the 19th century, and who knew more about Wales than I would ever hope to. He has been very kind to me over the years I have been doing this job. It is a strange thing to say, given that he comes from a different political party, but he has almost been like a mentor figure. I am really grateful to you, Wyn, and wish you every possible happiness and success on the Back Benches. Thank you very much.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000177"></a>An enormous number of questions have been asked in what has been a long and fascinating debate, and I shall try to answer as many of them as I can. If I miss out some of them, we will of course write to noble Lords.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000178"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, requested clarification on a number of points. He asked why the order is before Parliament now and read some slightly unworthy motivations into the timing which are simply not based on fact. As I indicated earlier, the Government gave a commitment to Parliament to ensure that Schedule 7 is complete and accurate. As I am sure noble Lords are aware, since the Government of Wales Act received Royal Assent, the Government have undertaken a substantial programme of secondary legislation, comprising 11 orders, properly to settle matters of technical detail which flowed from the Act. This order is part of that process.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000179"></a>This programme has included, for example, the staff transfer order, the property rights and liabilities order and the transitional provisions (finance) order.</p>

I am sure that noble Lords are aware that, since the Government of Wales Act 2006 received Royal Assent last year, the Government have  


<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC122"></a><b>3 July 2007 : Column GC122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been undertaking a substantial programme of secondary legislation comprising 11 orders properly to settle matters of technical detail that flow from the Act. This order is simply one part of that wider programme, and the process of clarifying and defining the exact boundaries of Schedule 7 to match the existing executive functions of the Welsh Ministers has involved detailed discussions between UK government departments and the Welsh Assembly Government. This has been undertaken over the past seven months and is not something that could properly be accomplished in a very short timescale or as an expedient reaction to circumstances.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000184"></a>The noble Lord referred to Articles 7 and 8. I welcome the fact that he has no criticism of the tighter definitions that they represent, and can confirm again that one purpose is to ensure that the Assembly&#146;s legislative competence is intended to fit within the boundaries of the devolution settlement rather than extending into areas which remain the responsibility of the UK Government. Having acknowledged that situation, and confirming that he has no criticism of it, I do not follow the noble Lord when he suggests that the public would be surprised that nuclear energy and installations are excluded. They have always been a matter for the UK Government, in Wales as in England. This order simply seeks to make that clear. It does not mean that local people and their representatives cannot have their say. The UK Government&#146;s current consultation on nuclear offers the opportunity for the public and representative groups to set out their views. The Government are committed to a diverse energy mix to ensure that we keep the lights on.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000185"></a>I shall take this opportunity to explain to the noble Lord that registration for local bus services has been excepted from the Assembly&#146;s legislative competence because there is a unified system of traffic commissioners across Great Britain. Although traffic commissioners are appointed by the Secretary of State for Transport, they have a quasi-judicial role so, as a result, operate largely independent of government. The role of the traffic commissioners is also not related to the power of Welsh Ministers to give subsidies to bus services. Their role is to ensure that bus operators operate their routes in accordance with the details of their services which they have registered. As a result, it is appropriate for this to be excepted, and the Assembly agrees to that.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000186"></a>I can also assure the Committee that, although transport emergency planning remains the responsibility of the UK Government, for Wales as for England, the UK Government work closely with the Welsh Assembly Government to ensure that UK civil protection policy and planning is tailored to Welsh needs in Wales. I am pleased that the noble Lord agrees with the clarification on the exclusion of occupational and personal pensions&#151;a matter raised by a number of noble Lords&#151;social security payments and various benefits from the scope of Assembly legislation. The noble Lord is correct in observing that the revised wording in Article 11 on water and flood defence more accurately reflects the current division of responsibilities between the UK

<a name="70703-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000187"></a>I welcome the acute observation of the noble Lord, Lord Roberts&#151;taken up by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey&#151;that there are no fewer than seven references to fish. In legislation, the term &#147;animal&#148; sometimes includes fish and sometimes it does not. These amendments seek to put beyond doubt the fact that fish will be within the Assembly&#146;s legislative competence. I therefore assure the noble Lord that this order has widespread support from the UK Government and the Welsh Assembly, and welcome the fact that neither he nor any other noble Lord has a fundamental objection to the order as a whole.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000188"></a>I shall pick up on a few of the other questions. As I have said, we will write if we fail to answer a question. The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, asked about nuclear energy and installations, and whether Wales should have the ability to legislate. The Assembly will not be able to legislate on renewable energy&#151;that is, the LNG pipeline&#151;which I think I dealt with in my speech. The noble Lord also said that there was no ability to have a public inquiry in relation to the LNG pipeline or nuclear waste disposal. The Assembly can hold inquiries only into areas where the Welsh Ministers have executive functions, so it is right that the Assembly cannot hold inquiries that stray beyond this boundary. Currently, Welsh Ministers have power only under the Inquiries Act 2005 to hold inquiries into devolved matters.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000189"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, and my noble friend Lord Jones also asked about English and Welsh water company areas. Certain water issues are devolved on a water company basis rather than on an all-Wales basis. Therefore, although some Welsh residents are served by companies regulated by the Secretary of State, the converse is also true. Some English residents are served by Welsh companies. I shall write to Members of the Committee with a list of those companies, which I do not have with me. The amendment relating to nuclear power has no

<a name="70703-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000190"></a>My noble friend Lord Rowlands asked whether the Assembly was consulted on this order with regard to the Explanatory Memorandum and the two clauses in two Bills conferring matters of legislative competence on the Assembly. Clauses in the Bill are subject to normal parliamentary scrutiny, debated in Committee in the House of Commons and on the Floor of the House of Lords. I have dealt with the fact that the Assembly does not have to approve this order. Negotiations have been conducted between the UK Government and the Welsh Assembly Government to arrive at the provisions. My noble friend Lord Rowlands also asked why the Assembly does not have competence over electricity matters. This reflects the current devolution settlement. The Welsh Ministers have no executive functions in this area.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000191"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jones, asked whether pensions of WDA employees were safeguarded. They are not affected by this order. WDA employees are employed by the Assembly Government and are thus civil servants. The noble Lord also asked whether the SI had been prepared carefully in conjunction with the Prime Minister&#146;s Statement today. It was prepared and laid before the Statement was made; it is the result of seven months&#146; work by officials, the Welsh Assembly Government and the UK Government. I was here in this Room when the Prime Minister made his Statement in the other place and it was repeated here, and I am looking forward to reading it. But the SI has certainly not been made in conjunction with that Statement.</p>

<a name="70703-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0707045000192"></a>I am grateful for the great interest in this order. We have had a long discussion. If I have failed to answer any questions, I shall write to noble Lords. I take the opportunity to say goodbye to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, as a spokesperson, though not as a friend and Back-Bencher.</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="07070333000010"></a>In 2003, King's College London was commissioned by the Ministry of Defence, as part of its major health and well-being survey of Operation TELIC personnel, to investigate the distribution and determinants of exposure to depleted uranium (DU) resulting from the use of DU munitions. Researchers visited bases in the UK and Germany and obtained urine samples from a total of 369 personnel who had taken part in the combat phase of the operation. Volunteers were sought in four categories&#151;combat, non-combat, battlefield medical and vehicle clean-up personnel&#151;among which the last two groups were expected to have the greatest chance of exposure.</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="07070333000011"></a>The findings of the study are today being published in the journal <I>Occupational and Environmental Medicine</I>. No evidence was found for DU contamination in UK forces exposed to DU munitions. Analysis of the urine samples indicated only traces of natural uranium from normal dietary sources at levels consistent with those in non-DU-exposed populations.</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07070333000012"></a>I welcome publication of these results, which should further reassure our veterans and others that the risk of incidental contamination by battlefield use of DU munitions is very small.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="07070333000014"></a>I am today outlining machinery of the government changes affecting a number of existing departments of state. Full details will be provided shortly in a paper to be laid in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="07070333000015"></a>These changes will sharpen the focus of central government on the new and very different challenges that Britain will face in the years ahead. In particular, the changes seek to strengthen the Government's support for children, young people and families through these challenges, and to ensure that Britain is equipped to seize the new opportunities of the global economy.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="07070333000024"></a>The new department will drive the Government's wider strategy on youth issues. This will include working with the Home Office and the Department of Health on tackling drug use and with the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) on youth homelessness and supported housing.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="07070333000032"></a>The council will comprise senior business leaders from a range of sectors, able to provide clear, independent advice on the reform priorities to enable business to compete in the global economy.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="07070333000033"></a>The council will meet twice a year, chaired by a senior business person. It will report to the Government and to Parliament. Secretaries of State will attend meetings at the invitation of the council.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="07070333000034"></a>The council will:</p>
examine the progress the Government are making to improve the business environment in areas critical to the future of the economy;advise the Government on their ongoing policies and priorities;conduct its own reviews on the areas it believes will determine the future economic well-being of the UK; andwhere issues are particularly important, the council will have the power to establish special commissions to make recommendations for reform.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="07070333000036"></a>To rise to the new global challenges, Britain must continue to develop its world-class competitive business environment as the key to being a dynamic, flexible and competitive economy.</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="07070333000037"></a>To lead this work, I am today announcing the formation of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (DBERR).</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="07070333000038"></a>The new department will be responsible for creating the conditions for business success, developing deeper and more effective engagement with business, with the ability to promote the competitiveness agenda across critical areas of government policy. It will provide support for the new Business Council.</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="07070333000039"></a>It will also be responsible for promoting choice and quality for consumers through competition policy and for ensuring an improved quality of life for employees.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="07070333000040"></a>The department will promote productivity and enterprise across the Government and within the EU. A key priority will be its cross-government role in promoting better regulation across the business, public and voluntary sectors.

The department will have joint responsibility with the Department for International Development on trade policy, and with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on trade promotion.</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="07070333000043"></a>In the years ahead, countries will increasingly derive their competitive edge from the speed with which they are able to innovate, building on a world-class research base, creating new products and markets and driving enterprise and efficiency. Seizing these new opportunities will also require a world-class skills base&#151;both through the expansion of high-end graduate skills, but also by raising the skills of the wider adult workforce, including those currently unskilled.</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="07070333000044"></a>To ensure that Britain is equipped to meet these challenges, I am today announcing the formation of a new Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS).</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="07070333000045"></a>The new department will be responsible for driving forward delivery of the Government's long-term vision to make Britain one of the best places in the world for science, research and innovation, and to deliver the ambition of a world-class skills base.</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="07070333000046"></a>It will therefore assume responsibility from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) for science and innovation&#151;including ensuring world-class research and increased business innovation. The department will oversee the science budget, which will remain ring-fenced, and the dual support system for funding will be retained. A new Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser will be created within the department.</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="07070333000047"></a>The new department will also assume responsibility for ensuring that the UK has the skilled workforce it needs to compete in a global economy.</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="07070333000048"></a>The department will, therefore, be responsible for the development, funding and performance management of higher education (both teaching and research) and further education, working closely with the Department for Children, Schools and Families. The department will also be responsible for taking forward the Government's wider skills agenda&#151;including the implementation of Lord Leitch's <I>Review of Skills</I>, published last year.</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="07070333000067"></a>The Prime Minister has today announced a series of constitutional reforms set out in the Green Paper, <I>The Governance of Britain</I>.</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="07070333000068"></a>These include reforms to modernise the role of the Executive and increase its accountability to Parliament. Further to the Prime Minister's Statement, I am announcing the reforms relating to the Treasury.</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="07070333000069"></a>In 1997, the establishment of an independent Bank of England and Financial Services Authority (FSA) reflected the Government's commitment to transparency, credibility and accountability in economic policymaking. Last month, reforms were announced to increase the transparency of appointments to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="07070333000070"></a>To further increase parliamentary accountability and scrutiny of appointments, I am today announcing that, following their appointment, I will invite the Treasury Select Committee to convene pre-commencement hearings with all appointees to the MPC of the Bank of England and the chairman of the FSA.</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="07070333000071"></a>These hearings will give the committee a full opportunity to discuss with the appointee their priorities and experience, and for external MPC appointments, coupled with the reforms announced last month, will allow the committee to evaluate their skills and qualities against the published criteria.</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="07070333000072"></a>Furthermore, as part of the proposals for increasing the independence of government statistics currently before Parliament, to further increase public confidence, I propose a vote in the House of Commons to confirm the Government's nominee for chair of the Statistics Board. I can also confirm today that, following the debate in Parliament, I propose that pre-release access to national statistics will be reduced from up to five days for non-market sensitive and 40.5 hours for market-sensitive statistics to 24 hours for all statistics.</p>

<a name="70703-wms0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="07070333000073"></a>In addition, in order to enable Parliament to better scrutinise public spending, I am proposing to simplify the planning, parliamentary approval and reporting of public spending by aligning estimates and accounts with budgets and the fiscal rules.</p>

This is an increase of 17 per cent on the year before and this reconfirms the UK's position as the top investment location in Europe.

It is for the governing bodies of the schools concerned to decide if they wish to have such a trust. All other maintained schools are free to establish a parent council in any way that they choose, or not to do so, if they so wish. Generally, schools have systems in place to consult parents but a parent council provides an additional route for parents to put forward their views. We do not believe that the regulations will result in a greater workload for schools' governing bodies.</p>
