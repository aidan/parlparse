<h2 align=center><a name="place_0"></a>House of Lords</h2>

<h2 align=center><a name="date_0"></a>Wednesday, 3 May 2006.</h2>



<h4 align=center><a name="hd_0"></a>The House met at three of the clock (Prayers having been read earlier at the Judicial Sitting by the Lord Bishop of St Albans): the LORD CHANCELLOR on the Woolsack.</h4>





<a name="topichd_0"></a>
<a name="60503-01_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Roads: Young Drivers</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Dundee </b>   asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>

<a name="60503-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What measures they propose to reduce the death rate among young drivers.
</p>


<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the Government are very concerned about young driver fatalities and especially about evidence that a minority has a seriously unsafe attitude to the risks. We have strengthened the driving test and commissioned research on improving pre-driver education and the way to develop safe attitudes to driving among young people. We have looked carefully at a range of possible driving restrictions aimed at all young drivers but do not believe that they are the right answer.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Dundee: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. He may accept that the death rate among young qualified drivers would reduce through an increase in the number&#151;now only 15 per cent&#151;who go on to take Pass Plus. Does he agree that a good way to improve that percentage would be through a conditional offer: for example, that if a young driver takes Pass Plus, then his current two-year probationary period could be shortened?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl, who always takes a constructive attitude to these issues. He is right: that strategy is a way of improving driver education after passing the test. We have strengthened the driving test, as I mentioned, but it is also important that young drivers in particular realise that improvement to their driving can continue through the Pass Plus course. We also have sanctions against newly qualified drivers who break the law&#151;when they achieve six points, they are banned from driving. I agree that we need to increase driver education beyond the passing of the test.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, have the Government looked at what happens before the driving test is taken, and has any consideration been given to limiting the life of a provisional licence so that young drivers do not think that such a licence will continue for five or six years? Are the Government prepared to consider the provisional licence having a limited life that ends with a test being taken?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, again, I am grateful to the noble Baroness. That is a constructive suggestion, and we shall certainly look at it. I do not think that we have a great deal of evidence that people <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_456"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 456</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

use the provisional licence to avoid the test. No doubt we all have anecdotal evidence of that, but it is not a great problem. As the House will recognise, a provisional-licence driver drives under severe restrictions. Therefore, there is an incentive to pass the test. However, the noble Baroness has drawn attention to the fact that our driving test is one of the most rigorous in the world, which is why people need to be satisfied that they have enough driving experience to pass it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that, at the age of 17, there is an enormous incentive for people to get a car, partly due to the fact that, under this Government, bus and train fares have risen faster than they have for a long time? They are the highest in Europe. Has he any proposals in that respect?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord may not have noticed our assistance with fares for buses for young people in education or the increase in bus usage, certainly in London, where young people travel free. He should perhaps recognise that we are concerned to improve bus usage. Of course, fares are always in question when we still have more limited use of buses than we would wish, and I take on board his recommendations that we should do all that we can to improve bus usage. The Government are pleased to agree.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   My Lords, is not the answer to be found in simply enforcing motor vehicle insurance?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, that goes some way towards the issue, because a driver&#039;s failure to have motor vehicle insurance is a serious misdemeanour. My noble friend will recognise that it is difficult to detect those driving without motor insurance until they have been involved in some incident attracting the attention of the police. The problem is that, for some, the temptation to drive without insurance still exists. There are significant penalties for not having motor insurance, and so there should be.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Oppenheim-Barnes: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that this is one of the only countries in Europe where motorists do not have to display a valid insurance disc in the front of their car? If they did, all the excuses that he has just made would not be necessary.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness has a point. Again, she will recognise that there is an enforcement problem. After all, the motor vehicle tax disc has had to be displayed for a long time, yet we all know that there is substantial evasion of that obligation. I take her point on board, however.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </b>   My Lords, have the Government looked at the cost of the driving test and whether failing and having to repeat it acts as a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_457"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 457</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

deterrent to young people? That means that there is only one driver when a group goes out. When youngsters pile in the car, peer pressure distracts the driver. I am told by youngsters that the cost of the test and resits puts some off from attempting the test.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the cost of the test is a factor, but it costs the normal driver in excess of &#163;700 or &#163;800 to learn to drive. The test itself is only a marginal element of those fees. I accept the noble Baroness&#039;s other point, however, that the issue is one of peer pressure. There is no doubt that driver accidents occur among young people because, when they are among their peers at a certain age, they act more recklessly than is good for them or their passengers. When they pass that medium age, peer pressure seems to work the other way&#151;they become responsible drivers. Our problem is dealing with the former issue.

<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="60503-01_time0"></a><h5>3.08 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire </b>   asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>

<a name="60503-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Whether they will take steps to enable an increase in the capacity of the east coast main line.
</p>


<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, Network Rail is developing a route utilisation strategy for the east coast main line. This will determine, first, what is the most effective and efficient use of the existing capacity. It will then go on to consider what developments might be justified in the light of demand forecasts and affordability.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that relatively opaque Answer. I am sure that he is familiar with the figures showing rising numbers of passengers using the east coast main line and rising freight use. There is also the expectation that the amount of freight being moved from the east coast ports to the north of England is likely to rise a good deal further. The schemes for increasing the capacity of the east coast main line are obvious. Some of them have been around for more than 50 years: the Welwyn viaduct, doubling north of Peterborough and now electrification between Leeds and York. Should not a Government who are committed to reducing road congestion invest in increasing rail capacity instead?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am sorry that the noble Lord considered my original Answer opaque. I was trying to clarify the issue. The route utilisation strategy will be the first comprehensive evaluation of the timetable for the east coast main line since electrification in 1990. We believe that there is considerable capacity for enhancing services. We want to see those services improved because there is no doubt that investment in rail is reflected in greatly increased passenger usage. I wanted to emphasise to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_458"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 458</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the noble Lord that I really could not provide him with a greater carrot than the route utilisation strategy, which will set out to increase the capacity on that line.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60503-01_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Rosser: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the decision of the Office of Rail Regulation to award other route paths to a new operator has undermined the franchising process, first, by preventing GNER introducing the improved half-hourly service from London to Leeds that was provided under its franchise renewal agreement and, secondly, by leaving the financial terms of the franchising agreement at least partially holed below the water line? What action has been, or will be, taken to restore confidence in the integrity of the franchising process, including on the east coast main line, and to prevent any similar occurrence?
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060503/text/60503-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60503-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is knowledgeable about the issues and is very helpful. I emphasise that the decision to bring on to the line a new service was taken not by Ministers but by the Office of Rail Regulation. The new service, which will introduce direct trains from Sunderland to King&#039;s Cross, is an enhancement that should be applauded. My noble friend was right to point out that unresolved issues surround the enhancement of the service to Leeds. That is the point that I sought to address in my original Answer, and the route utilisation strategy will look at it. I do not agree that the Leeds service has been torpedoed as yet; nor do I think that any action has been taken that runs athwart the franchising process. GNER was well aware when it won the franchise of the possibility of other participants providing services.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60503-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Mawhinney: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest as chairman of the Peterborough Urban Regeneration Company. When will we see the route utilisation strategy document and when will its benefits become available to the people who use the stations on the east coast main line?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60503-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, it is intended to produce a consultation document from the summer, leading towards a conclusive position at the end of the year for effect in 2007. I recognise the interest of the people of Peterborough in the issue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60503-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   My Lords, being more interested in the service between King&#039;s Cross and Berwick-upon-Tweed than in that to Leeds, may I ask the Minister whether the decision to award a franchise other than that awarded to GNER for trains from Sunderland to King&#039;s Cross will interfere with the potential expansion of the GNER service to Edinburgh and the north?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60503-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, it will not interfere with existing services because that was the basis of the decision. With regard to any enhancement that GNER may have in mind, the route utilisation <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_459"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 459</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

survey to be carried out will determine how many extra trains can be run on that line. We think that additional capacity will be revealed through the survey.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60503-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   My Lords, splendid though it may be to talk about increased capacity, I refer to present capacity and in particular to the difficulties that Sea Containers, the parent company of GNER, is reported to be in. Do the Government have contingency plans for the operating concession if any problems arise in that area?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60503-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the problems of Sea Containers, the parent company of GNER, have been well documented in the press. The company is on record as saying that the problems have no effect on the viability of GNER and, at this point in time, we are working on that presumption. If the situation changed, there would be considerable concern. However, at present GNER is a viable company and is looking entirely secure. It won the franchise in a highly competitive battle and is doing well.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60503-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </b>   My Lords, has my noble friend seen the article in the latest issue of <i>Modern Railways</i> by the respected journalist Roger Ford? It is required reading for anybody who studies these matters. It states that the universal opinion among informed sources is that a competent timetabler, unfettered by post-privatisation timidity, could find paths between Peterborough and Doncaster for six new London-Leeds off-peak services. Does my noble friend agree that the more difficult question for the Government is the one alluded to by the noble Lord, Lord Walton, and my noble friend Lord Rosser&#151;whether the extra capacity should all be given to GNER as a reward for its high premium payments or whether the Government believe in open access competition in the railways, in the way that the ORR does, of a sort that has not really existed since the railways were first regulated by Parliament in the middle of the 19th century?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60503-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for having quoted a magazine and an authority that we all hold dear as far as the railways are concerned. I agree with my noble friend that Roger Ford is an important commentator on the railways, and I am grateful that that authority indicates that successful timetabling can increase services on that line. Who should run those services is a matter for another day.

<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>What progress has been made with the implementation of the national bowel cancer screening programme.
</p>


<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60503-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My Lords, the national bowel cancer screening programme was started in April 2006, as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_460"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 460</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

promised. Funding for 2006&#150;07 is being transferred to the national cancer screening team in Sheffield. The kit supplier has been notified that the first order is for 100,000 kits. The first invitations to take tests should be sent out in July.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60503-02_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Hayman: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for that reply and for the information that has now been given about the roll-out of this life-saving programme, over which there were concerns about delay. Can I press him about funding for future years? He will be aware that an announcement was made last year that &#163;37.5 million would be allocated over two years for the full roll-out of the programme. Is that figure still a government commitment, and over what time frame will it now be available, given the inevitable delay that we now see?
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="60503-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the delay in starting the programme was extremely modest and has had no significant effect on the outcomes for individuals who take the test. We estimate that around &#163;10 million will be spent on the first year&#151;2006&#150;07&#151;of the national bowel cancer screening programme. My noble friend will know that funding decisions have not yet been made for future years. However, we are committed to ensuring that the necessary funding is available to see through the implementation of the programme. It has always been the case that this programme would take three years to roll out fully.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60503-02_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, how long will it take to get further kits? A first order of 100,000 kits is very small compared to the number of people who would benefit from screening. Will there be any delay in follow-up supplies?
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60503-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I hope that there will be no delays. We have done what is necessary to get the scheme going. There are constraints on expanding the scheme, largely to do with training staff to operate the new procedures.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60503-02_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   My Lords, given that the money promised for 2006&#150;07 was delayed to the extent that work that should have started by now will not start until September, will the Minister confirm that the money for 2007&#150;08 will be &#163;25 million? When will that money be confirmed for expenditure?
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="60503-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I have just answered that to the best of my ability in response to my noble friend Lady Hayman. I have nothing to add.

<a name="60503-02_spnew16"></a><b> Baroness Morgan of Drefelin: </b>   My Lords, the Government&#039;s announcement on 19 April was extremely welcome.

The Government must be congratulated on that. The announcement says that five programme hubs will be established in the first <br>&nbsp;<br>

year, along with 14 local screening centres. It also stated that to roll out the programme to the whole nation we would need 90 to 100 centres. Can the Minister inform the House of the milestones that there might be for years two and three to achieve full national coverage?
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="60503-02_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, we will roll out the additional local screening centres. We anticipate that there will be 90 to 100 such centres, which will provide endoscopy services for those with positive test results. We will roll out 14 this year, as my noble friend rightly says, and will announce further programmes later in the year for roll-out during 2007&#150;08.

The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are a proscribed organisation under the Terrorism Act 2000. Proscription is a tough power which makes it illegal for an organisation to operate or fund-raise in the United Kingdom. Of course, enforcement of the law is a matter for the police and prosecuting authorities, and we expect them to take these issues extremely seriously.

<p><a name="st_46"></a>

Meanwhile, the Minister says that proscription is tough on those proscribed. Is he aware, nevertheless, that there is continual money laundering in the United Kingdom; that illegal rallies take place under the flags of Tamil Eelam; that bogus charities are being set up; and that TTN is broadcasting Tamil Eelam propaganda in the UK? He may say that the issues are dealt with toughly and rest with other government bodies, but is he aware that the proscription is being flouted? Is it not the responsibility of the Home Office and the Government in general to make sure that proscription means what it is meant to mean and that it is not just flouted almost daily?

There are constant discussions between the Government and the enforcement authorities. What happened last year is a good example of these matters being dealt with exactly as they should be. The Tamil Rehabilitation Organisation, a charity, was closed down as a result of the police and the Charity Commission acting on evidence that funds were being channelled to LTTE.
</p>

<a name="60503-03_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>Clearly, the police and the prosecuting authorities can act only on the information that they have. I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord, who I know has great experience in the field, for drawing the matter further to the public&#039;s attention. That is a desirable thing to do, and we need to keep the pressure up.

<a name="60503-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, I join the Minister in expressing sympathy for the large number of families affected by the atrocities in Sri Lanka. The noble Lord, Lord Naseby, asks an important question: is there any evidence that members of the LTTE in this country are involved in the type of activities for which the Home Secretary would require additional powers, or are existing powers sufficient to deal with them? Moreover, what sort of information is available to the police about the activities of such organisations?
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="60503-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the powers that we have are fit for the purpose. Where there is evidence, the prosecuting authorities will act. Indeed, they have acted in the past, as I have made plain to your Lordships&#039; House. We can act only on information; we cannot act simply on supposition. The police must be fully involved in carrying out investigations and prosecutions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="60503-03_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that there is a lot of concern about the activities of this organisation? Is he aware&#151;I am sure he is&#151;that in the past 10 years there have been more suicide bombings in Sri Lanka, many of which are associated with this organisation, than anywhere else in the world? The number far exceeds that in the Israel/Palestine horror, for example. Is he also aware of the revolting practice of planting bombs on little children, giving them flowers to present to visiting politicians and dignitaries and then detonating the bomb so that it kills the child and the dignitary at once&#151;the most sordid and sickening practice that one can possibly imagine? Will he therefore take to heart the representations that he is hearing today that something very firm needs to be done to prevent these people pursuing their activities in this country or, indeed, anywhere else?
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="60503-03_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord makes several good points. I am completely at one with him. It is an appalling practice. It is a tragedy, and it is awful. Of course we take these matters seriously. We constantly discuss the issues with our opposite numbers in the Sri Lankan Government, and they make representations to us to act as firmly as we <br>&nbsp;<br>

can where there is clear evidence of fund-raising to finance terrorist activities. That is obviously one of our priorities, and we work closely with the police to ensure that that work is carried through.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="60503-03_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Monson: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it is the greatest pity that the Terrorism Act 2006 made it a criminal offence for investigative journalists and other writers to interview people such as the Tamil Tigers in their camps, as William Dalrymple did so splendidly a few years ago, thereby allowing them to reveal to the world at large just how fanatical and ruthless such organisations are?
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="60503-03_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, we have debated that issue at length. I am not aware that, as a result of the terrorism legislation that we have put in place, we have stopped investigative journalists carrying out their work. We are keen that journalists who have that information and knowledge pass it on to the authorities responsible for cracking down on terrorism.

<a name="60503-04_spmin2"></a><b>The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor  (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </b>  My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. The Bill gives effect to the Law Commission&#039;s proposal that legislation regulating the management of the radio spectrum should be consolidated into a single Act. The Bill is solely a consolidation measure, which will bring together provisions from six statutes. These are: the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949, the Marine, &c, Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967, Part II of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1967, Part VI of the Telecommunications Act 1984, the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1998 and Part 2 of the Communications Act 2003.

Consolidation is an important part of the Government&#039;s better regulation agenda. It makes the law easier to use and understand. It improves the statute book and saves time and money for those who have to consult it. I am grateful to all those at the Law Commission and the Department of Trade and Industry who have worked on the Wireless Telegraphy Bill and to those who responded to the consultation on its content.

<a name="60503-05_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Prisoners: Deportation</h3>



<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="60503-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary in another place. The Statement is as follows:


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_4"></a>&quot;With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement on the deportation and removal of foreign national prisoners. I will update the House on our progress in considering the cases which, I reported last week, had been released without proper consideration, and I will set out the facts in relation to the reports on foreign national prisoners and the removal of failed asylum seekers which my department received over a period of time. I will also set out the action taken by my department in response to those reports, including the robust procedures put in place to deal with the very specific issue of consideration of deportation pre-release.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_5"></a>&quot;Finally, I will set out, as promised a week ago, the conclusions I have come to on reforms necessary to the policy framework in which deportations are considered and dealt with. Let me begin by confirming, as set out to the House last week, that, as a result of decisions taken earlier this year, including improved management structures, more resources and tightened procedures, we have for the past month had a system to ensure that further cases cannot be missed. This situation will continue to improve as we move over time, as a matter of routine, to consider for deportation all potential cases a year before they leave prison, or at the beginning of the sentence, if that is less.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_6"></a>&quot;Last Friday I wrote to you, Mr Speaker, to set out our progress in dealing with those cases released without prior consideration of deportation. I would now like to update the House on the figures I published then. As of yesterday evening, consideration of all the most serious 79 cases had been completed, with deportation action having been commenced in respect of 70. The remaining <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_468"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 468</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

nine are cases where deportation action is not being pursued, in accordance with current policy criteria. Thirty-two of those 70 are now accounted for and either deported or within our control. The Immigration Service and police are continuing priority operations to bring the remainder under control. I will not give further details at this stage as the House will appreciate that my first priority is the efficacy of these operations.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_7"></a>&quot;As I made clear in last Friday&#039;s letter, our second priority for consideration is the 103 cases for which, as we stated to the Public Accounts Committee, the type of offence was unknown. Data on these cases is now complete and I can say that there are 11 of these cases where the original offence was within our category of &#039;more serious offences&#039;. Consideration for deportation of all but one of these cases has now been completed and deportation action has commenced in respect of seven of them. Since their release none of these individuals has committed any of the more serious further offences.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_8"></a>&quot;This deals with all the cases where individuals were originally convicted of more serious offences. Of the 1,023 cases in total, consideration has commenced in 574 cases, of which 554 have been completed, with deportation action being pursued in 446 cases. Perhaps I should add that almost all of the cases which have so far been given prominence in the media in recent days are not among those on which I have been reporting to the House, though some do indeed raise important issues of policy.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_9"></a>&quot;Whatever the historic failings, I want to thank all of those engaged in the very intensive work which has continued throughout the bank holiday weekend. This has included a major police incident room in Portsmouth, a casework operation in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) in Croydon, work by prison and probation staff, and joint police and IND operations to detain offenders decided for deportation. There is a very high operational commitment to this work, for which I want to express appreciation.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_10"></a>&quot;From the outset I have acknowledged that there has been a systemic failure within the Home Office, which I regret and for which I have apologised. For example, it was only in 1999 that records began to be kept in this area at all. However, there have been a number of allegations of inaction by the Home Office, in a range of areas over a period, which have portrayed what I believe to be a false position. I want now to set the record straight.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_11"></a>&quot;There are three distinct issues. The first is the broad issue of the rising number of foreign nationals in our prisons, from 5,587 in 2000 to almost 10,000 in 2005, and the policy framework for their deportation. The second is the removal of failed asylum seekers and our action to reach the so-called &#039;tipping point&#039;. The third is the specific operational question of the backlog of cases. The first issue, the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_469"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 469</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

overall approach to foreign-national prisoners and their deportation, was raised over a period by respective Chief Inspectors of Prisons. In summary, they have mainly made the argument that the Government were not paying sufficient attention to foreign-national prisoners or their human rights, particularly in relation to detention after the end of their sentence.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_12"></a>&quot;The Home Office has sought to deal with these concerns by a variety of means, which, among other things, led to the deportation of about 3,000 foreign-national prisoners in 2004 and 2005, a figure to compare with a total foreign-national prisoner population of 9,690 in 2005. Anne Owers acknowledged some progress on this broad issue in her report of 2004&#150;05.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_13"></a>&quot;The second issue, the removal of failed asylum seekers, was the main focus of the NAO report of July 2005, entitled <i>Returning Failed Asylum Seekers</i>. The overall conclusion of the report was that the prompt departure or removal of an unsuccessful asylum applicant should be prioritised, a conclusion which squared exactly with the Home Office prioritisation of asylum in general and, in particular, action to reach the point where more asylum seekers were leaving the country than there were unfounded new applications. This was indeed achieved in February this year and was widely welcomed.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_14"></a>&quot;The NAO report also noted that action on criminal cases was not being initiated early enough to allow preparations for removal to be made pre-release from prison, though it acknowledged the increase in resources already directed to dealing with these cases. The Home Office immediately responded to the NAO comment. Additional staffing of 90 caseworkers to come on stream from January 2006 was identified, as was a further &#163;2.7 million of resource to come online from 1 April 2006. Immigration Service staff were placed in four London prisons, and surgeries were held in 60 prisons; a weekly report on the foreign national prisoner population was initiated; and new arrangements were made to move foreign nationals who had completed their sentences from prison to immigration detention facilities at the rate of around 300 a month. In addition management arrangements were strengthened.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_15"></a>&quot;This NAO report was the basis for the Public Accounts Committee evidence session on 26 October 2005, which also focused on the removal of failed asylum seekers. I have already acknowledged the important role played by the Public Accounts Committee in focusing attention upon these matters. I also very much welcome the announcement that the Home Affairs Committee will extend its inquiry to cover this matter. The House may recall that I first raised publicly my concern over the broad policy issues raised by the increase in the number of foreign-national prisoners in evidence to the Home Affairs Committee on 25 October last year.

</p>

<a name="60503-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_16"></a>&quot;Following the PAC hearing, the Home Office set about collecting and cleansing the data in order that we could report properly to the committee and the public on the true size and nature of the backlog, and take the appropriate action. The first report was made to the PAC in November. However, closer analysis revealed that the backlog was larger than previously thought and, crucially, that serious offenders were among the backlog. This was reported to me at the end of March 2006, together with plans to re-check the information before it was put into the public domain, to begin casework on this backlog, and to work with prisons and probation on the serious cases.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_17"></a>&quot;The PAC published its report on 14 March. It did address the issue of foreign-national prisoners in the body of its report, but it was not in a position to draw firm conclusions or to make firm recommendations.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_18"></a>&quot;The rise in the number of foreign nationals in our prisons and the overall policy framework for dealing with issues of their deportation is a longstanding concern on which detailed work has been proceeding for some months. I would now like to report my preliminary conclusions to the House. These are complex and difficult issues. I will shortly publish, before the end of May, a consultation paper with specific, detailed proposals from the beginning to the end of the process. The guiding principle will be that foreign nationals guilty of criminality should expect to be deported. To achieve this I will consult in the following areas. First, the data which identifies an individual as a foreign national must be captured at the beginning of the criminal justice system, including at the point of arrest and as the case proceeds through the courts. At each stage there should be sanctions against individuals who give false information on nationality or indeed no information at all.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_19"></a>&quot;Secondly, it is important to ensure that the issue of deportation is raised throughout the sentencing process. Following recommendations from the Sentencing Advisory Panel, the Sentencing Guidelines Council will shortly be publishing draft guidelines to set clear criteria according to which judges should make deportation recommendations when sentencing.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para16"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_20"></a>&quot;Thirdly, we need to deport prisoners at an earlier stage in their sentences. Ideally, prisoners should serve their sentences in full in their home countries, which also assists rehabilitation. The UK currently has prisoner transfer agreements with 90 countries; we have recently ratified an agreement with India and others are awaiting ratification. Within the EU, we are strongly supporting the efforts of the Austrian presidency to secure a directive which will enable the repatriation of prisoners within the EU without requiring the consent of the prisoner. In addition, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced arrangements to consider whether prisoners should be deported before the end of the sentence, and we will consult upon proposals to enable that to happen earlier in a prisoner&#039;s sentence.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_471"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 471</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>

<a name="60503-05_para17"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_21"></a>&quot;Fourthly, I want to make it clear that the Government not only intend to ensure that the current system operates effectively but also seek after consultation to extend the categories of offenders who are considered for deportation. We will therefore publish proposals to consider for deportation a wider range of offenders.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para18"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_22"></a>&quot;I want to state clearly that, where deportation can properly be considered, the clear presumption should be that deportation will follow unless there are special circumstances why it cannot. We will consult on whether this presumption should be made statutory through primary legislation. Such a presumption would include: all criminals sentenced to imprisonment, all those convicted for an offence listed in an order under Section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, all those on the sex offenders register, repeat offenders, and, of course, all those recommended for deportation by the sentencing judge. We believe that there is a strong case for extending these proposals to any individual convicted of an imprisonable offence, whether or not a sentence of imprisonment was actually given, and we will consult on that.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para19"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_23"></a>&quot;These proposals would replace the current practice of considering for deportation only non-EEA nationals with a sentence of 12 months or more, EEA nationals with a sentence of 24 months or more, cases where the individual has three lesser convictions in a five-year period, and all cases where the sentencing judge has recommended deportation.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para20"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_24"></a>&quot;In relation to our policy framework, I have already said that we are now ensuring that all deportation decisions are being taken before an individual is released. That will continue but I will also consult on the following steps to ensure effective implementation of deportation and removal decisions: full use of the less burdensome process of administrative removal rather than deportation in eligible cases&#151;that is, where individuals have no or limited leave to remain; more effective procedures in relation to psychiatric hospitals; a new power in primary legislation to enable us to detain an individual pending consideration of whether they should be deported or removed as a result of their criminal conviction; amending primary legislation so that deportation appeals, save for those raising asylum or human rights issues that are not clearly unfounded are heard after the individual has been deported from the UK; and the introduction of an automatic bar on return for all those who are subject to administrative removal due to criminality, as is already the case with those who are deported.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para21"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_25"></a>&quot;Finally, I should add that I will also consult on proposals to achieve a more coherent approach to taking criminality into account in decisions on who is allowed into the country, who is allowed to stay, who is granted settlement, and who can acquire British citizenship.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para22"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_26"></a>&quot;These are significant proposals which, as I said earlier, we have been preparing for some months. They will, I am sure, also be controversial but I hope <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_472"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 472</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that unlike with some previous legislation in this area we can rely on the full-hearted support of both the main opposition parties in ensuring that foreign nationals who commit crimes are deported rapidly to the countries from which they come.


</p>

<a name="60503-05_para23"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_27"></a>&quot;This has been an unedifying episode for all of us in the Home Office who are charged with the protection of the public.  But I said that I would stay and put the situation right. I have set out the results of the intensive work being done by the agencies to deal with the outstanding cases. I have set out steps taken to improve our systems on foreign national prisoners, including robust procedures which now mean that the appropriate processes are in place, and I have set out my proposals to deport more offenders, more quickly&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60503-05_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.

<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="60503-06_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement made earlier today by his right honourable friend. I respond to it with a feeling of regret about the shambles over which the Home Secretary has presided. I made it clear on a previous occasion, quite recently, that the Home Secretary has been regarded with a broad degree of respect including, certainly, by me. The sorry tale of the failure to stem the tide of the release of foreign prisoners into our community when they should have been considered for deportation before their release is a stain on his career.
</p>

<a name="60503-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>Some 735 of the 1,023 foreign prisoners were released between February 1999 and the time when Mr Clarke became Home Secretary. But 288 more foreign criminals were released after August 2005&#151;that is, after the Home Secretary explicitly knew there was a problem. He has acknowledged that as a fact. The rate of release therefore accelerated on his watch.
</p>

<a name="60503-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>I have several questions for the Minister, but first I make it clear that we on these Benches will support any action that addresses these problems effectively. If that includes new legislation, so be it, but that legislation must be thoroughly and constructively scrutinised. That is the role of this House. To be a mere rubber stamp for executive authority would demean us all.
</p>

<a name="60503-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>The Government have said that they intend to create a presumption of deportation for foreign criminals. We support that intention, but it is right that the Government should be asked now, as they have been over the past week, why they have not properly used the powers that they already have. The 1971 Immigration Act gives the Home Secretary explicit powers to deport any non-British citizen; Section 3(5) says that he may do so,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;if he deems deportation to be conducive to the public good&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>Why have the Government not made full and effective use of that?
</p>

<a name="60503-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>The Minister referred to the draft guidelines that will shortly be published by the Sentencing Guidelines Council, following recommendations made to it by the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_473"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 473</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Sentencing Advisory Panel. However, when the Sentencing Advisory Council reported last year, it pointed out that judicial recommendations for deportation may be ignored by the Home Secretary in as many as 25 per cent of cases. What guarantee do we have that any of the changes announced by the Government today will improve the Home Secretary&#039;s rate of approval of the judge&#039;s recommendations to deport?
</p>

<a name="60503-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>I now turn to the length of time that it took the Government to alert the police to this problem. The Home Secretary and his predecessors were warned several times by Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Prisons and by some police forces of the growing magnitude of the problem of foreign criminals being released rather than deported. The Home Secretary himself was warned again by the National Audit Office on 14 July last year. At least 400 foreign criminals were identified in the Home Office&#039;s first submission to the Public Accounts Committee who could have been arrested and deported.
</p>

<a name="60503-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>If the Minister can give us a good reason today why the Government were unable to act 10 months ago, the question has to be: why did the Government not act one month ago, when they had a full list available? Crucially, why did the Home Secretary tell the press about the problem before he told the police, giving more than 1,000 criminals the chance to disappear before the police could launch their attempts to catch them?
</p>

<a name="60503-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>The Government have still not given us the information that they promised us last week, which was the full number of crimes committed by the 1,023 foreign criminals since their release. When will that information be given? Moreover, the Home Secretary has not told us how many crimes were committed by the 288 criminals released after he was explicitly told about the problem. When will that information be given?
</p>

<a name="60503-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>Last Friday, the Home Secretary said in his letter to the Speaker that he considered 79 of the foreign offenders to be serious. He tells us today that deportation has been started on 70 of them, but of course only 32 of those 70 have so far been located. That is indeed troubling. The Minister says that, of the 1,023 foreign criminals who are at issue here, deportation is being pursued in 446 cases. Will the Minister tell us today how many of those 446 are now within the control of the police?
</p>

<a name="60503-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>We must now all be concerned that even this 1,000 may be just the tip of the iceberg. Almost every day that passes, we hear of a new failure. Some have been rehearsed in the press today, but I shall not ask questions on those matters for fear of falling foul of <i>sub judice</i> rules. Our overriding concern on these Benches is that there must be effective and appropriate management of the deportation of foreign prisoners. Revelations over the past week have put at risk public confidence in the ability of the Home Secretary to achieve that. Whatever the reasons behind the rolling rhetoric of the Home Secretary in his Statement, only <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_474"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 474</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

one thing really matters&#151;that the Government now get a grip on this policy issue for the safety of the public. The British public deserve nothing less.

<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="60503-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for repeating this Statement in your Lordships&#039; House. I listened to Prime Minister&#039;s Question Time in the other place. There is a temptation to apportion blame to one or the other party as to who should have done what and when. This Statement is far too serious and I shall avoid that temptation. The demand for the Home Secretary&#039;s resignation has been fully aired in the newspapers and in the other place. We know that there are local elections tomorrow, and public appetite will not be satisfied until a resolution is reached on this subject.
</p>

<a name="60503-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>It comes as no surprise to many of us that such a disaster was bound to come to light. We have repeatedly drawn the Government&#039;s attention to the unacceptably high number of prisoners, to the procedures that created a high backlog of asylum seekers and to immigration procedures that are easy to enact but difficult to follow up. All this has resulted in our penal institutions becoming unmanageable. Is it any surprise, therefore, that foreign nationals or British citizens feature so prominently in repeat offences? Whether or not the functions of the Home Office need to be reorganised will have to be examined at some stage. We now require urgent action to deal with violent criminals who seem to have escaped the safety net. Public confidence has been destroyed since this foreign prisoners&#039; deportation issue came to light.
</p>

<a name="60503-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>I am therefore grateful for the Statement. We shall scrutinise the new figures with the attention that they deserve. We already know from the figures released last Friday that they beg as many questions as the answer. As for the announcement of new legislation for the revision of the rules, let us be clear that the present fiasco did not arise because of an absence of legislation, because of a lack of rules&#151;an 86-page document from the Prison Service came to light yesterday, which provides policy guidance on considering the deportation of non-British offenders&#151; or because of a lack of powers enjoyed by the Home Secretary. Indeed, the Home Secretary has very wide discretion already to remove anyone who is deemed not to be conducive to the public good.
</p>

<a name="60503-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>There is already a presumption in law that if you are convicted for an imprisonable offence you are liable for deportation. If a court recommends deportation of an offender, he or she should automatically be detained at the end of their sentence. According to the early release scheme introduced for foreign offenders, the assumption rests on automatic deportation. I ask the Minister to confirm that.
</p>

<a name="60503-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>The Government have introduced 36 new laws and 1,000 offences in the law and order area since 1997. The Minister must acknowledge that placing yet more pressure on an overburdened criminal justice system, with new rules and laws devised under the panic of the present fiasco, might <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_475"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 475</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

prove to be little more than a cosmetic solution. We will look positively at any measures necessary to deport those who should and can be deported more quickly than at present, but not if those measures prove on further consideration to be a knee-jerk reaction to help the Government out of this self-inflicted political problem.
</p>

<a name="60503-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Our prisons, as I said, are heavily crowded, the probation service is demoralised, the Government are at loggerheads from time to time with the judiciary and reoffending rates are now among the highest in the western world. This Government have presided over lamentably low conviction rates for some of the most serious crimes imaginable, such as rape. The Government should start getting a grip on the mismanagement of the whole criminal justice system, rather than indulging in rushing into new legislation.
</p>

<a name="60503-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>On one point I shall certainly come to the aid of the Home Secretary&#151;on those seeking to make political capital out of the tragic case of the murder of PC Sharon Beshenivsky. That is playing a most dangerous game. The present crisis centres on the fact that hundreds of offenders have not been considered for deportation at all when they should have been. By contrast, the case of Mr Jamal, suspected of playing a part in the murder of this PC, is of a very different order, since consideration of his deportation did take place, even though we now know that the decision taken had tragic consequences. In stirring this pot, they appear to be inching perilously close to active scaremongering.
</p>

<a name="60503-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Our focus will remain on the serial incompetence of a system in which the basic rules to examine each and every case for deportation simply were not operating at all. It is incompetence for which the Government should take political responsibility, and I note that the Home Secretary has apologised. However, he has said nothing today to restore that confidence which will come about only when the system is adequately monitored and the results of the 1,000-plus cases are known.
</p>

<a name="60503-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>We need to know at this stage where within the system we failed. What happens to those whose job it is to regulate the system? Can the Minister throw some light on that? Overall, it is a sorry state of affairs with very tragic consequences.

<a name="60503-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for the thanks of the noble Baroness and the noble Lord for the Home Secretary&#039;s Statement. I am also grateful to the noble Baroness for her commitment&#151;I think that I heard her say this&#151;to any action to support legislation that might be necessary to ensure that the problems and difficulties with which we have been grappling can be dealt with in the future in a more accurate, targeted and functional way. I am most grateful for that support.
</p>

<a name="60503-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>The noble Baroness is, of course, right to say that we should never rubber-stamp legislation and that we should properly scrutinise matters which are brought before your Lordships&#039; House to deal with some of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_476"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 476</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

profound problems that these issues involve. That is quite right and your Lordships&#039; House has a very good record on pursuing matters in that way.
</p>

<a name="60503-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, for his interest and concern, although, having heard what he said, I gained the impression that he and his party were rather less keen on supporting legislation. I believe that he argued against what he envisaged&#151;legislation which might act as a cosmetic solution. Having heard the Home Secretary&#039;s Statement today, I should have thought that it could hardly be argued that it is full of cosmetic solutions. The Home Secretary has thought long and hard about the additional measures which may well be necessary to tackle some of the problems that this issue has highlighted. I do not think that we should underestimate the importance of that point. Of course, the noble Lord is right to say that we should not be drawn into knee-jerk reactions, but I do not think that it is accurate or fair to say that all of this is simply the product of an overworked and overcrowded prison system, because that is not the case. These problems have been around for a long time. The Government have grappled with them over that period and previous governments have had to deal with similar issues.
</p>

<a name="60503-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, as ever, was assiduous in asking her questions and I shall try to deal with some of them this afternoon. The noble Baroness quite properly asked why we had not made full use of the deportation powers contained in the Immigration Act 1971, and referred to Section 3. Successive administrations have made use of available deportation powers. The Secretary of State has discretion in considering when deportation is conducive and what grounds should be considered. In today&#039;s Statement, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary signalled his intention to seek deportation for a wider group of criminal offences. I gave details of the numbers that are currently under consideration.
</p>

<a name="60503-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>The noble Baroness also asked what guarantees there were that new powers will help convert court recommendations into actual deportations. That is a very important question. The proposals set out in the Statement will provide a better procedural and legislative framework in which to deport a higher number of people whose actions make deportation the appropriate course. That has to be right and the way forward. I am sure that the noble Baroness will want to support that.
</p>

<a name="60503-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, asked whether there was already a presumption for deportation where imprisonable offences were committed. Existing legislation provides that a court may recommend deportation where an imprisonable offence is committed. This is different from the proposal that deportations shall be the presumed outcome. I would like to see from the noble Lord and the noble Lord&#039;s Benches a signature to that new commitment of the Government, because it is an important one. We believe that presumption should be there. I hope the noble Lord&#039;s party adds its support to that because <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_477"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 477</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that will help us to strengthen the current situation and enable us to secure support for that proposition in Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60503-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>I willingly concede that there have been errors and omissions along the way, but it would be wrong to presume that the Government do not take these matters very seriously. We do take them seriously. We have acted swiftly when these matters have been drawn through the process and when questions have been asked. A great deal of work has been undertaken; the Statement makes that clear. It is clear to me, too, that we should give all our active support and consideration to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, the police, and also the prison and probation services, to ensure that this work is carried through and that these deportations&#151;where they are right and proper&#151;are given full effect.

Why does he accept the assurance of the noble Baroness, who speaks on behalf of the Conservatives, when time and again, in this House, they have followed the Liberal Democrats through the Lobby watering down legislation? How will he discuss this with the Conservatives, with the Liberal Democrats and above all with the Cross Benches to make sure that on this occasion the Government&#039;s proposal is enacted speedily and effectively to deal with this problem?

<a name="60503-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, for his intervention, because he touches on an important point. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, as an advocate for her party, shows great integrity and is a noble Baroness of her word. I have a great deal of respect for her. We have worked closely over a number of years to ensure the safe passage on to the statute book of many important measures. But as the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, says, we have often brought important proposals before noble Lords, which deserve the support of the House, and yet we have been turned over on these things. It has made our job in government tougher. That is precisely why I welcome what the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, had to say, because I got the distinct impression that she would give a very fair wind indeed to practical propositions. I hope that the Front Bench opposite sticks to that. Clearly the same cannot exactly be said for the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, and his party. They recognise the problem. Whether they will help us to grapple with the solutions remains to be seen. There is a question mark.

<a name="60503-07_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Waddington: </b>   My Lords, I hope the Minister will, on reflection, agree with me that the matter identified by the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, is certainly not the problem with which we are faced today. Nor is this just a matter of an official failure to identify and consider for removal foreign criminals reaching the end of their sentence. The position, surely, is that under this Government there has been, to all intents and purposes, a complete collapse of immigration control. Net legal immigration now runs at well over 300,000 a year, enough to populate a new city the size of Birmingham every five years, and hundreds of thousands of people are estimated to be here illegally. This has led to a massive increase in the number of foreigners in our gaols. If that is not the cause, what is the cause of this dramatic increase in the number of foreigners in our gaols? There are some 11,700 at present&#151;one in eight of the entire prison population. The Prison Service and the Immigration and Nationality Directorate have simply not been able to cope. That is why we are in this position today. It is not officials who destroyed immigration control; it is this Government. It is not official incompetence, but government policy that is responsible for criminals, murderers and rapists having been released onto our streets. Unless we get some recognition of that, we are not going to get very far.

Had advice that was given by a number of people&#151;myself included&#151;been taken earlier, I do not believe that it would be necessary to introduce these sorts of measures under these sorts of circumstances. I am sure that we all regret that a situation should have arisen where both the Home Secretary&#151;many of us respect the current holder of that office for the vision he has shown regarding what he wants to do with the management of offenders&#151;and the Home Office, one of the great offices of state, should be dragged through the mire and criticised so publicly and viciously for something that was an accident waiting to happen. It was not only an accident waiting to happen regarding immigration but regarding many other affairs, thanks to a consistent failure over many years to tackle the problem of poor management within that office.

<a name="60503-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>My interest as Her Majesty&#039;s Chief Inspector of Prisons is that I raised this issue in my annual report of 2001. I made three specific recommendations to the Home Office at that time. First, I said that this problem would not be solved unless someone was <br>&nbsp;<br>

made responsible and accountable for the treatment and conditions of all foreign nationals in prisons and that until that happened, no one could be held to account and no proper, consistent action could be taken. Secondly, I drew attention to the needs of foreign national prisoners, which included language problems and treatment. Nothing happened about that.

</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="60503-08_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Ramsbotham: </b>   My Lords, thirdly, I drew attention to the fact that too many foreign national prisoners were awaiting deportation and at the end of their sentence they then went to an immigration centre. When I inspected the immigration centres, I found that the staff were extremely concerned that prisoners were coming into organisations that were there to handle asylum seekers and immigration detainees, and they did not want prisoners in their midst.

All I want to do is draw attention to these things, because we have here an attempt to solve one problem, which is one problem among many. I hope that the Home Secretary, in tackling this problem, will realise that the same sort of solution is needed in many other aspects of the criminal justice system as a whole. It is no good just plugging one gap and not tackling them all. I hope therefore that this will act as a wake-up call, because I am sure that if it does the Home Secretary will find that there is cross-party, Cross-Bench and every other support for any intention to put this system right.

I pay tribute to him for his work as Her Majesty&#039;s Chief Inspector of Prisons, and I am aware of his important report. I made reference in repeating the Statement to the fact that traditionally chief inspectors of prisons have drawn to the attention of the Home Secretary, as the Minister responsible, welfare issues relating to foreign prisoners. This Statement is related to welfare but concentrates mostly on improving our ability to secure deportations where people have committed serious crimes and have served a period of imprisonment that has come to a close. I am grateful to the noble Lord for his commentary, but there is nothing further I can add other than to say <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_480"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 480</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that I will ensure that his important remarks are forwarded to the Home Secretary in order that they can be taken account of in the round when looking at this whole policy area.

<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="60503-08_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Corbett of Castle Vale: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister confirm, for the benefit of the <i>Daily Mail</i>, that it was not because of fears for the safety of Mustaf Jama, a convicted felon wanted for his suspected involvement in the murder of WPC Beshenivsky, that he was not returned to his native Somalia, but because the militia in control of the airport had made it clear that they would fire on any plane that tried to land there? Can the Minister also confirm&#151;I do not minimise the failures of the Home Office, as my noble friend will acknowledge&#151;that the proportion of UK nationals convicted of very serious criminal offences who reoffend is higher than the reoffending rate among foreign nationals who have been in our prisons?
</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="60503-08_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I think that is the case. I do not have those figures to hand, but it is an important element of the debate. It would be wrong of me to become embroiled in a debate about individual cases, although the particular case to which the noble Lord and many others, including large chunks of the media today, have drawn our attention is of grave concern. It raises, as I said in the Statement, important areas of policy and it will no doubt feed into the wider debate on this issue. There are countries to which it is almost impossible to return nationals, because of the state of unrest within their boundaries. Somalia is a highly unstable country that falls very neatly into that category.

<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="60503-08_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   My Lords, will the noble Lord confirm that victims of people who have been released without being deported and who reoffend will be properly compensated? If they are not, the Home Secretary will have opened himself up to an action for misfeasance in a public office. He has come before us in sackcloth and ashes, apologising for the unedifying shambles in the Home Office, and will have to pay the price unless the state steps in.

<a name="60503-08_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Elystan-Morgan: </b>   My Lords, within the past week or so the Home Office has stated that it is unable to set out the number of cases where there was a judicial recommendation of deportation. Will the Minister kindly confirm that this is the case and, if so, how does that come about when such data are undoubtedly collected at circuit, if not national, level? Furthermore, if no figures for deportation recommendations are available, it would appear to be inevitable that there are no data about those cases <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_481"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 481</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

where a judge considered deportation and specifically concluded that no such recommendation should be made. Although it may well be that the totality of these figures does not change the general situation, certainly it may mean that from that figure of 1,023 there may be hundreds of cases where there is no real and acute danger to the public.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="60503-08_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord&#039;s final statement is quite likely to be accurate. I cannot today give the noble Lord the number of cases where a judge recommended deportation. Throughout this there has been an absence of accurate data. The situation that we inherited&#151;I do not use that inheritance as an excuse for what has happened in recent weeks&#151;was not a happy one. No figures for foreign national prisoners were accurately in place, as I understand it, until the late 1990s, although I have data that relate from 1997 through to the present. There has been an absence of accurate data collection and clearly we need to improve that. Some improvements have undoubtedly been made in recent years. We now have a much clearer picture of the nature of the problem and, as a consequence, some of the issues are there to be dealt with and resolved.

Secondly, does he accept that the circumstances that gave rise to this Statement make all sensible people both miserable and anxious and should propel them into seeking answers, not trying to invent slogans? Thirdly, can the Minister think of anyone who has a more personal strength of character or personal commitment to resolving the long-term weaknesses in the system than the current Secretary of State for Home Affairs? Fourthly, will he join me in condemning those who, in these circumstances, seek to plant and harvest public anxieties by the exaggeration of their language, regardless of which House of Parliament they happen to be in and regardless of whether they are on the streets or elsewhere, or what previously illustrious office they may have held?

That report will be published next week and is to be called <i>Illegal migrants: proposals for a common EU returns policy.</i> It examines the practices in EU countries and comes up with fair, decent and effective policies and practices to deal with failed asylum seekers.

Will the Government ensure that, with whatever reforms now take place, the judges, through the Judicial Studies Board and the Department for Constitutional Affairs, are included in the consultations and given full information as to how the orders they make will be implemented in the future? Will the Government bear in mind that judges, on the whole, react much more favourably to making orders which mean what they say, whether in relation to deportation or sentencing, rather than those which are something of a fiction?

However, I think he is in danger of misrepresenting the position. As I said in the Statement, there have been more than 3,000 deportations of foreign national prisoners in the past two years alone. Clearly, there have been management failures. The Home Secretary is well aware of that, and the measures offered today, which will be consulted on extensively&#151;of course the Judicial Studies Board will be part of that&#151;will make a significant improvement to processes and ensure that we have a more timely arrangement for securing these deportations when sentences due to be served in UK prisons are complete.

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>As my noble friend Lord Roberts of Conwy knows, it is no secret that I argued strongly against devolution, both as Secretary of State and subsequently. I genuinely believed that my experience demonstrated that Wales was well and effectively served, in the best interests of all its people, by having full representation in the UK Government at the highest level. Since the narrow referendum result that ushered in devolution, however, we have all come to terms with the inevitable changes. In now seeking to improve the Bill, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_484"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 484</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I recognise that there have been teething troubles and worse, but the principality has unquestionably recently been enjoying a tremendous renaissance.
</p>

<a name="60503-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>From the Millennium Stadium, which now seems to be hosting the FA cup final indefinitely, the Welsh National Opera and the Millennium Centre, to the fantastic new series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#151;filmed in Wales by BBC Wales, using Welsh talent but entrancing an entire nation&#151;it is an exciting phase in the history of Wales. Of course, the Assembly Government cannot be cited as the single cause of all this, but they are part of this new era and have an integral role to play in the future of Wales. We must, however, be hard-headed about that future. The devolution settlement across the United Kingdom is very uneven, and it is hard to see it settling down for any length of time until all the constituent parts of the union are palpably being treated fairly.
</p>

<a name="60503-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Aspects of each devolutionary settlement give cause for concern. I shall deal with the Ram doctrine and the royal prerogative shortly, but I turn first to the crucial question of the role of the senior law officers in the structure of government in Wales. On paper, the Counsel General is neither fish nor fowl. The role is a curious amalgam of poacher and gamekeeper, both offering friendly and courteous advice to members of the Assembly Government and watching over their shoulders to ensure that they behave themselves. I hope to hear from the Minister how he reconciles these two approaches.
</p>

<a name="60503-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>There is no mention of a Counsel General in the Government of Wales Act 1998. The role as I understand it has been to act as a senior legal adviser to the Assembly. There is obviously no objection to the position receiving statutory recognition. However, there is a markedly different system in Scotland, and there is an element of confusion about the future role of the Counsel General in Wales. The Counsel General is expressly stated to be a member of the Welsh Government. The assumption seems to be that the Counsel General will continue to act as a law officer to the Welsh Executive. Paragraph 2.9 of the White Paper states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;His or her principal role will be to advise the Welsh Assembly Ministers on legal matters relating to the exercise of their devolved functions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>However, a number of specific references in the Bill confer a different role: initiating challenges if the Assembly or Ministers act outside their powers. These two roles may sound similar, but the duties owed in the two roles go in opposite directions. As legal adviser to Ministers, the Counsel General owes them a duty to try to keep them out of trouble. As the person responsible for initiating challenge, the Counsel General&#039;s duty is, where appropriate, to get them into trouble. It is almost the difference between prosecution and defence.
</p>

<a name="60503-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify this, but whichever of the above-mentioned roles the Counsel General is to fill, and all the more so if he is to perform both at the same time, he needs to be a lawyer&#151;I would venture to say a lawyer of considerable stature&#151;yet there is no mention in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_485"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 485</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Bill of a need for him to have any legal qualification or experience. I hope that the Minister will comment on that aspect, too.
</p>

<a name="60503-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>It may be said that all these different roles can be combined in a person of outstanding experience, ability and integrity, and that it all depends on the quality of the individual. Perhaps so, but should the legislation not then say more about the kind of individual who might be considered suitable for the post?
</p>

<a name="60503-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>It is essential to ensure that the appointment process is transparent and that the individual appointed possesses, and is seen to possess, independence as well as impartiality and integrity. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="60503-09_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   We on these Benches support the amendment and seek clarification on whether the Counsel General is now to be a political appointment, as are the Solicitor-General and the Lord Advocate in Scotland. I particularly like the third proposed subsection of the amendment, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;The functions of the Counsel General shall be exercised by him independently of any other person&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>The Counsel General who was appointed and served for a long time in that position in the Welsh Assembly certainly acted independently, advising the Presiding Officer and Members of their powers. He has retired but has not, as I understand it, been replaced. Consequently, there is a wide gap in the legal department of the Welsh Assembly that has to be filled. It is right that there should be a lawyer who advises on the powers of the Assembly. I hope that he will not be a political person; I hope that he can give independent advice.

<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="60503-10_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Carlile of Berriew: </b>   I support what has just been said by my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. The history of this appointment is not altogether happy. As has been said, Mr Roddick, who was the first Counsel General, regarded himself, and was widely regarded, as being entirely independent. Those who have discussed his appointment with Mr Roddick know that there were uncomfortable moments for him, for he did not always know where the fountainhead of his independence lay. It was by him and in his courage in the job that that independence was established.
</p>

<a name="60503-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>After his retirement, there was what can be described only as an unseemly mess. There was a completely independent trawl for a new Counsel General. Recruitment consultants were used in the normal Civil Service way and the Civil Service Commission carried out the interviews. I believe that the final interviews were chaired by the First Civil Service Commissioner, who is a respected Member of this House. An appointment was provisionally made, of an extremely distinguished lawyer who everyone who knows the Welsh or the legal world would have regarded as an exemplary, apolitical appointment. For reasons that have never been adequately explained, it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_486"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 486</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

appears that the present First Minister rejected that appointment and, as a result, there has been no Counsel General since then.
</p>

<a name="60503-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>It is clear from what occurred that the present First Minister, at least, wished and presumably wishes that the Counsel General should, in effect, be like the Solicitor-General for Scotland or Lord Advocate; that is, a political appointment, a member of the Government in political terms and, as happens conventionally with Scottish law officers, someone who becomes a Member of your Lordships&#039; House. To many of us, that is not acceptable. We can do better in Wales. Someone like the person who the Civil Service Commission wished to be appointed would be an outstanding public servant, and would ensure that the Welsh Assembly Government&#039;s activities were lawful and that the Bill, when it becomes an Act, is fully carried out. There will be real concern, even in political circles in Wales that, if it is to be merely a political appointment, the quality of that appointment will suffer and the government of Wales will suffer as a result. This is therefore an extremely serious issue on which real clarification is required from the Front Bench.
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="60503-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Elystan-Morgan: </b>   I have some sympathy with the amendments. The office of Counsel General has suffered a sea change within the past few years. When the Assembly was first created, the role of the Counsel General could probably have been said to be akin to that of a conscientious clerk to a county council in the old days when such a clerk was a lawyer and intended to act as the solicitor, as it were, for that body. With the development of the Assembly, and particularly with the developments enshrined in the Bill, it is entirely proper that the role of the Counsel General should be regarded as more comparable to the role of an Attorney-General than to that of a clerk to a county council.
</p>

<a name="60503-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>I agree completely with what has been said: it is essential that the Counsel General is a person of the highest legal standing and, indeed, of considerable experience. I do not comment on what the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, said about the difficulties relating to appointment. I have shared chambers with both Mr Roddick, whom I regard as a person of the highest distinction, and Mr Elias&#151;the candidate whose candidature caused such controversy&#151;again, a person of the utmost probity and the first rank of legal experience and expertise.
</p>

<a name="60503-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Nevertheless, if the role is to be comparable with that of an Attorney-General, one may very well have to accept that it is a quasi-legal appointment. That does not damn that appointment for all time. Attorneys-General perform two roles: they are members of a government and political creatures, but they also exercise quasi-judicial functions. I believe that in all parties over the last 100 years one has found, almost invariably, an adherence to such standards. I had the very splendid experience in this Chamber of being an understudy to the late Lord Elwyn-Jones. I cannot imagine anybody who portrayed those qualities of judicial independence as well as he did. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_487"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 487</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I would accept, therefore, that the development of the Assembly justifies a change in the role of the Counsel General. It is inevitable that there should be some prospect of that person being a political appointment. I am not entirely happy with the idea that he should be a Minister; I would prefer him to be independent of that system.
</p>

<a name="60503-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>However, I doubt very much whether one can have it both ways. One has to accept, therefore, his political involvement. What I unfortunately do not accept is that there should be consultation with the Attorney-General before an appointment is made. The Assembly is given great powers and much trust is to be invested in it. It would be insulting and wholly unnecessary for there to be a necessity for that consultation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="60503-10_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Richard: </b>   When the Assembly was constituted as a corporate body, it was quite clear that one needed one Counsel General, but it became clear after a while that he had to perform two distinct roles. One role clearly was that he was there to advise the Assembly Government, who, however one looked at the issue and wrapped it up, existed as a government. The other role was advising the parliamentary Assembly and particularly the Presiding Officer.
</p>

<a name="60503-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Marrying those two together was, to say the least, rather difficult and required a man of considerable standing to pull it off. Now that we are reconstituting the basis of the Assembly, and in effect saying that there should be a clear distinction between the Assembly Government on one hand and the Assembly on the other, the role of the Counsel General has to change. He cannot ride both horses and straddle that gap any more. He should be there primarily&#151;I imagine that this is what the Government have in mind; certainly it is what I had in mind&#151;to advise the Government on such matters as they require advice on, in exactly the same way as the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General here would advise the Government on how they should proceed.
</p>

<a name="60503-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>It is right that the Presiding Officer&#039;s department should have its own legal staff and access to its own legal advice. I see nothing wrong with that. Advising the Assembly Government in the way in which the Government at Westminster or the Scottish parliamentary Government are broadly advised would therefore seem perfectly acceptable in Wales, provided that there is at the same time a growth in the legal advice available to the Presiding Officer and Members of the Assembly. I hope that we can proceed on that basis. But I am bound to say I share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, that, if ever there were matters for the Assembly, this would seem to be one of them. It is not a matter for the Attorney-General.

<a name="60503-10_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   I begin by warmly welcoming the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, to our discussions. Several issues have been raised that are very interesting and, to be absolutely frank, completely new to me. We will read and reflect on the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_488"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 488</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

comments of noble Lords, particularly those of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, and do whatever needs to be done.
</p>

<a name="60503-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>As we have heard, Amendment No. 42 seeks to ensure that the Attorney-General is consulted on the appointment of the Counsel General. It also places a condition on the recruitment of the Counsel General to ensure that the office-holder must have been either a member of the Bar or a solicitor of the Supreme Court for at least 10 years. The recommendation for the appointment of the Counsel General is properly a matter for the Welsh Assembly Government, with the approval of the Assembly. The Government agree with the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, and my noble friend Lord Richard that the Attorney-General should not be consulted on the appointment.
</p>

<a name="60503-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>The Counsel General will be a member of, and the legal adviser to, the Welsh Assembly Government. He or she will be their representative in the courts and, in this capacity, the Counsel General and the Attorney-General could conceivably find themselves representing opposite sides of a devolution issue. We believe that the limitations which the noble Lord seeks to place on the criteria for the selection of the office-holder are too restrictive. Given the nature of the office of Counsel General, it is inconceivable that the First Minister would recommend for appointment a person who did not have a high degree of legal expertise and experience. To impose a specific set of qualifications would be unnecessary and an undue constraint on the First Minister&#039;s discretion. What if the best candidate had nine years&#039; experience rather than 10? Furthermore, very specific levels of legal qualification, which may be appropriate for a member of the judiciary, are not necessarily so appropriate for someone who will be a member of the Welsh Assembly Government as well as their legal adviser. The First Minister may wish to take other experience into account, such as experience in constitutional matters generally.
</p>

<a name="60503-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>As laid out in the Bill, the appointment will be made by Her Majesty on the recommendation of the First Minister. However, the First Minister must have the Assembly&#039;s agreement to the recommendation. The role of the Counsel General has no effect on the role or status of the UK law officers who were consulted on the drafting of the Bill. It might be helpful if I place on record exactly what the Counsel General&#039;s role will be&#151;to provide authoritative legal advice to the Welsh Assembly Government; to represent the Welsh Assembly Government in the courts generally; to institute proceedings for the determination of devolution issues and to defend any such proceedings instituted by the Attorney-General; to receive notice of cases involving devolution issues; to monitor proposed Assembly measures and, following a yes vote in a referendum, Assembly Bills for compliance with legislative competence; to refer doubtful cases to the Supreme Court, when it is established, but to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the mean time; and to meet UK law officers and law officers of the other devolved Administrations.

I should like to reflect on some of the points made by the Minister. In particular, I am grateful to him for setting out in such detail the role of the Counsel General and the functions that he will perform. Against that background, this has been a useful discussion.

<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="60503-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy </b>   moved Amendment No. 43:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>Leave out Clause 51 and insert the following new Clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_1"></a><br>
&quot;LIMIT ON NUMBER OF MINISTERS

<br>
(1) Not more than eight persons are to hold the office of Welsh Minister appointed under section 48 at any time.


<br>
(2) Not more than three persons are to hold the office of Deputy Welsh Minister at any time.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_100"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is self-explanatory. It seeks to limit the number of Welsh Ministers to eight and the number of Deputy Welsh Ministers to three, rather than the current provision to limit the total number of both posts to 12. It is a minor change and a probing new clause. I also seek to probe various issues relating to this provision.
</p>

<a name="60503-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>There are many reasons in favour of a limitation on the number of Ministers, not least the example of what has happened in Scotland. The number of Scottish Ministers has exploded from the original five to the current 22. I know that the responsibilities of the Scottish Parliament are considerably more extensive than those of the Welsh Assembly. Nevertheless, 22 Ministers is substantial. It might be described as a kind of overgrowth. It has obviously led to increased cost and complexity for possibly questionable benefit. In Wales, with its Assembly membership confined to 60, an inappropriately large number of Ministers and Deputy Ministers would, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_490"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 490</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I think we would all agree, also reduce the number of Welsh Assembly Members available to hold those Ministers to account.
</p>

<a name="60503-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>I am glad to see that this Bill does not repeat the mistake made in the Scottish Act of placing no limit on the number of Ministers. As it is obviously so much harder to reduce the number of Ministers once they have been appointed than to prevent them applying in the first place, it is sensible to have that limiting provision from the start.
</p>

<a name="60503-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a> The current provision makes no distinction between Ministers and Deputy Ministers, which is necessary given that there is some confusion over the precise role of the new deputies. Perhaps the Minister would like to take this opportunity to explain exactly what need he envisages Deputy Ministers fulfilling. What is to be their role? Are they the equivalent of Ministers of State or Under-Secretaries of State in the United Kingdom Government? In addition, how will the National Assembly cope with the increased workload that will result from the implementation of Part 3 and especially Part 4?
</p>

<a name="60503-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>We have heard in the other place that the Assembly will sit for more weeks and more hours in the week and that that should allow Assembly Members adequately to scrutinise the legislation and perform their functions. If the Minister has views to express on the new Assembly and its workload, we would be grateful to hear them. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="60503-11_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   We feel that this amendment is too restrictive and prescriptive. Eight Ministers does not encompass the functions of the Assembly. In Part 1 of Schedule 5 it is interesting to see all the fields that the Welsh Assembly covers; it lists as many as 20. That is approaching the kind of figure that the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said existed in Scotland. It is clear that some of the headings of the fields of Assembly responsibility could be combined.
</p>

<a name="60503-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>Agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development are clearly one responsibility, as at present. On the other hand, field two is ancient monuments and historic buildings. I do not think that any Minister would wish to be described like that; I am not sure whether he would have a very long shelf life. Other areas are, understandably, combined at the moment: culture and the Welsh language; economic development; education and training. The environment is a field in itself. The list runs through the fields of health, highways and transport, housing, local government, social welfare, and tourism, which are all very important. There is also, for example, water and flood defences, and town and country planning. When you start to work your way through those functions, you see that eight Ministers is an inadequate number.
</p>

<a name="60503-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>We agree with the wording of Clause 51, which lays down that there will be 12 Ministers. That seems sensible, particularly in the fields that I have just listed.

<a name="60503-11_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   As we have heard, Amendment No. 43 would limit the number of Ministers to eight and Deputy Ministers to three. The Government agree that a limit is important to the effective function of the Assembly and that there should be a limit on the size of the payroll vote. The Bill sets a statutory limit in Clause 51 so there is no danger of the sort of explosion mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, that has happened in Scotland. We agree with the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, that the amendment is too restrictive. We do not believe that the limit on the number of Ministers and Deputy Ministers needs to be reduced. Moreover, the Government believe that it is not necessary to limit the First Minister&#039;s discretion over the balance of Ministers and Deputy Ministers.
</p>

<a name="60503-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>The limit prescribed in the Bill&#151;a combined total of no more than 12 Welsh Ministers and Deputy Welsh Ministers&#151;is consistent with the current situation. There are currently eight Cabinet Ministers in addition to the First Minister, and four Deputy Ministers.
</p>

<a name="60503-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>In the House of Commons, there are currently 89 Ministers, including Whips, and 51 Parliamentary Private Secretaries. This represents around 21.7 per cent of the total membership of the Commons. The limit that we have proposed for the Assembly, taken together with the First Minister and the Counsel General, represents only a fractionally greater proportion of the Assembly if the Counsel General is also an Assembly Member, and a smaller proportion than in the House of Commons if the Counsel General is not.
</p>

<a name="60503-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>The Assembly will also have powers over Welsh Ministers&#039; and Deputy Welsh Ministers&#039; salaries by virtue of Clause 53, should there be any concern about the size of the payroll. Furthermore, I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that in the Assembly committee&#039;s consideration of the Bill, the only suggested amendment to this clause, which was subsequently withdrawn, sought to set limits of eight Ministers and five deputies.
</p>

<a name="60503-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, raised the question of the workload of the Assembly in relation to the number of Ministers. As I believe I pointed out previously, to ensure adequate scrutiny there is considerable scope for the Assembly to adapt its working practices and to spend less time on routine subordinate legislation. The Presiding Officer, the noble Lord, Lord Dafydd Elis-Thomas, agrees and has said that the timetable should increase from 33 to a minimum of 40 weeks a year and that Monday and Thursday mornings should become part of the Assembly&#039;s working week. In an interview he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;I agree with the Secretary of State, we all have to work harder here. There should be three to four days of proper scrutiny . . . We should sit for at least 40 weeks a year . . . We finished for Christmas at least a fortnight before Parliament&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

probing debate. I must say to the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, that my mind goes back to the time when only three Ministers looked after the Welsh Office and it was managed. We expect that many of the 20 or so spheres that he mentioned will be combined as responsibilities for Ministers. Nevertheless, the difference between the new clause and Clause 51 is minor, as I pointed out. We are glad that there will be a limit in the Bill on the number of Ministers, and also to hear repeated what was said by the Presiding Officer of the Assembly and endorsed by the Government: that the Assembly sittings and number of working days would be extended to cope with its new responsibilities, which, after the passage of the Bill, will be substantially different from the work of the old Assembly, with far more emphasis on holding Ministers to account.

<a name="60503-12_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral </b>   moved Amendment No. 44:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>Page 35, line 22, after &quot;anything&quot; insert &quot;within their powers&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>The noble Lord said: I thank the Minister for his kind welcome earlier today. I wish to turn for a few moments to the Ram doctrine. As I understand it, the doctrine is set out in a memorandum, dated 2 November 1945, from the then First Parliamentary Counsel, Granville Ram. It states that a Minister of the Crown may exercise any powers that the Crown has power to exercise, except in so far as the Minister is precluded by statute from so doing, either expressly or by necessary implication. But I do not think Ministers can pray that doctrine in aid when they argue against these small amendments.
</p>

<a name="60503-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>Amendment No. 44 would insert into Clause 60 the words &quot;within their powers&quot;, so subsection (1) would read:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;The Welsh Ministers may do anything within their powers which they consider appropriate&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>Under the Royal prerogative, discretionary ministerial powers are held to exist except where they are curtailed or curbed by statute. As they stand at present, however, Clauses 60 and 70 stand to create worryingly wide-ranging and open-ended powers for Ministers. We should think once, twice or perhaps even a thousand times before giving anyone in any circumstances the power to quote Clause 60 to do anything.
</p>

<a name="60503-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>I was interested to hear my noble friend talking abut the number of Ministers. I recall the time when I was privileged to work with him in the Welsh Office; he seemed to perform the duties of at least 10 or 12 Ministers. Therefore, he is somebody one would trust always to exercise those powers very carefully indeed. But I do not think he ever sought the sort of wide discretion in Wales currently afforded by Clause 60. I hope the Minister will think carefully <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_493"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 493</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

about what are reasonably minor amendments but which will set in context how Ministers can exercise their powers.
</p>

<a name="60503-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>Just as citizens are free to do anything that is not illegal, so Ministers are generally empowered to do anything which does not conflict with statute. The same is held to be true of Ministers in the Welsh Assembly, which is why it is not only right but essential to qualify the powers created in these two clauses.
</p>

<a name="60503-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>The later amendment, Amendment No. 48, would insert, in page 38, the word &quot;reasonable&quot;. Therefore, under the heading &quot;Financial assistance&quot; in Clause 70, subsection (1) would read:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;The Welsh Ministers may give financial assistance . . . to any person engaged in any activity which the Welsh Ministers consider will secure, or help to secure, the attainment of any [reasonable] objective which they aim to attain in the exercise of any of their functions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>That would be a good reassurance. In an ideal world or one based upon that hoary doctrine of subsidiarity, power would invariably be passed upwards rather than delegated downwards. But we do not live in an ideal world and that is simply not a practicable system. The fact is that the Welsh Assembly and the Assembly Government or Senedd are all created under an Act of Parliament. It falls to us as parliamentarians to establish precisely what their role and functions are to be and where their powers begin and end. 
</p>

<a name="60503-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>Of course these clauses are not a recipe for despotism, although in a different context some might put that construction on their terminology. However, unamended and unqualified, they may well be a recipe for chaos and confrontation. They are ambiguous and seemingly open-ended, and they could so easily be improved if Ministers were minded to accept these small but reassuring amendments. The amendments are in no sense wrecking. It could even be argued that they do no more than make explicit what is already very much the moving spirit behind the clauses. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="60503-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The noble Lord is not going to entice me down the path of the Ram doctrine. I am not sufficient a constitutional lawyer to debate with him those issues. Let me say, however, that we have taken that point into account. It is because we do not think that Welsh Ministers can rely on that doctrine, which is fairly complex and leads to a great deal of academic debate, that we have included these clauses in the Bill. We want to reduce the uncertainty over Welsh Ministers&#039; powers.
</p>

<a name="60503-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said that his amendments were modest, but so, let me say, are the clauses in the Bill. They are in a very real sense modelled on Section 2 of the Local Government Act 2000, which gave local authorities the power to promote well-being&#151;the noble Lord will be entirely familiar with that legislation. That was done to reduce uncertainty over powers of councillors to act where there was no specific power relevant to what they wanted to do, even though it would be for the benefit of the area and the people in it.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_494"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 494</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60503-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>If we seek to create for Welsh Ministers only that range of competence and definition as is in the Local Government Act for councillors, I do not think that the noble Lord can object greatly to what we have in the Bill. His amendments, although not wrecking&#151;I would not use a concept as vulgar as that&#151;would substantially change the Bill. We have included the power in the Bill for a very good reason. The power is executive and not legislative. The Ministers will be answerable to the Assembly for any powers that they exercise. The clause does not give Welsh Ministers the freedom to exceed the devolution settlement; it just enables them properly to exercise their powers by clarifying the extent of those powers.
</p>

<a name="60503-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>If the Welsh Ministers did not have a general power at all, they would be uncertain as to their precise ability to participate in important initiatives of benefit to Wales, such as supporting the police as part of a multi-agency initiative to tackle drug-related issues. Another example would be if they wanted to take action outside Wales. They might want to offer grant funding to Welsh National Opera to undertake an international tour. That would be to the benefit of the people of Wales in enhancing the reputation of the opera and spreading appreciation of Welsh culture.
</p>

<a name="60503-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>The power would not be specific. Ministers would be acting on a general power of promoting well-being and, if they exceeded any such power, the Assembly would check them, although, in that last illustration, I would expect the Assembly to endorse them and even egg them on in providing resources in that area.
</p>

<a name="60503-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>I seek to define a couple of areas, but there are many others&#151;I could go through a long list, but it would not be anywhere near exhaustive&#151;where Ministers would enjoy the support of the people of Wales for enhancing well-being. Unless Ministers had some aspects of general powers, they would not be able to do that. The frustration that obtained in local government and that led to the Local Government Act 2000 extending this concept would be felt in Wales if we did not provide for such a power, as we are doing in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60503-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will recognise that, just as he has pursued his amendments modestly, so I am trying to rejoin by saying that these powers are not excessive. There is no attempt to take away the answerability of Ministers from the Welsh Assembly or to extend the concept of the devolution powers. The Bill merely gives them authority and freedom in areas where they would have the right to expect that. It defines for them the area in which that should be so. I hope that, after that explanation, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="column_495"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 495</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;the promotion or improvement of the economic well-being of Wales&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>we all know that the GDP of Wales is well below the UK national average. A lot certainly needs to be done about that. Then:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;the promotion or improvement of the social well-being of Wales&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>we know of many instances and communities where the social well-being is certainly not what it might be and needs to be improved. Finally, as regards the environment or its improvement, we know that the environment of Wales is very precious indeed.
</p>

<a name="60503-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>The clause requires that &quot;anything&quot; must be done that is, according to the wording of Clause 60(1),


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;appropriate to achieve any one or more&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>of various objectives. So, after a long discussion, we felt that this particular part of the Bill was appropriate for the needs of Wales.

<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="60503-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, for welcoming the amendment. It is good to be working with him, albeit on some modest amendments at the present time. I am grateful to the Minister for his &quot;modest&quot; contribution. I could say that he has so little to be modest about, but I would not dream of doing so.
</p>

<a name="60503-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>People considering these debates will be totally confused. The amendment would insert the provision that Welsh Ministers may do anything &quot;within their powers&quot; that they consider appropriate. I am not quite sure that the Minister has addressed the effect of the amendment. As I understand it, there are powers that would cover the areas that he is talking about. The Welsh National Opera is very close to my heart, as he will know&#151;15 years ago we were able to take steps to ensure that the Welsh National Opera went from strength to strength; it is a touring company and is often to be heard in our major cities and in London. The powers are there already. If we are to allow the existing powers to continue, that would be good enough.
</p>

<a name="60503-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>I would like time to consider what the Minister has said. I agree strongly with the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, that we are concerned to ensure the promotion or improvement of the economic, social and environmental well-being of Wales. We all share the concern that the GDP has slipped back a little. That is causing great concern for those who want to see Wales going from strength to strength. Obviously I will reflect carefully on all that the Minister has said. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>

<a name="60503-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>The noble Lord said: I say at the outset that I have a presence here which needs to be explained in that after nearly 28 years in another place, representing an English constituency, very few people tend to remember&#151;although I am sure that most Members of the Committee are aware of what I am about to say&#151;that I come from Wales, I am proud to say. I come from Cardiff and, indeed, Wales is very much the land of my fathers and of my grandfathers. Over the years I have retained many contacts in Wales, most particularly in the arts sector, which is why I have tabled this amendment.
</p>

<a name="60503-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>I have a considerable concern&#151;which I hope is shared by Members of the Committee&#151;that we get devolution right. I say that having been very much in favour of devolution. Indeed, I was publicly in favour of it when I was still a Conservative and devolution was not a policy of that party. There is a very real danger here. Some Members of the Committee may consider that the sequence which I shall outline in a moment is an example of that. After a long period of English dominance over Welsh institutions, there is a danger of overdoing it and of clutching unto oneself all the power that one can&#151;a sort of devolutionary aspect of the &quot;We are the masters now&quot; syndrome.
</p>

<a name="60503-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>I also have a very real concern about the merits of the issue. I make it clear at the outset that we are after the best and most effective governance of the arts in Wales and the maintenance of the arm&#039;s-length principle which has been with us since 1945, and was introduced by Jennie Lee herself. There is absolutely no argument about the desirability of increasing attendance and participation of disadvantaged groups in the arts within Arts Council of Wales circles or, indeed, anywhere else. Indeed, the excellent record of the Arts Council of Wales in that regard should be referred to. I mention in particular the charity, Youth Music, a creation of the Arts Council of England, but which, to my knowledge, has done excellent work in Wales. It was introduced under the present Government very much with those objectives in mind but is administered mainly by itself under the guidance of the Arts Council and the supervisory role of central government.
</p>

<a name="60503-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>These issues, and the background to them, need to be put firmly on the record as the Bill goes through this House and the Government should have the opportunity to comment on and to justify their stance. I have tabled the amendment in no party political spirit. I want my noble friends and Members on all sides of the Committee to realise that. We are dealing here with the governance of the arts. We are effectively granting powers to one part of the United Kingdom&#151;namely, Wales&#151;that are not so exercised in England. I say by way of illustration that I would be horrified if, for example, the National Theatre, of which I am a fairly frequent patron, was to come under the direct control of any government department, however benevolent that control seemed to be when it was introduced. I believe that Jennie Lee would agree with me, were she here today.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_497"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 497</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60503-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>I now come to the background to these matters, which it is very important to set out. Section 28 of the Government of Wales Act 1998 gave the Assembly the power to change or abolish a range of public bodies in Wales. These were listed in Schedule 4 to the 1998 Act, which introduced devolution to Wales. The schedule divided the public bodies into four categories&#151;Parts I to IV. The Arts Council of Wales, the Sports Council for Wales, the National Museum of Wales, the National Library of Wales and the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales are listed under Part IV. Bodies created&#151;this is an important point&#151;by Royal Charter or warrant were all included in Part IV. Under Section 28 of the 1998 Act, the Assembly was debarred from removing any function from a body listed in Part IV unless it was done with the consent of that body. It could not even add a function without that body&#039;s consent. The clear motive was to protect the status quo as far as those bodies were concerned. It was, in effect, the statutory embodiment of the arm&#039;s-length principle.
</p>

<a name="60503-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>That was confirmed with a number of references leading up to the 1998 Act, which should be referred to. Before the present Government came to power in 1997, a Welsh Labour Party document&#151;a good document&#151;was published in 1996. The document, Preparing a New Wales, said:</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_3"></a><br>
&quot;Bodies established by Royal Charter or by warrant, under the Royal Prerogative such as the National Museum of Wales, the Arts Council of Wales and the Royal Commission for Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales will continue to be responsible for their existing activities.

<br>
The Assembly will take over the role and responsibilities of the Secretary of State&quot;&#151;</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_119"></a>in other words, of central Government&#151;</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_4"></a><br>
&quot;with regard to these bodies, and will ensure openness and public accountability in their activities&quot;.<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>All is well and good with that, I am sure most of your Lordships will agree. There then comes, after the accession into power of the Labour Government, a government White Paper in 1997, leading up to the 1997 referendum. It was called <i>A Voice for Wales</i>. It made quite clear that:
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_5"></a><br>
&quot;The Assembly&#039;s powers to restructure bodies will not apply to those which, firstly, operate at arm&#039;s length from Government, specially to guarantee the independence of their decisions; and secondly, were created by Royal Charter or Warrant (such as the National Library of Wales). Such bodies are governed by their Charters or Warrants, and these can only be amended by Her Majesty&#039;s agreement&quot;.<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>Finally, we come to the debate on the Government of Wales Bill in 1998, in Parliament. During the passage of the Bill in another place, Peter Hain, now Secretary of State for Wales, and for whom I have the highest personal regard, then Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Welsh Office, said:
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_6"></a><br>
&quot;Under Clause 29&quot;&#151;<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>which became the Section 28 that I have already mentioned&#151;
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_7"></a><br>
&quot;we have made it clear that royal charter bodies can only gain functions; they cannot be taken away&quot;.&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 25/2/98; col. 466.]<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_498"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 498</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>Mr Hain had earlier said:
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_8"></a><br>
&quot;The assembly has the ability to leave only 16 quangos in existence, if it so chooses. That amounts to a bonfire of the quangos, which we lit with the Bill, and we have complied with our commitments in the White Paper&quot;.<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>This so-called &quot;bonfire of the quangos&quot; is an important part of the background to this, because the Under-Secretary, Mr Hain, then goes on:
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060503/text/60503-14.htm"/>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_9"></a><br>
&quot;Why did we not abolish all the bodies? That brings me directly to the Arts Council of Wales and the Sports Council for Wales. They together with the other three bodies&#151;the National Library of Wales, the National Museum of Wales and the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales&#151;are all bodies created by charter or royal warrant.

<br>
Unless the Conservative Opposition have suddenly become a republican Opposition, surely they would agree with me that it is for Her Majesty to agree changes to those bodies. It is not appropriate to amend them by means of a Bill&quot;.&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 25/2/98; col. 462.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>We then come to the actions of the Welsh Assembly. I will deal with this as succinctly as I can&#151;it is the recent history of this matter. As part of the Assembly Government&#039;s review of Assembly-sponsored public bodies in 2004, only two years ago, they decided to circumvent that protection of the status quo in the case of the Arts Council of Wales, by seeking to use Section 32 of the 1998 Act&#151;to circumvent therefore the Section 28 that I have mentioned by use of Section 32 of the 1998 Act&#151;which is the equivalent of the Clause 61 that I seek to amend. Section 32 of the 1998 Act gave the Assembly a general power to do anything appropriate to support the arts. They intended to use this section to allow them to transfer responsibility for six large arts organisations, from the Arts Council of Wales to the Assembly Government&#039;s culture department, thus making them direct clients of government. That was, of course, the direct subject of a defeat in the Welsh Assembly, which I will refer to in a moment. That was the intention; it has now been, for the moment at least, thwarted by that defeat.
<a name="time_13"></a>

</p>

<a name="60503-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>The companies were&#151;for the record I have to mention them, but they are all the largest clients of the Arts Council of Wales&#151;the Welsh National Opera; the BBC National Orchestra of Wales; the Clwyd Theatr Cymru; the Welsh Language National Theatre Company; the Diversions dance company; and the Academi, which is a literature promotion agency for Wales and a representative organisation for Welsh writers in both languages. Their combined annual grants were at the time equivalent to no less than 43 per cent of the total Arts Council of Wales grant in aid. If that is not a form of emasculation, I do not quite know what is.
</p>

<a name="60503-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>The Assembly Government also sought to transfer&#151;I say &quot;sought to&quot; because for the moment it has not been able to take effect&#151;or the actual words were to &quot;bring together&quot;, the strategic planning functions of the council to the department responsible for culture. In relation to the Arts Council, the Assembly Government challenged the arm&#039;s-length principle that has governed the relationship between government and the arts since the creation of the Arts <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_499"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 499</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Council of Great Britain in 1945. There had been&#151;and this is not unimportant&#151;no prior consultation on these important proposals. The Arts Council of Wales opposed the change, but proposed a compromise solution that the Minister for Culture, Welsh Language and Sport rejected. It became a matter of public debate&#151;which I remember going on at the time as I was following it quite closely&#151;in which the arts sector gave overwhelming support to the Arts Council&#039;s position.
</p>

<a name="60503-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>The matter was pressed eventually to a vote in the Assembly in the plenary session on 1 February 2006, and the opposition parties combined to defeat the Assembly Government by one vote. The resolution that was carried instructed the Assembly Government to halt all preparations to transfer responsibility for the six large arts operations until a public review and consultation with all stakeholders was carried out and a further Motion brought to the Assembly in December 2006. We are well ahead of that for the moment. That committee is now in active session. The terms of reference for the review were agreed, and they were extensive. It is being conducted by a panel of six people under the chairmanship of Elan Closs Stephens, the former chairman of S4C. They are all very distinguished people in their own right. It is fair to say that this clause is running ahead of any conclusion that that committee might reach. That is an important point.
</p>

<a name="60503-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>I have already mentioned a couple of relevant issues of concern. First, under the current Act an Assembly Member would not be able to abolish the Arts Council of Wales without persuading the Secretary of State for Wales&#151;in other words a Cabinet Minister in central government&#151;to petition the Privy Council to that effect. Under the new Bill, Welsh Ministers are themselves Ministers of the Crown and would be able to petition the Privy Council directly for changes to or abolition of the Arts Council, or the National Museum of Wales, or any of the other bodies. The protection given by the arm&#039;s-length principle is therefore considerably less than the 1998 Act. It goes around the safety valve of the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="60503-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>The second item of immediate concern is Clause 61, which seeks to replicate the effect of Section 32 of the 1998 Act, which I have already mentioned, by giving Welsh Ministers the general power to,
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_10"></a><br>
&quot;do anything which they consider appropriate to support&quot;,<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>arts, crafts, cultural activities, projects and so on. Given the uncertainty about the use to which Section 32 of the 1998 Act was put, there is a strong case for clarifying the issue in the Bill. Speaking now with a legal hat on, there could be a considerable legal argument here as to whether the action of using Section 32 against Section 28 was legitimate and not perhaps <i>ultra vires</i>, but that has never been heard legally. The sweeping powers that we are giving in Clause 61 in advance of the proceedings of the committee that I have mentioned need to be justified by central government. It is for your Lordships&#039; House, the other place and central Government in taking through this Bill to act in the necessary <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_500"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 500</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

supervisory way that is merited in this case. I want to re-emphasise that there is an active committee set up to consider this matter because of an Assembly defeat.

</p>

<a name="60503-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>My amendment limits what I have described as fairly sweeping powers to support the arts. I hope it clarifies the matter, but such a clarification is not intended to subvert the primary intention of this Bill, which grants the Assembly and its Government a much wider degree of competence. That is all well and good. It introduces a check and balance to ensure that if or when changes are made to these Royal Charter bodies, they will be made by reference to the Privy Council, after full consideration and debate by all parties in Wales, and not by administrative action alone, which is what Clause 61 amounts to.
</p>

<a name="60503-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>I now want to sum up the position. I believe that this whole process has been unsatisfactory. There has been no proper consultation with the Arts Council; there has been no proper consultation with anybody else. The former chairman of the Arts Council, who was obliged to leave office on 31 March 2006, was&#151;shall we say&#151;at least constructively, or summarily, dismissed on 23 December 2005. He was a person of very high status and renown in the Welsh arts, and indeed generally. The Arts Council of Wales was united in his defence and against these proposals. There had effectively been no consultation about them. There was also widespread public feeling against the Assembly Government over this, which has done my own party&#039;s government considerable harm. It went well beyond the Welsh arts world, leading to the defeat in the Assembly on 1 February 2006.
</p>

<a name="60503-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>There is a basic unsuitability in these six bodies being brought into the Government&#039;s culture department. There has been talk in Wales of parallels with the Soviet Union and eastern Europe before the Berlin Wall came down. That is a gross exaggeration and I want to make it clear that in moving this amendment I do not doubt the good intentions of the Assembly Government. It is not their integrity that is at stake here, but the good governance of the arts in the longer term. There are many people here who know Wales as well as&#151;or better than&#151;me, including a number who have helped to administer it. Wales is a small place. It is certainly a place where, in its establishment, and indeed generally, everyone knows everyone. In such a small place, a scenario where too much power is put in one place will inevitably lead to a sense of obligation and a general unwillingness to displease that source of power. The effect of that is possibly, or even probably, insidious.
</p>

<a name="60503-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>I shall give a couple of examples. Theatres should not be direct clients of government; nor should the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. There is an obvious clash of interest here. The BBC, and not just in Wales, is frequently out of sync with the government of the day. By putting a very important instrument of BBC Wales under the control of the government of Wales, there is a conflict. It should not be a direct client of that government. Finally, Academi gives grants to and represents writers; it should not be a direct client of government.

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>This is an important amendment. It raises important principles of democratic government and of devolution. Central government and this House have a responsibility to consider it very carefully. In that context, I look forward to my noble friend&#039;s reply.

<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="60503-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   The noble Lord has rendered the Committee and the people of Wales a very considerable service by tabling this amendment and by setting out the arguments so fully. Previously in Committee, I touched much more briefly on the issue. I referred then to the way in which Mr Geraint Talfan Davies had been treated. Apparently, he was dismissed largely because he represented the views of the council of which he was chairman in opposing the decision taken by Mr Pugh, the Minister with responsibility for these matters within the Assembly. I understand he was also criticised for the fact that the Minister did not consider that the Arts Council had been doing enough to ensure the attendance and participation of all sections of the population, a matter referred to by the noble Lord. The evidence on which that charge was based was a survey carried out by the Arts Council of Wales, expressly at the instigation of Mr Geraint Talfan Davies, its chairman. So it was a particularly strange argument to advance for getting rid of him.
</p>

<a name="60503-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>Incidentally, Mr Geraint Talfan Davies, when chairman of Welsh National Opera, played a leading role in extending, by a very considerable extent, the activities of Welsh National Opera in exactly that field, in schools and local communities, for which it is now very well known.
</p>

<a name="60503-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>I suppose I should declare an interest in that for half a century or so my father served on the Court Council and Arts Committee at the National Museum and my brother was president of the National Museums and Galleries at the time of his death. My wife also served for many years on the Arts Council of Wales and in another capacity was responsible for introducing into Wales that admirable charity, founded by Lord Menuhin as he became&#151;Yehudi Menuhin&#151;Live Music Now, which has probably done more to take music to places and to people who would not otherwise hear it in Wales than any other organisation.
</p>

<a name="60503-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>I speak with particular feeling about these issues. I can speak too as having been known, as Secretary of State, for the enthusiasm with which I funded the arts and having launched the great new building in the heart of the National Museum of Wales, which now houses the Davies Bequest. That work was carried on by my noble friend Lord Walker, whom I am glad to see in his place, and by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, who played a leading role in extending arts activities into the valleys as part of the valleys initiative.
</p>

<a name="60503-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>With that background of taking a keen interest in the arts and arts matters, I support every single word uttered by the noble Lord. I looked at this clause with considerable concern when I saw this apparently very extensive power that could be applied, not only, incidentally, to the public bodies to which he referred, but also to other bodies, such as the National Trust, on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_502"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 502</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which one would like a little elaboration. After all, the National Trust has responsibility for buildings and places of historical or architectural interest in Wales and there are other obvious organisations that might be affected by these powers.
</p>

<a name="60503-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>I am firmly of the view that the arm&#039;s-length principle is an important one. To bring together the funding of these six bodies in this way, so that such a large part of the finance going to arts organisations in Wales comes from a single source&#151;a single Minister&#151;has dangers. The noble Lord spoke of them in very cautious and reasonable terms. I shall certainly not suggest for one moment that the example of Soviet Russia will be followed. He was quite right to dismiss that allegation. However, there are real threats. If all the arts organisations, covering theatre, writing and every form of the performing arts, are funded from a single source, people will feel under obligations. They may feel that they have to listen to suggestions put to them, however discreetly, about the way in which they operate and the kind of performances that they put on or should not put on. It is no defence to say, &quot;Ah well, it will all come under the general supervision of the Assembly&quot; if the Minister is perhaps answerable to a party with a substantial majority in the Assembly. If only to get rid of any suggestion that undue influence is being exerted in this way, one should have the arm&#039;s-length principle as a protection.
</p>

<a name="60503-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Temple-Morris, told the Committee, Mr Pugh and the Welsh Assembly Government sought to circumvent the limitations of Section 28 by looking to Section 32 of the 1998 Act. Those are exactly the powers that we are now considering. So surely it is right that, if protection should be specifically written into the legislation to ensure that charter bodies are not taken over in this way, there should be no doubts allowed in another clause that might be used to overrule it.
</p>

<a name="60503-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>We must recognise that we are dealing with bodies with a well deserved reputation. For many years, organisations such as the National Library of Wales and the National Museums and Galleries of Wales have built up their reputation because they have been governed by people with a huge range of scholarly expertise and management skills. They hold a high reputation today because of that. Of course, Welsh National Opera has an international reputation in its field. We are dealing with bodies that cannot be under threat&#151;if that is the right word&#151;from interference by Ministers because they fail to perform. Many of them have performed outstandingly well.

<a name="60503-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>I therefore hope that the Minister will either accept the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Temple-Morris, which would be the best way out, or at least give us assurances satisfying us that the powers in this clause could not be misapplied in the way described by the noble Lord, and which were attempted under the previous Act. I hope that the Minister will take his noble friend&#039;s amendment extremely seriously. That is what it deserves.

I also support what the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, who has done a tremendous amount of work for opera in Wales, has said. We have all benefited from the previous status of the Arts Council of Wales, which has performed remarkably well. It went through a rough patch about five years ago but, other than that, it has done a very good job indeed.
</p>

<a name="60503-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>I am not a lawyer, but I tend to agree with the interpretation of the noble Lord, Lord Temple-Morris, that, in a legal sense, the Arts Council does not have quite the same status as what would be called a quango. Indeed, when a previous Secretary of State, Ron Davies, said that he was going to have a &quot;bonfire of the quangos&quot;, I do not think he was referring to the Arts Council or the Sports Council, because they have a different status.
</p>

<a name="60503-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>All that needs to be said has been said. I do not want to delay the Committee too long with these matters, but there is undoubtedly a case for such bodies, which stem from a Royal Charter and which are at arm&#039;s length, retaining their status because they should not be the subject of huge political controversy. They should continue to produce excellence for Wales. As we have heard today, they do a very good job.

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Temple-Morris, was correct to refer to Sections 28 and 32 of the Government of Wales Act 1998. It seems extraordinary that Section 28 debarred the Assembly from removing any function from a body listed in Part 4 unless it was with the consent of that body, yet Section 32 has been used to cause the present, enormous hiatus in the construction of the arts in Wales.

<a name="60503-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>I am pleased that Elan Closs Stephens and her committee are to look at the overall situation.

I hope that the same wisdom will apply in the Assembly, but we are on dangerous ground here&#151;I speak as an ardent devolutionist&#151;because this is a matter for the Assembly. None the less, the Government of Wales Act 1998 took account of these bodies which were formed under Royal Charter. I give way to the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands.
</p>

<a name="60503-15_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   I shall be very brief. I think that I speak for all sides of the Committee when <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_504"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 504</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I thank the noble Lord, Lord Temple-Morris, for his extensive, but necessary, introduction to the amendment. He rightly drew attention to the bonfire of the quangos that was lit by Assembly Government in Wales. Various bodies were tied to the stake, as it were, including the Welsh Arts Council. We also heard on the first day of this Committee about the impending fate of the Welsh Language Board, which is another quango threatened with burning.
</p>

<a name="60503-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>The impression has been given that the decision was taken without full consideration of the feasibility or the consequences. It was automatically assumed that getting rid of the quangos was a good thing and could be only beneficial. Gradually, people have come to realise that the quangos served a useful purpose and had many high achievements to their credit.
</p>

<a name="60503-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>In the <i>Times</i> of June 15 last year, Magnus Linklater described the situation in Wales as he understood it. He wrote then&#151;I stress that it was June of last year:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;In Wales, where the Assembly has moved to take over arts funding, there is a dawning realisation that the much maligned Arts Council may, after all, be the best body to take these tricky decisions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>He was referring to the allocation of funds to different organisations. He went on to write:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;I know of no European country that does not have some form of semi-independent organisation to manage its arts policy&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>So it seems on the face of it that the Assembly Government have committed an error of judgment and would be well advised to revise their thinking.

<a name="60503-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Richard: </b>   What the noble Lord said is important. He said that the Assembly seems to have made an error of judgment. That may or may not be right, but the question is whether this House should prevent the Assembly exercising that judgment. That is the real point of this debate: not whether it got it right or wrong, but whether the Bill should prevent it going through that exercise. But I interrupted; I had better not make a speech.

<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="60503-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   The other side of the question that the noble Lord raised is whether this House should aid and abet the Assembly, as it is alleged to do through this clause. We have considerable cause for concern.
</p>

<a name="60503-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>I shall end the quotation from Mr Linklater. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a>&quot;If every one of these bodies were to be abolished, their functions would have to be subsumed into the great maw of government bureaucracy, staffed by civil servants, controlled by ever-expanding hierarchies of senior officials. Far from contracting, they would expand, for that is what civil servants are good at. Costs would certainly escalate, since at present most quangos are run by councils of enthusiastic experts whose contribution is voluntary. The energy with which they approach their task would be drowned in a welter of benchmarks and performance targets&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>There is at least an element of truth in what Mr Linklater said. It is a truth that is becoming more obvious to members of the public in Wales who are <br>&nbsp;<br>

Many of the interesting arguments that I have heard this afternoon are arguments that I have had in many discussions about government funding of the arts, the arm&#039;s-length principle and what duties and responsibilities government has in relation to organisations it funds.
</p>

<a name="60503-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>I am not going to give a great deal of comfort to my noble friend Lord Temple-Morris and other noble Lords who agree with him, because I agree with my noble friend Lord Richard that this is a matter for the Assembly. If, as the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, suggested, it has made an error of judgment, so be it. The great advantage of this debate is that there is a lot of material on record that Assembly Members will be able to reflect on.

I do not think that Section 28 of the previous Act is repeated. If not, why not? Why the change of policy? If that is so, this is not just a reinforcement of the argument about the &quot;any powers&quot; clause, but we are engaged in a major change of government policy that has not been identified and about which we have had no explanation. However, I may be entirely wrong and the Minister may be able to show me the relevant clause and the protection that has been repeated.

<a name="60503-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>The amendment seeks to restrict the ability of Welsh Ministers to support any cultural or other activity referred to in Clause 61, cutting right across the functions and activities of all relevant charter or warrant bodies in Wales. To give effect to such an intention would impede the proper business of the Welsh Assembly Government and make it impossible for Welsh Ministers to provide, for example, financial support for major events or for institutions such as the Wales Millennium Centre. That would not be an acceptable proposition.

In that case it is still, presumably, in force, in which case all the stuff he said about not interfering with the Welsh Assembly&#039;s freedom presumably does not apply because the restriction is still there in law. Why is he making a speech therefore saying that the Assembly should have full powers on this issue, while maintaining on the statute book a section that specifically prevents it having them? I am delighted that there is a section still on the statute book, but he appears to be making a speech that is not related to that fact.

<a name="60503-17_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Temple-Morris: </b>   It falls to me to say a few words in conclusion about this amendment before I seek leave to withdraw it. I say that for the comfort of my noble friend Lord Richard and my other noble friends. I have to confess that, after listening attentively to my noble friend&#039;s reply, I am more concerned about this matter at the end of the debate than I was at the beginning. I thought I gave out quite a bit of concern in the course of my few words.
</p>

<a name="60503-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>I am very grateful for the support given to the amendment by both Front Benches from the noble Lords, Lord Livsey and Lord Roberts, and also from a former Secretary of State, the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, who&#151;I know we agree on the subject&#151;spoke a lot of sense.
</p>

<a name="60503-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>Why am I more concerned now than I was then? I believe that the Minister&#039;s reply flies in the face of any constitutional principle involved in the matter. I specifically and deliberately moved the amendment on the basis that this Parliament, and your Lordships&#039; House, had a responsibility for this devolutionary measure. I then set out the background to it, which creates certainly political difficulties and potentially legal difficulties in the clash between Sections 28 and 32 of the 1998 Act. There we clearly have a supervisory role.
</p>

<a name="60503-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>The Minister&#039;s reply gives no indication whatever that there is any concern, other than everyone reading matters with interest&#151;I am fascinated to know that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_508"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 508</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

everyone is going to read my speech with interest&#151;about any supervision being imposed. Indeed, a central government responsibility will be abdicated on the grounds that we cannot interfere with it because we are dealing with devolution. That is shielding behind devolution in an Act granting further devolution. What is the point of the Act? What can one ever object to in a devolutionary measure which is introducing further devolution if, because we have already introduced a certain amount of devolution, we cannot then interfere with what the Assembly wants, yet we are busy giving it far more power?
</p>

<a name="60503-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>I am fascinated by the fact that Section 28 has apparently not been repealed. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell; it is absolutely fascinating that it does not reappear in the Bill. One wonders why, if Section 28 does not appear in the Bill, it is necessary to put in Clause 61 as a repeat of Section 32. It would not take a genius to realise that Clause 61&#151;I shall have to check this&#151;introduces yet more powers. Involving more bodies has a purpose in the Bill that is directly contrary to the direction in which we need to go.
</p>

<a name="60503-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>It gives me no pleasure to speak like this, but I think it is necessary because we have a certain responsibility in this Chamber, which I hope this debate has helped to exercise. I do not seek the opinion of the Committee on something that I tabled from the government Benches. At the same time, I hope that what I and other noble Lords have said is useful, and that there will be an opportunity later in our consideration of the Bill for my somewhat tormented mind to be put a little more to rest as a result of what has been said from the Front Bench.

It depends on what part of Wales you are in, but some of the cross-border bodies are pretty important in this respect. The ones about which I am very well briefed are the flood defence committees, which tend to cross the border, following the river systems. The one on the Wye, for example, is a conglomerate of representatives in both Wales and England and ensures that the management of the Wye is good and that there is no excessive flooding.

Other clauses in Part 2 describe their powers to perform all kinds of functions, including the initiation of secondary legislation. The Assembly&#039;s role is largely confined to approval or disapproval. That is something of a change from the past and from previous legislation. Clearly, the Liberal Democrats would like the Assembly to have the independent right, if it commands the support of most Assembly members, to have a poll on a subject of its own choice, not on one chosen by Ministers, and to have full control. I am not clear; is that at all permissible under the Bill?

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>Incidental to our earlier debate about the use of the word &quot;Senedd&quot;, which appears in the amendment, I notice that the official programme for the opening of the new building, which some of us attended on St David&#039;s Day, actually refers to the Senedd of the National Assembly for Wales. It does not describe the Assembly itself as the Senedd, so the Senedd is an undefined part or aspect of the Assembly, according to the programme of that great event&#151;the opening of the new building.

compete with the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, and his interpretation of the Welsh definition of the opening on that day. I thought that what was being opened was the building, and that that was what was referred to, but if the noble Lord says that the Welsh means that an institution, rather than a building, was being opened, I shall simply defer to his expertise and not go down that track.
</p>

<a name="60503-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>In any case, the amendment has nothing to do with the opening of the Senedd of Wales; it is about opinion polls and who can conduct them. It is a fairly minor amendment, and the noble Lord, Lord Livsey of Talgarth, moved it in fairly modest terms. But surely it is based on a misconception. He said that it was a change from the past. So it jolly well is. Of course it is, because the Bill changes a great deal. One of the Bill&#039;s main themes is separating the executive from the legislature. That is one of its prime concepts.
</p>

<a name="60503-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>I ask noble Lords to think for no more than 10 seconds about whether the power to organise an opinion poll on the exercise of Welsh Ministers&#039; powers is an executive function or a legislative one. I do not think that noble Lords would say within 10 seconds that that is clearly an executive function. That is why it appears here as an executive function. I am not going to tackle the noble Lord, Lord Livsey of Talgarth, on the fact that the amendment would scarcely wreck the Bill; I merely suggest to him that we considered the separation of powers and concluded that this one clearly falls within the framework of the executive. That is why the Bill reads as it does.

<p><a name="st_136"></a>
<a name="60503-18_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I thank those Members who have contributed to this short debate. The amendment is phrased in relation to earlier amendments&#151;I think that they were the first amendments debated&#151;about the Senedd. We had a long debate then, which I have no wish to repeat. I tend to agree with my noble friend Lord Thomas. Certainly, I thought that it referred to the building, but I also heard what the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, said; namely, that it was referred to on that occasion as a sister Parliament. Perhaps we should say that there is not clarity in some respects. I know that this was hyped up in the press before the opening of the building and that &quot;discussions&quot; took place about this issue. I will go no further than that.
</p>

<a name="60503-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a> The amendment is correct about opinion polls. We want the Assembly to have its say. We certainly support the separation of powers to which the Minister has referred&#151;the executive from the legislature. The Minister has put it into context: he believes this to be an executive function. Many of us will remember the polls on whether pubs should open on Sundays in Wales. I will not go into that, but one would expect the Assembly to have had a view on such things. However, without more ado, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="60503-18_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Anderson of Swansea </b>   moved Amendment No. 49:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>Page 40, line 39, at end insert &quot;for approval&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The noble Lord said: In speaking to Amendment No. 49, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 50. These amendments were originally solely in the name of my noble friend Lord Davies of Coity, who much regrets that he is unable to be with us today. At Second Reading, he gave notice that he would table amendments concerning the Voluntary Sector Partnership Council. He also showed his personal commitment to the voluntary sector in Wales and gave the relevant background, which I adopt: in short, the vital role played by voluntary organisations in our national life and its ability, rather like a well known brand of beer, to touch parts which other parts of the public sector are unable to do. He also mentioned the role of the Wales Council for Voluntary Action (WCVA).
</p>

<a name="60503-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>Amendment No. 49 simply adds the words &quot;for approval&quot; to Clause 74. It strengthens the role of the Assembly in the endorsement or otherwise of the annual report on how the voluntary sector scheme has been implemented. Amendment No. 50 should be considered in the context of earlier clauses. The relevant section of the Explanatory Notes is headed, &quot;<i>Inclusive&quot; approach to exercise of functions</i>. Clause 72, which follows, requires Welsh Ministers to establish a partnership council for Wales with members of local authorities and other public sector groups, such as the police, the fire service and so on. Clause 72 includes the partnership council of Wales in the Bill. In my judgment, what is important for the public sector is also to be considered for the voluntary sector, given its importance in our national life.
</p>

<a name="60503-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>Clause 74 sets out the obligation on Welsh Ministers to make a scheme for the voluntary sector. <i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, this mirrors the obligation on the Assembly set out in Section 114 of the Government of Wales Act 1998. The resultant scheme provided <i>inter alia</i> for the establishment of a Voluntary Sector Partnership Council as the principal bridge, means or instrument for dealings between the Assembly and the voluntary sector. The partnership council has therefore provided an opportunity for consensus to be reached on major issues of policy and detail affecting the voluntary <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_512"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 512</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

sector and its relations with the Assembly. Because of the involvement of all four parties in the Assembly, it has also helped to promote the voluntary sector among various local groups in Wales. Most valuable has been the tripartite membership&#151;the voluntary sector, Ministers and Assembly Members&#151;who have learnt by practice to work together in a spirit of co-operation.
</p>

<a name="60503-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>That spirit of co-operation has led to a number of successes, including the establishment of the Criminal Records Unit in 2003. This unique body, which is run by the WCVA and is funded by the Welsh Assembly Government, provides the voluntary sector with access to the Criminal Records Bureau. It has also led to the strengthening of links with United Kingdom voluntary organisations operating in Wales. Following the withdrawal, which we all recall, I am sure, with regret, of the Children&#039;s Society from Wales in 2003, the partnership council took the lead in organising a seminar from which emerged the code of principles.
</p>

<a name="60503-18_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>Thus, the amendment seeks to maintain the partnership council by adding this to the Bill and by providing an assurance about its future. In my judgment, a precedent has been set by Clause 72, entitled, Partnership Council. It recognises the success of the voluntary sector in Wales under the partnership council and seeks from the Government a positive signal that they value the work of the voluntary sector.
</p>

<a name="60503-18_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>I have now seen a letter, dated 25 April, from the relevant Cabinet Minister, Jane Hutt, the Minister for Assembly Business, Equalities and Children, to Win Griffiths of the WCVA, which I concede throws a new light on the amendment. For the benefit of those Members of the Committee who have not seen the letter, perhaps it would be helpful if I quoted the relevant paragraphs. Following a meeting between Jane Hutt and representatives of the four parties in the Assembly who agreed on certain points, she wrote:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a>&quot;The first point is that all four parties can affirm their commitment to a productive relationship with the voluntary sector, both from the point of view of the Welsh Ministers and from the point of view of the Assembly. We all four agreed that we wanted this relationship to work and that it was the commitment to making it work which mattered most&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-18_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>The second point is the relevant one in respect of the proposed amendment:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a>&quot;The second is that all four parties would wish to maintain a Voluntary Sector Partnership Council following separation. However there are reservations about setting these arrangements in statute and indeed about committing to maintain the status quo, totally unchanged. If the role of the council is to advise and act as a &#039;critical friend&#039; to Ministers, not all opposition parties may think it appropriate for their Members to sit on a body advising Ministers. There are other models for ensuring cross-party engagement and engagement with the Assembly as a scrutinising body and legislature which we should like to consider further and which we would encourage the sector to think about too&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-18_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>Clearly the views set out in that letter, which was only recently received, should be respected.
</p>

<a name="60503-18_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>Notwithstanding that letter, I would welcome my noble friend&#039;s response. Is there, in his judgment, something to be lost in abandoning the tripartite relationship which has acted with success in the partnership council since 1998? I concede that there is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_513"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 513</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a new dispensation with the separation, but could not something be lost by abandoning that tripartite principle?
</p>

<a name="60503-18_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>What value do the Government attach to the role of the voluntary sector in Wales? I am intrigued by what is said in that letter, pregnant with meaning, about other models that may be pursued. What other models, in my noble friend&#039;s judgment and that of the Assembly, could be relevant to the working out of what is for us in Wales an important relationship: that between the voluntary sector, which carries out such valuable work, and the Welsh Assembly Government, both the executive and the legislature. I beg to move.

I would be grateful if the Minister could respond to it, so that he might shorten proceedings at a later stage. Amendment No. 49 raises whether the Assembly is in a position to give approval to the papers laid before it. The same point applies or could have applied to Clause 73, which we have just passed. It applies to Clauses 75 and 76, although there is a Liberal Democrat amendment on that which raises the parallel point. It also applies to Clause 77. It would be useful if the Minister could comment on this approval question, as it attaches to all the clauses; then we need not raise the issue again clause by clause.

<a name="60503-19_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for having read out the relevant part of the letter from Jane Hutt on the amendment, because in principle I support the thoughts behind the amendment. Indeed, the spirit of co-operation is enormous and the contribution of the voluntary sector is huge. I must declare an interest, working in the hospice sector, but I also sound a little warning that if we are not careful to ensure that there really is a good mechanism for the Assembly and the voluntary sector&#151;I personally would like to see something in the Bill&#151;there is a danger of different parts of the voluntary sector going and doing their own thing. Some parts of the voluntary sector are driven by powerful personalities with enormous energy that can be harnessed for the public good but, unfortunately, when they compete for funds they can have a tendency to compete directly with a similar provider adjacent to them, which can create local friction.
</p>

<a name="60503-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>The Assembly has done an astoundingly good job at harnessing the energy of all the voluntary sector providers. I want to make sure that that is not lost. While the wording of the amendment may not be perfect, I hope that the Minister will agree to consider the principle behind it to ensure that what has been achieved is not lost as the Bill passes.

<a name="60503-19_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I am sure that this is the right moment to congratulate all those involved in the voluntary sector in Wales.

maximum support. I support the amendment and the sentiment behind it, particularly the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, that an overarching co-ordinating strategy that does not cause duplication of effort is needed. The Minister would be advised to consider that point and discuss with the Assembly Members what they are going to do in this situation. Proposed new subsection (2) of Amendment No. 50 refers to:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a>&quot;(a)   the Welsh Ministers,</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<a name="60503-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>I wonder whether there will be a proper party balance in the circumstances. I say no more than that.
</p>

<a name="60503-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>I congratulate the Wales Council for Voluntary Action, which does some very good work, including work with co-operatives. It has some good staff and good co-ordinating skills. In principle, we support the idea but we certainly do not want to be too prescriptive to the Assembly. None the less, a body is needed to co-ordinate matters in Wales and the voluntary sector.

<p><a name="st_142"></a>
<a name="60503-19_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   These are the first words that I will utter on the Bill. They will be extremely brief and modest, but I put it to the noble Lord who moved Amendments Nos. 49 and 50 that the final line of subsection (3) in the proposed new clause would be improved by the addition of a comma after the word &quot;representatives&quot;.

</p>




<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="60503-19_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   I listened carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Coity, said at Second Reading, and I have listened to the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, today on the subject of the new clause. I have also been in touch with the Wales Council for Voluntary Action, which has developed into a significant body over the years and now has some 25,000 voluntary and community organisations on its database. It has made considerable progress. The noble Lord, Lord Davies of Coity, gave more details at Second Reading about the extent of the council&#039;s activities, including its involvement in the National Assembly&#039;s voluntary sector scheme, which was the direct outcome, as the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, said, of the requirement in Section 114 of the Government of Wales Act 1998 that the Assembly shall,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a>&quot;make a scheme setting out how it proposes, in the exercise of its functions, to promote the interests of relevant voluntary organisations&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>As I understand it, the resultant scheme provided for the establishment of a voluntary sector partnership council on similar lines to the body proposed in the new clause. Indeed, it seems that the purpose of the new clause is simply to give a statutory basis for what is in effect already in existence. The voluntary sector, I am told, believes that the Welsh Assembly Government would wish to maintain the current arrangements and that it would be appropriate therefore to include the voluntary sector partnership council and its composition in the Bill.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_515"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 515</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60503-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>As we have heard, the Wales Council for Voluntary Action is a substantial organisation, which employed some 169 staff in the year to March 2005 and received government support towards its core funding of &#163;721,000. It also received Welsh Assembly funding of &#163;14 million and European structural funding of more than &#163;9 million towards specific areas and grant schemes that fell within its scope.
</p>

<a name="60503-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>Presumably, the Wales Council for Voluntary Action can see benefit for itself in the new clause, although&#151;and I suspect that this is what Jane Hutt is getting at&#151;there is an obvious danger that it could be eclipsed in time by the new partnership council. I am sure that it has given this issue its full consideration and perhaps will consider it even further.
</p>

<a name="60503-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>My second point concerns whether it is right that the partnership council should be established by this Parliament in primary legislation or whether it might not be a more appropriate subject for the Assembly to deal with. I can understand a statutory council being necessary when statutory local authorities are involved, but non-statutory voluntary bodies are arguably in a different category. I await the Minister&#039;s response with interest.
</p>




<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="60503-19_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   I begin by associating the Government with the congratulations expressed by the noble Lord Lord, Livsey, to the voluntary sector in Wales on all that it does. I hope that, in answering this amendment, I will give total reassurance to everyone that we value and the Assembly values its close relationship with the voluntary sector.
</p>

<a name="60503-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Anderson and my noble friend Lord Davies of Coity, who tabled the amendment but cannot be with us today, for raising the very important subject of the voluntary sector and giving us the opportunity to discuss it. The partnership between the voluntary sector and the Assembly has been a very positive development and I am sure that all sides of the Committee would wish that productive relationship to continue.
</p>

<a name="60503-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>Amendment No. 49 would have the effect of making the voluntary sector report laid before the Assembly by the Welsh Ministers subject to the approval of the Assembly. With all due respect, I must say that that fails to recognise the consequence of separating the Welsh Assembly Government from the Assembly. The voluntary sector scheme report will set out how the Welsh Ministers&#039; proposals to promote voluntary sector interests were implemented in the previous financial year. It is an executive and administrative document, not a legislative one&#151;that is, something factual and retrospective which the Assembly does not need to approve.
</p>

<a name="60503-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>The current Government of Wales Act 1998 requires the Assembly to make the voluntary sector scheme because the Assembly is currently a single, corporate body. With separation, the functions of making and reporting on the scheme properly become a function of the Welsh Ministers.
</p>

<a name="60503-19_para10"></a>

voluntary sector. It will be able to do so in a way consistent with its role as a legislative and scrutinising body, by holding the Welsh Ministers to account.
</p>

<a name="60503-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>I recognise the spirit in which this amendment was tabled, which was to signal the importance of the Assembly continuing to be involved in monitoring the interests of the voluntary sector. Given the response from other parties in the Assembly, I am sure that this will be the case, without the need for the change proposed by this amendment.

</p>

<a name="60503-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>Amendment No. 50 would put the voluntary sector partnership council on a statutory footing. By doing so, it would seek to preserve what the voluntary sector values about the current arrangements: namely, that they are cross-party and that the voluntary sector itself, through the Wales Council for Voluntary Action, determines the voluntary sector representation. It is understandable that the voluntary sector in Wales should not wish to lose what it has gained through the many years of good practice and experience under the current arrangements. I know that the Welsh Assembly Government have already given a public assurance if re-elected that they would continue with a voluntary sector partnership council. I can also state with some confidence, because discussions have taken place, that the other parties represented in the Assembly would also wish to have a voluntary sector partnership council to advise the Welsh Assembly Government, as part of the voluntary sector scheme.
</p>

<a name="60503-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>I hope that this provides the reassurance which the voluntary sector was seeking through this amendment. As to the amendment itself, I fear that what it proposes could prove to be unwieldy and would not best serve the interests of the voluntary sector itself post-separation. I hope that, in the light of these firm assurances, my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

</p>




<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="60503-20_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth </b>   moved Amendment No. 51:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a>Page 42, line 6, leave out from &quot;must&quot; to end of line and insert &quot;have it approved by the Senedd by a simple majority of those voting before it comes into effect&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 51 refers to Clause 74 which concerns regulatory impact assessments. It is an important matter as, if the regulations and legislation are not working properly, they have to be sorted out and expedited. The ability of the Assembly to attempt to resolve these matters in the interests of the effective governance of Wales is very important indeed. Assembly Members may, in some circumstances, be the victims of inadequate regulations which may have an adverse impact on their constituents. If one looks at the regulatory impact assessments, our amendment would require that a code or revisions under subsection (5) must be approved by a simple vote of the Assembly. We wish to ensure that the Assembly gets its head around this matter and, indeed, agrees with the code. This would clearly be an improvement on what happened previously and which necessitated this Bill. We believe that the Assembly can express an opinion in this respect on regulatory impact assessments.
</p>

<a name="60503-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>Amendment No. 52 refers to sustainability. Under it, the copy of the report would have to be approved by the Senedd by a simple majority of those voting. Sustainable development is a very important function of the Assembly and was enshrined in the 1988 Act. For example, a report could contain many statements or evaluations of projects in Wales which might not in fact be sustainable. I can give your Lordships two examples of this. One is the much talked about Severn barrage. We know of the excellent work done in Swansea University on tidal lagoons. There is clearly an issue as to whether the tidal lagoon idea along the banks of the Severn estuary might be a better and more <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_518"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 518</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

sustainable answer than the Severn barrage, while producing the same amount of power. That is an important issue.
</p>

<a name="60503-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>Another current issue&#151;which is outside the Assembly&#039;s power but, none the less, it could pass an opinion on it&#151;concerns the gas pipelines that are being taken from gas holders in Milford Haven through national parks. That could affect the sustainability of the national parks and would certainly have an impact on the landscape. If the report does not meet sustainable development objectives, the Assembly may wish to reject it. Alternatively, however, if courageous decisions have been made which are contained in the report, it can rightly be endorsed by the Assembly which can express its opinion through a vote. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_147"></a>
<a name="60503-20_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   I quite understand the anxiety behind these amendments which once again show concern that the Assembly should play an active role in approving or disapproving ministerial action in the context of regulatory impact assessments. How else is the Assembly to scrutinise ministerial activity and properly hold Ministers to account? That is the question. While the principle of the Bill is to transfer powers and functions to Ministers, the Assembly must be afforded every opportunity to hold them to account for their subsequent actions. This is clearly going to be a very important part of the new Assembly&#039;s role&#151;a far bigger part than it was in the past under the old regime.
</p>




<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="60503-20_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   Amendment No. 51 would require Assembly approval of the regulatory impact assessment code when published or revised by Welsh Ministers. Similarly, Amendment No. 52 would require the Welsh Ministers to obtain the approval of the Assembly for their report into the effectiveness of Welsh Ministers in promoting sustainable development. However, these amendments, as with the previous group of amendments we have just discussed, fail to recognise the consequences of separating the executive and the legislature&#151;something which has been warmly welcomed by this House.
</p>

<a name="60503-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>A code of practice is an executive document; it is not one which requires Assembly, and therefore legislative, approval. Clause 76 places a requirement on the Welsh Ministers to make a code of practice setting out their policy on regulatory impact assessment with respect to relevant Welsh subordinate legislation. This carries forward, in essence, the requirement in Section 65 of the Government of Wales Act 1998 for subordinate legislation procedures to include provision regarding regulatory impact appraisals. It will ensure that there is a clear statement of how the costs and benefits of complying with subordinate legislation made by the Welsh Ministers will be assessed, including consultation and when such assessments will be made.
</p>

<a name="60503-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>The provisions in Clauses 74 and 75 ensure that the Welsh Ministers will take account of the interests of business and the voluntary sector in addition to the    specific requirement on regulatory impact <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_519"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 519</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

assessments. These are explicit duties&#151;more explicit than is the case with Ministers elsewhere in the UK&#151;and the Assembly will be perfectly capable of holding the Welsh Ministers to account for the way they exercise those duties.
</p>

<a name="60503-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>The report containing an assessment of the effectiveness of the scheme in promoting sustainable development is also an executive and a retrospective document and, as such, does not need Assembly, that is to say legislative, approval. I hope that in the light of this explanation, the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="60503-20_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, for his support of the principles lying behind the amendment. From what the Minister has said, I understand that obviously the separation of powers comes into this. Indeed, he has enlightened us by saying that the code of practice is an executive function and an executive document. I would wish to read carefully what he has said, although it certainly seemed to me to be a clear statement to that effect.
</p>

<a name="60503-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>There is another matter that I wondered about. The Minister also stated that Welsh Ministers would be held to account and would have explicit duties. Some of the subjects, particularly in RIAs and sustainable development, can be extremely controversial and, indeed, great differences of opinion can take place. Given what he said, therefore, I hope that the Assembly will hold Ministers to account and that there will be an effective method for it to do so in a democratic fashion. That being the case, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="60503-21_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Kingsland </b>   moved Amendment No. 54:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a>Page 50, line 23, leave out subsection (1).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>The noble Lord said: I rise to move Amendment No. 54 and to speak on the Questions whether Clauses 92 to 101 and 108 shall stand part of the Bill. I trust that the fact that I seek to remove the whole of Part 3 from the Bill will in no way undermine the genial and harmonious atmosphere in which today&#039;s deliberations have been conducted.
</p>

<a name="60503-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>Essentially, Part 2 of the Bill is a statutory system for devolving power to the Welsh Assembly, on a piecemeal basis, by Orders in Council. It is a two-stage <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_520"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 520</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

process. Stage 1 delegates to the Welsh Assembly by Order in Council the power to legislate on certain matters within certain fields which are stipulated in Schedule 5 to the Bill. Stage 2 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to make what are called &quot;Assembly Measures&quot;, as long as those measures are within the scope of the authority delegated by the process in stage 1.
</p>

<a name="60503-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>In essence, Assembly measures are primary legislation; but they do not obtain that character until they are confirmed by an Order in Council. These Orders in Council have two functions. At stage 1 they have an authorising function and at stage 2 they have what I would term a &quot;camouflaging&quot; function. At stage 1 they authorise the scope for the Welsh Assembly&#039;s legislative power; at stage 2 they camouflage the fact that what the Welsh Assembly is really doing is making primary legislation. Your Lordships should be in no doubt about that.
</p>

<a name="60503-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>In my view, one needs inordinate patience in reading Part 3 to reach the analysis that I have just put before the Committee. One would think that Part 3 would start off with stage 1 and then, having completed it, move on to stage 2. In fact, Part 3 starts with stage 2, wanders into stage 1 and in the end wanders back into stage 2. One might take the view that, when the Minister was settling these provisions, he either intended to obfuscate or had just had a very good lunch; indeed, it might have been a mixture of the two.
</p>

<a name="60503-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>We are opposed to Part 3 for a number of reasons. The first reason is that it is not authorised by a referendum. Like, I suspect, many of your Lordships, I am not an enthusiast for referendums. I believe that our long-standing system of representative government is the best way of taking all decisions in our country. But the fact is that the existing state of the devolved Assembly is the result of a referendum, so it must follow that any change in that existing state&#151;any deepening of devolution&#151;should also be mandated by a referendum. Such a procedure is set down in Part 4 of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60503-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>One might, therefore, well ask why we need Part 3 at all. Why cannot we simply move to Part 4, have a referendum and, if the Welsh people authorise the degree of devolution, so be it? But that is not what will happen. As your Lordships know, this Bill has been extensively debated in another place. On Report, the point about a referendum was put to the Minister, Mr Ainger, in as direct a manner as possible. Mr Ainger&#039;s response was:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a>&quot;The purpose of referendums is to establish people&#039;s view on a change . . . It is pointless to hold a referendum if one knows that one is not going to achieve the change that is its purpose&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 28/2/06; col. 179.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>In other words, in the view of the government Minister, referendums are valid only if they produce the result desired by the Government. I would have thought that the point of a referendum was to find out what people think. However, the conclusion that Mr Ainger and the Government have reached is that, since the referendum will not produce the result that they want, they will not have a referendum.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_521"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 521</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60503-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>Has that deterred them from making any change to the way in which Wales will be governed in the future? Certainly not, because we have Part 3, without a whisper of a referendum to authorise it. That point was also put to Mr Ainger in the debate in another place. Mr Dominic Grieve asked him:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a>&quot;Why does he think that part 3 is desired by the people of Wales?&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>Mr Ainger replied:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a>&quot;Because they voted for a Labour Government and a Labour manifesto&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 28/2/06; col. 180.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>It is true that they voted for a Labour Government and it is true that the Labour Government had a manifesto. But there is not a scintilla of a reference in it to the procedure laid down in Part 3. Indeed, during the time leading up to the manifesto, no Minister or anyone else, as far as I am aware, made any reference whatever to any procedure remotely like the procedure in Part 3. It is true that there was an important debate about Welsh devolution in the months running up to the general election but that was in relation to the commission chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Richard; and the proposals that he made were a long way from what is contained in Part 3. In my submission, the argument&#151;just in case the Government are inclined to include it in their response&#151;that it was in the manifesto is no argument at all.
</p>

<a name="60503-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>The fact that Part 3 is not authorised by a referendum is only one reason why we think that it does not belong in the Bill. There are two others of equal weight. The first is that the act of delegation in stage 1 is to a very large extent unscrutinised by Parliament in Westminster, either in another place or in your Lordships&#039; House. We are talking here about an Order in Council process; we are not talking about a process that concludes in an Act of Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60503-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a> How will that process work? Your Lordships will look in vain at this Bill to find that out. In another place, Mr Ainger did to some degree flesh this matter out. Apparently, what is intended is something approaching the following. The Welsh Assembly will make a proposal for a draft Order in Council to delegate certain legislative powers to the Welsh Assembly within the fields capable of delegation under Schedule 5. That draft order will be laid before the Welsh Assembly; but it is envisaged that before it is laid extensive discussions will take place between the Welsh Assembly Government and Whitehall&#151;I presume that &quot;Whitehall&quot; means the Secretary of State for Wales. Once that draft order has been passed by resolution, it, together with the resolution, will appear both in your Lordships&#039; House and in another place.
</p>

<a name="60503-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>However, the order will not be subject to any form of legislative amendment. It will be subject to something that Mr Ainger called pre-legislative scrutiny; but nowhere in the Bill is the nature of this <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_522"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 522</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

pre-legislative scrutiny defined. The honourable Minister suggested that it might include consideration by the Welsh Affairs Committee and perhaps also by the Welsh Grand Committee. The conclusions of both those institutions would be dispatched to the Welsh Assembly in the hope that it might take them into account when it reached a final conclusion on the draft order. The final draft order, after further discussion with Whitehall, is then tabled as an Order in Council both in another place and in your Lordships&#039; House. In the normal way of affirmative resolutions, we will have the opportunity to say yes or no to a text that we cannot amend. In my submission, this is a degree of scrutiny that falls well below the standard one would expect for such a dramatic constitutional change. That is the second reason why we wish to expunge Part 3 from the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60503-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>The third reason is that if one looks under the skin of what is proposed in Part 3, one sees that what is happening in reality is that delegation&#151;at both stage 1 and to some degree stage 2&#151;is not from this Parliament to the Welsh Assembly, but from this Parliament to the executive, from this Parliament to the Secretary of State for Wales. Throughout the process under stage 1, the Secretary of State for Wales is intimately involved in shaping the draft order. Indeed, it says expressly in the Bill that if in the end he is not satisfied with the draft order he can refuse to table it.
</p>

<a name="60503-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>This is a plain shift of power from the legislature to the executive. Moreover, even when the Welsh Assembly is authorised to produce Assembly measures, at the end of the day, even when that process is completed, it is still the job of the Secretary of State for Wales to table an Order in Council before it becomes the law of the land. It is almost as if this Bill is being used as a pilot for the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, which your Lordships are expecting soon in this House.
</p>

<a name="60503-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>I would like to make one further observation in this context. At stage 2, once the Welsh Assembly has the power, the matter will go through to its conclusion. If the political parties that dominate Welsh government and the political party that dominates the Government of the United Kingdom are of the same hue, one can see them being reasonably co-operative. But what if the Welsh Government in the future are of one political complexion and the United Kingdom Government of another political complexion? How on earth is it envisaged that the process laid down in the Bill could possibly work in any manner that could reasonably be described as harmonious? That said, I wish to emphasise again that the third reason that we are opposed to Part 3 is because of the amount of power that is switched from legislative bodies to executive bodies.

<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="60503-22_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I want to make it absolutely clear that we are not against that solution. We are against it without a referendum making that grant.
</p>




<p><a name="st_153"></a>
<a name="60503-22_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   Yes, I follow what the noble Lord says, but we are dealing with the Bill in front of us. I do not see anything in the amendments so far tabled by the Conservative Party that would indicate that they pursue the same line as us. We start with the basis that there should be full legislative competence for a Welsh parliament save in reserve matters. That is an issue that we will flesh out in later amendments. Once we have arrived at that position, we have to decide what we will do about the Bill before us.
</p>

<a name="60503-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>There is undoubtedly a tortuous procedure to adopt&#151;a word used by the noble Lord, Lord Richard, to describe it was &quot;involved&quot;. We by no means consider that the numerous stages and processes set out in the Bill&#151;namely, the application for the Order in Council, followed by putting through a measure of the Assembly&#151;amount to a satisfactory solution. However, it is a step forward. We have always wished to see devolution as a process and not as an event. We wish to see steps taken that lead towards the goal which I personally have been advocating for something like 42 years. It will take more than this Bill to stop me advocating full powers for a Welsh parliament.
</p>

<a name="60503-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>Accepting many of the criticisms that have been made by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and certainly accepting that this machinery is not at all as clear-cut as it could be, we nevertheless oppose these amendments.

</p>




<p><a name="st_154"></a>
<a name="60503-22_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   I acknowledge that the noble Lord and many of his friends have been pretty consistent on this issue, which is why I find it rather strange that they are content with this extraordinarily complex and unsatisfactory set of arrangements, which has been introduced almost entirely because the Labour Party in the other House is divided and because of the fact, already referred to by my noble friend Lord Kingsland, that Ministers do not believe they could win a referendum.
</p>

<a name="60503-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>My position, which I made clear at Second Reading, is that I would go straight to Part 4 and give the people of Wales those powers, if that is what they want. I acknowledge that my views were rejected by the people of Wales at the last referendum, by a narrow margin. I fully accept that verdict. I made it clear at Second Reading that I do not want to go back. However, if you are substantially going to change the devolutionary step that was approved by the Welsh people on that occasion on the basis of information clearly put before them, you must have a further authority.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_524"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 524</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60503-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>I would not go down the halfway house route. If the Welsh people want to take the devolutionary step and have the same powers as people in Scotland, let them do it, but let us get on with it. Indeed, as regards the suggestion that so far we on the Conservative Benches have done nothing to indicate that we really mean that, I have tabled amendments that would make a referendum easier. I have tried to remove some of the blocking mechanisms that stand in the way. I have said that if a clear majority&#151;rather than a two-thirds majority&#151;of the Assembly want to go down that road, it should not be possible for the Secretary of State to block it. Let us have no aspersions cast on our willingness to go down that road. Indeed, a number of my colleagues in another place made that very clear. Mr Gummer made a passionate speech in which he said that he would like to go down that road and get on with it. There are many other examples of that.
</p>

<a name="60503-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>I refer to the power that we are discussing. Incidentally, one of the most curious arguments advanced by Ministers in another place against a referendum is that the scheme that the Government have devised is so complicated that no one will understand it. Apart from the feeling that it was pretty insulting to the people of Wales to be told that they would find the whole thing much too difficult to understand, the general proposition was included by the Labour Party in its manifesto but in such general terms&#151;I have the wording of the manifestos in front of me&#151;that no one could have expected the Welsh people to understand what was actually proposed. Surely, if the Welsh people are to be told that they have given a matter their approval, they should have clearly put before them an explanation of what it is about.
</p>

<a name="60503-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>I do not want to go over the ground that many of us covered in great detail at Second Reading, but this is not a modest measure. It is a Trojan horse measure that enables very wide powers to be taken step by step so that we can go down the full road to the kind of legislative Assembly that the Liberal Democrats say they want without a referendum at all. We can get there step by step under this arrangement. That is one of the reasons why we object to it. One should have no doubt about the extent to which this measure can widen the powers and scope of the Assembly and its Ministers. The report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee is very helpful in this context. As I do not think that its comments have been quoted before in our debates, I propose to quote some of them now. One of the points the committee emphasises is the breadth of the measure. It explains that the competence of the Assembly is defined by reference to 20 fields set out in Schedule 5. Paragraph 24 of the report points out:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a>&quot;There is no limit to which fields may be added, or which matters within each field. The fields could even be more extensive than the list of subject headings in Schedule 7 (which relates to Part 4 - Assembly Acts)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>At paragraph 26 of the report the committee reasonably states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a>&quot;It is for the House to decide whether it is appropriate for such a degree of competence to be conferred by subordinate legislation. It is the apparent purpose of the bill for Part 3 to be a gradual process and for Part 4 to be a more definitive settlement. We <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_525"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 525</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>consider that an incremental process of increasing the Assembly&#039;s competence need not necessarily be achieved by a series of bills. The idea of areas of competence being varied by subordinate legislation is precedented in the Scotland Act 1998&quot;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>The committee goes on to say,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a>&quot;What is different here is the proposed scale of the use of the power: the Scotland Act 1998 itself defines the devolution settlement and the Order in Council power may be used to modify it; in contrast, it is here proposed that Orders in Council will define the competence of the Assembly&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>In other words, by this piecemeal measure and without the approval of the Welsh people taken in a referendum, we are going down the full legislative route. That is wholly wrong and wholly improper. We should be either honest about the matter and face up to it&#151;we want full legislative powers given to the Assembly&#151;and deal with it by the proper legislative route, or we do not. It seems to me wholly wrong to abandon the opportunity for anyone in this House to carry out the vital process that it does so well of looking at the detail of legislation&#151;the devil is in the detail and cannot be covered by pre-legislative scrutiny&#151;and allow this vast extension of power without proper authority from the people of Wales. I support the amendment.

<a name="60503-22_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Elystan-Morgan: </b>   I suspect that all those who have taken part, and will be taking part, in this debate will run true to form regarding their views on devolution. Mine go back a very long way, perhaps even longer than those of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. I was a very young boy when I decided that, so far as I could understand, the gaining of a home rule parliament for Wales was not only to be desired but a very condition of the continued existence and development of the nationhood of Wales, and I have not changed my mind.
</p>

<a name="60503-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said that the basis of his case was that we are dealing in Part 3 with primary not subordinate legislation. That is the main plank of his platform. However, the Explanatory Notes deal with the matter very differently. I hope that I may have the Committee&#039;s indulgence to quote paragraph 318 of the Explanatory Notes, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a>&quot;This clause [92] confers on the Assembly the power to make a type of subordinate legislation in relation to Wales called &#039;Measures of the National Assembly for Wales&#039; in English, or &#039;Mesurau Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru&#039; in Welsh. They are referred to in this Bill as Assembly Measures&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>Then there follow these words:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a>&quot;The ultimate right of Parliament to legislate in relation to Wales, even in principle on a matter over which legislative competence has been conferred on the Assembly, is preserved&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>There can, therefore, be no doubt at all that we are dealing with subordinate rather than primary legislation. It is casuistic to argue on that point.
</p>

<a name="60503-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>Under the Local Government Act a county council has wide powers enabling it to adopt model clauses of legislation. Does that make it a primary legislature? I doubt it. I do not in any way wish to disturb the placidity of the waters of agreement, consent and goodwill that have existed in relation to this Bill by anything that I say tonight but I am afraid that, so far <br>&nbsp;<br>

as the Conservative Party is concerned, it has been reluctantly dragged into accepting devolution at all and it is essentially a rearguard action. What one has here is the determination of the Conservative Party to put a stop to the whole process of what one might describe in one way as devolution and in another way, so far as the Welsh Assembly is concerned, as evolution.

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>If Part 3 were taken out altogether, the Welsh people would be deprived of a real advantage: what I described at Second Reading as a bridge between the present situation and the situation where the people of Wales can consider whether they would wish to take up the enabling powers that will essentially have created the foundations of a Welsh parliament. The experience over a few&#151;I hope not too many&#151;years would enable the Welsh people to judge in a mature way exactly what these added powers mean and what they lead to. I do not for a moment believe, therefore, that the main case put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&#151;that one has broken over a fundamental boundary&#151;holds any real truth at all.
</p>

<a name="60503-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>We are still dealing with the area of subordinate legislation. The powers of this House and of the other place remain absolute. The capacity to set up any number of appropriate bodies, to deal in detail with every aspect of each of these proposals, is infinite. I do not see, therefore, that it is a case of robbing either House of its essential sovereign authority. The Richard commission concluded that a referendum was entirely necessary for Part 4. Why? That is because Part 4 sets up, essentially, a home rule parliament&#151;nothing less than that. Part 3 is a path towards that. If the Conservative Party were to take the view that every evolutionary advance made by the Welsh people for the Assembly must be the subject of a referendum, that would be nonsense. Since the Assembly was created in 1998, there have been, large and small, hundreds of aggregations to its authority. Does one then hold a referendum and ask, &quot;That is what has happened over seven years. Are you, the Welsh people, content with that or not?&quot;? With very great respect, there is a fundamental inconsistency in the attitude of the Conservative Party. I was a Member of the other place in 1972, as were the noble Lords, Lord Crickhowell and Lord Roberts of Conwy, when the European Communities Act was passed. I do not remember the Conservative Party at that time asking for a referendum on such a fundamental matter. Indeed, it stood unanimously against such a referendum. I suggest, therefore, that although there are old echoes here of Conservative opposition to devolution and evolution in relation to a Welsh Assembly, this amendment should be rejected.

I am absolutely convinced that it is not making a political point; it is not taking an attitude for or against the Welsh Assembly. The point is whether this House should agree to primary legislation, an unlimited amount by degrees, taking place because of an order from Westminster. I think it was my noble friend on the Front Bench who said that it was as if the regulatory reform Bill coming to this House were already in place. It is a major step for secondary legislation to bring about primary legislation.
</p>

<a name="60503-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>While I have much less experience than the noble Lord, I would say to him that this is a constitutional point. I rather resent that he is entirely politicising this, saying it is a Conservative fetish because it does not like the Assembly. I am fully in favour of the Assembly&#151;the Welsh people voted for it&#151;just as I am fully in favour of the Scots Parliament. I am fully in favour, if the Welsh people want it, that they should have more power to do primary legislation. I am surprised that a very distinguished Liberal Democrat lawyer from the Front Bench has said that because this is a step towards more power to the Welsh Assembly he will not stand in the way. To my mind, this is a constitutional point, a legal point, and a very big one. I hope we will not have a Division because I suspect the amendment would be defeated. I do not know what my noble friend is planning to do, because it is a huge issue. Westminster would be making a very big mistake if it agreed to this.

<p><a name="st_158"></a>
<a name="60503-23_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   This has been a fascinating debate. The noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, has certainly taken away from me any necessity to make observations about political differences with regard to this amendment. I am all the more grateful that it has come from the Cross Benches, because it means that my criticism will therefore be muted as far as the Conservative Front Bench&#039;s present position is concerned. Let us not make any bones about it: if this amendment were carried, the Bill would be gutted. It would effectively delete the process whereby additional powers are offered to Wales.
</p>

<a name="60503-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>The thrust of the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, was that there was no referendum to back this up, and that therefore there was no democratic basis on which the Government ought to proceed in these terms. The Conservative Party did not think a referendum was necessary on entry into Europe, it did not think that Scotland needed a referendum, it does think that additional powers to Wales can be processed and consented to by this Parliament only by a referendum. That seems a late conversion to this concept of how one achieves popular support for measures. There is another route, which the Conservative Party and other parties <br>&nbsp;<br>

generally follow, and which the Labour Party took with regard to this legislation: to put in its manifesto that it intends to enhance the legislative powers of the National Assembly. That is what Part 3 sets out to do.
</p>

<a name="60503-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Edwards, said&#151;I am awfully sorry, I meant the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell; I was going back to the old days. I think I was guilty of not getting his first name right on another occasion and now I have failed on his title, so I am doubly apologetic. The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, referred to this position. With the concept of the Order in Council we are not producing an innovative approach to extending powers; Scottish powers would be enhanced through Order in Council and it is how Northern Ireland has its powers defined. So there is nothing exceptional about the approach, although I recognise that noble Lords opposite have reservations about how the consultation process is developed prior to these powers. We had a debate on this point at our previous Committee sitting. I want to develop and, I hope, answer that point in a moment, but I will give way to the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell.

</p>




<p><a name="st_159"></a>
<a name="60503-23_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   The noble Lord asserts that he has answered the point, but I have already pointed out to him that the much respected Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has said that what is different here is the proposed scale of the use of the power. The Scotland Act 1998 defines the devolution settlement, and the Order in Council power may be used to modify it. In contrast, it is proposed here that Orders in Council will define the competence of the Assembly. That is an enormous difference, and the noble Lord should not try to pretend that they are the same thing.
</p>




<p><a name="st_160"></a>
<a name="60503-23_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The committee noted&#151;the noble Lord was fair enough to quote this point but I want to use it as evidence for the Government&#039;s case&#151;that use of the new mechanism would be an incremental process, with government and Parliament deliberating at each step on proposals to confer legislative competence over specific matters. It would be for Parliament to decide on a case-by-case basis what legislative competence should be conferred on the Assembly as the draft Orders in Council come forward. The important point, which is recognised by the committee, is that each proposal for new legislative competence is subject to the necessary parliamentary approval.
</p>

<a name="60503-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>I recognise, and the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, is absolutely right, that the committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, approached this issue with its customary due diligence and examined it very carefully. But the noble Lord will not be surprised to learn that we regard the position that the committee has taken up as one to which the Government are able fully to respond, because we are indicating that parliamentary approval is necessary at each stage. What is parliamentary approval for? Not for a Secretary of State&#039;s arbitrary act&#151;it was suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, that somehow these Orders in Council were the property of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_529"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 529</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Secretary of State. The Secretary of State for Wales is unlikely to stand idly by while issues of this moment are being discussed. Of course he would expect to be consulted; I do not know how we would think he was fulfilling his duty as Secretary of State for Wales if he were not involved. But the orders come to this House after the democratic body in Wales has decided that they should do so. If the democratic Assembly in Wales decides that they should not go forward, they do not. What can be arbitrary about that when an Order in Council mechanism is being used&#151;but one that is actually to convey powers that a democratically elected Assembly is seeking? That is the basis of Part 3.

<a name="60503-23_spnew5"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I wonder whether he could clarify something for me. As I understand it, the Scotland Act is limited by Schedule 5, and we frequently amend Schedule 5 by statutory instrument. Has there been an Order in Council amending other parts of the Scotland Act, or could there be such, or have there been any Orders in Council involved?
</p>




<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="60503-23_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The noble Duke is absolutely right in his definition; I am merely describing what the Welsh counterpart to that is. The Orders in Council for Wales are not arbitrary, authoritarian acts of an executive; they are the democratic will of the National Assembly being translated to this Parliament for both Houses to consider whether those powers should be conferred. I am merely indicating that, far from the Opposition&#039;s case that what is involved here is an arbitrary process that requires a referendum, what we are involved in is a democratic process that fulfils the objectives of the Welsh people.

<a name="60503-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>The Conservative Party in the other House went a little further than the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has done today. It faced up to the fact that there are some difficulties with regard to the referendum, because we would have to work out what kind of question could be put to the Welsh people, who enjoy some powers but now may wish to increase those powers; not as a total package, but incrementally. The shadow Attorney-General had a shot at the question that should be put to the Welsh people:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a>&quot;&quot;do people wish to be governed by Order in Council moderated in its detail by the Welsh Assembly&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 9/1/06; col. 119.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>What kind of participation in a referendum does any noble Lord think would take place under a question of that degree of abstruseness? That is the nature of the problem. What we have already is a Welsh Assembly with powers. There are good reasons and pressures from within the Welsh community for additional powers, but they are not powers that one can put into a total package and say, &quot;This is the question before the Welsh people&#151;do you want this in its totality?&quot;. It is not like a European Community referendum, which of course the Conservative Party did not offer; it is not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_530"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 530</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

like a referendum for the Scottish people, which the Conservative Party never offered. It is different from those, and that is why the Government are saying that this is not the kind of question that is subject to a referendum. But it must follow due democratic process, and I am identifying the process that will be followed.
</p>

<a name="60503-24_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord. I want to understand the Government&#039;s position. Is it that Part 3 can simply be implemented in the Bill without any need for a referendum? Or is it the Government&#039;s position that the only reason why Part 3 should not have a referendum is that the question would be impossible to put?
</p>




<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="60503-24_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   But it might be the case that the question is impossible to put because the process whereby one develops the interests of the people of Wales is more difficult than the yes/no concept of a referendum question. Why should it be more complex? Is it because the Government have set out to make it more complex? No, because what the Government have created and what has been in place for the people of Wales is a partially devolved Administration and powers that are very limited. We always anticipated that these powers would be subject to pressure for enhancement and improvement as the Assembly developed in its confidence and as the Executive became more and more responsive to the Assembly. The two main concepts are in this Bill; on the one hand separating the executive from the legislature, which is one major principle in the Bill; and secondly how we have a process that is subject to democratic scrutiny both in Wales, which will be the origin of the request, and in the United Kingdom in both Houses of Parliament when the requests come forward.
</p>

<a name="60503-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>It might be said that this looks like a very tortuous road, and a partial road, and one which will take a period of time to deliver. So it will. My noble friend Lord Richard&#151;who has been ever-present with us and now when I want to call him in aid regrettably is not in his place&#151;thought that the process would take up to 2011 before there were additional powers for the Welsh Assembly. Under this process, if the National Assembly so wants it, and if this House and the other place so agree, the process will operate more quickly. It might be said, &quot;This is a pretty complex operation&quot;. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, who was looking for difficulties rather than helping us with solutions, said, &quot;What about a situation where the Assembly government in Wales might be different in political hue from the rest of the United Kingdom?&quot;. That is a concept that beggars belief at present. If that were to occur, the noble Lord is right to identify that there would be greater difficulties. I have no doubt that a government hostile to what the National Assembly of Wales sought to achieve would use this process, through their democratic mandate, to resist some of these proposals. After all, they would have that right; that is how these Orders in Council are meant to be processed.

<a name="60503-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>Does anybody think that that is more difficult for the people of Wales than what obtains at the present time? Does anybody think that it is easy for the National Assembly and the Executive in Wales to contemplate how they would successfully influence United Kingdom legislation if the Executive who initiated such legislation were from another party? It is a clash of two mandates which we all recognise. In any devolved administration that clash will, from time to time, happen. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, cannot say that this process will throw up a great many difficulties when a clash of two mandates occurs. Before this concept was ever devised, differences between the administration of the United Kingdom and that of Wales would throw up just such difficulties.

It is in favour of greater democracy in Wales, subject to a referendum, but it does not have the faintest idea what the question put to the people of Wales would look like, or even if it would be intelligible. The alternative is the Bill; I support and defend the Bill.

<p><a name="st_165"></a>
<a name="60503-24_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I am astonished that the Minister should have left the principle of increased democracy until his peroration. Whatever else Part 3 does, it certainly does not increase democracy. It reduces democracy, both in this Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. Essentially, laws are going to be made by deals struck between the First Minister in Wales and the Secretary of State for Wales. They will produce legislative proposals which cannot be amended in either the Welsh Assembly or this Parliament. Why on earth should that be labelled &quot;democratic&quot;? I do not know.
</p>

<a name="60503-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>Compared to Part 3, Part 4 is a far more logical solution, and of much greater benefit to Wales. It is certainly far more democratic. All it needs is a referendum. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, was kind enough to see some merit in my criticisms of Part 3; but what overrode his determination to support me was the fact that he wanted Welsh devolution at all costs. I do not mean that in the literal sense; but rather that the noble Lord was so determined to achieve Welsh devolution that he was not going to drop the opportunity this Bill afforded. Am I right in saying that?

This, although it is a very unsatisfactory mechanism, gives the people of Wales the chance to see the Assembly succeed, without having to go into questions of cost, the nature of the voting system, and other matters which will, in the short term, detract from the ultimate success of the Assembly. That is why I am prepared to go along with this.

Technically, Welsh Assembly measures are subordinate, in the sense that they become binding law only when they are approved by Order in Council. That Order in Council, the stage 2 order, is not brought to this House. The Secretary of State has no discretion in deciding whether or not to table that order. Once the Welsh Assembly has passed a measure, the Secretary of State is obliged to bring that order before the Privy Council. It is exactly the same situation as for the Overseas Territories.

However the Government want to camouflage it, those were the words I used at the beginning of my observations. The substance of what the Government seek to do in stage 2 of this Bill is to give primary legislative powers to the Welsh Assembly. I have no objection to that, but I believe that it should be a consequence of a decision by the Welsh people, and not simply of a Bill in this Parliament.

<a name="60503-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral </b>   rose to move to resolve, That this House calls upon Her Majesty&#039;s Government to revoke the regulations laid before the House on 7 February (SI 2006/246) [<i>25th Report from the Merits Committee</i>].
</p>

<a name="60503-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am very grateful to the Minister for coming to the Chamber today to explain the Government&#039;s position on these regulations. I declare my interest as a solicitor and a partner in the firm of Beachcroft LLP. I have been inspired to put down this Motion to revoke by the very serious concerns raised by those who are most directly affected by the regulations; namely, those involved in turning around and, in particular, rescuing failing companies where the transfer of undertakings is all-important. Above all, these highly skilled professionals need as much certainty and as little uncertainty as possible. Our concern is with the insolvency provisions of the regulations, specifically with their drafting and their practical application.
</p>

<a name="60503-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>These regulations were intended to give effect to an EC directive from 2001, fully five years ago. The Government have had plenty of time to get them right, but I believe they have failed abjectly. Over a year ago, the DTI first consulted on the draft regulations and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_534"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 534</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

respondents included R3, the representative body for insolvency practitioners in England and Wales, whose expertise in these matters is universally recognised as being second to none. It drew attention to the unsatisfactory nature of the regulations, setting out its detailed concerns and suggesting alternative wording that would have made the regulations workable. Its advice, however, seems to have been completely ignored. Despite many subsequent representations to Ministers and officials, still nothing was done to improve matters.
</p>

<a name="60503-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>In the past, the operation of TUPE has deterred potential purchasers from buying insolvent businesses because of the prospect of inheriting onerous and sometimes uncertain liabilities. One of the stated aims of the regulations is to make it easier for insolvent businesses to be transferred to new employers by reducing some of the burdens that will pass across to a purchaser. We on these Benches fully support this policy objective. Insolvency practitioners, too, are as anxious as anyone else that as many jobs as possible should be saved when an employer becomes insolvent. However, if the regulations are to have the desired effect, they must be drafted in clear, unambiguous language. Only then will those dealing with insolvencies and those acquiring businesses subject to insolvency proceedings know where they stand and precisely how the provisions of the regulations will affect transactions.
</p>

<a name="60503-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>Unfortunately, the regulations, as regards the insolvency provisions, failed to achieve that. That is because they are drafted in language that is so loose and imprecise it is not possible to discern with any clarity how they are supposed to work. Instead of bringing clarity, they bring confusion to new, unprecedented heights.
</p>

<a name="60503-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>My principal concerns are that these regulations, first, fail to specify the types of UK insolvency proceedings to which they are intended to apply; secondly, fail to make clear which liabilities will pass to a purchaser and which will not; and, thirdly, impose unrealistic obligations on insolvency office holders with which it would be impossible for them to comply and with penalties that will ultimately fall on creditors. The regulations transpose the vague generic language of the directive without attempting to specify how it is to apply in the context of specific UK insolvency proceedings. Only expensive and time-consuming judicial interpretation will establish the circumstances in which they are intended to apply.
</p>

<a name="60503-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>The regulations seek to draw a distinction between two types of insolvency proceedings: those opened with a view to the liquidation of the assets of the transferor and those opened not with a view to the liquidation of the assets. However, that distinction makes no sense at all in the context of UK insolvency. It is unclear which of the UK insolvency regimes would fall within which provision. Assets are sold in every type of insolvency process, whether administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement or liquidation, even where the whole or a part of the business is preserved and sold as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_535"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 535</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a going concern. In some cases, part of a business will be preserved while other remaining assets are disposed of piecemeal.
</p>

<a name="60503-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>In that context, I ask the Minister what the phrase &quot;[not] with a view to the liquidation of the assets of the transferor&quot; is supposed to mean. How is it intended to apply? It is possible for a business to be sold in any of the regimes. Consequently, it is possible for employees of insolvent businesses to be affected by a transfer or proposed transfer of the business, regardless of the type of insolvency regime into which their current employer has entered. Where there is a transfer, the treatment of the employees should be the same, regardless of the insolvency process used. The uncertainty caused by ambiguous drafting will cause delays only in the administration of the insolvency and, most important of all, reduce the chances of successful rescue and preservation of jobs.
</p>

<a name="60503-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>It is unbelievably complacent of the Minister&#039;s colleagues, by their own admission, to leave it to the courts to sort this mess out, ultimately at the expense of creditors and to the detriment of employees. Either the regulation should be amended to make it clear explicitly which provisions apply to which types of insolvency process or they should simply apply to all insolvency proceedings equally without distinction.
</p>

<a name="60503-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>Regulation 8 says that where the transferor is subject to insolvency proceedings which have been opened&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74"></a>&quot;not with a view to the liquidation of the assets of the transferor&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>certain accrued liabilities will be paid from the national insurance fund with the balance of any liabilities passing to the transferee. Reference is made to the debts payable by the Secretary of State under the redundancy and insolvency provisions of the Employment Rights Act 1996. However, the interpretation of this provision also is uncertain.
</p>

<a name="60503-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>On a straight reading, the regulation seems to provide for the payment out of the national insurance fund only of the debts payable under the insolvency provisions. This makes it difficult to understand the reference to the redundancy provisions. First, the guidance note issued by the DTI in February indicated that payments would be made out of the national insurance fund in respect of both the redundancy and the insolvency provisions. On 3 April, only three days before these regulations were due to come into force, the Redundancy Payments Office issued a statement of its own. It suggested that where there is a transfer or an unfair dismissal made in connection with a transfer, it will pay only the arrears of pay and accrued holiday pay, which are often minimal or even non-existent. There would be no termination or redundancy payments at all.
</p>

<a name="60503-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>So, again, the Government have added to the confusion. The left-hand appears to contradict the right-hand which, I believe, is unacceptable and must be resolved as a matter of urgency. It is difficult to see how these provisions should or could be amended until Ministers explain exactly what the Government were <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_536"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 536</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

seeking to achieve by these provisions and which liabilities the Secretary of State is prepared to permit the national insurance fund to meet.
</p>

<a name="60503-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>Before closing, I would like to raise another problem. The regulations include, first, a requirement for the transferor to provide the transferee with information regarding the employees to be affected by the purchaser with a potential liability of at least &#163;500 per employee for a failure to comply and, secondly, joint and several liability between transferor and transferee in the event that employees are not properly consulted prior to the transfer taking effect. These provisions fail to take into account the unique circumstances in which transfers of businesses are affected in the insolvency arena. Within the very tight timeframe of a live insolvency, it will not usually be possible to comply with this requirement and the insolvency practitioner will usually not have enough information to do so in any event. Insolvency practitioners, attempting to act in the best interests of creditors by effecting a swift sale, should not be exposed to the potential costs and delays of defending claims in a tribunal by purchasers on the basis that full information was not given.
</p>

<a name="60503-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>Furthermore, any award made by a tribunal could have a significant impact on the return to unsecured creditors. Should not the regulations have excluded the application of these provisions to insolvency-related transfers? If these regulations stand, it will arguably be impossible for any insolvency practitioner, prospective purchaser of an insolvent business, employee or any of their professional advisers to ascertain with certainty what they mean, what they are intended to achieve and where they should apply.
</p>

<a name="60503-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>The practical effect will be that fewer jobs and businesses will be saved, and that is surely precisely the opposite of everything we are seeking to achieve. The insolvency provisions of the 2006 regulations are uncertain and ambiguous. They even conflict with the Government&#039;s own guidance notes. What a mess!
</p>

<a name="60503-25_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>Many of us have been inundated with representations urging the amendment of these regulations. I have been greatly assisted by my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon and R3&#151;the Association of Business Recovery Professionals&#151;the Insolvency Lawyers&#039; Association and some of the leading law firms. All of us believe that these regulations are wholly unacceptable, should be withdrawn, reconsidered and redrafted. I beg to move.
</p>

<a name="60503-25_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>Moved to resolve, That this House calls upon Her Majesty&#039;s Government to revoke the regulations laid before the House on 7 February (SI 2006/246) [<i>25th Report from the Merits Committee</i>].&#151;(<i>Lord Hunt of Wirral</i>.)

<a name="60503-26_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   My Lords, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Motion. My interest, as I am sure a number of noble Lords will understand, is to ensure that the rights of employees in merger and takeover situations are fully protected. As a former trade union official, it is not surprising that that should <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_537"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 537</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be my viewpoint. We already have the TUPE regulations, providing some protection for existing employees when a business is taken over. It is important for industrial relations generally that employees should continue to feel that protection exists. Job insecurity is not helpful in any industrial or commercial environment, particularly in a situation created by globalisation.
</p>

<a name="60503-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>As I understand it, there has been a view that the regulations need some revision, particularly on insolvency, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, explained. However, there has been a long period of consultation. Since 2001, I believe, the DTI has consulted the CBI, the TUC, the Business Services Association and the Engineering Employers Federation. Of these, only the EEF, as I understand it, has raised strong objections. The CBI has accepted in principle with some reservations. There has also been a report from the Merits Committee. The CBI has apparently objected to the regulations on the grounds of the changes to provisions on service provision, and argues that they would create inflexibility in contract provision, reducing competition and innovation.
</p>

<a name="60503-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>However, the regulations, in changing service provision, are of value and improve protection for employees. In those circumstances, the regulations as a whole should be accepted. I support the Government&#039;s position on this, and oppose the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, despite the clarity with which he spoke to it. I am not convinced that the employee rights that concern me would be adequately protected if his Motion were carried.
</p>

<a name="60503-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>I note what the noble Lord says about the language, and am sure that the Minister will deal with that when he comes to reply. In the light of my reading of the regulations, and the position I take on the protection of employee interests, however, I do not feel, in the circumstances, that I am able to support the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt.
<a name="time_23"></a>

<p><a name="st_179"></a>
<a name="60503-26_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Newby: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for moving this Motion. I will not repeat his clear description of why the practitioners in this area are so unhappy with the regulations, or underestimate the difficulties that the DTI has clearly faced in drafting the regulations in a clear way. It has obviously been difficult to get it right. Although we on these Benches have no problems with the principles that lie behind the regulations, it is clear that, in certain limited respects, the DTI has not got it wholly right.
</p>

<a name="60503-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>The Association of Business Recovery Professionals, as we have heard, has serious concerns that the regulations as drafted will cause confusion and make its job more difficult. This is not a body given either to political posturing or to taking matters into its own hands when it does not feel seriously about them. It is a highly technical trade association. Interestingly, the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, did not mention it as being one of the groups that has been consulted. However, it has, as we have heard, two complaints.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_538"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 538</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60503-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>The first relates to definitions of the types of proceedings to which the regulations apply and the liabilities which will pass to a purchaser. These are not matters of principle, but technical issues. Secondly, R3 has concerns about the mechanics relating to the provision of information and consultation. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, made clear, as currently drafted, they do not seem to be practical to put into operation in the circumstances of some insolvencies. It is strange, given the long period since the directive was passed and the fact that there have been significant consultations, that we still have this difficulty.
</p>

<a name="60503-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>I suspect one reason is that the Government do not always mean what the man or woman on the street means by &quot;consultation&quot;: if you ask people their views and they give them to you and are standing on firm ground, you amend your proposal. I deal more with Treasury than DTI matters, but it is now commonplace for the Treasury either not to consult or, where it does, to ignore what is said. As a result of that, we have had a string of tax measures in recent years which have had to be reversed because they have proved to have perverse and unintended consequences. I slightly fear that this is what has happened in this case.
</p>

<a name="60503-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>I therefore ask the Minister&#151;I am sure he is going to enlighten us anyway&#151;whether the Government believe that the concerns expressed by insolvency practitioners are simply unfounded. If so, will he explain to the House why that is? If not, will he explain why a little further time was not taken to resolve these points? Clearly, this directive was passed in 2001. It does not desperately matter whether these regulations are passed tonight or in a month or two&#039;s time. There is no overriding time constraint to get it right.
</p>

<a name="60503-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a> Noble Lords will have heard me make my final point in debates about secondary legislation in your Lordships&#039; House. Here we are, yet again, having a debate about statutory instruments over which we have no control whatever. Whatever we do tonight&#151;whether we vote or not, whether the Motion is passed or not&#151;will not have the slightest practical effect. Although we feel that we are fulfilling a function in shining a spotlight on to what may be inadequacies of legislation, as a legislature, that seems to be an inadequate function. We ought to be able, where there are problems, to cause regulations to be reconsidered.
</p>

<a name="60503-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a> There are two ways in which we could do that. One is to follow more regularly&#151;although I am not suggesting in every case&#151;the precedent which I believe has been set in the Identity Cards Bill, under which regulations can be amended by Parliament. Another suggestion is that in a case such as this, where real problems arise&#151;not imagined problems, put forward by vexatious people&#151;the House ought to be able to refer the statutory instrument in question back to the department for further consultation in specific areas. Just as we return legislation to another place and ask the Government to look at it again, we might be able to do that with statutory instruments, within a set and tight timetable.

<a name="60503-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>I realise that this is neither the time nor the place for a full-scale debate on these rather more far reaching changes, but this House needs always to look at how it can operate more effectively. In terms of statutory instruments, we do not operate in an effective manner.
</p>

<a name="60503-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>I have great sympathy with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and will support his Motion.

<p><a name="st_180"></a>
<a name="60503-26_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   My Lords, I shall add two brief points relating to procedure. I listened with some care to the noble Lord, Lord Newby, but would say that we have improved procedures for scrutiny of statutory instruments. It is precisely because of concerns of the type which have been expressed that the Merits Committee was set up only a year ago. We now have its report, which goes into some detail about who was consulted and when. I am sorry that the Insolvency Practitioners Association does not think that it was listened to, but it is surely rather wide of the mark for the noble Lord, Lord Newby, to say that the Government ignored what it said. I do not know whether the Insolvency Practitioners Association was slow off the mark, but all of these matters have surely been considered in great detail. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot say, &quot;This thing has been going on for a long time. Why haven&#039;t they got it right?&quot; when some of these considerations are now on the table&#151;at least they are on the table before us today&#151;and the statutory instrument is in front of us. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75"></a>&quot;Made 6th February 2006  . . . Laid before Parliament 7th February 2006  . . . Coming into force 6th April 2006&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>A wide range of people has been consulted and not everybody is over the moon about the regulations. However, as I understand it, we cannot just make our own transfer and insolvency arrangements as if there are not 24 other countries in the European Union. Will the Minister comment on that? We do not want to jump from the frying pan into the fire by having some system that looks somehow perfect so far as the traditions of our insolvency practitioners are concerned only to find ourselves trying to find some certainty within a range of different traditions to reflect continental subsidiaries of UK companies and vice versa. This goes back to the argument about why we entered Europe in the first place. We know that it is overwhelmingly to the advantage of industry that regulations of this type have been made in Europe going as far back as 1977. They are among the earliest and most time-honoured of all the social-dimension regulations in the European Union.
</p>

<a name="60503-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>The Insolvency Practitioners Association perhaps needs to gain some further understanding about how it will do its work against the background of the procedure being done and dusted and having been carried out correctly and with great care.

<a name="60503-27_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My Lords, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 are unquestionably important. The Merits Committee has also noted their significance. I am therefore pleased that we have had an opportunity to discuss these <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_540"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 540</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

new TUPE regulations today. As we know, these regulations implement the Acquired Rights directive in the UK. They are therefore made primarily under Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 via the negative resolution procedure.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that we have consulted extremely widely, including with the Association of Business Recovery Professionals. We have listened to its views. If we had thought that its views and the proposed course of action would improve the situation, we would have amended the regulations and taken account of that. However, it is our view that they do not and that they merely would have replaced one kind of uncertainty with another, as I shall explain. We therefore felt that we should go forward on this basis.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>I was asked why we did not take more time to get these regulations right. It has taken a very long time to bring these regulations forward. Work started in 1997, and we have been pressed to finalise the regulations and improve the protections provided by them. Against that background, it would have been a grave mistake to delay them further.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>The original TUPE regulations were introduced in 1981. They have given rise to large amount of litigation and have been repeatedly tested in the tribunals and courts. This new set of regulations represents a major revision of those 1981 regulations. They have been in preparation for many years and have been the subject of three rounds of public consultation.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>Our aims in revising the 1981 regulations were several. We needed to update them to reflect the changing face of our labour market, in particular the greater use of outsourcing and similar practices. We also needed to clarify the law, both to reflect important developments in case law across the 25 years or so during which the 1981 regulations were in force and to address some of the inconsistencies that had arisen between domestic and European interpretation of the directive and the regulations. We wanted to revise them also to take account of changes to the Acquired Rights directive.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>The revised Acquired Rights directive provided new possibilities for member states to develop their law on transfers. We have taken advantage of those possibilities. For example, the 2006 regulations place a new obligation on the transferor employer to provide information to the transferee employer about the employees who are transferring. That information, which should normally be provided in advance of the transfer occurring, should help the new transferee employer to prepare for the responsibilities and obligations that he will inherit. It should therefore help ensure a smoother transition, benefiting both the new employer and the transferred employees.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>Another major set of changes flowing from the new directive concerns the treatment of transferors subject to insolvency proceedings at the time of transfer. It is this element of the new regulations, which is in Regulations 8 and 9, that has attracted speakers in this debate. In explaining our position on these two <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_541"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 541</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

regulations, it is fair to say that our objective in making these changes is shared by most, if not all, of us. Regulations 8 and 9 aim to make it easier for a new transferee employer to take on all or some of the business from a transferor employer who is insolvent or, more precisely, is the subject of insolvency proceedings. In other words, it aims to support the &quot;rescue culture&quot;, preserving as many jobs as possible in the difficult situations which can arise when businesses face extreme financial difficulty.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>Regulation 8 assists by relieving the transferee employer of some of the debts owed by the transferor to the transferring workers. Under the 1981 regulations, most of those debts would have been transferred to the transferee, creating a disincentive for a new employer to step in. Under the 2006 regulations, we have relieved the new employer of some debts that will now be met through the National Insurance Fund. For example, the fund will meet arrears in pay owed to the transferring employees up to the statutory maximum that can be paid under the Employment Rights Act 1996. This provision applies where the transferor is the subject of insolvency proceedings which have been opened not with a view to the liquidation of the assets of the transferor.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>In addition, Regulation 8(7) disapplies Regulations 4 and 7 in those extreme cases where the transferor is subject to &quot;bankruptcy or analogous&quot; insolvency proceedings which have been opened with a view to the liquidation of the assets. This means that if a transfer occurs in those circumstances, the TUPE provisions concerning continuity of employment and the maintenance of contractual terms and conditions do not come into play.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>Regulation 9 assists the rescue culture by creating room for the transferred employees to agree new terms and conditions with the transferee or the insolvency practitioner. Under the 1981 regulations, the transferee employer would have to have taken on the employees under their old terms and conditions. Regulation 9 loosens that arrangement and, in effect, permits the parties, subject to particular safeguards, to agree to transfer on different, perhaps inferior, terms and conditions. The safeguards limit contractual changes to permitted variations of contracts that are designed to safeguard employment opportunities by ensuring the survival of the undertaking. They also involve the participation of union or other representatives in the process and the provision of information on proposed contractual changes to the affected employees. In cases where bankruptcy or analogous proceedings are taking place, there is even wider scope to apply new conditions because Regulation 4 does not apply.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>There have been two broad criticisms of these insolvency provisions and they were made by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, this evening. First, it has been suggested that Regulation 8 and our guidance are insufficiently clear in identifying which debts are met from the National Insurance Fund. Secondly, doubts <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_542"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 542</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have been expressed about our approach to copying out the directive when defining how the various categories of insolvency proceeding are covered.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>Let me start with the debts issue. The National Insurance Fund will be able to play a role where employees transfer within the scope of the regulations and they are owed certain contractual debts by the transferor. The fund will cover any arrears in pay and holiday pay owed by transferor, subject to the statutory limits. Statutory redundancy pay does not come into play for those employees because they have not been made redundant during the transfer process and TUPE regulations have the effect of deeming such employees not to have been made redundant on the date of the transfer.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>The situation is different for employees who would have physically transferred had they not been dismissed in advance of the transfer. Such dismissals may be lawful under TUPE where the dismissals were connected with the transfer and were made for an,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76"></a>&quot;economic technical or organisational reason entailing changes in the workforce&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>Those employees are entitled to statutory redundancy pay, and the National Insurance Fund will meet those debts.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>Where employees have been dismissed because of the transfer itself or for a reason connected with the transfer that is not an economic, technical or organisational reason, that dismissal is unfair under the TUPE regulations. Employees in that position must complain to an employment tribunal of unfair dismissal, seeking the standard compensation for their loss. The liability in that situation could pass to the transferee, but it will be for the tribunal to decide where liability falls. The fund is not responsible for the debts arising from tribunal awards against the transferee.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>The Insolvency Service has provided a detailed note to insolvency practitioners that sets out the various ways in which the fund can assist. That detailed note clarifies the position adequately and it is clear what the situation is. It is complicated, but we are dealing with a complicated situation involving TUPE regulations in an insolvency. There is no getting away from that complicated situation, but it is clear what the National Insurance Fund can do.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>Let me now turn to the set of questions concerning our decision to copy out the relevant parts of the directive. As a result, we have not specified how each of the many types of insolvency proceeding would be treated. The main reason for adopting our preferred approach was to be sure that we implemented the directive correctly. Had we adopted a different approach, errors might have been made. We are often criticised in this or other places for failing to implement our EU obligations correctly. On this occasion, we have sought to avoid that potential error.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>It has been said that our approach creates uncertainty because it fails to specify how each type of insolvency proceeding is to be treated. Some argue that it is unreasonable to leave such matters to the courts. However, it is impossible to give absolute legal <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_543"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 543</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

certainty when applying European directives of this kind. If we had chosen other wording for our regulations&#151;for example, if we had listed each type of insolvency proceeding covered by Regulation 8(6) and 8(7)&#151;we would potentially have created scope for legal challenges about our implementation of the directive. It is not possible to get rid of all uncertainty. Either there is uncertainty about how the general point in the directive applies to particularly circumstances in this country or, if that is specified, there is the uncertainty of that method being challenged because it does not properly implement the European directive.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>Furthermore, the listing of insolvency proceedings would have made the regulations much more complicated. This point was raised by my noble friend Lord Lea this evening. How would they deal with the transfer of an undertaking located in the UK that was part of a French or Italian business entity that was the subject of insolvency proceedings in its home country? To cater for those circumstances, it might be necessary for Regulations 8(6) and 8(7) to specify how each of those foreign insolvency proceedings were to be treated. That would clearly be ludicrous, but it is a problem that can arise when regulations are drafted in fine detail.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>I recognise that some insolvency practitioners are concerned about the regulation. In our judgment, the generic descriptions of relevant insolvency proceedings in Regulations 8(6) and 8(7) are reasonably clear. In our view, there are unlikely to be significant problems.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>Let us look at the position of administrations, the main category of insolvency proceeding. Regulations 8 and 9 were drafted with the intention that where there was a transfer in a business or undertaking, and the transferor was in administration under the Insolvency Act 1986, employees engaged in that business should be transferred to the acquirer of the business or undertaking. In other words, we intend that Regulation 8(7) should not apply in that situation, but the other provisions in Regulations 8 and 9 would apply. It is our view that the regulations have the intended effect. The key words in Regulation 8(7) are &quot;bankruptcy proceedings&quot; and &quot;analogous&quot;. The expression &quot;bankruptcy proceedings&quot; is to be interpreted as meaning proceedings that have as their main or only purpose the realisation of a debtor&#039;s assets with a view, after payment of the associated costs and expenses, to the distribution of the proceeds to the debtor&#039;s creditors. A key feature of bankruptcy proceedings is that they are collective proceedings; in other words, they are for the benefit of all creditors. Administration does not fall within the expression &quot;bankruptcy proceedings&quot;. The key question is whether administration is analogous to bankruptcy proceedings and it would appear that it is not. The principle or main purpose of administration is not the realisation of the debtor&#039;s assets with a view to distribution among creditors. The statutory purpose to which administrators are obliged to have regard first is the rescue of the company. However, the interpretation of the regulations is ultimately a matter for the tribunal and the court.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_544"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 544</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60503-27_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, made the point that few transfers of insolvent businesses involve the sale of all assets to the transferee. This is another area where there has been concern. Some assets are simply sold off to the highest bidder as in a liquidation. Just because some assets are liquidated, it does not follow that Regulations 8(6) and 9 do not apply. The regulations refer to the &quot;liquidation of the assets&quot;. They do not refer to &quot;the liquidation of some assets&quot; or to &quot;the liquidation of any assets&quot;. It is therefore very difficult in our judgment for the tribunal and courts to conclude that the wording of the regulations and the directive means that where some assets are liquidated, Regulations 8(6) and 9 do not apply.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>I do not pretend that the regulations are completely certain in their effect and in their capture. That is inherent within much new legislation. Complete or near-complete certainty cannot be found in these situations.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>I turn to one or two specific points that were raised. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said that it is impractical for insolvency practitioners to supply the level of detailed information required in the short time periods within which they typically operate. Regulations 11 and 12 have flexibilities within them. In general, the information must be supplied at least 14 days before the transfer, but this can be relaxed when it is impractical for the transferor to do so. It is perfectly possible for an insolvency practitioner to argue that he should supply the information later because he is new to the business. The tribunal can also waive the minimum compensation for a failure to supply the information where it considers it just and equitable in all the circumstances to do so. Again, the insolvency practitioner could argue for this discretion to be used where it was impossible for him to assemble the necessary information. That said, we believe that in most cases the information can easily be assembled by the insolvency practitioner and most information will be located on payroll and in other personnel information, which should be readily accessible.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said that the DTI guidance on the provisions is unclear. The statement in the response document is factually correct, although I concede that it might potentially confuse the reader. Where a statutory redundancy payment is made, the individual who receives that payment would need to build up his entitlement from zero. The phrase was not meant to imply that all transferring employees should receive such a payment on a transfer, whether or not they lost their job. Indeed, the opposite is the case where employees take out employment with the transferee because, in general, they will not be made redundant by the transferor in the lead up to the transfer. However, there will be some cases where affected employees are made redundant for an economic, technical or organisational reason connected with the transfer in anticipation of the transfer or afterwards. Those employees are entitled to statutory redundancy payments so long as they meet the standard and other criteria. The position on that is set out very much more fully in the guidance issued by the Insolvency Service.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_545"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 545</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60503-27_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, spoke about the justification for making the transferor and the transferee jointly and severally liable for a failure to consult. He asked whether that would inhibit the rescue culture and deter potential employees from taking on an insolvent business. There is no reason why consultation cannot be carried out properly in extreme situations of insolvency. We would want parties to ensure that they occur in practice. Joint and several liability provides an incentive to both employers to ensure consultation occurs. Good prior consultation usually smooths the way for transfers by reducing employee resistance. So our proposals would in fact provide a stimulus to business rescue.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>The 2006 TUPE regulations have taken many years to produce. They have been the subject of an enormous amount of prior consultation. We believe that we have implemented the directive correctly and have updated the regulations to reflect the way our modern labour market works. We had to make a decision about whether to copy out how the directive was produced, or, alternatively, try to specify the provision in greater detail in terms of the UK and then face the situation of uncertainty because of challenge that it did not properly implement the directive. We have taken the first course because we think that will lead to greater certainty. I think that is the right course to take.
</p>

<a name="60503-27_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>However, we will monitor closely how the new regulations operate in practice. If problems emerge we will consider the case for amending the regulations. With those assurances and explanations, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his Motion.

<a name="60503-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Newby, for his support. I agree that the Government have not got this right&#151;it is certainly not wholly right. I very much agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, and the noble Lord, Lord Lea, in wanting to make sure that as many jobs as possible can be saved in a simple and effective way. I am rather disappointed with the Minister, as he would probably anticipate I would be disappointed. He said, &quot;Well, it is going to be uncertain. It is a matter for the courts and tribunals&quot;. I do not know whether the Minister has read the advice of the Insolvency Service. It says that it is uncertain. I am sorry, but it is. The Insolvency Service says in its letter:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a>&quot;It is inevitable that an employment tribunal will eventually determine this point&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>I do not think that it is good to pass legislation which requires courts and tribunals to interpret it so that it can be put into effect.
</p>

<a name="60503-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>I must say to the noble Lord, Lord Lea, that our three correspondents were not slow off the mark. On 7 June 2005, they submitted a greatly detailed response that stressed that the drafting was unsatisfactory. On 23 November, when they had heard very little from the department, they telephoned the department, spoke to the lead official and asked whether they could come in to explain why they were so concerned. The official said no; the department did not want a <br>&nbsp;<br>

meeting. Declining that offer of a meeting probably lies at the heart of all this; we would get this right if only the Government listened a little more. I really think I should test the opinion of the House.

<a name="60503-28_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Government of Wales Bill</h3>

<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>House again in Committee on Clause 92.

</p>

<p><a name="st_184"></a>
<a name="60503-28_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Kingsland </b>   moved Amendment No. 54A:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_78"></a>Page 50, line 26, at end insert &quot;, adopted by resolution of each House of Parliament&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>The noble Lord said: Now that we have covered most of the issues in a general way during the debate on the previous amendment, my submissions on the detailed points can be relatively succinct. First, we come to Amendment No. 54A to Clause 92(2), which is a good illustration of the point that I was trying to make about the way that the Bill is drafted when speaking to the previous amendment.
</p>

<a name="60503-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>We are having to deal with stage two before we go on to stage one. My point is simple. Clause 92(2) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_79"></a>&quot;A proposed Assembly measure is enacted by being passed by the Assembly and approved by Her Majesty in Council&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>There is no mention of the order being tabled in your Lordships&#039; House and in another place before being taken to the council for approval. Why? I cannot think of any precedent of that being so in this country. There are precedents for the overseas territories, but, as far as I am aware, there is no precedent for an Order in Council going in front of Her Majesty before it has been treated by either the negative resolution procedure or the affirmative procedure.
</p>

<a name="60503-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>One can only speculate on why that is so. There are two answers. One is that the Secretary of State has no discretion whatever. Once he or she receives evidence that an Assembly measure has gone through all its <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_548"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 548</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

stages, the Secretary of State has no alternative but to table it. The other is that the Secretary of State does have discretion whether to say yes or no. If that is so, surely the case for the order being tabled before both Houses of Parliament is overwhelmingly strong. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_185"></a>
<a name="60503-28_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   I am puzzled by this amendment because, by this time, the measure would have gone through the Assembly. It would have evolved. It would have been debated at great length and scrutinised following an Order in Council approving that competence. Therefore, what would this House be expected to do when that measure is complete? The House would not have been party to any stage of the Assembly measure&#039;s preparation and development because, quite rightly, that has been devolved to the Assembly itself. It would be a completed Assembly measure. Therefore, there would eventually have to be an Order in Council to finalise it. What in the name of heaven would we be voting on? Would we say that we did not believe the measure to be a good one, when this House had not been party to its development other than the original Order in Council? Surely we would not say that it was outside the devolution competence, because all sorts of provisions prevent that happening in other clauses. When the noble Lord develops this case, I would like to know what we would be expected to vote on.
</p>




<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="60503-28_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I will attempt to answer the noble Lord&#039;s question. I suggest there are two possibilities. One is that, at the end of the day, the Secretary of State can refuse to table the order, even though it has been passed by the Welsh Assembly. If the noble Lord reads Clause 92 he will see that it states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_80"></a>&quot;A proposed Assembly Measure is enacted by being passed by the Assembly and approved by Her Majesty in Council&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>So the legislative process has two stages. First, it has to be passed by the Assembly as an Assembly measure and, secondly, it has to be tabled in the Privy Council. The question I am probing is whether or not the Secretary of State for Wales has the discretion to say no to the Welsh Assembly, for one reason or another. The noble Lord is shaking his head but that is not clear. If the Secretary of State does not have any discretion, this is plainly primary legislation. If he does have discretion, and if it really is subordinate legislation, why is Parliament not engaged, as it always is when a Secretary of State has the discretion following the tabling of an Order in Council?

<p><a name="st_187"></a>
<a name="60503-29_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   We oppose this amendment on the basis that it is bringing Parliament in as a check upon the Welsh Assembly. That is quite undesirable. It does not happen in Scotland. There is no reason to think that the body of Members of the Scottish Parliament are more competent or have greater wisdom than the Members of the Welsh Assembly. It is essential that our Conservative friends let go on devolution and let the people decide.

goes back far enough, the Conservative position was certainly always against devolution. Your Lordships will know that, as they stagger out of the Bishops&#039; Bar, they will see opposite a large painting of the Marquess of Salisbury addressing the House on the Government of Ireland Bill on 8 September 1893. I have often wondered what he was saying. He said that this is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_81"></a>&quot;the motto which I hope the Unionist Party will adopt . . . if you allow this atrocious, this mean, this treacherous revolution to pass, you will be untrue to the duty which has descended to you from your splendid ancestry&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>of course, he was talking to hereditary Peers&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_82"></a>&quot;you will be untrue to your highest traditions, you will be untrue to the trust that has been bequeathed to you from the past, you will be untrue to the Empire of England&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>That is an interesting thing. Addressing the national union of the Conservative Party in 1886, he said that the Hottentots, Indians, Greeks, Russians and Celts were unfitted for self-government. So it is a pretty deep tradition to oppose devolution.
</p>




<p><a name="st_188"></a>
<a name="60503-29_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, introduced that quotation in the context of an earlier remark he made about the Conservatives. I do hope he is not suggesting that the philosophy which was expatiated upon by the Marquess of Salisbury in the late 19th century is one that we share today.
</p>




<p><a name="st_189"></a>
<a name="60503-29_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   I hope not, because his view was that only the Teutonic races were fitted for self-government. That was something that carried an echo into the 20th century. It is great that the Conservatives have come forward as far as they have to support the whole concept of devolution. But one cannot help feeling that there is some reluctance. It is rather like breaking open a piece of toffee and, as one pulls it apart, seeing the strands cling to each other. One feels that the Conservative Party is reluctant to allow the Welsh Assembly to sail off into Cardiff Bay.
</p>




<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="60503-29_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   I merely observe that the noble Lord speaks with all the authority of a man who tried on a number of occasions to be elected by the people of Wales and always failed. I am not sure that he is in a position to lecture those of us who stood consistently in Wales and were always elected.
</p>




<p><a name="st_191"></a>
<a name="60503-29_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   Yes, eight times, to be precise. I regard it as a proud tradition of Liberal Members of this House.
</p>

<a name="60503-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>Turning to the amendment, we believe that to interpose both Houses of Parliament every time there is some suggestion of devolution is quite wrong. Consequently, we cannot support the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland.
</p>




<p><a name="st_192"></a>
<a name="60503-29_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   In that case, the noble Lord agrees with me that, in effect, the Assembly is making primary legislation.

reference to the Westminster Parliament, the Welsh Assembly measure is effectively primary legislation. Would the noble Lord agree?
</p>




<p><a name="st_193"></a>
<a name="60503-29_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   Shock, horror, I would.
</p>




<p><a name="st_194"></a>
<a name="60503-29_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   But there will have been a previous reference to this place. That is what the Orders in Council process does. The original draft Order in Council bestows on the Assembly the power to go ahead and make the measure. That is the difference between full transfer of primary powers and what this part of the Bill does.
</p>




<p><a name="st_195"></a>
<a name="60503-29_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   There is a big difference between bestowing power on the Welsh Assembly to legislate on a certain matter and the measure that is made under that authority. For example, the measure may exceed the delegated power. Suppose that the Secretary of State for Wales takes the view that the Assembly measure goes way beyond the scope of the Welsh Assembly&#039;s authority. Does he have the power at that stage to turn to the Welsh Assembly and say no or doesn&#039;t he? Suppose that he takes the view that the Welsh Assembly measure exceeds the delegated power and Westminster takes a different view. Surely there would be a benefit in those circumstances in having Westminster vote on what the Welsh Assembly had done before the matter was taken by the Secretary of State to Buckingham Palace.
</p>




<p><a name="st_196"></a>
<a name="60503-29_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I think that all that needs to be said in response to the amendments has already been said by my noble friend Lord Rowlands and the noble Lord, Lord Thomas. It is a strange form of devolution that says that, after due process has been followed through the Orders in Council to devolve power to the Assembly and the Assembly then takes measures within that power, Parliament should have some capacity to approve those measures. That reduces the National Assembly for Wales to a committee of the House. It basically says: &quot;You can recommend or pass what you like, but final authority will remain at Westminster&quot;. Well, that is not devolution, which is what we are debating in the framework of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60503-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>I can understand the Conservatives&#039; reservations about this. They do not like devolution. Perhaps we should say that part of the Conservative Party does not like devolution; other parts of the Conservative Party seem very keen on it. Indeed, some parts of the Conservative Party want devolution for England; they say, &quot;England for the English&quot;, in very strong terms.
</p>

<a name="60503-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>But we are discussing the Bill and the Government&#039;s view of devolution. I am saying to the noble Lord that it is a complete denial of devolution to suggest that, after the Assembly&#151;a democratically elected body with its own direct mandate&#151;has had the approval, won through Orders in Council, to use its discretion in a particular area and then takes measures, Parliament should intervene again.

I am perfectly happy for the Minister&#039;s answer to be that the Secretary of State has no discretion. That is fine. In those circumstances there would be no point in coming to Parliament. However, if the Secretary of State has no discretion, we are not talking about the subordinate process that the Government claim this is, both in the Bill and in the notes.

</p>

<a name="60503-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment refers to subsection (3) in Clause 92. A similar provision to this appears in Section 28(5) of the Scotland Act 1998 and in Section 5(5) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Indeed, it is, in effect, contained in the Bill of Rights.
</p>

<a name="60503-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>The nature of devolution in Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well as the nature of legislation in the Westminster Parliament, is that we make primary law. It is true that the Northern Ireland and Scottish legislatures make primary law within circumscribed circumstances. Nevertheless, within those circumstances they make primary law. Even under Part 3 the Welsh Assembly will not, in law, be making primary law. Therefore, in my submission, this subsection does not belong in the Bill at all. There was no attempt to insert such a provision in 1998, at the time of the first devolution to Wales. The Welsh Assembly remains under this Bill a subordinate body. Therefore, there is no room for Clause 98(3). I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_199"></a>
<a name="60503-29_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   Amendment No. 56 would certainly remove the protection afforded to Assembly measures against legal challenge on grounds of procedure invalidity in the proceedings of the Assembly leading to enactment. The Government do not think that the Assembly should be impeded by legal challenges, some of which might be wholly spurious.
</p>

<a name="60503-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>Article 9 of the Bill of Rights of 1688 provides that there can be no legal challenge to things done in Parliament. That is an absolutely fundamental part of parliamentary privileges and rights. Similar provisions to that in the Bill before us today are included in the Scotland Act and the Northern Ireland Act. The principle is already clearly established in relation to legislation passed by other devolved bodies. The concept of devolution, if it means anything at all, must mean that these bodies have the capacity to pass legislation. They must have legislation passed with the same protections as Parliament has enjoyed over the centuries, because without that they have an inferior <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_552"></a>

form of legal capacity. As we all know, they would be potentially subject to all sorts of challenges on process. It is a cardinal point of parliamentary responsibility. This Parliament has enjoyed it for several hundred years. The Scottish Parliament has enjoyed it since the Scotland Act 1998, and parts of the Northern Ireland Act provide it as far as the Province of Northern Ireland is concerned. We are seeking to extend that to the National Assembly for Wales only within those areas of competence duly and specifically granted by this Parliament. The National Assembly should have the same entitlement to privilege that all other parliamentary assemblies enjoy.

&quot;REFERENDUM ABOUT COMMENCEMENT OF ASSEMBLY MEASURES PROVISIONS

<br>
(1)   Her Majesty may by Order in Council cause a referendum to be held throughout Wales about whether the Assembly Measure provisions should come into force.


<br>
(2)   If the majority of voters in a referendum held by virtue of subsection (1) vote in favour of the Assembly Measure provisions coming into force, the Assembly Measure provisions are to come into force in accordance with section 92.


<br>
(3)   But if they do not, that does not prevent the making of a subsequent Order in Council under subsection (1).


<br>
(4)   No recommendation is to be made to Her Majesty in Council to make an Order in Council under subsection (1) unless a draft of the statutory instrument containing the Order in Council has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament and the Assembly.


<br>
(5)   But subsection (4) is not satisfied unless the resolution of the Assembly is passed on a vote in which the number of Assembly members voting in favour of it is not less than two-thirds of the total number of Assembly seats.


<br>
(6)   A draft of a statutory instrument containing an order in Council under subsection (1) may not be laid before either House of Parliament, or the Assembly, until the Secretary of State has undertaken such consultation as the Secretary of State considers appropriate.


<br>
(7)   For further provision about referendums held by virtue of subsection (1) see Schedule 6.

(8)   In this Act, &quot;The Assembly Measure provisions&quot; means sections 92 to 101.&quot;</p>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 554</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


<a name="stpa_373"></a>The noble Lord said: The argument for a referendum before the Assembly measure provisions in Part 3 come into force is similar to the Government&#039;s argument for a referendum on the commencement of Assembly Act provisions in Part 4. The argument is similar because the effect of implementation of Parts 3 and 4 could be similar over time. This was elicited in Committee and on Report in the other place and has subsequently been clarified in the 17th Report by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. My noble friend Lord Crickhowell was quite right in saying that that report has not been referred to sufficiently, but I shall do so now. I shall quote the statement in paragraph 27, page 5, of that report, to which my noble friend referred earlier. The report says:</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_12"></a><br>
&quot;We draw to the attention of the House the width of the power in Part 3 and that it could, subject to the necessary parliamentary approval, be used to achieve a situation (by filling up the &quot;fields&quot;) which is not really distinguishable from that under Part 4 (for which a referendum is required)&quot;.<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>We recognise that the committee&#039;s judgment is independent of party interest and noble Lords will respect it as totally non-partisan. It highlights the close interrelationship between these two parts of the Bill and the situations that may result from their implementation. I remind your Lordships that they are described by the committee as &quot;not really distinguishable&quot;. Why then should a referendum be required to introduce Part 4 but not Part 3? The short answer is that the Government do not see eye to eye with the committee, or the Opposition, on this issue. They believe that the outcomes of the implementation of the two parts are very distinguishable.
</p>

<a name="60503-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>The Government&#039;s commitment to a referendum goes back to the White Paper <i>Better Governance for Wales</i>, in particular to paragraphs 3.22 and 3.23, on page 25, where it is stated that the enhanced powers described in the preceding paragraphs,
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_13"></a><br>
&quot;would be adaptations of the current settlement and the Government believes that they do not require a referendum&quot;.<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>The enhanced powers include those available under Part 3. The White Paper goes on to say that if further transfers of primary legislative powers over all devolved fields are required:
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_14"></a><br>
&quot;The Government is clear that this would represent a fundamental change to the Welsh settlement and would have to be endorsed in a referendum&quot;.<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>I do not query that referendum conclusion. I believe the Liberal Democrats do. They are not in favour of referendums.
<a name="time_25"></a>
<a name="60503-30_time0"></a><h5>9.30 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60503-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>Let us be clear that what we are talking about here is the quantitative rather than the qualitative difference between the outcomes of Part 3 and Part 4. It is not a fundamental change at all, but an incremental one. That is a description that the Government use from time to time. The noble Lord, Lord Davies, used the word &quot;incremental&quot; earlier in our proceedings today. The very meaning of &quot;incremental&quot; is quantitative, not qualitative. If a referendum under Part 4 produced an affirmative result and the provisions came into force, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_555"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 555</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

one of the immediate consequences would be that Part 3 would cease to have effect, as the Explanatory Notes and Clause 105 make absolutely clear.
</p>

<a name="60503-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>In short, Part 3 would be submersed&#151;not subsumed but submersed&#151;by Part 4. The line between Part 3 and Part 4&#151;where a referendum is not required and where a referendum is necessary&#151;is a very fine one, and it is not easy to detect on the slippery slope from a little primary legislative power in a corner of a devolved field to full primary legislative power all over the devolved fields in their entirety.
</p>

<a name="60503-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>The implementation of Part 4 is by far the more satisfactory from a democratic point of view, as my noble friend Lord Kingsland emphasised earlier, because it would represent the will of the Welsh electorate as expressed in a much-needed referendum. The interim Part 3 position is totally unsatisfactory, because it leaves the legislative competence of the Assembly to be defined by Orders in Council, which are ultimately controlled by the Secretary of State. That is an autocratic, not a democratic, solution. The incremental process of increasing the Assembly&#039;s competence requires the endorsement of the electorate in a referendum just as much as, if not more than, the ultimate goal of full primary legislative power in the devolved fields. That is why we are calling for a referendum before the process begins and before Part 3 is implemented, rather than Part 4. A referendum at the Part 4 stage would be rather late in the day; possibly it would take place more than a decade hence. It would be long after the horse had bolted from the grip of the Welsh electorate.
</p>

<a name="60503-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>Our new clause is a replica of the Government&#039;s Clause 102 and must therefore be beyond ministerial criticism. If carried, of course, there would need to be some consequential changes to Schedule 6, which could be introduced at a later stage. I hope that the Minister will not press me on what the question for a referendum should be, because the Government have already thought about that, and they have got their question ready for the implementation of a referendum under Part 4. The same mechanism would apply to a referendum under Part 3. I beg to move.

<a name="60503-31_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, fails to understand the fundamental distinction between Part 3 and Part 4. Part 4 would give primary powers to the Welsh Assembly, and neither this House nor the other place would thereafter have any responsibility or control over legislation&#151;except the one catch-all provision that Parliament always remains sovereign. That is as true of the Scotland Act as it would be of a new Wales Act. Part 3 does not do that. It still leaves the fundamental power to decide whether the Assembly can further enhance its legislative competence with Orders in Council. Those Orders in Council must be approved or otherwise by both Houses. That is a fundamental distinction between those two positions, and therefore between Part 3 and Part 4.
</p>

<a name="60503-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>This also, in my view, distinguishes the question of whether there should be a referendum. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, then ducks the basic question. It <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_556"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 556</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is very easy to devise the question under Part 4 because it would be a simple proposition: do the Welsh public wish the Assembly to have primary legislative powers? It would be very clearly understood. The question that would have to be put in a Part 3 referendum would be: do the Welsh public support the Assembly measure provisions in Clauses 92 to 101 of the Bill? Presumably, in order for there to be a referendum, these nine clauses would have to be printed and circulated to every member of the Welsh public in order for them to decide if they wanted Orders in Council; if they wanted the proceeding then to go to Assembly measures; and if they wanted the reserve powers of the Secretary of State contained between Clauses 92 and 101. I have a profound belief in the maturity and intelligence of the Welsh electorate; after all, it elected me for many years. However, I have grappled with Clauses 92 to 101. Can you imagine the discussion around the breakfast table about whether to vote, and whether to support Clauses 92 to 101? It makes a nonsense of the idea of a referendum on Part 3. It is unnecessary because there is a clear distinction between Part 3 and Part 4. It is also not the kind of material that makes for a sensible referendum.

The noble Lord cannot get away from how one would handle a referendum dealing with nine complicated clauses, which even some of us are grappling with, and then ask the poor Welsh electorate to try to determine it. There is a clear distinction between Part 3 and Part 4. I believe it is for us to grapple with Clauses 92 to 101 and, ultimately, for the electorate to decide, at some point in the future, whether they wish to proceed to Part 4.

<a name="60503-31_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   I have listened to the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, making very persuasive speeches for more than 30 years. I do not think I have ever heard him make a less persuasive one than that. The noble Lord gave the whole game away in his opening remarks. The real reason the Government do not want to move on to Part 4 and prefer this more obscure way of proceeding is that the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, and many of his friends in the other place are all too aware of the consequences of that move as regards the role of Welsh Members of Parliament. The likelihood is that there would be a reduction not only in the role of Welsh Members of Parliament, but in their number. We all know that there are Members in the other place who are very concerned about that. It was because <br>&nbsp;<br>

there was no unity on this issue that the Government have suddenly devised this complex and obscure route forward. That is the whole reason why we are going down this rather absurd route.
</p>

<a name="60503-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>The noble Lord put forward an Aunt Sally and then tried to destroy it. He put up a wholly fallacious argument about setting out in great detail the clauses of the Bill in a referendum and the inability to explain it to the electorate of Wales. One only has to turn to two remarks made about the matter by very distinguished Members of both Houses to see how easy it would be to get a perfectly simple question that one could put to the electorate of Wales. The first remark was made by the right honourable Alan Williams, the Father of the House of Commons, when he pointed out that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_88"></a>&quot;the Bill as drafted . . . provides for a succession of orders, [and] the full legislative objective could be achieved without a referendum&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>He went on to say,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_89"></a>&quot;It is a form of creeping devolution&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 9/1/06; col. 53.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>Then, in the Welsh Affairs Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Richard&#151;unusually for him he is not in his place, but that is not perhaps surprising at this late hour&#151;pointed out very clearly that we are dealing with,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_90"></a>&quot;a device to avoid having to come to Westminster to ask for primary powers to be formally devolved. It is quite an interesting device . . . Westminster can say they have not devolved primary legislative powers, but depending on the way in which the Order in Council procedure is used, it could in effect be a concealed grant of almost a direct legislative competence down to Cardiff&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>Once one brings those two things together, all one really has to do is to say, &quot;Look, we propose to extend primary legislative powers&quot;&#151;that is what they are, as my noble friend Lord Kingsland has established very clearly&#151;&quot;to the Welsh Assembly, step by step and bit by bit. We are reluctant to do it all in one great step, but we think that you should have the opportunity to choose whether you want those legislative powers conveyed in the step-by-step process or whether you want to wait until the whole process is complete and the powers have been transferred in totality so that nothing can be reversed again. Then we are prepared to go through the farce, the charade of having a referendum to decide whether you go on to what we have already given you&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60503-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>I think that is profoundly insulting to the people in Wales. It is an absurd proposition that it is not possible to get agreement on a form of wording that one could fairly put to the people of Wales and that the people of Wales could perfectly understand. What is more, one of the features of a referendum campaign&#151;we have all taken part in them&#151;is that the parties are able to explain in detail exactly what the problem is and put the case, something that was never done when the clause was slipped in on the back of the manifesto. I do not believe many Labour candidates went round their constituencies saying, &quot;I draw your attention to the wording that we have put into our manifesto about what we are going to do in the next Parliament to <br>&nbsp;<br>

extend the powers of the Welsh Assembly&quot;, nor do I believe they attempted to explain them. They did not elaborate in any way. Indeed, as my noble friend Lord Kingsland pointed out earlier, they had not actually devised this obscure way of doing it when they went to the electorate.
</p>

<a name="60503-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>We are being led up the garden path. I think the people of Wales are being misled. I want the people of Wales to have the choice. If they want to go further, I think they should be allowed to. I think that the proper way to proceed now is to ask them whether they want full legislative powers, and get on and do it, sooner rather than later. I do not think they should wait 10 or 11 years and I do not think the then Secretary of State, whoever it may be&#151;I cannot imagine for one moment that it will be the present Secretary of State, and I hope it will not be&#151;should have the power to take that decision. I think the Welsh Assembly, by a simple majority, should be able to ask for a vote on Part 4. When we get to it, I shall move an amendment in due course. At this stage, however, we ought to have a referendum on Part 3, and not fudge the issue or try to obscure the reality of the situation from the people of Wales.

I do not think it is an answer to my point, to say &quot;Well, if they want it, we&#039;ll accept it&quot;. What we want to know from the Front Bench of the Conservative Party is whether they will campaign for it. If all the political parties in Wales campaign for Part 4 now&#151;because we all see the logic of it&#151;then we can get rid of Part 3 straight away.
</p>

<a name="60503-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>Let us think for moment about what the problem is. Why do the Welsh Assembly Government seek to extend their powers? Because every year since they were formed, they put in a bid for five or six Bills which they obviously think necessary to carry out their policy. That is so whether it is a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, or Labour in government on their own. Each year, they have been allowed one or two Bills to go through both Houses of Parliament. That is the problem. Part 3 is, or should be, a short-term <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 559</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

solution to that problem, by making it unnecessary for the Welsh Government to come to Westminster and bid for parliamentary time for a full Bill. We have, in fact, put forward some excellent legislation: the Children&#039;s Commissioner, the Commissioner for Older People, the Transport Bill and so on. They have been effective measures.
</p>




<p><a name="st_214"></a>
<a name="60503-32_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   Will the noble Lord allow me to remind him of the Commissioner for Older People (Wales) Bill? We had the Second Reading shortly after the election and had to wait for around 18 weeks for a Committee stage. We were ready: there was no problem with the legislation here, but there was elsewhere.
</p>




<p><a name="st_215"></a>
<a name="60503-32_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   Yes, there are problems with the parliamentary timetable. The noble Lord makes my point. That was only one of two Bills which got into the legislative programme for that year. That is not satisfactory. For the Assembly to prove its worth, it must have the tools to carry out its policies. It looks at various issues very carefully through the committee system, which we have all approved of, and brings forward sensible measures, some of which get through, and some of which do not. This is a way immediately to give the Assembly a chance to prove itself. The more it proves itself, the greater are the chances of a referendum to bring in Part 4 being successful. The quicker that happens, the more chances there will be.
</p>

<a name="60503-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>While the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, is asking for a referendum about commencement of Assembly measures provisions, it is just too early. It does not solve the problem that we face. The Assembly measures provisions will bring about a form of primary legislation&#151;I have already conceded that to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&#151;but that is a step in the right direction. Let us welcome it together and build in the next five years towards bringing in Part 4. I have criticisms of the mechanisms which I shall pursue in later amendments. I hope that your Lordships will hear about them in due course. For the moment, I regret that we cannot support this amendment.

<p><a name="st_216"></a>
<a name="60503-32_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   There is a certain air of d&#233;j&#224; vu about this debate because we rehearsed most of these arguments when we discussed Amendment No. 54. I certainly do not have a great deal to add to the response that I gave at that stage, particularly as anything that I would have sought to present at the Dispatch Box has already been delivered by my noble friend Lord Rowlands, who indicated the difference between Part 3 and Part 4. I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, said about where a referendum could fit in, but, unfortunately, this amendment tells us exactly where this referendum is meant to fit in. Subsection (2) of the new clause makes it quite clear that the referendum is about Part 3 and the Assembly measures.
</p>

<a name="60503-32_para2"></a>

debate the information that I somewhat churlishly introduced when we discussed Amendment No. 54; namely, that the opposition Front Bench in the other place had had a shot at it. Let us give them their due. They wanted a question on Part 3; they wanted a referendum, so they had a shot at it. We all know the reputation of the shadow Attorney-General. We all admire a great deal of the work which he does and will continue to do in opposition. He triedby asking whether,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_91"></a>&quot;do people wish to be governed by Order in Council moderated in its detail by the Welsh Assembly&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 9/1/06; col. 119.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>That was a good, honest try, but it was absolute rubbish in terms of anybody being able to run a referendum on such a proposition. Here rests the difficulty, which is at the heart of this amendment. At its heart is a requirement for the people of Wales to reach in a referendum a judgment on this part of the Bill. We will get to Part 4 in due course, and I have no doubt that the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, will be as eloquent then as he has been today, but his eloquence is misplaced in the context of this amendment, which requires a referendum which none of us could possibly conceive as being a realistic proposition to put before the Welsh people. I hope that the noble Lord will recognise that the amendment needs to be withdrawn on that basis.

<a name="60503-32_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Norton of Louth: </b>   Is the Minister saying that one could not draft a simple referendum question, or is he saying that the Welsh people could not understand the basic provisions of Part 3?

<p><a name="st_218"></a>
<a name="60503-32_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   We all ought to consider very carefully the questions that are advanced in referendums&#151;noble Lords have had great experience of this. After all, I imagine that Conservative Party&#039;s opposition in recent years has been expressed in terms of referendums which have been carried out other than by democratic bodies and by state authorities which have used referendums by devising questions which rig the result. The nature of the question is crucial for the response. The referendum has to be fair. That is why we invest in the Electoral Commission a great deal of responsibility and why we recognise that to put a referendum before people is a very serious issue. If the noble Lord wishes to advance the cause of his own side rather than simply to put probing questions to me&#151;after all, it is its amendment that I imagine he is here to defend&#151;he could perhaps identify the nature of the question which could be asked under this amendment, which would make sense to the Welsh people, which would get past the Electoral Commission in terms of fairness, and on which a referendum could be launched.
</p>

<a name="60503-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>We do not think that that can be done because the powers that will have been advanced under Part 3 could not be readily and easily put into a package that makes sense to the Welsh people until a considerable amount of devolution had occurred.

great assistance to it. It has not produced convincing arguments thus far and that is why I am resisting the amendment.

<a name="60503-32_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Norton of Louth: </b>   Surely it is fairly simple and one can come up with straightforward wording. I have just jotted one down now. It is simple to ask the Welsh people whether they want to &quot;bring into effect the law-making powers under Part 3 of the Act&quot;. It is then a separate exercise to explain what those powers are, which is the Government&#039;s responsibility.

<a name="60503-32_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   We can all play games with this at this stage. The noble Lord&#039;s approach is rather more populist than the more sophisticated one of the noble Lord, Lord Norton. It seems to the Government that it is exceedingly difficult to identify with clarity the nature and basis of the referendum. It is for the Opposition to prove their case because their amendment contains this requirement. The Government&#039;s position is that the amendment should be withdrawn because the case is not established.
</p>




<p><a name="st_222"></a>
<a name="60503-32_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   I am absolutely astonished by the debate that we have just had and by the camouflage thrown up by all this discussion of the actual question. Noble Lords have forgotten that I said in moving this amendment that it was drawn verbatim from Clause 102, which provides for a referendum on the introduction of Part 4. There is exactly the same number of subsections in my amendment&#151;eight in all&#151;as there are in Clause 102. Further to what the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, said about the detail that I provided by numbering the subsections, I draw his attention to Clause 102(8), which gives the sections that are meant by &quot;the Assembly Act provisions&quot; referred to in that clause.
</p>

<a name="60503-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>There is avoidance of the key issue of whether there should be a referendum. That is what should lie at the heart of our debate. But everybody seeks to avoid that issue of principle. The Government accept that there must be a referendum for the implementation of Part 4. So what is so ridiculous about the proposal for a referendum on the introduction of Part 3, which, in principle, provides the Assembly with primary <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_562"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column 562</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

legislative powers? It is only a matter of how much primary legislative power is given to the Assembly in Part 3 and the full power in Part 4. That is what we are talking about.
</p>

<a name="60503-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>My noble friend Lord Crickhowell explained the political background&#151;we had hints about it&#151;to Part 3, which is, let us face it, a device. That word has been used by Members opposite. I agree with my noble friend that the people of Wales are being seriously misled. That is why we feel so strongly that there should be a referendum so that they can have their say. We know that the Secretary of State believes that he would not win a referendum. But that is a matter of opinion. The fact of the matter is that it is our belief and, indeed, the Government&#039;s belief that before full primary legislative powers are granted to the Assembly there should be an approval by a referendum. We believe further that it would be unwise to embark on that process, as we are doing in Part 3, without a referendum.
</p>

<a name="60503-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>I go back to our previous debate and remind the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, that the amendments moved by my noble friend Lord Kingsland at the beginning of our discussion on Part 3 were intended to eliminate the whole of Part 3; in which case there would be no call for a referendum for the implementation of that part of the Bill and we would move directly to Part 4. The noble Lord will have taken note that while we objected to every clause standing part in Part 3, we have no such similar objections to Part 4. That is the ultimate proof that we accept the basic tenets of Part 4. It is still very much our view that should we get rid of Part 3 and then embrace Part 4. That, as my noble friend Lord Crickhowell said, has been made abundantly clear in the other place as well.

</p>

<a name="60503-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_1"></a>Amendment No. 61 is intended to improve the consistency between regulated activity relating to children and regulated activity relating to vulnerable adults. As the Bill is currently drafted, an individual on the vulnerable adults&#039; barred list would not be able to be an inspector of healthcare settings, while a person on the children&#039;s barred list would be able to be an inspector. This anomaly is corrected by the amendment.

<a name="60503-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_2"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 65. Where a person is self-employed and they are principally training, supervising children or otherwise engaged in an activity providing close contact with a child under the age of 16 in the course of that child&#039;s employment, they will be covered by the provisions of the scheme.

No. 66 makes it clear that the bar applies and the requirement to check applies to all individuals who have frequent opportunities for contact or who engage in close contact with children in key children&#039;s settings, including all providers of nursery education, whether or not they are required to register under the Childcare Bill.
</p>

<a name="60503-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_3"></a>Amendment No. 172 is intended to ensure that the definition of educational institutions includes those providers of initial teacher training courses that may not otherwise be educational institutions in the ordinary sense of the term. Amendment No. 173 rectifies a drafting error in Clause 44. The current definition of &quot;personnel supplier&quot; makes reference to &quot;B&quot; when there is in fact no previous definition of &quot;B&quot;. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that those educational institutions that supply individuals with the purpose of enabling them to experience regulated activity, such as supplying trainee teachers to schools, should be covered by the definition of &quot;personnel suppliers&quot; in the Bill.

&quot;(f) any service provided wholly or mainly for vulnerable adults and paid for directly under section 57 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 (c. 15) (direct payments)&quot;

<p><a name="gc_st_6"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment, along with Amendment No. 75 tabled in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Laming and Lord Harris, deals with the issue of direct payments where potential employees are eligible for disclosure but not the bar. This amendment adds the provision of direct payments into the list of regulated activity relating to vulnerable adults. Under the Bill, recipients of direct payments are not classified as regulated activity providers and therefore do not have to check people providing services to them. There may be unsuitable people who might move into providing direct payment <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC225"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC225</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

services because the likelihood is that they may not be checked, and in doing so, creating an ideal unsupervised opportunity to abuse vulnerable people.
</p>

<a name="60503-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_10"></a>People receiving direct payments must be fully aware of the vetting and barring process, with support if necessary, and offered appropriate protection against unsuitable people providing services to them in their own home under the new scheme. Alternatively, there could be an opt-out check, where direct payment recipients would have to make an active decision not to check providers of services.
</p>

<a name="60503-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_11"></a>As the Committee knows, people with learning disabilities who have limited capacity to manage their own affairs can receive direct payments with assistance from a family member or an agent. However, a separate bank account must be used, and if the person concerned does not have the capacity to understand what the account is for, it must be a trustee account. However, in that situation, the agent or trustee is making decisions about risk on behalf of the vulnerable adult. In view of that, we suggest that the bar should extend to employees of people who use a trustee account for their direct payments. Agents have a duty to ensure that services are purchased that promote the service user&#039;s well-being and independence. The well-being of vulnerable people is not at all promoted by their receiving care from unregulated social care workers.
</p>

<a name="60503-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_12"></a>The simplest way to achieve that is to add recipients of direct payments to the list of regulated activities. I believe that that would also cover agents or trustees. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_7"></a>
<a name="60503-33_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Laming: </b>   I rise to speak to Amendment No. 75. As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, this amendment also concerns the scope of the bar. Under the Bill, all posts in schools and in registered care homes would be covered by the bar. Ancillary posts in other care and health settings would not. It would not be feasible to make the bar apply to all posts in all services used by vulnerable adults, because the definition of &quot;vulnerable&quot; in the Bill is drawn so widely. It includes everyone who is receiving healthcare, which is pretty much the whole population at some point in their lives.
</p>

<a name="60503-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_13"></a>However, some services are wholly or primarily used by people who are disabled or who have impaired mental capacity. Those people should be afforded greater protection than is currently offered by the Bill. By using the definition in the National Assistance Acts, which relates to physical and learning disabilities, that can be achieved without making the scope of the bar wider than would be proportionate.
</p>

<a name="60503-33_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_14"></a>The effect of the amendment would be that all posts in settings such as day services for vulnerable adults would be subject to the bar, without making it apply to posts such as dentists&#039; receptionists or a clerical worker in the social services department, which would clearly be disproportionate. A day centre worker is in a very different position from that of a dentist&#039;s receptionist. The latter has, in most cases, very irregular contact with the vulnerable person, whereas <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC226"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC226</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in a day centre relationships are established for good or ill&#151;in many instances, those relationships are very important. Therefore, staff in day centres should be covered by the bar. The amendment recognises that and is aimed at protecting potentially vulnerable people from danger. I therefore hope that it will be accepted.

<p><a name="gc_st_8"></a>
<a name="60503-34_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Buscombe: </b>   I have considerable sympathy for the amendments. I must confess that I have not looked at their drafting in detail but, after hearing what the Members of the Committee who have spoken in this debate have already said about their principle, I very much look forward to hearing the Minister&#039;s response.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_9"></a>
<a name="60503-34_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   We have intentionally sought to make the definition of regulated activity wide to provide protection for the greatest number, including those employed under direct payment and all those working in community care services who have close personal contact with vulnerable adults. We are especially keen to ensure that adults receiving direct payments are protected under the new scheme, and the Bill will ensure that that happens. For the first time ever, direct payment recipients will have access to the same vetting and barring scheme as other members of the vulnerable adults&#039; workforce and will have the option of vetting their staff, should they so wish.
</p>

<a name="60503-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_15"></a>In response to the amendments tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Sharp, it is clear in the definition of a vulnerable adult in Clause 43 that direct payment recipients are covered by the Bill. The definition of regulated activity has been drawn widely and will include those providing services to direct payment recipients. We are confident that the activities described in paragraph 5(1) of Schedule 2 are wide enough to cover all the activities that a direct payment recipient may employ someone to do. For flexibility, however, we have the power to add to that definition should service delivery dramatically change in the future. Anyone who is barred will be committing an offence if they work for a direct payments recipient. That means they will not be able to care for, advise, guide, teach, treat or give assistance to a direct payments recipient.
</p>

<a name="60503-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_16"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, the purpose of direct payments is to put individuals in control of the care and support they receive. It is therefore right that they should decide whether or not to make a check, and we will support them in that decision. We have had a very strong steer following consultations on our Green Paper, <i>Independence, Well-Being and Choice</i>, that adults want to manage their own risk. Through guidance, and the direct payment support services that exist in most councils, we will help them to make an informed choice.
</p>

<a name="60503-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_17"></a>We must, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, pointed out so eloquently yesterday, be mindful of basic human rights principles and proportionality. Balance and proportionality are key to this Bill. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Laming, I do not believe that it would be proportionate to require all <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC227"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC227</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

individuals who come into contact with vulnerable adults to go through the vetting and barring process; indeed, he recognised that. Neither would it be proportionate for individuals on the barred list to be prevented from working in all jobs that bring them into contact with vulnerable adults. For example, a cleaner in a daycare centre may work under supervision and have minimal contact with vulnerable adults, and it would not be proportionate to prevent some people on the barred list from undertaking that role.
</p>

<a name="60503-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_18"></a>It is important that the scope of the bar is proportionate to the potential risk presented. We have sought to provide the greatest levels of protection where we know the incidence of abuse is greatest. Therefore we have provided for care homes, which are establishments where vulnerable adults are always present, to have the highest level of protection. Vetting and barring checks will be mandatory for all individuals working in care homes, whatever their role.
</p>

<a name="60503-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_19"></a>We do not think the same arguments apply to daycare, for example, which covers a wide range of services provided to older and disabled people. It can be provided in a variety of ways by the local council, a voluntary sector organisation or by a local religious organisation. Very often daycare is provided in a community setting where a range of other activities take place. However, I emphasise that those who undertake a caring or supporting role in community care settings, including daycare services, will be covered by the bar. As the noble Lord recognised, it would not be proportionate to bar a receptionist in a community setting because a daycare group meets there once a week, but we have provided in Clause 19 for those posts to be covered by controlled activity.
</p>

<a name="60503-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_20"></a>We will issue guidance to try to ensure that employers in all care settings make checks on those staff who are not undertaking regulated activity but who have opportunity for contact with a vulnerable adult or access to their personal information. An employer will be under a duty to have regard to such guidance, issued under Clause 20, in relation to the steps they should take when employing individuals to engage in a controlled activity. That will include checking barred status and conditions that should be met if the employer decides to employ an individual who is barred.
</p>

<a name="60503-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_21"></a>I believe the Bill provides the right balance between protecting vulnerable adults and placing unnecessary burdens on the workforce. We have to ensure that the regulatory burden is not so great that people are unable to get the services they need. We have ensured that those sectors where the highest levels of abuse occur are provided for within the definition of a regulated activity. I would therefore ask noble Lords to withdraw their amendments.

</p>

<a name="60503-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_22"></a>I thoroughly agree that a cleaner in a day centre should not be covered by the bar, because in most instances it is likely that the cleaning will take place when the day centre is not in operation; so there would be minimum contact between the day centre users and the cleaner. However, one of the most difficult situations that I faced when I was a director of social services&#151;and I hope that noble Lords will excuse a personal example&#151;was when a member of staff &quot;groomed&quot; a user of the day centre who had severe learning disabilities and, over a period, arranged to meet that young woman outside the day centre and took advantage of her in a way that I thought was intolerable.
</p>

<a name="60503-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_23"></a>I am in no doubt, and I hope that further consideration might be given to this, that the relationship between day centre staff and users can become very close. For the most part, that closeness is positive, encouraging, instils confidence in the users, helps people develop their potential&#151;however limited that may be&#151;and is a source of great reassurance in their lives. But we need to recognise that such people are vulnerable and they can be with a day centre worker for hours, sometimes alone with them, if they are pursuing certain activities. Most day centre workers that I have encountered are wholly honourable, but I hope that the Bill would extend to people who will abuse their position because they can cause such terrible suffering to people who already have enough to cope with in life.

&quot;(   )   Regulated activity providers will not be subject to new or additional financial or resource burdens in order to meet their duties under this Act.&quot;

<p><a name="gc_st_18"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment has come to me from the Local Government Association and has been tabled in the light of recent debates in both Houses on the state of local finances. Local authority budgets are under increasing pressure, and the pressure on councils to charge higher and higher taxes is rising. Council tax itself has risen by 84 per cent since 1997, yet we are continually placing extra burdens on our local authorities. There are some projects which cannot be compromised and I would argue that this project is one of them.
</p>

<a name="60503-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_29"></a>Although it is vital that robust arrangements are put in place for safeguarding children and vulnerable adults, it should be achievable within existing resources.

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_19"></a>
<a name="60503-35_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving me the opportunity to say a little more about the costs to employers of these new arrangements. I draw the Committee&#039;s attention to the regulatory impact assessment and, in particular, to paragraphs 82 to 85 and the table following paragraph 82 which sets out in detail the cost areas, the estimates of the cost and the principles of who might pay. I think it deals with a number of the concerns raised by the Local Government Association.
</p>

<a name="60503-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_30"></a>I say at once that we accept there will obviously be some additional costs for employers and employees as a result of the increased requirements to secure IBB checks, simply by virtue of the increased size of the workforce that will be covered by the new arrangements as a matter of public policy. At the moment, about 6.5 million people are covered by the existing enhanced disclosure requirements; we think that figure will rise to between 7.5 million and 9 million under the provisions of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60503-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_31"></a>However, for some employers there will be a lesser financial requirement than there is now because of the ability in some areas for employers to take advantage <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC230"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC230</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of online checks&#151;for which no charge applies&#151;which they are not able to do at the moment. Additionally, there will be a benefit to all employers from the new continuous updating regime brought about by the Bill. Under continuous updating, once an individual has become subject to monitoring by the scheme, the IBB will be able, if necessary, to add a person to a barred list based on the most recent criminal records, police information and information referred by employers and others. The current employer, where feasible, will be notified of any changes to an employee&#039;s barred status, and employers who refer information to the scheme will be informed of the outcome of the referral.
</p>

<a name="60503-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_32"></a>As I say, these costs and benefits are set out in paragraphs 82 to 84 of the regulatory impact assessment. Paragraph 82 sets out the monetary costs, highlighting the Government&#039;s commitment to fund all the start-up costs of the scheme but accepting that there will be a review of the current &#163;34 CRB disclosure fee when the new scheme is introduced in 2008.
</p>

<a name="60503-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_33"></a>Paragraph 83 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_8"></a>&quot;In terms of impact on the workforce it is important to highlight the significant net benefits that will flow to employers (largely in the public sector) from the change to a continuously updated system that will reduce the need for repeat CRB disclosures and speed up the recruitment process through instant access to the barred list. This could bring savings not only to individual employers but to the sectors as a whole&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_34"></a>Paragraph 85 states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_9"></a>&quot;there will be an unquantifiable social benefit due to the reduced incidence of abuse of children and vulnerable adults and associated negative social consequences&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_35"></a>I developed that point more fully at Second Reading.
</p>

<a name="60503-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_36"></a>Lest anyone think that these social benefits are small, paragraph 87 of the regulatory impact assessment states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_10"></a>&quot;Independent research carried out by MORI for the CRB estimates that in 2004 around 20,000 people were refused employment on the basis of information on the Enhanced Disclosure&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_37"></a>So we are talking about a significant number of decisions taken by employers as a result of the existing CRB disclosure system. We expect that information to be much fuller and more widely available when the new IBB regime comes into play.
</p>

<a name="60503-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_38"></a>I should stress, however, that the additional costs of central administration and the costs of the IBB and the CRB are not being imposed on employers. The current CRB fee&#151;which will need to be increased&#151;is payable by the individual applicant, not the employer. We fully accept that employers not infrequently pay the fee on behalf of their employees. If an employer considers this to be necessary as part of a recruitment strategy, we would not wish to stand in the way. As I said earlier, I accept that in some cases there will therefore be, in practice, an additional burden on employers. But there is no centrally imposed requirement on employers to meet the application fee; that is rightly a matter for the individual employer&#039;s discretion.
</p>

<a name="60503-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_39"></a>I hope I have reassured the noble Baroness that the burdens we are imposing are reasonable in the circumstances and well worth the additional security <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60503-35_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_44"></a>I turn to my last amendment, Amendment No. 110, which is an addition to the end of Clause 16. It provides that if an offence is committed under Clauses 9, 10 or 11 then directors or similar officers of the organisation as well as the organisation itself will have committed the offence. The amendment deals with corporate responsibility and individual responsibility. I think that it is important for those whom we are really addressing&#151;the most vulnerable in our society. I beg to move.

<a name="60503-36_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, raises a number of very important issues. I am sorry; I see that the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, has an amendment in this group. She should speak first.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_26"></a>
<a name="60503-36_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Buscombe: </b>   That is all right; you go first.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_27"></a>
<a name="60503-36_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I am grateful. I blame my cold&#151;I was not quite on my toes.
</p>

<a name="60503-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_45"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, makes some important points. If, as the Minister said to me earlier, people making direct payments are perfectly entitled to make the checks online or by whatever other means, it is terribly important that there is a duty to make sure they are informed that they can do it, how they can do it, and that they are given assistance to do it if appropriate. A duty on the local authority to do that might be considered.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_28"></a>
<a name="60503-36_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Laming: </b>   I wish to speak to Amendment No. 79, which would remove the words &quot;or vulnerable adult&quot;. It would have the effect of making checks against the barred list mandatory where someone is commissioning regulated activity which is for the benefit of a vulnerable adult other than himself or herself. Typically this situation arises where a friend or family member is helping someone who lacks the capacity to manage their own affairs unaided. This amendment, in our view, is not only to protect the vulnerable person; it also provides reassurance to the member of the family or friend who is commissioning the work on behalf of someone else.
</p>

<a name="60503-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_46"></a>In the Bill as drafted, someone who hires personal assistants or other staff to work directly with a disabled person, whether using direct payments or other funding, will not have to obtain Criminal Records Bureau checks or checks against the barred list on potential employees, although they will be able to take them up if they choose. The amendment will not affect the situation of a disabled person hiring their own staff. Where a person has the capacity to understand what the checks are, they will be free to make their own decision about whether they wish to obtain them. However, where a vulnerable adult lacks the capacity to make such a decision, the situation is entirely different.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC233"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC233</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60503-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_47"></a>The rationale for the amendment is that there should be a greater duty of care on someone who is not personally affected by the decision they are making. In these circumstances the friend or family member who is assisting the vulnerable adult would need to be redefined as a regulated activity provider in order for the checks against the barred list to be mandatory. We recognise that that places additional burdens on friends and family members who are assisting vulnerable adults, but in our view that additional burden is worthwhile because it provides them with the assurance they need to ensure that the vulnerable person is not made more vulnerable by the commissioning process. However, such people are already under a duty to take reasonable steps to promote the welfare of the person they are assisting. By clarifying the checks&#151;and both the CRB checks and the checks against the barred list should be made on potential staff carrying out regulated activity&#151;the welfare of vulnerable adults in these circumstances is being promoted. We believe that this is consistent with the principles of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60503-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_48"></a>I am sure that the Committee will realise that in many instances the person who is going into a home to assist a vulnerable adult has unsupervised access to the whole home and very often to the vulnerable person&#039;s personal circumstances and financial arrangements including collecting pensions and the like. We believe that this minimum vetting is essential if we are to protect those who cannot organise their own care unaided.

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_29"></a>
<a name="60503-36_spnew4"></a><b>  Baroness Buscombe: </b>   I wish to speak to Amendment No. 107. Clause 14 provides a list of activities that are exempt from the requirement to make a monitoring check and we will later debate what those specific activities should be. But the principle is the same for both points: that while the scheme will provide stringent protection for some vulnerable adults, other vulnerable people will be wide open to abuse. Other noble Lords have touched on that already. Given the need to make checks in the more protected activities, it is reasonable to suggest that those who would commit abuse would be drawn to those less-protected areas. We are very aware that the sort of people we are talking about can be extremely canny. Amendment No. 107 addresses one such area. More often than not, activities carried out under direct payment schemes occur in people&#039;s homes, where they should feel the most protected.
</p>

<a name="60503-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_49"></a>The amendment would remove direct payment recipients from Clause 14. It would become a mandatory requirement for those recipients to check the people who provide direct payment services to them, fulfilling roles as both employer and recipient. They would then receive the same treatment as any other vulnerable adult in other care or educational situations. The Ann Craft Trust is concerned over this issue of direct payments. It states:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC234"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC234</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_12"></a>&quot;We are concerned that there may be unsuitable people who may gravitate towards providing direct payment services because the likelihood is that they will not be checked, and in doing so are creating an ideal, unsupervised opportunity to abuse vulnerable adults&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_50"></a>The trust goes on to state the importance of raising awareness of the vetting and barring process and the need to provide support and help in implementing the process.
</p>

<a name="60503-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_51"></a>It is worth mentioning that the amendment goes some way, but not all the way, towards Amendment No. 73 tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, on direct payments. However, rather than requiring checks on all those who receive direct payment whose jobs lead them to minimal contact with adults, my amendment would address the core group of those who work for individuals under a direct payment scheme providing services with regular contact. It does not seem right that those receiving care in their own homes should be more at risk than those in protected institutions. So I hope that the Minister will think carefully and most positively about my Amendment No. 107.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_30"></a>
<a name="60503-36_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   Crucial to this debate is the fact that direct payments are about putting individuals in control of the care and support they receive. In respect of Amendment No. 107, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, while we wish to make checks available to individuals in receipt of a direct payment, we do not wish to enforce mandatory checking where it may not be appropriate to do so. This is particularly true in cases where a direct payments recipient may wish to employ a family member or friend. Consultation with stakeholders has given us a strong message that making checks mandatory in these cases would constitute an unnecessary and offensive intrusion into private life and that direct payments recipients want to retain the decision about whether or not to make a check. Amendment No. 107 seeks to remove the exemption for direct payments recipients. We believe that the decision on whether to vet staff should be taken by the individual. They will decide whether to make a check, and we will support them in that decision.
</p>

<a name="60503-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_52"></a>Amendment No. 79, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Laming, also refers to direct payments recipients who may wish to employ a family member or friend; we believe that checks would be intrusive in those circumstances. It is for that reason that we are resisting Amendment No. 79 which seeks to bring family members and friends who make private arrangements for vulnerable adults within the definition of a regulated activity provider.
</p>

<a name="60503-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_53"></a>The amendment would mean that when a family member or friend acts as an agent for a vulnerable adult and makes arrangements to receive a direct payment on their behalf, they would also be responsible for ensuring that staff employed under the direct payment scheme were subject to central vetting requirements. That would also apply to private arrangements&#151;for example, where an individual employed a care worker to look after his mother. We do not wish to impose central vetting requirements on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC235"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC235</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

such people or risk criminalising them where they fail to engage with the scheme. Instead, we prefer to offer them the flexibility of having the option of accessing the scheme, should they wish to do so.
</p>

<a name="60503-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_54"></a>Where individuals need support to make their own decisions, of course they must be offered the highest levels of protection. However, we must balance that with respect for family life. We remain clear that the Government should not impose requirements that will prove burdensome and intrusive to family members or friends who are caring for loved ones&#151;I refer to the 5.2 million carers who are doing such a brilliant job. It is also important that we trust those closest to vulnerable adults to make the right decisions on their behalf.
</p>

<a name="60503-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_55"></a>Amendments Nos. 78, 94, 95 and 110 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, would also impose certain obligations, backed up by an offence, on those who assist direct payments recipients in setting up, and arranging for, a direct payment. The obligations seek to ensure that these persons provide certain information and assistance in connection with the vetting and barring scheme to the payment recipient. We do not consider it necessary to set out such obligations in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60503-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_56"></a>In relation to Amendment No. 78, I have already stressed the importance of allowing individuals to retain the choice and freedoms that direct payments offer. Ultimately, direct payments recipients must retain the right to decide what services to buy and whether to become employers in their own right, should they wish to do so. With those rights come the responsibilities that all employers face, although I understand that they are the most vulnerable employers. It will be their decision whether the staff they employ go through central vetting; it will not be the decision of the local council or the support service. Individual budgets are being piloted but will encompass a wide range of services, and many of those services will be provided for elsewhere in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60503-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_57"></a>We agree that local authorities have a responsibility to support individuals who are in receipt of a direct payment or, in the future, an individual budget. In turn, these support services, as a matter of good practice, have a responsibility to notify direct payments and individual budget recipients about the vetting and barring scheme and of their right to engage with the scheme. As mentioned yesterday, information, and communication of that information, is key. We will assist local authorities in the provision of that information and ensure that what they provide is relevant.
</p>

<a name="60503-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_58"></a>We will set out in guidance the importance of making barred status checks. We wish to create a culture where those providing support to direct payments recipients routinely assist them to access the scheme. We hope that that will result in checks being made as a matter of good practice rather than through legal force. However, we do not feel that it is necessary to set out good practice in primary legislation. In particular, we do not feel that imposing an offence is a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC236"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC236</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

proportionate response to what is, essentially, the need to ensure that individuals have proper and adequate information available to them.
</p>

<a name="60503-36_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_59"></a>It might be argued that the Bill creates enough offences as it is without adding to them unnecessarily when the same result can be achieved by putting proper administrative procedures in place. We therefore feel that the effect of the amendment can be achieved through building on the existing practices set up to support direct payments recipients and, in time, those set up to support individual budget users.
</p>

<a name="60503-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_60"></a>The fact that I have argued strongly against imposing requirements on direct payments recipients&#151;and, in the future, on individual budget recipient, too&#151;does not mean that they will be left unprotected. Anyone who is barred will be committing an offence if he works for a direct payment recipient. We believe that this is the correct approach to take and I trust that noble Lords will not press their amendments.

<a name="60503-37_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Buscombe: </b>   First, I thank the noble Baroness for her response on Amendment No. 107, although I am not entirely sure that I accept all that she said. I do not believe that what we are asking for here is in the least offensive. We were looking to protect those who I feel are particularly vulnerable&#151;people who, although they are in their own homes, often feel very alone, frightened and uncertain. So they are looking to put a good deal of trust in these individuals. However, I accept her final point that those who are barred would be committing an offence if they were to take on this role. I will reserve my thoughts and perhaps consult other noble Lords who have taken part in this debate and those from beyond your Lordships&#039; House who feel strongly that amending the Bill in such a way would make sense.

<a name="60503-37_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Laming: </b>   Like the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, for a very full response to these amendments. Will she dwell a little further on Amendment No. 79? It seems to me and, I suspect, those of us who have spoken on this matter, that we are living through a period of considerable change. We know very well about the demographic factors. It is not just that we have a growing number of very old, frail people in our community, but by improved healthcare, we are able to keep alive people who have profound disabilities. At the same time, the Government are pursuing a policy of care in the community, which seems to most of us to be sound. It allows people to have as much independence as possible and remain in their own home for as long as possible. But the reality is that more and more <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC237"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC237</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

people&#151;many of whom live alone, many of whom may be bedridden, and some of whom have disabilities such as blindness or deafness&#151;are incredibly vulnerable. People who live in residential establishments have a group of people around them all the time. It is very rare for staff in residential establishments to be unsupervised; but somebody going into another person&#039;s home to provide care does so, in general terms, unsupervised. They have incredible access to that person&#039;s lifestyle and all that that entails.
</p>

<a name="60503-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_61"></a>Experience shows that people in such circumstances can be more vulnerable to exploitation than people who live in residential establishments. Sometimes, I regret to say, vulnerability can be the cause of the actions of their nearest and dearest relatives. We should not be na-ve about this; some of these people will have considerable personal resources. There is something inconsistent in not providing the quality of protection that is available to other people.
</p>

<a name="60503-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_62"></a>I urge the noble Baroness to think again about this. The thrust of the amendments go along with the spirit of the Bill and with what is happening in the community in terms of demographic changes. The amendments are in line with the Government&#039;s policy to enable people to live in their own home for as long as possible and to retain whatever independence is open to them. I hope that the noble Baroness might be persuaded at least to give the amendments further consideration.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_35"></a>
<a name="60503-37_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   Before the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, withdraws the amendment, I should like to add my voice to what the noble Lord, Lord Laming, said. The Minister has before her four different Peers who have put forward a range of amendments in two different groups, all concerned with the same group of very vulnerable people. That is partly a result of our having been lobbied by various organisations which represent the people we are trying to protect and speak with their voice. There is a lot of concern and disquiet about how these arrangements will be dealt with under the Bill and how people receiving direct payments will be protected. I hope that both Ministers will have another think about this and see if they can come back to us at the next stage of the Bill&#039;s proceedings with something that might address these concerns.

<a name="60503-37_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Greengross: </b>   I thank the noble Baronesses and the noble Lord for that eloquent description of something I feel extremely strongly about, having worked in this field for so long. We are talking about taking risks with the most vulnerable people in our community. Of course it is true that, if good administrative procedures are always followed and carried out to the letter, the risk will be extremely slight, even negligible. We also know that the people who do this type of work have outrageously large caseloads, but older people and vulnerable adults generally are often last in the queue.

<p><a name="gc_st_38"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 82, I should like to speak to Amendments Nos. 91, 97 and 101 as well. This is a simple cluster of amendments which differ only in technical respects. They are intended simply to close a potential loophole and ensure that all individuals participating in regulated activity have been vetted under previous arrangements or that they will be subject to the new vetting procedures as laid out in the Bill. They are intended to bridge the gap between the old legislation and the implementation of this Act. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_39"></a>
<a name="60503-37_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   The amendments seek to ensure that where individuals were not subject to vetting procedures as they existed prior to the commencement of this legislation&#151;for example, an individual who was not checked against List 99, POCA or POVA, and/or did not obtain a CRB disclosure&#151;they will have to go through the vetting process.
</p>

<a name="60503-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_70"></a>As drafted, the offence in Clause 8 for individuals who engage in a regulated activity with the permission of a regulated activity provider without being subject to monitoring will apply only where an individual applies for a new job after the commencement of these provisions. Similarly, the offence that applies to regulated activity providers who knowingly permit an individual to engage in regulated activity without being subject to monitoring, and the offences to apply to regulated activity providers and appropriate officers who fail to make an appropriate check before permitting an individual to engage in regulated activity, will apply only where the individual applies for a new job after the commencement of the provisions. Offences will not be committed if an individual is already in employment before the commencement of this clause until such time as the Secretary of State specifies by order.
</p>

<a name="60503-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_71"></a>We entirely understand the noble Baroness&#039;s concern that individuals who have not been through vetting procedures who are already in employment when the legislation is commenced may pose a risk to children or vulnerable adults. However, we believe <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC239"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC239</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that this concern is properly addressed in the new IBB scheme. First, by requiring applicants to new jobs to be subject to monitoring, the majority of the workforce will in fact be covered within three years, and an estimated 88 per cent within five years, based on new entrants, movers and re-checks alone.
</p>

<a name="60503-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_72"></a>Secondly, the Bill provides the Secretary of State with the power to require individuals who are already in employment in regulated activity to be subject to monitoring through Clause 8(5) and (8). Clause 45 allows us to apply that power at different times for different sectors of the workforce. It is my right honourable friend&#039;s intention to use these powers to ensure progressive coverage of the children and vulnerable adult workforce. In doing so, we will need to balance carefully the need to protect vulnerable groups with the need to ensure effective implementation by avoiding a &quot;big bang&quot; approach which would impose unmanageable, immediate burdens on employers, including costs&#151;a concern raised earlier by the noble Baroness. We will therefore seek to phase in the new obligations to check the status of existing employees. I hope the Committee will think that that is a responsible way to proceed in the circumstances.

I do not know whether other noble Lords wish to contribute to this issue, but I think it is disappointing that the Government feel that it is all right to phase in something which is so important in this way and hope that those who may be most in need of vetting, if I can put it that way, move on in their jobs within a short span of time.

&quot;(   )   In subsection (7) an &quot;occasional basis&quot; means no more than six times a year.&quot; .

<p><a name="gc_st_43"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 85, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 141 and 146, which are grouped with it.
</p>

<a name="60503-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_76"></a>Amendment No. 85 is a probing amendment to tease out from the Government what they mean by &quot;on an occasional basis&quot; and to achieve greater clarity on the issue. In the Explanatory Notes&#151;the only information that I had available to me when I tabled the amendment&#151;the example is given that a parent assisting with certain activities in a school does not have to be subject to monitoring if he does so &quot;on an occasional basis&quot;. I have suggested &quot;six times a year&quot; in my amendment simply for the sake of specifying something. I am not fixated on &quot;six times a year&quot; being the only definition of what &quot;on an occasional basis&quot; means but, in order to stimulate the debate, I felt we should have something to talk about.
</p>

<a name="60503-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_77"></a>Since I tabled the amendment, I have been grateful to receive a copy of the very large bundle of papers the Minister sent to the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, during the bank holiday weekend. I did not receive the bundle until yesterday morning and I was not able to refer to it in our debates yesterday afternoon. But I wrapped a wet towel around my head this morning and ploughed through it.
</p>

<a name="60503-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_78"></a>I notice that information note 1(iv) states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_17"></a>&quot;anything happening less often than once a month and any contract shorter than a week&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_79"></a>could be regarded as being &quot;on an occasional basis&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60503-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_80"></a>To take the example given of a university lecturer who comes into a school to help a class of GCSE students, broadly speaking, the Government would expect that the school should not have to check the lecturer&#039;s barred status if he held the class on a one-off occasion or was invited in once a term over the school year&#151;I think that means three times. But the criminal offences in Clauses 10 and 11 would apply to the school if it used the lecturer every week&#151;however many weeks there are in a school year; I am not quite sure&#151;every fortnight or every month. The latter would be 12 times. From what I can make out, it looks as if my &quot;six times&quot; is actually about right. It is just about what the Government were thinking about.
</p>

<a name="60503-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_81"></a>It needs to be clear who would be covered by these regulated activity categories. Our debates yesterday showed that it is not clear from the drafting whether certain kinds of people such as telephone counsellors and people looking after data are covered. However, we discussed that yesterday.
</p>

<a name="60503-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_82"></a>It would be very helpful if, in addition to the note that we have, the Minister could tell us a little more about why he feels that it is inappropriate to specify. I think that I understand that, but perhaps he can say what range of frequencies can be regarded as &quot;on an occasional basis&quot;? How will somebody be judged if they say, &quot;I didn&#039;t think 12 times a year was frequent. I thought that was an occasional basis&quot;? But someone else might disagree&#151;it really is rather difficult.

</p>

<a name="60503-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_83"></a>Amendments Nos. 141 and 146 would clarify another aspect of the Bill: what is meant by &quot;harm to a child&quot;. We have some comment on that in the notes as well. In fact, it is in the same note. The Government say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_18"></a>&quot;In both these cases we believe that harm should take its normal commonsense meaning so that a special definition is not required on the face of the Bill&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_84"></a>Over the page they say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_19"></a>&quot;Given that the IBB is required to form a view that it is appropriate to include a person on the list and that the board will only bar if it assesses that the risk to children and/or vulnerable adults is significant enough, there is little need to legislate explicitly on the face of the Bill for harm to be significant&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_85"></a>It is not clear from the Bill what thresholds the Independent Barring Board will use when deciding whether to bar a person from working with children or vulnerable adults and whether it is appropriate to put them on the barred list. It is crucial to ensure that the new system is a marked improvement on the current arrangements and that those decisions are consistent. Nor is there an adequate explanation of &quot;relevant conduct&quot; that would lead to barring as defined in Schedule 2. For example, it states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_20"></a>&quot;conduct of a sexual nature involving a child&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_86"></a>would be defined as &quot;relevant conduct&quot; if it appears to the IBB that the conduct is inappropriate. But it leaves unclear what and how conduct of a sexual nature involving a child would be acceptable.
</p>

<a name="60503-38_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_87"></a>The Children Act 1989 introduced the concept of significant harm as the threshold that justifies compulsory intervention in family life in the best interests of children. It was updated in Section 120 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 to include a child seeing domestic violence happening. The local authority is then under a duty to make inquiries or cause inquiries to be made where it has reasonable cause to suspect that a child is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm. A court may make a care order committing the child to the care of the local authority or a supervision order putting the child under the supervision of a social worker or a probation officer in respect of a child only if it is satisfied that the child is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm and that the harm or likelihood of harm is attributable to a lack of adequate parental care or control.
</p>

<a name="60503-38_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_88"></a>In my amendment I have therefore defined significant harm in the Bill in the same words as used in Section 31 of the Children Act 1989, in an attempt to be helpful and to be very clear on the criteria on which the IBB should base its decisions. There are no absolute criteria on which to rely when judging what constitutes significant harm. I am quite aware of that. Consideration of the severity of ill treatment may include the degree and extent of physical harm. It might be the duration and the frequency of abuse and neglect, the extent of premeditation, the degree of threat, and the level of coercion, sadism or bizarre and unusual elements in child sexual abuse. However, we must try to be as clear as possible about what we mean; and the definition in the Children Act 1989 is well <br>&nbsp;<br>

known and understood by all workers in the children sector&#151;which is why I have chosen to use it in Amendment No. 146. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_44"></a>
<a name="60503-38_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Laming: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Harris, has given me the nod to attempt to speak to Amendment No. 142. If I make a mess, I am glad that he will be there to assist me. This is a simple amendment which recognises that acts of omission can be as serious in their consequence as acts of commission. The amendment underlines the fact that failure to do something that is reasonable, as well as taking any positive action, can harm a child or vulnerable adult, or place them at risk of unreasonable harm. It would ensure that the Bill reflected the provisions of Section 7 of the Care Standards Act, which governs the operation of the Protection of Vulnerable Adults list. It would also reflect the Mental Capacity Act 2005, which created a long-overdue criminal offence of ill treatment or neglect of a person who lacks capacity.
</p>

<a name="60503-38_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_89"></a>Neglect can cause serious harm and can be just as distressing to the person suffering it as directly-inflicted physical harm. We all know of examples and I shall not detain the Committee longer by giving examples, but it is inevitable that if the care needs of vulnerable people&#151;who need the proper care and assistance of other people&#151;are neglected, it can have serious consequences. For that reason, I hope that Amendment No. 142, to include &quot;any action or inaction&quot; that can lead to harm to a vulnerable person, will be accepted.
</p>

<p><a name="gc_st_45"></a>
<a name="60503-39_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Harris of Haringey: </b>   I rise to speak in support of Amendment No. 142, not because of any inadequacies in what the noble Lord, Lord Laming, has just said, because he made all the points that needed to be made in respect of &quot;action or inaction&quot;. It is just as important to include &quot;inaction&quot; as &quot;action&quot;. I wish to make two other points. In the cold light of day, the grouping seems to be a ragbag of issues that have been brought together. In addition, if this amendment were incorporated in the Bill, a similar amendment would be needed in Clauses 27, 32 and 35.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_46"></a>
<a name="60503-39_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   As my noble friend has just said, we are covering a number of terms in the amendments that probe at the meaning of &quot;frequently&quot;, &quot;occasionally&quot;, &quot;harm&quot; and &quot;neglect&quot;. Perhaps I may first address Amendment No. 85, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, which seeks to define &quot;occasionally&quot; and therefore, by implication, &quot;frequently&quot;. As laid out in Schedule 3, engaging in regulated activity relating to children includes, for example, teaching, training, caring for, supervising, or advising children &quot;frequently&quot;. Frequently undertaking a similar activity in relation to vulnerable adults is also classified as a regulated activity.
</p>

<a name="60503-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_90"></a>Furthermore, the definition of regulated activity in relation to children covers engaging in such an activity even &quot;occasionally&quot; in one of the establishments specified in paragraph (3) of Schedule 3, which includes a school or a children&#039;s home. An activity is also classified as a regulated activity relating to children if it is not an activity specified in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC243"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC243</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 3, but still affords the employee frequent contact with children in a setting specified in paragraph 3. Any activity carried out in a care home exclusively for vulnerable adults that gives the employee opportunity for frequent contact with vulnerable adults is also a regulated activity.

</p>

<a name="60503-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_91"></a>Clause 8(7), to which the amendment refers, makes it clear that an individual would not commit a criminal offence if he was not subject to monitoring were he to engage in an activity only on an occasional basis in relation to children specified in paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 3&#151;that is, caring for, teaching, training and so on in an establishment specified in paragraph 3 of that schedule.
</p>

<a name="60503-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_92"></a>In the information note, which I circulated prior to the Committee stage and to which the noble Baroness referred, we sought to get to grips with what these terms would mean. I stress that we will be issuing guidance to local authorities and others on how to interpret them. In paragraph 3 of that note, I said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_21"></a>&quot;In terms of the work that a barred person can do other than in a setting specified in paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 3 we broadly consider anything more than once a month or any contract that lasts longer than a week to be &#039;frequent&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_93"></a>So we are in the same ballpark as the noble Baroness. The note continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_22"></a>&quot;In terms of the duties to check and ensure that a person is subject to monitoring that employers will be under we broadly consider anything more than once a month or any contract that lasts longer than a week to be &#039;frequent&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_23"></a>&quot;In terms of the exceptions that there are for employers from the duties to check and to ensure that an individual is subject to monitoring when they are engaged in a setting specified in paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 3 we broadly consider anything happening less often than once a month and any contract shorter than a week to be &#039;on an occasional basis&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_94"></a>I repeat all that so that it is in <i>Hansard</i> for reference.
</p>

<a name="60503-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_95"></a>The noble Baroness asked why we do not put that in the Bill. We have considered that, but we do not believe that it would be appropriate to set hard and fast definitions in the Bill&#151;as I said, we will give guidance&#151;not least because we believe that, if we were to do so, it could constrain and potentially distort the way that regulated activity is identified. For example, if an activity were performed five times in a year but on an intensive basis over a short period, so creating an opportunity for an abusive adult to build up a relationship with a child, we would not want that to be excluded from the definition of &quot;regulated activity&quot;; nor, more importantly, would we wish employers to regard themselves as not being under a duty to consider whether they should regard that as a regulated activity&#151;yet that would be the unfortunate effect of the amendment if we were to apply it in a hard and fast way in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60503-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_96"></a>A variety of factors must be weighed up in establishing whether an activity is performed only occasionally. We believe that a single, simple test of the number of times a year is not on its own sufficiently discriminating, although of course we accept that there must be some yardstick by which these judgments are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC244"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC244</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

generally made. Those are the ones which I set out in the notes and which I have now ensured are available in <i>Hansard</i>. As I said, we will set out in the guidance to be issued by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State both the indicative definitions of &quot;frequent&quot; and &quot;occasional&quot; and also the other factors that employers should take into account when making these judgments.
</p>

<a name="60503-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_97"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 141 and 146 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, concerning the issue of harm. This word is of relevance not only to local authorities, as suggested in the amendments, but to all bodies in the Bill that are under a duty to refer information on an individual to the IBB when they think that the harm test has been satisfied.
</p>

<a name="60503-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_98"></a>Amendment No. 141 would seek to provide a comparator for determining whether harm is significant. As the noble Baroness said, the context for the wording that she has adopted in her amendment is Section 31 of the Children Act 1989. However, while we believe that this test is important in the context of that legislation, we do not think it will assist with Clause 30 in this Bill. In Section 31 of the Children Act, the comparison test is appropriate because the threshold for intervention under that section is that a child is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm. However, the harm test under Clause 30 of this Bill makes no reference to the harm having to be deemed significant. An additional condition in Clause 30(4) on the local authority&#039;s duty to refer seeks to minimise the circumstances in which potentially trivial cases of harm are referred. I shall elaborate on that shortly. But, as the harm test contains no reference to the harm needing to be significant, we believe that this amendment would be unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="60503-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_99"></a>Amendment No. 146 would provide a definition of &quot;harm&quot;&#151;again, by reference to the Children Act 1989, as amended by the Adoption and Children Act 2002. We are concerned that, by defining the word as suggested, we may unnecessarily restrict the circumstances in which local authorities could refer information to the IBB. That may mean that important evidence is lost that might otherwise have been critical in a barring decision. Instead, we believe it right for &quot;harm&quot; to take on its normal meaning so that a special definition is not required in the Bill. The normal meaning of &quot;harm&quot; would include damage to a child or vulnerable adult&#039;s mental or emotional state as well as physical harm. In the case of vulnerable adults, that may also include harm incurred through financial loss.
</p>

<a name="60503-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_100"></a>In addition, there are explicit provisions in the Bill designed to ensure that the IBB is not over-burdened with referrals on the basis of trivial harm. In relation to local authorities, an additional condition in Clause 30(4) upon their duty to refer is that they should do so only when they think that the person is engaged or may engage in a regulated or controlled activity, and that the IBB may consider it appropriate for the person to be included on a barred list. We intend to support local authorities in making these decisions by providing them with guidance on the sort of situations that could occur.

</p>

<a name="60503-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_101"></a>On Amendment No. 142, in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, and my noble friend Lord Harris, local authorities have a key role to play in the effective functioning of the new vetting and barring scheme. Under the clause to which this amendment refers, they are under a duty to refer information to the IBB if they think that one of the various routes to barring listed in Schedule 2 applies to a particular person. That includes if the local authority thinks that the harm test is satisfied. We entirely appreciate the rationale behind the amendment that seeks to modify the harm test to cover future acts of omission as well as commission, but we believe that this specific amendment is not necessary because it is covered by the wording of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60503-39_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_102"></a>Local authorities will, subject to the additional condition in Clause 30(4), be in a position to refer prescribed information to the IBB, not only on the basis of evidence of behaviour but also if the local authority thinks the harm test, as set out in subsection (3), is satisfied. That is satisfied when the local authority thinks that the person may harm, cause to be harmed, put at risk of harm, attempt to harm or incite another to harm a child or vulnerable adult. This is intended to capture those circumstances in which the local authority has clear evidence that an individual has an inclination to cause harm which has not yet been acted upon. In this situation, the local authority must refer the prescribed information, such as medical evidence, to the IBB so that the individual can be considered for barring.
</p>

<a name="60503-39_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_103"></a>This criterion of risk of harm is crucial to increase the safeguards for vulnerable groups, even though it may apply in only a small number of cases. The amendment would make it clear that the harm test would be satisfied not only when a local authority thinks an individual may in the future harm a child or vulnerable adult but also where it thinks that as a result of something that that individual will in future fail to do, a child or vulnerable adult may be harmed. But we do not believe that there is a need to modify the harm test explicitly so that future acts of omission will cause the test to be satisfied. As it is drafted in the clause, we believe the harm test already makes provision for capturing potential future omissions.
</p>

<a name="60503-39_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_104"></a>Clause 30(3)(c) states that the harm test is that the person may,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_24"></a>&quot;put a child or vulnerable adult at risk of harm&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-39_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_105"></a>We believe that covers future acts of omission so that the child or vulnerable adult may be placed at risk of harm regardless of whether this is because of something an individual will proactively do or that they will fail to do in the future.
</p>

<a name="60503-39_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_106"></a>Were there to be an individual for whom evidence suggested that he would be incapable of acting in a given situation, that individual could still be said to be putting a child or vulnerable adult at risk of harm. For example, an individual whose psychological evidence suggests that he may have proclivities not to look after <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC246</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a vulnerable adult properly&#151;not to provide them with sufficient foods and fluids, for instance, as in the case of neglect that the noble Lord, Lord Laming, raised&#151;would be putting a vulnerable adult at risk of harm, and that would be covered by the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60503-39_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_107"></a>I hope that this shows that a potential failure to do something as well as a positive action is covered by the harm test as drafted, and that this meets the concerns of the noble Lord and my noble friend.

The noble Lord, Lord Harris, and I will need to reflect on it. Before the Minister sits down, I should like an assurance from him. Do his remarks cover a social worker, for example, who neglects to see a child known to be seriously at risk when it was expected that the social worker would see the child, or someone who leaves an elderly person lying in soiled clothes over a period of time that could cause infection as well as considerable physical distress?

<a name="60503-40_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I thank the Minister for his reply. On Amendment No. 85, the best way for a potential employee to find out whether the work they propose to do falls within the &quot;frequent&quot; category or that of &quot;on an occasional basis&quot; is to ask about it. Can the noble Lord tell me whether a potential employee or employer can check with the IBB specifically about a proposed employment relationship? Will the board be able to decide whether the proposed work is frequent or occasional, thereby preventing an offence being committed? No one wants to lay themselves open to such a risk. The difficulty here is that these things are vague and I fear that if the noble Lord responds to me by saying &quot;yes&quot;, the IBB will be inundated by a flood of people who are not sure about the situation. Perhaps he would like to respond to the point before I move on to the other amendments.

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_57"></a>
<a name="60503-40_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I oppose the question that Clause 10 should stand part of the Bill because I believe it is excessive. It criminalises a regulated activity provider who uses someone who has not been subject to monitoring. The crucial difference between this clause and Clause 9 is that there is no requirement for the regulated activity provider to know, or have reason to believe, that the person could be any risk to children or vulnerable people. I do not mean to imply that the omissions set out in the clause are not serious; they certainly are. If carried out by employees, they may very well merit severe disciplinary action and even dismissal, and rightly so. However, I believe that the creation of offences targeted at those who make mistakes is excessive and unnecessary. Unfortunately, it is likely that mistakes will be made, especially while the new system beds down. Confusion could easily arise over the different checks that apply to those seeking to work, for example, in various types of therapy. Under paragraph 2(e) in Part 1 of Schedule 3, any form of therapy provided to a child is a regulated activity. However, under Clause 14(1)(a), &quot;complementary or alternative therapy&quot; is listed as one of the areas of exemption from the need to make a monitoring check for vulnerable adults. We will come to my Amendment No. 102 on that later.
</p>

<a name="60503-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_119"></a>Meanwhile, &quot;therapy&quot; is listed as being a controlled activity relating both to children and adults, requiring guidance to be issued by the Secretary of State on engaging people in that activity, as covered by Clauses 18 to 20. It is easy to see how there will be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC248"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC248</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

scope for some confusion, especially in the early days, about what exactly is regulated, who is barred and who must be monitored. Proper training and guidance will be far more important than the threat of criminalisation in order to avoid contravening these measures. I do not believe that these offences and penalties will constitute a deterrent. It would be far better to develop a positive culture of care and safeguarding through the accreditation of whole organisations rather than having a set of criminal offences where it will often be difficult to pin the blame on any one particular person, a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, in a debate on an earlier amendment. Further, the fines referred to in the Bill would not be significant for a large organisation. Rather it would be the slur on its professionalism that would hurt more than the penalty.
</p>

<a name="60503-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_120"></a>While I do not condone people being slipshod and committing offences of omission in relation to all these duties, I favour the carrot rather than the stick: training and whole-organisation cultures of safeguarding rather than criminal offences. Disciplinary action and sanctions of that kind would be far more appropriate in this case.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_58"></a>
<a name="60503-40_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My best response to the noble Baroness is to say that wherever we refer to a stick in the Bill, it is done notwithstanding the many carrots that are also available to encourage and incentivise precisely the culture of care and safeguarding referred to. It goes almost without saying&#151;I will say it because the noble Baroness has raised the issue&#151;that none of the checks and protections we are putting in place will be effective unless they go hand in hand with a culture of care and safeguarding on the part of employers as they put appropriate measures in place. I say that because a point made frequently in our debates is that a very substantial area in which the risk of harm will be high is among those who have been perfectly and properly cleared by the current processes and the checks to be put in place with the establishment of the IBB. Often a culture of abuse, of which we have had all too much evidence in various cases over recent years, has developed while people are in employment, not as a result of a failure of checks that could have been made when those individuals changed their employment. Vigilance on the part of employers is vital, as is their proper training. As I said at Second Reading, we are now putting in place significant resources to make available appropriate training for employers. Nothing in the Bill should be seen as in any way weakening those important elements in ensuring a culture of care and safeguarding.

<a name="60503-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_121"></a>However, we believe it important that there should be proper statutory protection, including a requirement that individuals engaged in regulated activity with the permission of the regulated activity provider are subject to monitoring. While the noble Baroness is right that the fines alone will not provide the incentives or the disincentives to act, they are none the less a statement of the importance Parliament <br>&nbsp;<br>

attaches to these issues and they will have a big effect on the reputation, or the potential reputation, of employers in fulfilling their proper duties. What we do in this place is often as important for the signals we send out as for the precise content of the measures themselves.
</p>

<a name="60503-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_122"></a>I should add that an offence will not be committed by a regulated activity provider who uses an individual for regulated activity who is not subject to monitoring where the regulated activity provider began to employ that person before the commencement of the clause until such time as the Secretary of State specifies by order in the way I described in my response to the previous amendments spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe. We intend that where existing employees who have not been checked come within the purview of the scheme, this will be done in a proper and orderly way, so as to manage the increased obligations on employers.
</p>

<a name="60503-40_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_123"></a>Clause 10 creates important incentives for regulated activity providers to ensure that the individuals they permit to engage in regulated activity are subject to monitoring which, in turn, will ensure that the scheme works to protect children and vulnerable adults from those who present a risk. While I entirely accept the point about the wider factors which create a positive culture of care and safeguarding, we believe that the clause should stand part.

It would ensure that the new scheme is mandatory for self-employed individuals wishing to participate in regulated activity in a domestic setting. In the case of individuals who are self-employed, such as tutors and carers working in a private home, I believe the onus must be on them to prove to their prospective employer that a check has been completed and that they are permitted to participate in the activity in question. It is a bit of self-regulation, if you like. If an accreditation system was available in England and Wales, the amendment might not be <br>&nbsp;<br>

necessary. That could be a solution to the problem. Perhaps the Minister can reassure me that such people will be covered.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_62"></a>
<a name="60503-41_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   We are entirely at one with the noble Baroness in wishing to provide the maximum protection to all children and vulnerable adults, including protection from those who work with them in the home. The new system will improve that protection. For example, when considering someone for relevant work, for the first time parents and other domestic employers will be able directly to check an individual&#039;s barred status where the individual has applied to the scheme to be monitored. Where an individual has not applied to the scheme, employers can request that he or she does so. They will also be able to check an individual&#039;s barred status online for free. That option is not available at the moment to parents or other domestic employers. It will significantly enhance the protection offered in those settings.
</p>

<a name="60503-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_127"></a>We will be encouraging domestic employers to check the guidance, which sets out the advantages and ease of checking, and how they can go about doing so. We wish to make access to the online service as user-friendly as possible for parents when it comes to getting the necessary passwords and logging on to the system. We will also implement, through websites, press articles and key organisations, an extensive and ongoing communications campaign to encourage checks.
</p>

<a name="60503-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_128"></a>Following the debate on the Childcare Bill, to which we look forward to returning tomorrow afternoon, we are giving further consideration to the requirements on childminders with respect to the vetting and barring scheme. However, we believe that there is a balance to be struck here, so as not to make the life of private individuals excessively difficult. We have therefore not placed a statutory retirement on parents and domestic employers to check those they employ to work closely with children or vulnerable adults. Parents may employ a neighbour to babysit their child whom they know and trust, for example. We should not make it difficult for parents to get support for the difficult job of parenting or for them to get together to arrange activities for their children. Similarly, the direct payments system aims to give individuals choice about how to lead their lives. As we said earlier, we do not want to restrict that choice by placing undue requirements on them.
</p>

<a name="60503-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_129"></a>So while I entirely share the concerns raised by the noble Baroness and we believe that the arrangements in the Bill will considerably strengthen the capacity of parents and those who employ in the home to check the status of the people they employ, we do not wish to bring domestic arrangements into the statutory obligations under the Bill.

However, given that the offence requires only a failure to make a check or a failure to obtain information in time and no knowledge or suspicion on the part of the person making it, I do not believe it really can be justified, even with amendments. These offences will be committed by people not carrying out their employment obligations. They would be much more suitable for civil law sanctions and should not really be in the domain of criminal law at all. That I why I feel that Clauses 11 and 12 are excessive. I wonder what the Minister can say to alleviate those concerns.

<p><a name="gc_st_68"></a>
<a name="60503-41_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My reply is the same as that to the debate on whether Clause 10 should stand part. While we certainly do not believe that criminal sanctions and fines in themselves are a sufficient set of incentives, we do believe that they send an important signal for regulated activity providers to make appropriate checks to ensure that the individuals they permit to engage in regulated activity are not barred and subject to monitoring which, in turn, will ensure that the scheme works to protect children and vulnerable adults from those who present a risk. Taken in the round with all the other obligations on employers, it is appropriate to have the provisions in place because of the further signals and incentives they provide. But we do not believe that they alone will do what is necessary, and to that extent I agree with the noble Baroness. But I hope that she will agree with me that we should not turn our back on the sending of signals that encourage employers to take their duties with the utmost seriousness in this area.

<p><a name="gc_st_72"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 102, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 105. Amendment No. 102 refers to Clause 14, which provides for exemptions in relation to monitoring checks made by certain regulated activity providers. The list includes complementary or alternative therapists.
</p>

<a name="60503-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_140"></a>I have been approached by the Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society, which is concerned that employers in these areas are excluded from the requirements to check their employees. That goes against the spirit of the legislation. The society believes it is important that people with Parkinson&#039;s should be able to access complementary and alternative therapy services and that they should be afforded the same level of protection as that given to those accessing other health services.
</p>

<a name="60503-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_141"></a>It is clear that many people with Parkinson&#039;s disease have an interest in accessing such services. A 2003 survey of more than 2,000 members conducted by the PDS complementary therapy working group found that 65 per cent of members declared their interest in complementary therapy. No form of complementary medicine can cure Parkinson&#039;s disease, but for some people it can help to ease the symptoms of, and help them to cope with, the condition. I refer to a range of therapies such as the Alexander technique, massage, yoga and so on. The society believes it is vital that people accessing such services are afforded a level of protection equal to that given to those accessing other health services, and it would therefore like to remove such services from the exemptions.
</p>

<a name="60503-42_para2"></a>

<a name="60503-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_144"></a>The amendment addresses a difficult area in this clause. Some noble Lords might not place the welfare of convicted criminals very highly on a priority list but, in this case, we are not necessarily discussing hardened criminals but young adults and offenders with special needs who are detained in custody. The second joint chief inspectors&#039; report on arrangements to safeguard children has a wealth of information on this subject. It covers both the needs of children in custody and those of young people. The report notes that children and young people who commit offences present particular challenges for safeguarding. The statistics surrounding young people in custody speak volumes. The number of young people in prison has increased by 66 per cent in the past five years, raising the number of young people in prison to more than 11,000. Of those 11,000, more than 70 per cent will suffer from two or more mental disorders, compared with 5 per cent of the population. Reconviction rates are extremely high for young prisoners. More than 80 per cent of male prisoners aged under 21 who were discharged from prison in 1997 were reconvicted within two years, compared with 58 per cent of adult males.

The second chief inspector&#039;s report highlights positive practice in the probation services, such as the strong relationship between the North Tyneside youth offending team and local social services, but the report found that one third of the required paperwork between agencies had not been completed when young people are subjected to remand, and some examples of young people remanded in custody who remained there until sentence, with no input from the youth offending team.

<p><a name="gc_st_74"></a>
<a name="60503-42_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Harris of Haringey: </b>   I have a great deal of sympathy with this group of amendments. Indeed, I am quite surprised that the exemptions listed have been included, for the reasons given by the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Buscombe. For example, in the provision of complementary or alternative therapy&#151;which goes much wider than the provision of such therapy to people with Parkinson&#039;s disease&#151;those people are providing a therapy that puts them in a position of trust with the individuals concerned. Vulnerable adults will implicitly accept the goodwill and <i>bona fides</i> of the individuals providing that support. That is why they should be encompassed by the Bill&#039;s provisions.
</p>

<a name="60503-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_148"></a>I do not know whether some value judgment is made about complementary or alternative medicine by including it in the list. I certainly do not want to get into that debate. What is significant is that individuals presenting themselves for complementary or alternative therapies believe in it and are putting themselves in a position where their vulnerabilities can be exploited. Points have already been made about prisons and the probation service. I wonder about the consequences of abuse for the likelihood of reoffending.
</p>

<a name="60503-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_149"></a>Finally, on Clause 14(1)(d) and (e), the exclusion specifically mentions organisations providing,

I can think of a number of instances that were brought to my attention at the time. It is irrelevant whether the organisation is part of a local authority or part of a separate organisation. Those are precisely the circumstances in which vulnerable adults may well be subjected to all sorts of abuse and we should be providing the protection of the Bill.

<p><a name="gc_st_75"></a>
<a name="60503-42_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   The introduction of the new vetting and barring scheme marks a significant step forward in adult protection. Our intention is for the new scheme to apply as widely as possible across the vulnerable adults&#039; workforce. It will go beyond health and social care to cover a variety of other settings. However, it is important that the new scheme offers a broad degree of flexibility. In the health and social care sectors, where we know that the incidence of abuse is greatest, there will be a requirement to check the bar status of all those undertaking regulated activity, but in other areas it may not be appropriate to impose a blanket requirement on employers or <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC255"></a>

providers to vet everyone undertaking such regulated activities. Therefore we have allowed for a number of exemptions under the new scheme.
</p>

<a name="60503-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_151"></a>Amendment No. 103, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, deals with the prison and probation services which fall into this category. The exemption in relation to those services means that they will be afforded the flexibility to specify and undertake vetting requirements relevant and proportionate to their unique services. They will determine in guidance which staff it will be appropriate to check through the central vetting scheme. To put this into context, a prison officer working with juveniles poses a different level of risk to someone working in administration or in the offices of an adult prison. It is absolutely clear that the prison officer working with juvenile cases, as suggested by the noble Baroness, will be checked.
</p>

<a name="60503-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_152"></a>As to Amendment No. 105 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, it is important that the scope of mandatory checks is proportionate to the potential risks presented. This is the case for providers of recreational, social and sporting activities, which are often provided by community groups such as Churches. We need to strike a careful balance between protecting vulnerable people and imposing a regulatory burden which would mean that services were no longer provided to those who need them. Leisure activities and educational courses designed for older and disabled people are a vital part of their inclusion in our communities. The isolation which might result from a lack of such services may increase the risk of abuse.
</p>

<a name="60503-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_153"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 102. The Bill will bring about a cultural change in relation to adult protection. Many areas will be brought within a central vetting system for the first time. I note the concerns expressed on behalf of the Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society that complementary and alternative medicine, which has been left without standard vetting procedures for many years, will now be included. This means that individuals practising complementary or alternative therapy will be able to be checked under the same vetting procedures as those working within the NHS. So those people who wish to use alternative therapies can check whether or not the people providing such therapies have been checked. It might even be a selling point for the providers of therapies; they could advertise that they have been checked.
</p>

<a name="60503-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_154"></a>Where a complementary or alternative therapist is contracting directly with the NHS or other regulated independent healthcare providers, he or she will be placed under the same requirements as those working in the sectors, and the check will be mandatory. However, we must remember that mandatory checks can be imposed only where it is proportionate. Complementary and alternative therapies encompass a vast array of services. Adults accessing complementary and alternative therapy under private arrangements have the right to manage their own risks and take responsibility for the decisions they make. We cannot stipulate otherwise.

<a name="60503-42_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_155"></a>I can assure the Committee that in the sectors where the exemption applies, vulnerable adults will not be unprotected&#151;far from it. As I said, for the first time ever, those working with vulnerable adults in a variety of settings across the workforce will be subject to the same vetting and barring procedures. We will develop guidance for employers and providers, emphasising that checks should be made through good practice rather than legal force. Again, information and communication will be key in building this good practice. I ask the noble Baroness to consider withdrawing her amendment.

<a name="60503-43_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I thank the Minister for that explanation. However, I fail to see why someone who comes to a person&#039;s home, without anyone else present, and performs a hands-on massage of that person should not be subject under the Bill to exactly the same provisions as someone delivering the same service in a hospital. I continue to be concerned.

</p>

<a name="60503-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_156"></a>I do not quite go along with what the Minister said about all this being an increasing burden on some of the organisations that provide, say, leisure and sporting activities. Most of those organisations, including Churches, already have provisions to safeguard children. It would not be too difficult to add vulnerable adults to them. Although the Minister says that people purchasing these services can go online and do the checks for themselves, many such people have quite a lot to worry about in their lives and it would be far better if that was done for them. I will go back, read what the Minister said and consult the people who have briefed me before deciding what to do with this group of amendments.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_77"></a>
<a name="60503-43_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Buscombe: </b>   Before the noble Baroness withdraws her amendment, the Minister referred in the discussion of this group of amendments and in previous amendments to the need to be proportionate, which is quite a subjective test. There also seems to be a difference when there is regular close contact. This may not seem relevant, but in my mind it is. The Soham murders were committed by the caretaker. The caretaker was not in regular contact with those schoolchildren&#151;there was no contact at all&#151;so why is that such a fundamental basis on which decisions on whether or not someone needs to be monitored are made? I simply do not understand that. It is important that we stand back and think about the matter.
</p>

<a name="60503-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_157"></a>I will read with care what the Minister said, but we must remember that the people whom we most want to protect are the most vulnerable. I have just referred to an especially vulnerable group&#151;which is renowned for being abused in prison&#151;and it is our responsibility to do whatever we can to protect them. We are in a brilliant position to do that and we have an opportunity to really make a difference. We are talking about deterrents here&#151;I referred to this yesterday&#151;but we have almost become afraid of imposing deterrents. Somehow life has to be all about solutions and being proportionate and caring. We are talking about a very vulnerable group of people who may be in prison because they have started life in a vulnerable <br>&nbsp;<br>

position where they have been abused themselves, and who then go into an arena where they should expect to be especially well protected.
</p>

<a name="60503-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_158"></a>I will think again, but I will also consult with other Members of the Committee who have spoken during the debate. I urge the Government to think about the sad fact that the kind of people who will perpetrate these heinous crimes are unbelievably smart; they are very clever and very canny. If they are able to behave in a way that we all find so utterly distasteful and get away with it because they are in a position such as that of a caretaker or someone who is removed from regular contact, we need to rethink some aspects of the Bill.

contact, and we have had some debates about that already in the context of Part 1 of Schedule 3, which is the threshold for certain activities in paragraph 2(1) of that part being regulated.
</p>

<a name="60503-43_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_175"></a>In the bundle of notes with which the Minister provided us a few days ago, he refers, in regulation-making power 2(i), to guidance. Paragraph 23 tells us:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_38"></a>&quot;The guidance will clarify for the purpose of employers the scope of controlled activity as outlined in the Bill so they are clear on the extent to which their employees will be covered by the definition. It will give examples of job roles that will be covered as well as more information on the meaning of concepts in the Bill such as frequent access to specific records concerning children and vulnerable adults&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-43_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_176"></a>In paragraph 24 we are told:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_39"></a>&quot;Engaging a person in controlled activity brings with it a certain set of responsibilities as set out in the Bill and the guidance will provide a useful opportunity to remind potential employers of their duties in managing controlled activity&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-43_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_177"></a>The duties seem very similar to those relating to regulated activity.

<a name="60503-43_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_178"></a>In paragraph 25 we are told:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_40"></a>&quot;The inclusion of this guidance-making power is also therefore to reflect the fact that barred people may present some risk to children and vulnerable adults if they do such work without extra safeguards being put in place. By outlining certain conditions which must be in place for a barred person to engage in controlled activity this guidance will help employers manage this risk appropriately&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-43_para23"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_179"></a>I guess that employers will find it too much trouble to employ people who are on the barred list in controlled activities, so they may as well be included in these jobs under regulated activity. I rather doubt if employers will want to employ them at all in view of the fact that over the page we are told that these extra safeguards entail:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_41"></a>&quot;Ensuring there is extra supervision of the barred person . . . Keeping the barred person away from areas specifically targeted at children and vulnerable adults . . . Introducing a longer probation period for the barred person . . . Drafting objectives for the job in conjunction with the individual that have been &#039;risk-assessed&#039; to reflect their barred status . . . Monitoring access to specified records about children or vulnerable adults . . . Building into job contracts: boundaries of personal conduct&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-43_para24"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_180"></a>and so on. These are all appropriate if you have concerns about someone working with children.
</p>

<a name="60503-43_para25"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_181"></a>It is in the light of this that the NSPCC has approached me and suggested that Clause 18, which introduces the concept of &quot;controlled activities&quot;, should be deleted from the Bill and that everyone who works with children in any capacity should be regulated and treated as such by all the provisions of the Bill. That would be the effect if we removed Clause 18.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_83"></a>
<a name="60503-43_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   The noble Baroness has made a number of good points; indeed she could hardly do otherwise since she spent a good part of her time reading out the note I circulated earlier to the Committee. In no way do I dissociate myself from that note. We are concerned that bars in relation to individuals should be proportionate and not excessive in the settings they cover, which I know has been a concern of the noble Baroness in earlier debates. We should act proportionately and accept that we are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC259"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC259</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

dealing with human beings who deserve to be treated properly and with respect. For that reason, we have not done as she suggests and deleted Clause 18, saying simply that all of these activities should fall within the scope of regulated activity.
</p>

<a name="60503-43_para26"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_182"></a>We believe that there are activities covered by this clause which should not be regulated activities preventing all individuals who are placed on the children&#039;s barred list engaging in them. It may be possible for some to be employed safely in these posts because they do not entail any close involvement with children or vulnerable adults. Earlier the noble Lord, Lord Laming, gave us examples of where that might apply. We could multiply those instances. For example, an individual may be on the barred list because she lost her temper and hit a child while teaching in a school, but there is no evidence that she would present a risk of harm to children if she was, say, a receptionist in a dental surgery, which would be covered as a controlled activity. A reasonable person assessing the situation would agree that there is a distinction between those two types of activity which, in fairness and justice, is one that deserves to be made in the legislation. It is not right simply to treat all these activities simply as regulated activities.
</p>

<a name="60503-43_para27"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_183"></a>However, for that distinction to be made and for there to be a category of employment that is not regulated and therefore barred to those on the list, we need appropriate safeguards. The passage repeated from paragraph 26 of my note reflects our discussions so far with employers on what might be the appropriate safeguards. I should stress here that everything depends on the context. It may not be that all the safeguards set out in paragraph 26 would be appropriate. It is a list of the types of additional controls or supervisory arrangements that might well apply. We do not say that they need all be used in each individual case.
</p>

<a name="60503-43_para28"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_184"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether this would be worthwhile for employers. It is for employers to make that judgment. If an employer decides because of the nature of the potential risk that an employee might pose that the scale of the supervisory arrangements that it would be necessary to put in place would be so large that it would be impractical for the individual to perform their job, then the employer would conclude that they should not employ that person. But our view is that those decisions should be made fairly by employers. In the case of this controlled activity which does not involve frequent contact with children in the manner of regulated activity, these decisions should be left to employers with appropriate safeguards.
</p>

<a name="60503-43_para29"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_185"></a>On that basis, we believe that it is right for Clause 18 to stand part of the Bill, but we will continue to consult with stakeholders on what are the appropriate arrangements to recommend in guidance for those employing individuals who need to be controlled.

an employer can put into place to ensure that someone working in a controlled activity would not present a danger to children do not all have to be implemented for each individual employee. But choosing the most appropriate safeguards in any individual case requires a considerable level of expertise and understanding on the part of the employer. That is a deep concern of mine because while many employers will have such a level of expertise, others will not. They will not know which appropriate safeguards would make it safe to employ a barred person in a controlled activity.

If someone is using the checks incorrectly, it is possible to refuse to issue a certificate to check or to suspend or cancel the registration of that person or organisation. I am concerned that organisations will not be completely <br>&nbsp;<br>

clear about their duties under the new scheme, especially at the outset. As a result, particularly in light of the criminal offences contained in the Bill, many will tend to err on the side of caution and check more people in their organisations than is strictly necessary. I do not believe it is helpful for that to result in an automatic suspension of their ability to undertake CRB checks. I should like to see alternative sanctions made available, depending on the reason for the inappropriate use of CRB checks. If the only sanction is the removal of registration and the ability to check, that could affect an employer&#039;s capacity to protect children by checking other people.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_197"></a>I have with me the new regulations which have just come into force in respect of the registered body network and the new code of practice, which has also just come into force. The best response I can give the noble Baroness is to say that I will write to her on the specific points, because I am told that these provide a more expansive range of sanctions, which I believe would meet her concerns. However, because I was not sure of her precise point&#151;and at the moment I regret that I am no expert on the Police Act 1997 (Criminal Records) (Amendment) Regulations 2006&#151;an admission of ignorance is probably my best defence. I will write to her, but I am told by my advisers that I can meet her concerns. I look forward to being able to do so.

&quot;(   )   The harm test may only be satisfied where statements attesting to the harm test described in subsection (5) are provided by two individuals associated with the regulated activity provider both of whom have experience in the provision of regulated activity.&quot;

<p><a name="gc_st_94"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment relates to the harm test, and to the circumstances in which a regulated activity provider thinks the harm test is satisfied, and then looks further at the definition of this. The intention behind this amendment&#151;which, no doubt, is appallingly drafted and even were its sentiment accepted by my noble friend, would require extensive further work&#151;is to avoid situations in which the barring board is confronted with a single statement <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC263"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC263</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

from an individual&#039;s employer, against which there may be a statement from the individual saying, &quot;This is rubbish, and is completely unfair&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60503-45_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_220"></a>I have read with great interest the letter my noble friend has circulated to the Committee on discretionary barring on the basis of the risk of harm. It talks about circumstances in which there is clear psychological or medical evidence that an individual has an inclination to cause harm. In some senses that is a clear and defined set of circumstances, though I am not entirely sure how well that would all work.
</p>

<a name="60503-45_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_221"></a>On Second Reading, I referred to circumstances that I had been aware of, when I was involved in local authority social services, where there was real professional concern about an individual&#039;s behaviour&#151;towards children, in that case, but it could equally have been vulnerable adults in care. That professional concern was not amenable to proof in terms of finding a disciplinary matter, because it never got to that stage; it was the professional concern of someone who has worked in that field for a long time who feels that the way an individual relates to the people in their care is inappropriate. The no doubt dubious process then followed by my local authority at the time was to find ways to remove the individual from that task and try and avoid that happening in the future.
</p>

<a name="60503-45_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_222"></a>My belief is that the Bill would provide for circumstances in which, as opposed to psychological or medical evidence that the person might have an inclination, there was professional concern about their behaviour. The Bill covers that. I am trying to avoid circumstances in which it is simply the say-so of one person that there is that professional concern.
</p>

<a name="60503-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_223"></a>The example I cited was within a local authority. Amendment No. 143 deals with local authority providers, and Amendment No. 152 deals with other bodies. In the circumstances that I described in a local authority, an individual with professional experience would supervise the person and perhaps another individual higher up the management tree, also with substantial professional experience, would, as it were, validate the concerns expressed by the individual. He would also be aware of any other issues that might exist between the individual and his supervisor that might lead to strange things being said about the individual, and he would also have confidence in the professional judgment of the immediate supervisor.
</p>

<a name="60503-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_224"></a>So, in a local authority context, it is likely that two individuals with professional knowledge would be able to certify that professional concerns existed. However, in a voluntary organisation&#151;particularly small voluntary bodies&#151;there may well not be two people with professional experience who are able so to certify. I can conceive of circumstances in which the barring board would be placed in a very difficult position where there were very strongly felt representations expressing professional concern but no means of seeing whether those concerns were supported or endorsed by anyone else with professional experience. That would leave the barring board with a difficult and invidious decision to make.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_225"></a>It is possible that the Minister will say that the professional concerns that I have outlined are not intended to be part of the Bill. In that case, I think that there is an omission in the Bill because it should be possible somehow to pick up those concerns, and I suspect that in the past they have been picked up in variety of ways&#151;some formal and some informal. But if it is intended that these professional concerns should be covered in the Bill, I think that we have to build in some safeguards, particularly in small organisations, to ensure that there is a system of validation.
</p>

<a name="60503-45_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_226"></a>As I said, I have no affection for the drafting of the amendment&#151;I suspect that it is inadequately drafted&#151;but its purpose is to try to ensure that, in making such statements, the barring board is provided with a statement, and some confirmation of that statement by another professional.

From a cursory look at Amendment No. 128, I would say that at least it illustrates well what the noble Lord is trying to achieve. I look forward to hearing whether the Minister has been able to find a way to accommodate this important and difficult point.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_96"></a>
<a name="60503-45_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   Any concerns raised by my noble friend, who has vast experience in this area, we take with the utmost seriousness. I have gone in some detail into the concerns that he set out at Second Reading on precisely this point. I am satisfied that the position that we have reached in the Bill is satisfactory when all the elements of the duty on employers to refer are understood.
</p>

<a name="60503-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_227"></a>At Second Reading, my noble friend said that under Clause 27:
</p>

<a name="60503-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_228"></a>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_57"></a>&quot;A regulated activity provider must provide the IBB with information in certain circumstances where the regulated activity provider,</p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-45_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_230"></a>The last line is a direct quotation from Clause 27(4)(c). The clause then goes on to define the harm test with the five elements set out in subsection (5). My noble friend went on to say at Second Reading:

<a name="60503-45_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_231"></a>

<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-45_para14"></a>

<a name="60503-45_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_236"></a>the provision of such information. My noble friend then said:
</p>

<a name="60503-45_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_237"></a>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_63"></a>&quot;Perhaps it should do so, given that this is about something which it is thought might happen&quot;,&#151;[<i>Official Report, </i>28/3/06; col. 745.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-45_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_238"></a>in the future.
</p>

<a name="60503-45_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_239"></a>We are talking about hypothetical situations that could, in those circumstances, be the cause of malicious or vexatious references to the IBB: a particular concern of my noble friend&#039;s which has given rise to his later amendment. I believe we can meet him on that point. It would be a significant disincentive for uncorroborated allegations being put to the IBB that are malicious or vexatious if those making such allegations would be subject to claims for damages under amendments that I hope we can bring forward on Report.
</p>

<a name="60503-45_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_240"></a>However, I would like to take my noble friend through Clauses 27 and 30, because, as ever when dealing with legislation of this kind, the situation is more complex than he set out on Second Reading. In order for an employer to have a duty to refer under Clause 27, it is not sufficient for subsection (4) to be satisfied. An employer must satisfy subsection (2) as well; that is, the employer must have withdrawn permission for P, the relevant person, to engage in an activity for a reason mentioned in subsection (4)&#151;so, in practical terms, they must have dismissed them&#151;or, if they do not withdraw permission for such a reason, but would or might have done so if P had not otherwise ceased to engage in that activity, that is the first condition that must be satisfied.
</p>

<a name="60503-45_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_241"></a>I think my noble friend would agree that that is a very high threshold to meet. It is not simply a case of one or two freestanding allegations. Those allegations come into play only if Clause 27(2) is first met; namely, that the employer withdraws permission for P to engage in the activity for a reason mentioned in subsection (4), of which the harm test is one, or would have done so if P had not otherwise ceased to engage in the activity. There is a double test here, and the harm test, set out in subsection (5), needs to be seen in the context of the fact that there is a duty on the employer to refer only if they either have in effect dismissed the individual concerned or would have done so if the individual had not ceased to engage in that employment.
</p>

<a name="60503-45_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_242"></a>With regard to Clause 30, which invokes the duties of local authorities to refer&#151;wearing their social services hat, as distinct from their employer hat&#151;there are again three conditions to be met. First, there is the conduct test in Clause 30(2) or, as my noble friend mentioned, there is the harm test, set out in Clause 30(3). As well as that test they must also satisfy the two conditions in subsection (4), which begins:
</p>

<a name="60503-45_para23"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_243"></a>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_64"></a>&quot;The second condition is that the local authority think . . . &quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-45_para24"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_244"></a>Those conditions are,

<a name="60503-45_para25"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_245"></a>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_65"></a>&quot;that the person is engaged or may engage in regulated activity or controlled activity&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-45_para26"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_246"></a>and,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_66"></a>&quot;that IBB may consider it appropriate for the person to be included in a barred list&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60503-45_para28"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_247"></a>The thresholds are higher than my noble friend may have feared, because in respect of the duties of local authorities as employers there are the requirements in subsection (2), and in respect of their duties to refer where they are not an employer there are the conditions set out in subsection (4).
</p>

<a name="60503-45_para29"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_248"></a>When it comes to the role of the IBB itself when cases are referred to it, its duty as a professional body in this area will be to gather all the available evidence, such as any police information, any other referrals and, in some cases, further expert opinion, should it believe that that would be relevant&#151;such as, for example, a psychiatrist&#039;s report. That whole dossier of information will then be considered by the IBB, which, as the Committee agreed yesterday, will have the necessary expertise to make judgments about the risk that the individual presents.
</p>

<a name="60503-45_para30"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_249"></a>We recognise that in some cases these judgments will be finely balanced, but that is the nature of the scheme and of the severity of the cases being considered. It is also a practical issue regarding the existing List 99, the Protection of Children Act list and the Protection of Vulnerable Adults list. That is precisely why we believe the IBB must contain the right mix of experts who will be qualified to make such decisions, including, as we discussed yesterday, senior individuals with extensive experience of social services in local government, who will bring to bear an expertise that I believe will be invaluable in making the kind of judgments that my noble friend highlighted.

</p>

<a name="60503-45_para31"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_250"></a>I am not in any way minimising the gravity of the issues that my noble friend raised. They are indeed serious, but I believe that the further conditions set out in Clauses 27 and 30, together with the appropriate professional judgments and processes conducted by the IBB, will meet the concerns that he raised, as well as the amendments I intend to bring forward at Report on vexatious or malicious allegations.

<a name="60503-46_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Harris of Haringey: </b>   I am enormously grateful to my noble friend for that very full and thorough reply. We will come on to malicious and vexatious allegations in a moment.

In the example that I gave&#151;I am not sure whether I can recall all the gory details&#151;it was not so much a question of withdrawing permission as of finding ways of moving an individual worker to other tasks. That may not be withdrawing permission; it is simply that the individual has ceased to work.

So that may not matter. But I am not convinced that that quite meets the point. Voluntary organisations, in particular, may raise concerns only when an individual has left their employ. In that context, there may be a need for validation.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_252"></a>I also accept what my noble friend said about what will happen when such issues reach the Independent Barring Board. We all expect that it will not simply rely on a single referral but will consider all the matters in the round. This displays my ignorance as I have not read all the documentation as thoroughly as I might have done, but I am not clear whether it is in a position to require a psychiatric assessment of individuals if it is felt that that might be helpful in reaching a determination. I am sure that that is covered somewhere.

<p><a name="gc_st_99"></a>
<a name="60503-46_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Harris of Haringey: </b>   That is very helpful. I am sure that the board will consider all the other matters. That may be sufficient grounds for allaying my concern because a single uncorroborated professional concern would then be assessed along with lots of other matters. If there were two sets of professional concerns, that would weigh in the balance more on one side than the other.

<a name="60503-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_253"></a>I still think that thought needs to be given to regulated activity providers so that they are aware that more note will be taken of a referral under circumstances in which more information is provided or more than one person is able to certify that there are professional concerns. Perhaps that can be addressed in guidance.

<a name="60503-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_254"></a>I have fewer concerns about local authorities and their duty to refer because a series of checks and balances applies internally.

</p>

<a name="60503-46_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_256"></a>in regulated activity. That does not seem a very strong test. The person may engage in it in the future if that is the sort of thing in which he is interested.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_100"></a>
<a name="60503-46_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   The local authority must think both (a) and (b)&#151;if my noble friend follows; it must think both that the person is engaged or may engage in regulated activity and it must think that the IBB may consider it appropriate for the person to be included in a barred list. So the local authority&#151;which, as my noble friend said, is a professional body with professional staff&#151;would have to be of the view that the concerns that had been raised were such that it believed it would be appropriate for the person to be included in a barred list. It would have to make the referral in those circumstances.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_101"></a>

<a name="column_GC268"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC268</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

significantly changes the position because, if there is professional concern that the individual may engage in regulated or controlled activity, the local authority presumably also thinks that it is sufficiently serious that the IBB will consider it appropriate for the individual to be included. That is its professional opinion and that is why it has referred the case.
</p>

<a name="60503-46_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_257"></a>However, I take my noble friend&#039;s point that several tests have to be followed. I assume that, in the context of the guidance that will be issued, it will be made clearer to regulated activity providers, to local authorities and to everyone else under what circumstances they should refer professional concerns, and what they need to do to provide supporting material in respect of such professional concerns&#151;those are not in the standard of proof but add to the matters that will be weighed in the balance by the IBB. It would be helpful if my noble friend could indicate that such matters will be covered thoroughly in guidance. If he can give me that assurance, I shall reflect on what he says.

<p><a name="gc_st_127"></a>
<a name="60503-48_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   After that marathon, I rise to oppose Clause 40. The clause provides for how Northern Ireland is brought under the Bill. It is important that new vetting and barring arrangements are taken forward on a UK-wide basis. They need both to reflect local circumstances and to knit together to form a seamless protection across each jurisdiction.
</p>

<a name="60503-48_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_314"></a>Northern Ireland has tended to lead vetting and barring arrangements in the UK and there has been much investment from government, NGOs and the Children&#039;s Commissioner&#039;s office in system improvements&#151;in particular, investment in good practice arrangements and through the unique accreditation arrangements contained in Article 18 of the Protection of Children and Vulnerable Adults (Northern Ireland) Order, which previously I have held up as a good example. Accreditation has strengths in relation to the types of organisations found in the faith, voluntary and sporting sectors. For example, a church will contain positions that are regulated, such as that of a Sunday school teacher, and those that are not&#151;notwithstanding that children move across all those boundaries. Accreditation works to ensure that good standards are in place across the whole of the organisation, while requiring vetting and reporting on positions that are regulated.
<a name="gc_time_8"></a>
<a name="60503-48_time0"></a><h5>6.30 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60503-48_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_315"></a>There is an emphasis in the Bill on regulation and sanctions. One of its major weaknesses lies in the assumption that vetting in itself will protect children and in regard to the need for vetting to be part of a good practice approach and positive measures. Accreditation arrangements, if added to the Bill, may significantly address that issue. I should therefore like to ask the Minister three questions. Why, if the Government are talking about UK consistency in vetting and barring systems, did they not consider adopting the concept of accreditation from Northern Ireland? Secondly, could accreditation be used as a positive method to system-improve vetting that takes it beyond simple checking of staff? It could be dovetailed with regulated and controlled positions. Thirdly, while certain posts, particularly in sporting and Church groups and in the voluntary sector, will become regulated under Schedule 2(2), many activities in the organisations will not. So does the Minister accept that children move across those boundaries and have contact with adults in a wide range of ways? <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC273"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC273</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Accreditation would ensure that the whole organisation worked to make certain that children were protected.
</p>

<a name="60503-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_316"></a>It is unfortunate that, because of the suspension of devolution and the limited provisions for Northern Ireland law-making at Parliament, a significant piece of social welfare legislation is being taken forward by a negative resolution clause. While I am concerned about making legislation this way, I would be happy to withdraw my objection to Clause 40 if the Minister could assure me on four issues: first, that the negative resolution clause will allow sufficient flexibility to facilitate the dovetailing and customisation of the main provisions in the Bill in Northern Ireland to suit local circumstances and issues; secondly, that there will be full consultation and involvement of interested parties and stakeholders in the development of the Order in Council and regulations in Northern Ireland; thirdly, that the arrangements will incorporate the unique accreditation provisions in the protection of children and vulnerable adults order which promote good employment practice and child-protection standards in non-regulated organisations; and, fourthly, that the IBB will ensure that it has a local Northern Ireland presence in case work and Northern Ireland expertise in barring decisions that relate to that jurisdiction. I wonder whether the Minister can help me on those matters.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_128"></a>
<a name="60503-48_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   The noble Baroness has asked me a large number of questions. I am not sure, because I have not been able to note them all down, that I will answer them all, but I will look very carefully at what she said in <i>Hansard</i> and write to her afterwards to deal with all the issues that she raised.
</p>

<a name="60503-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_317"></a>On the key issue of concern to the noble Baroness, which is how the new scheme will work with proposed accreditation arrangements in Northern Ireland, I believe that I can meet the concerns that she raised. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland intends to introduce a voluntary system of accreditation for non-regulated organisations that work with children and young people in Northern Ireland. The department intends to issue proposals for consultation within the next few months. Accreditation proposals as currently envisaged are much wider than the vetting of employees and volunteers and will require organisations to provide evidence of good child protection policies and procedures before accredited status will be awarded. I think that that was the noble Baroness&#039;s main concern.
</p>

<a name="60503-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_318"></a>The two other concerns I noted were the role of the IBB in Northern Ireland and the negative resolution procedure. The IBB will appoint staff whose combined expertise will cover all of the IBB&#039;s functions. Given that the IBB&#039;s functions extend to Northern Ireland, it follows that in appointing its staff the IBB will ensure that it has access to the appropriate expertise in the particular needs of Northern Ireland. Nothing in the Bill constrains the ability of the IBB to appoint staff with such expertise and we would expect it to do so. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC274"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC274</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

There is no need to constrain the operation of the IBB in primary legislation in order to respond to the particular requirements of Northern Ireland because we believe that the board is under a duty to do so, anyway.
</p>

<a name="60503-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_319"></a>The Secretary of State will consult widely on the appointment of the chairman and members of the IBB, and that consultation will of course include Northern Ireland Ministers and other stakeholders. The IBB must also publish an annual report on its functions, which will include its activities in relation to Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="60503-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_320"></a>On the negative resolution procedure, we believe that this will give the flexibility needed to ensure that Northern Ireland people have the same right to protection as their counterparts in the rest of the United Kingdom, while ensuring that their particular circumstances are fully reflected. The strength of the negative resolution procedure is that it will ensure that Northern Ireland adopts the principles and foundations of the scheme, but is able to adapt its technical and operational requirements to reflect local needs. The Government will consult on these aspects of the order, and this will include consideration of the equality obligations outlined in Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The section requires public authorities to have due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity and the desirability of promoting good relations. These duties are designed in particular to ensure that equality issues are integral to the whole range of public policy decision-making in Northern Ireland. Public authorities are required to submit equality schemes to the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and to consult widely on and screen all policies, functions and duties as they relate to Northern Ireland, and to carry out equality impact assessments of their policies in certain circumstances.
</p>

<a name="60503-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_321"></a>In the light of those requirements for consultation, which we will honour as we draw up the order, we believe that the negative resolution procedure is appropriate to meet the needs of the Province.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_129"></a>
<a name="60503-48_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I thank the Minister for that full reply and look forward to anything further that he can provide. It is a great pity that we have to pass legislation on behalf of Northern Ireland, but I hope that we are now close to the Assembly being reconvened so that it can do this for itself. It is traditional that major pieces of social welfare legislation are carried through on the basis of cross-party consensus, and I am quite sure that there will be consensus on these important provisions to protect children. I would not want to do anything to delay their implementation in the Province, but I do not want to throw the baby out with the bath water. The accreditation pilot has been highly successful and has brought enormous benefits. I am somewhat reassured by what the noble Lord has said.

&quot;COMMUNICATION OF NEW SYSTEM

<br>
 The Secretary of State will issue guidance to IBB on communication and information relating to its functions under this Act.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="gc_st_131"></a>The noble Baroness said: Given the Minister&#039;s statement yesterday that he would come back with his own version of my Amendment No 54 on information flow, I shall not move this amendment today.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_132"></a>
<a name="60503-48_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Buscombe: </b>   I rise to speak to Amendment No. 179 in this group. The amendment would ensure the consistent implementation of the Bill across a large and disparate group of employers and employees. A hugely diverse range of employers across the country will be expected to come to terms with the requirements of the Bill. Some of them will be liable to prosecution if they do not comply with those requirements. As noble Lords have warned over the past two days in Committee, there is a danger that they will carry on as normal, unaware of their legal duties. For the scheme to survive, it needs to be implemented as effectively as possible from the start. Only then will the findings of the IBB and the reprimanding of offending employers or employees build up a good reputation and provide an effective safeguard.
</p>

<a name="60503-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_324"></a>We have heard today of a number of instances where the Minister has assured us that detailed guidance will help in terms of providing clarity and certainty to some of the provisions of this legislation, and to assist in decision-making as a result of implementation. We have just had an example of that in Amendments Nos. 128 and 130, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey. They are excellent examples of why it is crucial that from the start we are provided with clear guidance, as sought in my amendment. The second part of the amendment would ensure that those in a domiciliary setting are made especially aware of their duties and the benefits available to them through this scheme.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060503/text/60503-49.htm"/>






<p><a name="gc_st_133"></a>
<a name="60503-49_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   As the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, said, I have given a number of assurances about the guidance in my remarks to the Committee today and yesterday. We intend that the guidance should deal comprehensively with the issues I have set out. It will be important over the next two years to move to a shared understanding with stakeholders and employers on the nature of conduct and harm that should trigger a referral, and to produce appropriate guidance on the ways that referrals should be handled and the way that the IBB intends to treat them. To that extent we are entirely in sympathy with the concerns that lie behind the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment.
</p>

<a name="60503-49_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_325"></a>We do not, however, think it would be helpful to introduce a statutory requirement to issue guidance, as this amendment envisages, before any part of the Bill could be commenced. That would have a more draconian effect than we think is intended. It could severely delay the implementation of the Act, because, I am told, guidance on the entire Act would have to be issued before any part of it could be commenced. That would be very unusual, especially as many parts of the Act could be commenced with no need for guidance. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC276"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC276</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

For example, the Government do not need to issue guidance to themselves with regard to those parts of the Act that they implement, such as setting up the IBB. If we do not allow those sections to be commenced earlier than the sections on which we need and intend to issue guidance, we will delay implementation of the scheme. While entirely concurring with the sentiments behind the amendment, we do not think the precise way the noble Baroness is proposing to carry it out would fit the Bill. I detected that this was a probing amendment anyway, and I hope she regards me as duly probed.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_134"></a>
<a name="60503-49_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Buscombe: </b>   It has to be probing in Grand Committee. I accept what the Minister has said, but, in the spirit of being positive about the Bill, I hope that this does not mean we will have to wait a long time for the issuing of guidance for these measures, given that the Minister said that this amendment could perhaps lead to a severe delay in implementation of the Act. From experience of other legislation passing through your Lordships&#039; House, there is genuine concern that many of the amendments we have raised have illustrated the lack of clarity on some of the detail of the Bill. It is impossible always to have that detail in the Bill, and this is not a criticism of the Bill itself, but there are many aspects for which guidance will be essential for employers and employees really to understand what their rights and responsibilities will be. We are putting a good deal of trust in the Minister and his department that every effort will be made to ensure that the guidance is drafted as quickly, efficiently and fully as possible, so that those put in the position of needing to respond to the law as soon as it is implemented will be able to respond with assurance and with the comfort that they will need to understand some of the deeper and more difficult aspects of this legislation.

<p>

&quot;SURRENDER OF PASSPORTS

<br>
(1) All persons possessing a United Kingdom passport who are placed on the children&#039;s barred list for any kind of sexual offence involving contact with a child shall be required to surrender their passport in a manner to be prescribed by and to such agency as may be designated by the Secretary of State, or where they obtain a passport for the first time they must surrender it immediately on the same terms.


<br>
(2) The passport of any person placed on the children&#039;s barred list shall only be returned to its owner upon application in a manner to be prescribed by the Secretary of State, such application to include details of the intended travel itinerary of the person and the purpose of any travel outside of the United Kingdom.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC277</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(3) It shall be an offence for any person subject to the provisions of subsection (1) to go abroad or attempt to go abroad using any form of identification other than his passport which has been made the subject of surrender under this section.

<br>
(4) It shall be an offence for any person subject to the provisions of subsection (2) knowingly to provide false information about their intended travel itinerary or knowingly to provide false information about the purpose of their intended visit overseas.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="gc_st_137"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment seeks to introduce a new clause into the Bill. I apologise that it is written in plain English so that the Committee will be able to understand exactly what it is intended to do, but I am not a lawyer. As this is my first attempt at this, I thought I would write down exactly what I want to do and see where we get to.
</p>

<a name="60503-49_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_328"></a>The amendment only affects people who have been convicted of a contact sexual offence against a child and have therefore been put on the banned list. It does not affect everyone on the banned list. At the moment, judges have a discretionary power to remove a convicted sex offender&#039;s passport, but I regret to say that the judges, their clerks and prosecuting counsel seem unaware of this power because last year only one such order was made. I do not have any information about what happened previously to that. The proposed new clause, if enacted, would simply remove that discretionary element. It would not prevent people affected by the provisions from travelling abroad, but it would mean they would have to go to the police and explain where they were going and why in order to get their passports back.
</p>

<a name="60503-49_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_329"></a>At the moment, people on the sex offenders register are supposed to report a change of address only if they are going to be away from their normal address for three days or more&#151;some Members of the Committee may remember dealing with the legislation several years ago&#151;but this is not working. With cheap flights to all kinds of destinations, one has to wonder about the effectiveness of the legislation even if the sex offenders abide by it. Many organisations and those of us who are interested in stopping prostitution and the exploitation of children abroad as well as in the UK question the effectiveness of the existing programme.
</p>

<a name="60503-49_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_330"></a>In sharp contrast, with the World Cup coming up, let us consider the position of football hooligans who, even if they have not been convicted of a criminal offence, can be made the subject of a banning order which stops them from going abroad. Indeed, in the past few months the Home Office and the Football League have been keen to announce the success of banning orders. In 2004&#150;05&#151;in the same period in which one banning order was made against a sex offender&#151;3,153 individuals were legally prevented from attending domestic and international football matches. In my view, the proposed new clause would, in essence, say to the rest of the world that we believe that protecting children overseas from British paedophiles is at least as important as protecting overseas football fans and citizens from the predations of our soccer hooligans.
</p>

<a name="60503-49_para6"></a>

<a name="60503-50_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I confess that I have read the amendment. I have two points to raise.

</p>

<a name="60503-50_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_334"></a>The other point is that I thought this issue had already been dealt with by the Sexual Offences Act 2003, on which we all worked together at great length. I am distressed to hear from the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, that it simply is not working and that only one banning order was made last year. That is surely inappropriate, given the number of known paedophiles engaged in sex tourism who have gone through our courts. It could be that there may be justification&#151;without infringement of human rights&#151;for people to have their passports kept and for them to have to ask for them back. As the noble Baroness said, it would not stop them travelling but it would give the authorities in both countries the opportunity to keep an eye on them when they do travel.

legitimate concern. My first point is that the amendment she is proposing would, of course, go significantly beyond the existing scope of the Bill. This legislation is concerned with the regulation of activity in this country and not, implicitly, in other countries, which is what would be covered by the taking away of passports. For that reason, we have not gone into this area in our examination of the issues within the Bill. That is not to say it would not be possible to extend it, but it is not our current view of what the scope of the Bill should be.
</p>

<a name="60503-50_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_336"></a>I accept that there was only one foreign travel order made in 2004&#150;05. However, I am told that we are working with the police and others to explore how the provisions of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 might be put to the best possible use. It must be borne in mind that foreign travel orders represent only one tool available to the police to prevent overseas travel should it be necessary to do so. For example, all those on the sex offenders register are required to notify the police of any foreign travel of three days&#039; duration or more. Failing to notify the police of foreign travel, as well as breaching the terms of a foreign travel order, is an offence punishable by a sentence of up to five years in prison.

I hope to be able to give her a satisfactory reply in that regard.

The point about the three days&#039; duration&#151;perhaps I did not spell this out&#151;is that you can get to Bangkok and back in that time with a cheap flight; it is proving to be not sufficient. Had I had more time, I could have given the Committee the facts and figures that ECPAT and other organisations have about sex offenders who are continuing to pursue their horrible activities in Thailand and other countries while they are on the sex offenders register. We need to address the issue one way or the other. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="gc_st_150"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment would allow Parliament to amend orders that will amend the definition of what constitutes regulated activity under Clause 5(3). I am concerned that reserving the listing of behaviour to regulations could lead to offences being inappropriately designated. The regulation-making process seems to differ from that normally adopted in a Bill, the powers arising from a combination of paragraphs 11 and 19 of Schedule 2.
</p>

<a name="60503-50_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_352"></a>Even the positive resolution procedure is a blunt tool for legislative scrutiny as it does not allow amendment of a proposed regulation. Parliamentarians may agree with some, but not all, of a list of offences being included in proposed regulations, but they will be unable to amend it. It is difficult to imagine a situation in which parliamentarians, when dealing with such an important and emotive issue as the protection of children and vulnerable adults, would not vote for a list of offences leading to an absolute bar, even if they felt that conviction or caution for one or more of the offences contained on the list were not justified.
</p>

<a name="60503-50_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_353"></a>For anyone affected, the impact will be dramatic. Anyone who is given a caution for one of these offences will be subject to an absolute bar. They will not be able to make any representations and they will not be able to appeal. Similarly, parliamentarians may be concerned that the scope of regulated activity changed under Clause 5(3) is too broad or that a list of amending provisions made under Clause 47(2) is excessive. Because of that, I believe it is appropriate to enable full legislative scrutiny and parliamentary debate on such changes. The power to amend regulations should be written into the Bill. I beg to move.

<p><a name="gc_st_151"></a>
<a name="60503-51_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   A provision of the kind envisaged by the noble Baroness would be unusual, although, I am told, not absolutely unprecedented. It is so highly unusual that we are not minded to think that this would be an appropriate course to pursue&#151;not least because of the assurances that we have given about the extensive consultation that we intend to conduct before we publish the order.
</p>

<a name="60503-51_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_354"></a>I have already circulated an information note on automatic barring containing an illustrative list of offences that would lead to an automatic bar with and without representations. We are already consulting on that list, and will continue to do so, with recognised experts in the field of child protection, alongside their equally qualified colleagues from the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and other key stakeholders. With their help, we intend the list to be appropriately framed after full consultation before it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC282"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column GC282</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

goes to Parliament. We should also remember that the list is not without precedent, given the current arrangements for List 99. The prescribed offences will therefore hardly be unfamiliar to your Lordships when the order is produced.
</p>

<a name="60503-51_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_355"></a>Therefore, although I in no way minimise the gravity of the impact of the list, we do not believe that, given the circumstances of the existing law and of the consultation that will be conducted, it is of a kind to justify this highly unusual course of an order that would be amendable.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_152"></a>
<a name="60503-51_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I thank the Minister for his reply. I am of course aware that the Government have been consulting on many aspects of the Bill, but not every response has been incorporated into it. I give as an example the concerns of noble Lords about the various exemptions for regulated activity in relation to vulnerable adults under, I believe, Clause 14. Various noble Lords sought to remove some of the exemption categories. Those exemptions have been responded to by the many organisations which have come forward and asked us to remove them from the Bill. So consultations do not always take into account people&#039;s concerns. This regulation-making power does not affect only the automatic bar provisions but also the scope of regulated activity, as I said in my earlier presentation.

</p>

<a name="60503-51_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>I am today announcing my intention to engage a consultant to conduct a strategic review of the independent living funds, in the context of the Prime Minister&#039;s Strategy Unit report <i>Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People</i>.

<a name="60503-51_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>The independent living funds enable thousands of severely disabled people to live independently and we need to consider the future direction of the funds in the light of our goal of equality for disabled people and the wider context of proposed changes in social care outlined by the Department of Health White Paper <i>Our health, Our care, Our say</i>.
</p>

<a name="60503-51_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>The consultant will supply independent expert advice and carry out a public consultation in order to provide recommendations as to the future direction of the funds. The independent living funds will discharge &#163;263 million of public funds during 2006&#150;07 so it is essential that we have an independent and informed review of their role.
</p>

<a name="60503-51_para22"></a>

[HL5149]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_8"></a>
<a name="60503w01_spmin5"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  Some of the recommendations mentioned in the <i>March of Dimes</i> report cover areas which the international development community strongly promotes: family planning, control of communicable diseases in women of    reproductive age (such as syphilis, HIV/AIDs, tuberculosis and malaria), and the importance of nutrition.
</p>

<a name="60503w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>The UK Government, through the Department for International Development and the Department of Health, provides core budget support to the World Health Organisation and other agencies, such as UNICEF and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which work in these areas.
</p>

<a name="60503w01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a>UK funding, policy and programming for developing countries is focused on those activities that are likely to have the greatest impact on the main causes of newborn and childhood deaths, which include diseases such as diarrhoea, pneumonia, malaria, measles and AIDS, which are responsible for over half of these deaths. Around 40 per cent of all child deaths take place within the first month of life (and mostly within a few hours of birth). This is why    the UK Government focus on millennium development goal 5 (Improve maternal health), as part of the wider efforts to reach millennium development goal 4 (Reduce child mortality).

<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a>Single farm payments due during 2005 become subject to income tax as part of the profits of a farmer&#039;s trade included in his accounts for a period of account ending in the 2005&#150;06 tax year (or, in some cases, in the 2006&#150;07 tax year). The first income tax payment to reflect any single farm payments for 2005 will be the final instalment of income tax payable in respect of the 2005&#150;06 tax year, which is not due until 31 January 2007. If the single farm payments are taxed as part of the profits for the 2006&#150;07 tax year, that instalment of income tax will not become due until 31 January 2008.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_16"></a>Where decriminalised parking is in force, parking contraventions are enforced by local authorities. Outside London, the levels of additional parking charges (including penalty charge notices) for parking contravention are set in accordance with procedures in the Road Traffic Act 1991 and the order under that Act putting decriminalised parking in place in the local authority. In particular they must be set in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of State. Inside London, the level of additional parking charges (including penalty charge notices) is set in accordance with procedures in the Road Traffic Act 1991.

<p><a name="wa_st_22"></a>
<a name="60503w03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   The Government have a close interest in the economic effect of migration and believe that immigration is broadly positive for the UK, boosting labour market flexibility and economic growth. This view has been endorsed by a recent European Commission report that studied the impact of the accession to the European Union of central and eastern European countries in May 2004 <sup>1</sup> .
</p>

<a name="60503w03_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_19"></a>The latest official statistics (summer 2005) show that around 10&#189; per cent of people above the age of 16 were migrants, defined as people not born in the UK. Migrants typically have lower employment rates than the UK average, around 5 per cent lower, but typically earn 8 per cent more. Assuming that the higher earnings signify that migrants are, on average, more productive, this would indicate that migrants contribute around 11 per cent to total gross domestic product, and cause a small but positive increase to gross domestic product per capita.

<p><a name="wa_st_23"></a>
<a name="60503w03_spmin3"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  The Government have been concerned for some time that the international humanitarian system is under-performing, and in December 2004, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development proposed a package of six key reforms to improve the effectiveness of emergency response. The six reforms are:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_1"></a>establishment of a new global humanitarian fund;


</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_2"></a>strengthen the UN humanitarian co-ordinator system;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_5"></a>increased donor focus on &quot;forgotten&quot; or under-funded, emergencies;


</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_6"></a>increased donor funding for disaster risk reduction, and the UN international strategy for disaster reduction.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_WA78"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column WA78</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>
</p>
</ul>
<a name="60503w03_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_20"></a>The United Nations is taking forward these reforms, with the support and participation of the wider donor community, including the UK, the NGO community, and the Red Cross movement. In December 2005, a new upgraded UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) was approved by the UN General Assembly. It was launched on 9 March 2006 with $254 million from 38 donors, including $70 million from the UK. The CERF will enable UN humanitarian agencies to    respond rapidly to sudden disasters, such as earthquakes; time-critical responses in slow-onset disasters, such as famines; and essential life-saving actions in ongoing but under-funded crises. The first payments from the fund have been made for the drought in the Horn of Africa, and the deteriorating conflict situation in C&#244;te D&#039;Ivoire.
</p>

<a name="60503w03_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_21"></a>A number of proposals for strengthening the UN humanitarian co-ordinator system are being taken forward, including developing a pool of suitable candidates and associated training. Alongside this, the UK is leading seven other donors in piloting pooled country level funding in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo during 2006. The UK is also providing support to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the UN Children&#039;s Fund (UNICEF) in developing a set of global humanitarian performance benchmarks, initially for mortality, nutrition, and health. The Government have supported progress over the past 12 months in reforming the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, and also launched their new Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy in March 2006.
</p>

<a name="60503w03_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_22"></a>In September 2005, the UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee, which deals with humanitarian issues, established a new &quot;cluster&quot; system to deliver more accountable and predictable humanitarian response. Certain agencies have responsibility for co-ordinating the response in key under-performing sectors, and developing networks, or clusters, of other agencies and NGOs to work together to improve capacity, performance, and effectiveness. The UK Government are currently considering, along with other donors, how best to support this initiative.
</p>

<a name="60503w03_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_23"></a>In January 2006, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development called for further reform of the international humanitarian system by improving the quality and focus of the UN Flash Appeals system; developing agreements on the use of military assets; and for more accountability in humanitarian response on funding, performance, and impact of assistance on beneficiary communities.

</p>

<a name="60503w03_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_24"></a>The Government will consider carefully the findings and recommendations of the forthcoming inter-agency evaluation of the response to the Asian tsunami, and any reviews of the Pakistan earthquake, to assess whether further improvements to the international humanitarian system might be necessary. It is too early to assess the impact of the response to the Horn of Africa drought.

</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_27"></a>What recent steps they have taken through aid and other programmes to increase economic and education opportunities in (a) India, and (b) Pakistan in order to reduce poverty.  [HL5209]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_24"></a>
<a name="60503w04_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b> 
</p>

<a name="60503w04_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_25"></a><i>India</i>
</p>

<a name="60503w04_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_26"></a>DfID&#039;s largest aid programme is to India, where we provided &#163;245 million in 2005&#150;06. All DfID&#039;s support is aimed at reducing poverty, which as we know has many, inter-linked dimensions, including low levels of income, assets, literacy and well-being. DfID&#039;s largest programmes in India are in education and health which have an indirect but very significant impact on economic opportunities for the poor.
</p>

<a name="60503w04_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_27"></a>India is making impressive progress in growing its economy and reducing income poverty, and DfID contributes to this in a number of ways. Nationally, working with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), DfID assists the Government of India to make their increasingly open trade regime deliver their potential for promoting sustainable growth and reducing poverty. In Orissa, one of the poorest states in India, DfID is working with the Government to improve the investment climate through measures such as simplifying regulations facing businesses. DfID supports several micro finance programmes to promote access to credit and other financial services to poor people, both within India and in having better information about money transfer services for remittances from family and friends working abroad.
</p>

<a name="60503w04_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_28"></a>DfID supports rural livelihood programmes in Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa, which are designed to improve economic opportunities for poor people through increasing access to markets and diversifying livelihoods in the agricultural and non-farm sectors.

</p>

<a name="60503w04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_29"></a>DfID supports governments and municipal authorities in Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh in efforts to improve urban management and the urban environment, particularly for poor people and slum-dwellers. Many aspects of these programmes will increase economic opportunities&#151;e.g. by reducing the cost or time to fetch clean water, by improving roads to better link people, jobs and goods and services. There is also a local economic development component to these programmes, including business or skills training and grants for starting small businesses.
</p>

<a name="60503w04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_30"></a>DfID also assists the Governments of Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh with power sector programmes which are designed to improve efficiency and financial sustainability of the power sector in these states. Better-run services should reduce power outages and so remove a major constraint on firms&#039; productivity, increasing investment and jobs in a range of sectors.

</p>

<a name="60503w04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_31"></a>To increase educational opportunities, for the past two years DfID has been supporting the Indian Government&#039;s flagship Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) universal elementary education programme, together with the World Bank and the European Commission. DfID&#039;s commitment is &#163;210 million over the five years 2003&#150;04 to 2007&#150;08. SSA is the central government&#039;s prime vehicle for delivering on the universal primary education MDG and the 2002 constitutional amendment that made elementary education a fundamental right. The aim is to ensure that by 2015 all children in India are receiving eight years of basic education of acceptable quality, regardless of sex, caste, creed, family income or location.
</p>

<a name="60503w04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_32"></a>SSA is a priority for the Indian Government, who have greatly increased their funding of the programme in the past two years, in part funded by an earmarked tax. Large numbers of teachers are being recruited and trained, teaching and learning materials are in mass production, new schools and classrooms are under construction and there has been a huge drive to get children into school. Remarkable progress is being made:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_7"></a>enrolments for 2004&#150;05 among the 6&#150;14 years age group have reached 94 per cent (201 million children);


</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_8"></a>the number of out-of-school children has fallen from 25 million in 2003 to 13.5 million in March 2005;


</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_9"></a>drop out rates have fallen; and


</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_10"></a>strong progress has been made towards gender and social equity, including for scheduled caste children and children with disabilities.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="60503w04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_33"></a>The remarkable progress with SSA is helping to ensure that all girls and boys in India can have the opportunity to complete a full course of primary education, though further large-scale investments in the primary education system are needed to achieve that.
</p>

<a name="60503w04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_34"></a>DfID and other UK government departments are also supporting the Indian Government to access information, ideas and experience from the UK and elsewhere in diverse areas of education and skills development.
</p>

<a name="60503w04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_35"></a>Increasing economic and education opportunities is recognised and appreciated by our partners in India and is set to remain a key part of our support to India.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_36"></a><i>Pakistan</i>
</p>

<a name="60503w04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_37"></a>DfID Pakistan became a fully devolved operation in Islamabad only at the beginning of 2005. It has agreed a country assistance grant programme worth &#163;236 million with the Government of Pakistan for the period 2005&#150;06 to 2008&#150;09. Poverty reduction in all its many facets is the central focus of the programme, which operates under three major pillars: (a) income growth (including access to microfinance), (b) accountability of the state to its citizens (good and better governance) and (c) service delivery (including education, health and water and sanitation).
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WA81"></a>

<b>3 May 2006 : Column WA81</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60503w04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_38"></a>DfID recently released the first &#163;20 million tranche of the &#163;85 million poverty reduction budget support programme to the Government of Pakistan. Among the indicators for the first year is a requirement for increased social sector spending by the Government. This increased money in the Government of Pakistan&#039;s budget will have a national impact on improved education in Pakistan.
</p>

<a name="60503w04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_39"></a>In addition to this, 17 per cent of the recently approved devolved social services programme in Punjab (total value $220 million) will be spent in the education sector, with a significant emphasis on adult literacy, a major issue for Pakistan where over 40 per cent of the population is illiterate. The aim of the programme is to achieve progress on the millennium development goals related to poverty, gender, education, health, and water and sanitation, with the purpose being to strengthen devolved social services for more equitable, efficient and sustainable delivery of social services in Punjab.
</p>

<a name="60503w04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_40"></a>In direct education programming, we are providing &#163;700,000 of funding to the National Education Assessment System, in collaboration with the World Bank. This programme is a government-led system of testing to establish quality of learning and the factors that influence that learning. Findings from the tests will help the Government of Pakistan better to address areas of concern in the education system, such as curriculum and teacher training, thereby improving the overall quality of the education system.
</p>

<a name="60503w04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_41"></a>DfID is actively supporting the Government of Pakistan&#039;s Poverty Reduction Strategy, which focuses on increasing incomes and employment opportunities for the poor through sustained economic growth. DfID poverty reduction budget support is aimed at helping the Government of Pakistan achieve their targets of accelerating economic growth while providing adequate social safety nets for the marginalised.
</p>

<a name="60503w04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_42"></a>On economic opportunities for the poor, DfID is providing &#163;20 million for increasing access to micro-finance through two large NGOs, the Kashf Foundation and Rural Support Programmes Network (RSPN). With DfID support, Kashf is targeting to increase its clients (mostly poor women) from 75,000 to 300,000 in five years. The RSPN programme provides micro-finance, social mobilisation and building small-scale infrastructure to improve livelihoods.
</p>

<a name="60503w04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_43"></a>DfID is also helping the Government of Pakistan to improve access to finance through analytical studies and information sharing on global best practices. The Government have asked us to support a household survey that would ascertain a baseline on access to financial services in Pakistan. As part of this programme, we recently submitted a report to the Government on the potential for increasing the level of remittances (mostly from the UK) to re-habilitate the earthquake affected household in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and the North West Frontier Province (NWFP).

<a name="60503w04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_44"></a>DfID is also helping to improve the enabling environment for investment and private sector development. In this connection, DfID is providing &#163;12 million to support a tax administration reforms programme. The programme aims at improving the tax administration culture through automation, capacity building and reducing corruption. DfID is also supporting the development of a competition framework and investment climate assessment.
</p>

<a name="60503w04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_45"></a>In the Punjab province, DfID is helping the provincial government to develop a vision for private sector development and creation of employment opportunities. The programme focuses on improved infrastructure, reduced barriers to business and improved communication networks. DfID is also considering a large programme to improve income growth opportunities in the poorer districts of Punjab and NWFP.

With over 3,200 deaths per week in Zimbabwe relating to AIDS, the number of orphans has already risen to approximately 1.3 million.

DfID is currently at an advanced stage in developing a new phase of support, jointly with other donors, which will include scaling up AIDS treatment in Zimbabwe. The aim is to establish a UN-managed multi-donor fund for procurement of anti-retroviral drugs, including paediatric formulations, that will be delivered through the public health service. This has necessarily involved UN-led technical discussions with the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, which have been constructive. No DfID funding is going directly to the Government of Zimbabwe.

<a name="60503w08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_64"></a>Along with other donors, DfID has also contributed &#163;23 million to a UNICEF-led programme of support for Zimbabwe&#039;s National Plan of Action for Orphans and Vulnerable Children. This programme offers grants to non-governmental organisations, faith-based organisations and their partners at the community level. Many children with AIDS will benefit from this programme. Priorities include keeping children in school and protecting children from all forms of abuse.
