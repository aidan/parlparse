The number of terminal passengers travelling through Heathrow in December 2010 was down by around 10 per cent compared with 2009, mainly due to severe weather disruption. As a result some UK firms might have lost revenue, although there is currently no basis for quantifying this. In some cases firms might have mitigated impacts, for example through video conferencing.</p>

The Spanish owners of Heathrow borrowed the money to buy it, thus leaving themselves too impoverished to invest in the infrastructure necessary

This is confirmed by the <I>Financial Times</I> of 21 December. Do the Government think that so many of our key national institutions should be available to anyone, from anywhere, who can borrow the money to buy them?</p>

That is why we are continuing to invest in our infrastructure despite the economic situation. As for the ownership of BAA, there was an agreement with airlines about the level of residence to be provided this winter. However, 16 centimetres of snow in one hour far exceeded the agreed provision. I am not sure that ownership is relevant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="11013110000005"></a>I have to apologise to the House, as last week I said that Heathrow had 24 aircraft stands with snowbound aircraft on them. I should have said that there were 200 such stands.</p>

The Civil Aviation Authority is taking forward work to understand more fully the impact of disruption on passengers to help to inform a decision on whether regulatory change is needed to balance the cost of disruption to passengers and business against the cost of dealing with severe weather.</p>

The motorway between Glasgow and Edinburgh was closed for two days, yet as far as I know has not been privatised. Is not the real issue whether we will have winters like this on a regular basis, and whether we need to invest in our infrastructure-our roads, our airports and the rest-to prevent our country from looking ridiculous in the eyes of the rest of the world?</p>

BAA is responsible for keeping the runways and taxiways clear, but the airlines are responsible for de-icing the aircraft. I asked about the environmental impact of the de-icing fluid, which is a glycol-based chemical. I was advised that the de-icers are intercepted and the effluent is reprocessed.</p>

This is a rolling programme over the length of the Parliament, and individual departments are engaging with representatives of employer and employee groups. As part of this, last Thursday we announced a consultation on reforming the employment tribunal system, which followed discussion with a range of stakeholders including the CBI, the TUC and the British Chambers of Commerce. This consultation will last until 20 April 2011.</p>

Indeed, it will be impossible to seek redress unless the employment has lasted for two years or more. In other words, that will apply to a large section of the workforce. This is at a time when many working people are already concerned about employment and their future prospects. What does the Business Secretary think he is doing? Surely he should be doing everything possible to keep people in employment rather than on benefits.</p>

This change, if implemented, would return the law to as it was until 1999. We believe that this is fair to employees and employers. It is fair to employers, because it gives businesses the confidence to take on staff that they may not have employed otherwise, particularly in small and medium-sized companies. It will also encourage employees to have a longer time to prove that they are the right person for the job and a longer time to prove their skills, and we hope that fewer and fewer cases will finish up in the courts. We feel that this is a good move and we hope that the Opposition will help us to develop it through the consultation period, which will last until 20 April.</p>

We are hoping to achieve earlier resolutions to workplace disputes so that both parties can resolve their problems in a way that is fair and equitable for both sides without having to go to an employment tribunal. We want to ensure, when parties need to come to an employment tribunal, that the process is as swift, user friendly and effective as possible. We hope very much indeed that we will be able to use ACAS more and more, and we are consulting with it at the moment.</p>

As she rightly said, the legislation has been there since 1999, due of course to the efforts of the Labour Government at that time to ensure that where there is inequity between the power of the employee and the power of the employer, fairness should be achieved through the work of the employment tribunals.</p>

What we are looking for here is flexibility for businesses, especially small and medium-sized businesses, to give them confidence, and fairness for employees. We hope and we know that the so-called "day one rights" will stay in place. The proposals will not affect the existing "day one rights" of people when they start to bring a case for unfair dismissal; for example, when they believe that gender, race or some other form of discrimination has taken place, or where someone is dismissed for exercising their legal rights, such as asking for a written statement or to be paid the national minimum wage. The proposals relate to the areas where we do not wish people to rush first to a tribunal. If the qualifying period is only one year, it means that everything starts to happen too quickly. I know through my business experience people who have come to work with no experience. It takes them a while to get used to the job, and extending the time will make the employer and employees take a better look at each other and see whether they can keep themselves together, rather than rushing to tribunals and not going to ACAS first.</p>

Although the rate of inflation has increased over the past months, the committee's view is that inflation is likely to fall back to target during 2012, as the impact of temporary factors wanes, but the timing and extent of that decline in inflation are uncertain due to the margin of spare capacity in the economy.</p>

I think there was a question at the end of it. It is precisely because the Government took resolute and early action to restore the fiscal position to one that pulls us back from the brink of the disaster which the previous Government left us with that the Bank of England can conduct monetary policy on a prudent basis and, as I said in my earlier Answer, all forecasters that I know of are forecasting that inflation is likely to come back towards the target range.</p>

That is why the Government are taking steps to take almost 900,000 people out of the tax net this April; that is why, under the coalition Government's plans, 23 million taxpayers will be up to £170 better off next year than they would otherwise be; that is why we are reducing corporation tax from 28 to 24 per cent with other measures to make sure that we get the economy growing again.</p>

In fact they are not rising because, according to the ONS, the statistics now include, for the first time, three public sector banks, which pay out about £25 billion to people.

All I can say is that, if we are talking about the City, the Treasury's latest comparison of independent inflation forecasts from City and other commentators in mid-December shows that the City is forecasting inflation to come down to 1.8 per cent in 2012 and then to be steady at 2 per cent thereafter.</p>

That is the only exception that has ever been made.

Our amendments very much reflect a number of critical points that we discussed in Grand Committee.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="11013110000066"></a>Perhaps I should start with Amendment 4, on which Amendments 1 and 2 are essentially consequential. We are talking here about the independence of the OBR. Amendment 4 will formalise the role of the non-executive directors in reporting on the extent to which the OBR's duty has been performed, in accordance with Clauses 5(1) and 5(2) of the Bill. To ensure the OBR's credibility, it is important that the OBR is able to operate with the complete discretion provided for at Clause 5(1) and in line with the principles of Clause 5(2). Amendment 4 provides a mechanism for the non-executive directors to report on anything that they believe has prevented the OBR from carrying out its duty with complete discretion and "objectively, transparently and impartially". Such a report will feature as part of the OBR's annual report, which is to be laid before Parliament. For example, the non-execs might report on any interference with the preparation and publication of the OBR's reports or any attempt to control the OBR through manipulating its budget.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="11013110000067"></a>Amendment 12 will remove the provision that states that the charter may include guidance on Clauses 5(2) and 5(3). That will address the particular concern raised in Grand Committee that the charter could be used to redefine the commonly used terms "objectively, transparently and impartially". It is not the Government's intention to subvert what these terms mean through the charter. The amendment will therefore remove the marker that strongly indicates that the charter will define what these terms mean.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="11013110000068"></a>Amendment 13 will change the process for amending the guidance in the charter. Concerns were raised in Committee that such modifications could be done too easily, which would again undermine the independence of the OBR. Amendment 13 requires the Treasury to publish any revisions to the guidance at least 28 days before the modified charter is laid before Parliament for approval in another place. This period of 28 days, which is consistent with the period used in other secondary legislation, will provide further opportunity for scrutiny of and comment on the guidance before it is voted on. If appropriate, the Government could respond to, or make changes in the light of, this scrutiny before the formal version is laid for approval.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="11013110000069"></a>Other safeguards remain in place. The charter is limited to considering the functions conferred on the OBR in the Bill and cannot add or distort them. The charter must also be approved by an affirmative resolution in another place before it comes into force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="11013110000070"></a>Amendment 11 will clarify the drafting of Clause 5(3) to make explicit that the OBR must have regard to government policies relevant to its analysis, including the Government's economic policies. The amendment preserves the original effect of Clause 5(3), which is to prevent the OBR from examining non-government policies. Otherwise, the OBR could be drawn into political commentary, which might undermine its perceived impartiality and independence. The OBR will continue to be able to analyse non-policy scenarios such as economic or demographic scenarios. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="11013110000072"></a>An essential difficulty with the structure of the OBR is that the OBR is to be both outside government and yet of government. The goal of the Bill is to make the OBR independent-a goal that we on this side fully support-yet, as the provider of the official forecast, the OBR is an essential part of policy-making and must be closely involved with the development and costing of government programmes. As the draft charter states,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="11013110000292"></a>"The Government will have full and timely access to information and assistance from the OBR".</p>

<p><a name="11013110000273"></a>A very obvious manifestation of the resultant ambiguities is that the Treasury is planning to retain forecasting skills in order that Ministers may make informed judgments on the impact of various policies. As the noble Lord made clear in Committee, this may lead to the extraordinary situation in which the Treasury could reject the official forecast. Such paradoxes are the inevitable outcome of the peculiar, ambiguous status of the OBR.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="11013110000073"></a>Given this peculiar status, it has been the objective of this side of the House to reinforce the independence of the OBR wherever we might. After all, if there is  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1189"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1189</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not widespread confidence in that independence, the legislation will have failed. To that end, I am pleased that the Government have-in the form of Amendments 1, 2 and 4-accepted our argument that the non-executive members of the OBR should be given clear roles, including, most importantly, that of guardians of the independence of the OBR and, as we shall see in later amendments to be considered by the House, that of securing third-party monitoring of the OBR's performance. We are pleased to support Amendments 1, 2 and 4.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="11013110000074"></a>There are two other important amendments in this heterogeneous group-I am sure that, listening to the Minister introducing the amendments, noble Lords might have been rather puzzled about why they are in a single group. Following suggestions made by this side and by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, Amendment 11 clarifies the previously obscurantist Clause 5(3). Will the Minister confirm that Clause 5(3) as amended will ensure that the evaluation of the relevant government policies will essentially be part and parcel of all the OBR's work, including the work outlined and defined in the charter?</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="11013110000075"></a>Amendment 12 is an acceptance of our argument that it is preposterous that the Treasury should, via the charter, be able to qualify the meaning of the requirement for the OBR to perform its duties "objectively, transparently and impartially". I am delighted that the amendment will remove that nonsense. Will the Minister make it clear that the remaining requirement-which is, so to speak, all that is left-in Clause 6, which provides that the charter</p>
<ul><a name="11013110000332"></a>"may include guidance to the Office about how it should perform its duty under section 4, including (in particular) guidance about ... the time at which it is to prepare any forecast, assessment or analysis",</ul>
<p><a name="11013110000274"></a>can now refer only to the time at which the OBR should perform its duties under Clause 4? Do any wider, unspecified powers of direction remain? It would helpful if the Minister could clarify that, since Clause 6 will now have been changed to such an extent that it is not entirely clear what subsection (3) now refers to when it refers back to subsection (1).</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="11013110000076"></a>Finally, in Amendment 13 the Government have responded to our criticism about the lack of adequate parliamentary scrutiny of the charter by requiring that a draft of any modification be published 28 days before the charter is laid before Parliament to be approved by resolution of the House of Commons. This is an important improvement on what went before, but even so-as the noble Lord, Lord Newby, said in Committee-the charter is subject only to vestigial parliamentary scrutiny. The important word in this context is "vestigial".</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="11013110000077"></a>That raises an important issue mentioned in the notes distributed with the amendments for the Report stage. Noble Lords will recall that several elements of the charter came in for stiff criticism in Grand Committee, yet the notes that accompany this stage declare that the revised charter will be published only after the Bill has received Royal Assent. That cannot be right. The failure to provide a revised charter deprives Members of another place of the opportunity to relate the charter in the Government's preferred form to their substantive discussion of the Bill. In effect, this is the

Will the Minister give me an assurance that this underhand way of going about things will be rescinded and that the revised charter will be published in good time for its consideration by another place?</p>

<a name="11013110000078"></a><b><a name="110131-0001.htm_spnew64"></a><a name="11013110000439"></a>Lord Newby:</b> These government amendments are welcome because they recognise the discussions held in Committee. The Minister has a gone a long way towards responding to the concerns that were expressed.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="11013110000079"></a>I am particularly pleased with Amendment 11 because we spent a lot of time on this issue. Clearly, the original drafting was inadequate. Pride of authorship means that I am unhappy that the words that I suggested in Committee are not being used, but the wording in Amendment 11 will do exactly the same job, so I welcome that.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="11013110000080"></a>I also welcome Amendment 13 for the reasons suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. I have some sympathy with his last point. I cannot see why the charter cannot be presented in its final form before the Bill goes through another place. I cannot believe that there will be much to change-the charter is not a very long document-so, for the reasons given by the noble Lord, that would be an improvement on what is currently proposed.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="11013110000081"></a>I want to make a final comment on what the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, said about the Treasury retaining its own forecasting ability and what would happen if there was a dispute with the OBR. We discussed at some length in Committee why it was essential that the Treasury should retain it own forecasting abilities While it would clearly be a major source of embarrassment if the Treasury disagreed with the OBR forecast, the one good thing about the new system is that, presumably, any such disagreement would be transparent because the Treasury would have to explain that it has disagreed with the OBR and give reasons why, and there would no doubt be a huge row about it. Although that might be uncomfortable for the Government, that will at least expose all the issues that are in dispute. In the interests of transparency, surely that is a good thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="11013110000084"></a>On relevance, there are dozens of truly independent forecasting bodies all over the country, including the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which used to be chaired by the present chairman of the OBR. The issue concerns itself with the expense of a body such as this when we have not only the forecasts of the independent outside bodies but the Treasury forecasts, the Bank of England forecasts and the OBR forecasts, most of which probably will be broadly in line with the current situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="11013110000085"></a>We will never know-I have tried to find out on many different occasions-the Government's view on what should happen when they have the forecasts. The Minister has found all kinds of different ways of not answering my questions about what the Government's policy is and whether they agree with the Bank of England on keeping interest rates at 0.5 per cent, given the growing pressure-wrongly in many quarters-on the need to increase interest rates. He will not say whether he disagrees-I appreciate that he cannot disagree with or say anything different to what the Chancellor has said-but it would be nice if, at some time or another, he could answer the question of what the Government's policy is, as opposed to accepting the forecasts, which he has done on numerous occasions.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="11013110000086"></a>On the question of independence, I am worried by the constant references in the media to "the Government's in-house forecasting body, the OBR". This does not lend itself very well to the independence that we would all like to see in the OBR. I am sure Robert Chote will do his best to ensure that it is truly independent but, if it is no more independent than the dozens of existing bodies, why do we need the OBR at all? That is the question I put to the noble Lord while thanking him for the amendments he has brought forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="11013110000088"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, referred to the OBR being regarded as the Government's in-house forecasting body. I have never heard it referred to in those terms, although I know that noble Lords on the Benches opposite have tried to make that accusation stick. I believe it is already regarded as a properly independent body under its chairman, Mr Robert Chote, and we should rejoice in that.</p>

We spent a great deal of time in Grand Committee trying to bring greater clarity to the remit of the OBR and protecting its independence. We also tried to clarify the governance of the OBR and, particularly, the role of its non-executive members. The Government have responded positively to those discussions. The amendments deal very well with the bulk of the issues that were raised, particularly in clarifying those areas of the remit where there was ambiguity and the role of the non-executive members in relation to their oversight of the forecasting process and as the protectors of the external review process. That has been a success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="11013110000090"></a>I fear that there will always be a certain amount of tension between observers when it comes to the relationship between the forecasts of the OBR and the activities that take place within the Treasury. I pointed out at Second Reading that whatever arrangements are put in place for the OBR, you cannot strip the Treasury of its own skill set and the resources it needs to monitor the progress of the economy and to make judgments on whether the economy is following the track that was intended at the time that measures were

This is an arrangement that we have to live with. I am sure that as time goes on, we will see much more clearly the way in which those are worked out and how the OBR relates to the internal activities of the Treasury. I hope that noble Lords will not get too exercised about this. That is a natural tension that exists in this type of arrangement and I would be surprised if it cannot be made to work.</p>

I am very happy for noble Lords to take credit for the ideas in there, if they wish to do so. Although the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, may not quite understand or want to appreciate why we have grouped these amendments together, they all touch critically on the independence of the OBR.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="11013110000092"></a>I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Noakes for pointing out that in the OBR's short existence-even before it is within a statutory framework-Robert Chote and his colleagues have done a remarkable job through the quality and extent of their work to carve out an unchallenged reputation for quality of thinking and independence. Of course, we need to make sure that the Bill underpins that. In that context, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Burns, who speaks from a position of great authority as a former Permanent Secretary at the Treasury, for pointing out that for all the OBR's independence, HM Treasury will need to retain a separate capability to monitor and assess the progression of the economy. I thought that his admirable summary was the answer to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="11013110000093"></a>I had a sense of déjà vu, because I thought we were going back to Oral Questions with the first part of the noble Lord's intervention. We will pass over our regular sparring about the Monetary Policy Committee, but his questions on why the OBR is needed and its independence were partly answered by the noble Lord, Lord Burns. Fundamentally, over the past few years, as the previous Government redefined the cycle, there was not an appropriate degree of transparency around the forecasts, which is why we believe the OBR is necessary. I do not want to dwell on that because we spent a lot of time on that at Second Reading and in Committee.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="11013110000094"></a>The job now is to get that independence properly enshrined in the Bill, which takes me to the suggestions from the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. Also, on the comment from my noble friend Lord Newby, I am sorry that the parliamentary draftsmen did not precisely agree with his wording but grateful for confirmation that we got to the same result. On the couple of questions from the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, on Clause 5(3), indeed the OBR now has a clear and explicit duty to consider government policies in its work. That is what the OBR is essentially all about: assessing the impact of government policies and, on the back of that, whether the fiscal mandate will be met. Clause 5(3) is indeed now quite clear on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="11013110000095"></a>Clause 6(1) is quite explicit that the charter may still give guidance on other topics but there is a particular signal that the charter may give particular guidance on

When the noble Lord comes on to press me on the draft charter, I think that we will all agree on how important the transparency of the remit is. The critical point, as I hope noble Lords would agree, is that we published the draft charter early on in our discussions, to enable that to be fully considered in Committee. As my noble friend Lord Newby said, any consequential redrafting of the charter as a result of our discussions will be small.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="11013110000096"></a>The essential point is that we issued a draft charter in very good time for discussion now. There is no overwhelming need to issue a new draft, simply because not a lot will have changed. We have been clear on the issues that we have looked at again. While I hear what has been said, I do not want to prejudice how the charter and the Bill might be looked at as they go through the stages in another place, as and when we send the Bill there. I hope that answers the various points that have come up on this group of amendments.</p>

The Bill provides for this through a right of access to information, a Budget Responsibility Committee of experts and a duty to act transparently. In response to the discussion in Grand Committee, these arrangements are intended to be bolstered by the two amendments that we are bringing forward.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="11013110000098"></a>Amendment 3 gives the non-executives a duty to keep under review the processes that the OBR uses to assure that it is producing the best possible work. These are likely to be management processes that the non-executives will be well placed to consider. Examples might include: whether the OBR is consulting with a wide and appropriate range of experts, including academics and internationally; whether it is working effectively with the rest of government to produce analysis; and, to make sure that it follows up lessons from internal reviews.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="11013110000099"></a>Amendment 5 requires the non-executives committee periodically to commission independent expert reviews of the OBR's work. In detail, it needs to consider frequency: these reviews could be carried out at times considered appropriate by the non-executives, but "at  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1194"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1194</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>least" every five years. In scope, the review will consider work published in the relevant period. The non-executives will determine which of the OBR's reports are to be considered. That could be all the OBR's work or a particular theme could be focused upon. This flexibility is important to ensure that maximum value is always gained from the reviews. There is then the question of the reviewer. The non-executives would appoint a person or body with the appropriate knowledge or experience to carry out each review. Although we expect the reviews to have minimal costs, there is provision in the Bill for the OBR to make payments to the reviewers-for example, for their expenses. Each review will be published and a copy laid before Parliament. I beg to move.</p>

Amendments 3 and 5 therefore establish the responsibility of the non-executives to keep under review the activities of the OBR, relative to its main duty. An important component of this monitoring will be the commission of the third-party reviews of the OBR's performance, as described by the Minister.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="11013110000101"></a>We are entirely supportive of the Government's amendments in this respect, other than in one crucial aspect. Amendment 5 proposes that an assessment by an independent person or body should be carried out, </p>
<ul><a name="11013110000333"></a>"at least once in every relevant 5-year period".</ul>
<p><a name="11013110000275"></a>The final part of the amendment, proposed in new sub-paragraph (7), says,</p>
<ul><a name="11013110000334"></a>"the period of 5 years beginning with 1 October 2010".</ul>
<p><a name="11013110000276"></a>However, as will be evident from Amendment 6, which I shall be moving, we on this side think that five years is too long a period. First, as a professional economist, I feel that five years is much too long for an organisation to be running before its activities are assessed independently. After all, the OBR will be producing more than one report a year-in fact, there will be three or four reports-so within three years there will be a substantial body of material for an independent assessor to consider. The independent review will also have value for the OBR. It will provide informed third-party input into its techniques and procedures, and postponing that for five years will unnecessarily weaken the expertise that feeds into the OBR's work. Of course, expert appraisal of the OBR's activity will also be an important input into parliamentary scrutiny, and I think that in parliamentary terms we should want more regular consideration than is provided by this amendment.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="11013110000102"></a>That parliamentary element leads me to the second reason why five years is too long. Setting a five-year appraisal period politicises a process that should be entirely apolitical. If the Government secure the constitutional reforms that they have proposed, five years will be the length of a fixed-term Parliament; hence the OBR review will become part of a five-year political cycle. Indeed, as I emphasised to noble Lords just now  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1195"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1195</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with regard to proposed new sub-paragraph (7) in the amendment, the timing has been set carefully so that a review takes place just after the next election. Review of the work of the OBR should be divorced from the political cycle and not linked to it in any way. That is why my Amendment 6 sets the review period at three years. This will achieve the dual objective of allowing timely consideration of the work of the OBR, giving Mr Chote and his colleagues the benefit of that professional input and stimulus, but most important of all, establishing a cycle of review which is divorced from the political cycle. That is a crucial aspect in maintaining independence and cross-party respect for the work of the OBR.</p>

If we are to have confidence in the non-executive committee that is being set up in the Bill, it seems to me that we have to give it quite a lot of discretion about the timing of when it thinks it is appropriate to have a review. That will be governed in part by the extent to which the outcome of the work of the OBR comes under criticism, the extent to which we think there are lessons to be learnt. I am content with the five years not because I think the review should take place every five years, but because I think that the onus should be upon the non-executive members to take the decision about the timing-one should not box them in too much.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="11013110000104"></a>By bringing this forward and suggesting that it should be every three years, we are setting a clear timetable as to when those reviews will take place, rather than leaving it in the hands of the committee that is being set up in the Bill to make that decision. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, will reflect on the emphasis that he has given to this five-year period and his interpretation that the committee will always let it run the full length. I would rather show more confidence in the role of the non-executive body and give it discretion as to when is thinks is an appropriate time to have that review in the light of circumstance and events and how the work of the OBR is seen.</p>

I was not in the House for the beginning of Report, but I add my congratulations to those that I understand were expressed to the Minister on rejecting the advice that Ministers so often receive to resist and instead listening carefully to what was said by all sides in Committee, taking that into consideration and bringing forward a set of very constructive and welcome amendments. That shows the House performing its correct and proper function of revision, being professional and efficient, enhancing the quality of the Government's intention and not unduly delaying the House in so doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="11013110000106"></a>I repeat my support for the concept of the Office for Budget Responsibility. I hope that, just as the Minister reminded us during Oral Questions that the previous Government established the Monetary Policy Committee which is now an important part of our financial and economic infrastructure, the OBR will be a similar testament to this Government's contribution to building a sustainable and effective architecture. However, I support the amendment put forward by my noble friend Lord Eatwell because it seems to me that the symmetry between the electoral cycle and five years is simply inappropriate for something which should be established to stand well apart from day-to-day politics and the electoral cycle.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="11013110000107"></a>It is particularly important that the work of the OBR should be subject to independent review in a shorter period than five years at commencement. It is new, and it is going to be establishing a lot of new ways of working and new formats for reporting that no doubt will evolve over time. It would be unfortunate if we did not have a chance to stand back and look at how it was performing and how its contribution could perhaps be further enhanced before five years had elapsed-before we got to 2016.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="11013110000108"></a>There is a strong reason for having these reviews in periods of not more than three years, rather than in periods of not more than five years, as proposed. However, the noble Lord, Lord Burns, is right to remind us, as I am sure the Minister will in his closing speech, that the current draft says that, as it should not be more than five years, it could well be that the committee, the membership of which has not yet been selected or identified, could choose to make the reports earlier. For the purpose of good order and good process and, frankly, to strengthen further the integrity of the OBR and the confidence that it will be able to sustain from the broader public, these reviews should take place more frequently than once every five years. Once every three years would be a better outcome. It is for that reason that I support Amendment 6.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="11013110000110"></a>As for whether three years or five makes better sense, I have a lot of sympathy with what the noble Lord, Lord Burns, said about the benefits of five years. The amendment is very flexible. It does not say that the review will be commenced on 1 October five years hence. It says that at any point a review can be undertaken; as soon as the non-execs were appointed, they could cause a review to be undertaken if they were worried ab initio that the office was not performing well. If they then felt that it carried on causing them concern, they could have another review relatively quickly. The draft gives the non-execs a lot of flexibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="11013110000111"></a>What we are doing here is a belt-and-braces job. On the assumption that the office is doing a reasonable job, and bearing in mind that it will be subject to a huge amount of external scrutiny-this body is not operating in the closet with no one looking at what it is doing; every time it produces a report, 50 economists mark it-to do that roughly once a Parliament sounds about right.</p>

Noble Lords have focused on only one point in responding to this group of amendments, which is whether the backstop date, because I regard it as a backstop date-the noble Lord is obviously distracted by something in the corner of the Chamber. I want to address the point about the five-year backstop dates.</p>

As I say, the issue is one of a backstop date. The noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, is seeing chimera where none is to be seen in trying to link the political cycle with this five-year backstop date. We think that it is appropriate to have a date in there to ensure that the independent review happens at some stage, but it is most likely that the non-executive directors will indeed choose to have reviews on some other cycle or whenever they think it is appropriate. I absolutely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Burns, that we have to allow-it is proper to allow this-the

A shorter period may well be decided on, particularly in the initial period of operation, just as, in the context of the Monetary Policy Committee, a review was carried out a couple of years into the new arrangements. Therefore, we should leave this to the committee's judgment and not impose a rigid pattern on it.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="11013110000121"></a>It might be relevant to consider read-across or precedents from other comparable bodies. However, I have been able to tease out only one comparable read-across involving the Dutch Central Planning Bureau, which has a provision for external reviews every five years and has stuck to that model since 1945. That continues to work for that body.</p>

One of the dangers of having a shorter time such as three years is that it might become a regular feature. What we need here is flexibility but with a sensible and appropriate backstop date. It is also important to remember in this context that these external reviews are far from the only means through which the OBR is being and will be scrutinised. I remind noble Lords that the package of scrutiny goes much wider. First, there is the duty on the OBR to act transparently, which means that all its work is open to ongoing challenge and review-this is proving to be the case already-from any of the well regarded and distinguished think tanks and academics looking at its work. The OBR is required to produce an annual assessment of the accuracy of its fiscal and economic forecasts.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="11013110000124"></a>There is also the fact that the OBR intends to establish an advisory panel of experts to support and challenge its work on an ongoing basis, which not only is an important additional element of external challenge and review but brings the OBR into line with the best practice, drawn in this case from the United States' CBO. I see the noble Lord nodding on that point.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="11013110000125"></a>On the basis of the argument put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Burns, and backed up by my noble friend Lord Newby, and considering the other elements of scrutiny that are ongoing and challenged externally, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="11013110000132"></a><b><a name="110131-0001.htm_spnew90"></a><a name="11013110000465"></a>Lord Eatwell:</b> My Lords, I first moved this amendment in Grand Committee in which, of course, there are no votes, and the matter was simply left on the table. I regret that the Government have not seen fit to bring forward some proposals whereby the OBR's budget would be formally exposed to independent scrutiny. My argument then was the same as my argument now. Given that our fundamental objective is to ensure the OBR's independence to the greatest degree possible, one of the key means of controlling any independent organisation that is limiting its budget relative to its responsibilities must be constrained. In this amendment we have proposed that it be constrained by the requirement to publish the annual budget and make it available for scrutiny and assessment by the Treasury Committee in another place.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="11013110000133"></a>When we discussed this in Grand Committee, the Minister made the following points. First, he argued that the Treasury was incentivised to fund the OBR adequately, since the OBR performed important tasks for the Treasury. What worries me is that this argument is indicative of a failure by the Government to understand fully the need to ensure the independence of the OBR. Of course the Treasury is incentivised to fund what it wants done, but it is not incentivised to fund what it does not want done. Truly independent studies by the OBR that ruffle Treasury feathers will not attract enthusiastic funding from the Treasury. Therefore the incentivised argument really does not carry any weight.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="11013110000134"></a>Secondly, the Minister argued that the current funding agreement, outlined in a letter from Sir Nicholas Macpherson to Robert Chote, provided adequate funds to the OBR through to 2014, but what about after 2014? The creation of the OBR is not just for the next three or four years. We on this side of the House hope that it will become and remain for many years a valuable instrument in UK economic policy-making-valuable because it is independent-just as the Monetary Policy Committee has become a valuable instrument in UK economic policy-making. To argue simply that things are okay now is a quite inadequate way of providing confidence for the future. Therefore, the second argument does not stack up.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="11013110000135"></a>Thirdly, the Minister argued that there were other means of informing the Treasury Committee of another place of the OBR's budgetary position, for example via the OBR annual report. Once again, he fails to grasp the substance of independence. It is not for the OBR to fight its budgetary corner, which is what it is being asked to do. It is for Parliament to ensure that its independence is protected. That is what we on this side seek to do in this amendment.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="11013110000136"></a>Finally, the Minister suggested-extraordinarily-that paragraph 15 to Schedule 1 provided protection for the OBR's budget, whereas in fact it does exactly theopposite, leaving power with the Treasury to keep the OBR on as tight a budgetary leash as it wishes.  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1201"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Therefore, the arguments deployed in Grand Committee did not answer the case that was made. They were not simply unconvincing but disturbing, in that they betrayed a lack of understanding of, and commitment to, the concept of the independence of the OBR.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="11013110000137"></a>I have been working on this issue and my concerns deepened when I investigated what had happened to similar organisations in comparable jurisdictions. In Canada, the incoming Conservative Government established the Parliamentary Budget Office in 2008. Toronto's <I>Globe and </I><I>M</I><I>ail</I> reported that a year later, after the Parliamentary Budget Office had produced two reports that were critical of the Government, the office's annual budget was frozen despite earlier promises to boost it by a third.

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="11013110000138"></a>In Sweden, the Fiscal Policy Council was set up in 2007, once again by an incoming Conservative Government-there is a pattern here. On 18 November last year, the council wrote an open letter to the Government pointing to the discrepancy between its remit and its resources. What was the reaction? The Swedish Minister of Finance is reported to have reacted negatively to the letter and suggested-you guessed it-that the council's budget should be cut in response. Thus in Canada and Sweden-two jurisdictions for which we have great respect-critical reports have resulted in budgets being frozen or cut.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="11013110000139"></a>On 6 December last year, a letter appeared in the <I>Financial Times</I> in support of the independence of the Hungarian Fiscal Council-the Hungarian version of the OBR. One author of that letter was Mr Robert Chote, the chairman of our OBR. As well as making the case for the independence of the Hungarian organisation, Mr Chote and his fellow signatories argued that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="11013110000307"></a>"Developments in Hungary are also of a more general interest for the viability of independent fiscal monitoring. It is easy for a government to be in favour of this in principle. It is more difficult to stand criticism when it is actually delivered".</p>

<p><a name="11013110000277"></a>How true that is-and how important, therefore, is the amendment before us, the purpose of which is to support the independence and the financial integrity of the OBR.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="11013110000140"></a>If the OBR behaved in a manner that did not suit the Government, for example by undertaking extra studies that cast government policies in an unfortunate light, the easiest way to discipline those independent-minded souls would be to cut their budget, forcing them back to their core function and thereby diminishing their independence. Control of the budget is an important means of controlling any organisation, as the Swedish Minister of Finance made clear.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="11013110000141"></a>The amendment seeks to provide the OBR with the protection of independent scrutiny of its budget. The budget must be published and made available for scrutiny by the Treasury Committee of another place. The OBR would not have to fight its corner; Parliament would fight its corner for it. This would give the Treasury Committee the opportunity to have its say on whether any inappropriate limitations were being placed on the OBR's operations by budgetary means.

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="11013110000142"></a>The Minister should mark the words of Mr Chote in his letter in the <I>Financial Times</I>, and accept the amendment to ensure that the OBR's budget is protected, even when it speaks unwelcome truth to those in power. I hope the Minister can give me some reassurance that this issue will be taken seriously and will be considered for government amendment at Third Reading. I beg to move.</p>

However, it does not seem to do what the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, said it does. It does not enable the Treasury Committee to control the budget, but enables it to ensure that the budget is scrutinised after being published. This is something which my noble friend should readily accept, because it would be very surprising if the annual operations budget were not to be published. I should have thought that that was consistent with the whole argument for transparency which we have heard from the Government throughout the debates on this Bill, and that it should be virtually automatic. It is equally likely that the Treasury Committee would wish to scrutinise the budget, once published. My noble friend might of course argue that it is unnecessary for the amendment to be made, but, if it were, some reassurance would be given to those expressing the kind of view expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. It would certainly be right for the budget to be published and for the appropriate body to look at it to be the Treasury Select Committee in another place.</p>

We need an arrangement that will last. We all know that the Treasury has great power and I accept the argument that the OBR needs the protection of a transparent process. Of course, nothing would in the end prevent the OBR from suffering in respect of its budget if the Government wished that to happen and could get the support of Parliament, but it is important that that process should be transparent. I recognise the argument that it is already evident from the public expenditure process that there is nothing to stop the Treasury Committee being involved, but I support the principle of making a specific provision for the funding of the OBR that should be as transparent as possible.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="11013110000145"></a>The detail in the amendment that I am not happy with is the suggestion that the committee should investigate the annual budget. It is important that if you are to have a successful operation such as the OBR, it should know what the prospects for its finances are, stretching beyond one year. Subjecting it to an annual budget process might not do the job. The noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, already referred to Sir Nicholas Macpherson's existing letter talking about a financing process that stretches some way ahead.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="11013110000146"></a>I therefore support the principle of the amendment and hope that it is possible to find a way of expressing

I am delighted to see that he agrees with the principle of the amendment. I agree with the principle but I disagree with the amendment. Once again, my noble friend Lord Eatwell ignores this House. He would like to see the scrutiny undertaken just by the Treasury Committee of the House of Commons. I have no objection to that and, indeed, I would be delighted if the Minister accepted it, because the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons, under different chairmanships, has usually done a great job and continues to do a very good job now under a Conservative chairman. Why does my noble friend not wish to have this scrutinised, as my noble friend Lord Peston and I proposed in Grand Committee, by the Economic Affairs Committee of the House of Lords? As a former chairman, I am prejudiced and my noble friend Lord Peston was a longer-term chairman of the committee. It has always done an excellent and very independent job in this House.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="11013110000148"></a>If the Minister is minded to accept an amendment occasionally, and can ignore the word "resist" in his brief, perhaps he might be willing to add to the amendment the words "the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee should also carry out scrutiny". We now have a former Chief Secretary to the Treasury chairing the committee and doing an excellent job. On this occasion, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Sassoon, will accept the amendment as amended by my suggestion. I beg formally not to move.</p>

I shall try to give the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, the reassurance that he seeks in this area. The Government support the spirit of the amendment. Transparency and parliamentary scrutiny of the OBR's budget are absolutely central to safeguarding its independence. I do not think that there is any difference between us on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="11013110000150"></a>The next issue is getting a proportional arrangement which achieves the objective. The effect of the proposed amendment has already been achieved. In line with the Treasury Select Committee's recommendation, the annual budget of the OBR will be identified separately in the Treasury's estimate and it will be available for the Treasury Committee to scrutinise in another place. Nevertheless, we have gone further than the Treasury Committee asked for in order to enhance the transparency of the OBR's budget and critically to protect it from any suggestion of politically motivated cuts. Again, in line with the Treasury Select Committee's recommendation, the OBR will also be able to submit to the Treasury Select Committee an additional estimates memorandum alongside that of the Treasury in which it can explain for itself the reasons for changes in the available budget for the year ahead. I think that will go beyond what is

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="11013110000151"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Burns, that if we need to be concerned about anything here it is the multi-year aspects of it, which the proposed amendment does not address. The OBR has already been provided with an agreed and publicly documented multi-year budget, so that an annual budget exercise cannot be used to exert hidden pressure on the OBR. This specific element has been welcomed by the IMF.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="11013110000152"></a>I will divert for a moment to address one or two of the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, on some of the international experience in this area. While I am sure that the Toronto <I>Globe and Mail</I><I></I>is a fine source of reporting, I think it is relevant to remember that the Canadian parliamentary budget officer is really not in any comparable position to the OBR. Its budget is not separately identified anywhere within the estimates of expenditure presented to the Canadian Parliament. It is a very different office from the one we are looking at. The parliamentary budget officer in Canada was not given an agreed and published multi-year budget. I think we are in very different territory from Canada.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="11013110000153"></a>Hungary was mentioned. It is interesting to note that Hungary's fiscal council chairman pointed out-I do not know whether this is correct-in the context of saying it was very, very rare to introduce substantial changes or abolish fiscal councils that the only example he could point to was Venezuela under Hugo Chavez abolishing its fiscal council. So there are one or two examples but they are not comparable examples. It is precisely to guard against any suggestion of such interference that we have put in place the measures that we have.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="11013110000154"></a>In trying to give the noble Lord the reassurance he seeks, we have discussed already the responsibility of the OBR's non-executives. Critical to that is their duty to report on anything that appears to them to constrain the OBR's discretion. Of course, that would include any attempt to control the OBR through manipulating its budget. To quote the chair of the Treasury Select Committee:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="11013110000308"></a>"It is vital that the OBR has the resources it needs. The Committee will monitor this carefully: the terms of reference suggest that the Treasury accepts the importance of transparency and separate disclosure, and we will have the information we need"-</p>

<p><a name="11013110000278"></a>we, the Treasury Select Committee-</p>
<ul><a name="11013110000335"></a>"to do our work".</ul>
<a name="110131-0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="11013110000155"></a>The package of measures we propose for the OBR in the Bill follows the recommendations of the Select Committee and in the judgment of the Treasury fully reflects that intention. The chair of the OBR has already made clear that he has adequate resources and that he will promptly raise any issues on funding with the Select Committee-a very public forum in which to raise any concerns.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="11013110000156"></a>Finally, I will quote Robert Chote at his pre-appointment hearing in front of the Select Committee. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="11013110000309"></a>"If you accede to my appointment and I find myself being squeezed in that way, this committee will be hearing about it very promptly. That's how we make that public and ensure that those sorts of pressures do not go unremarked".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="11013110000157"></a>I suggest that there are a considerable number of safeguards in place. Indeed, we go further than the noble Lord's proposed amendment because we believe that it is the multi-year dimension that is as important as, if not more important than, the single year dimension to which his amendment refers. In view of the reassurance that I have been able to give him, in particular pointing to the role that we have just now confirmed for the non-executives, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.</p>

Perhaps I may address a couple of the points that were made. The first is the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Burns, supported by the noble Lord, Lord Sassoon, about the word "annual" in my proposed amendment. I think they are absolutely right. It should refer to the budget; the word annual should be taken out; then everything would flow quite nicely. However, the noble Lord, Lord Sassoon, still does not quite grasp the idea that the OBR should not have to fight its own corner but should be given parliamentary protection in the budgetary field for the long term, not simply for the period for which Sir Nicholas Macpherson's letter is relevant. We are looking beyond that provision.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="11013110000159"></a>The one element from which I derived some comfort in the reply of the noble Lord, Lord Sassoon, was the issue of a separate line in the Estimates, which will provide the Treasury Select Committee with the opportunity separately to identify the budget of the OBR. My amendment would require that to be brought for scrutiny, rather than it simply being available, but I am willing to accept that that is a small point.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="11013110000160"></a>I suppose that I should accept being chided by my noble friend Lord Barnett for leaving the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee out of the amendment. I felt that since this was particularly an expenditure matter, it should be handled by the committee in another place. I am willing to stand corrected on that point.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para67"></a>

In some ways, this grouping is rather too extensive, but several important points are enshrined in the amendments.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="11013110000163"></a>I will start with the Minister's amendment, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="11013110000311"></a>"Any Report which the Office makes in pursuance of its duty under this section must include ... the main assumptions made by the Office, and ... the main risks which the Office considered to be relevant".</p>

<p><a name="11013110000279"></a>We debated both those points at considerable length in Grand Committee, so I certainly welcome the fact that the Minister has tabled the amendment. If we are to be able to appraise the forecasts made by the OBR, it is crucial that we should know on which assumptions they have been made, so I am glad that we shall now be able to do that. Secondly, we should also know the OBR's assessment of what risks it considered to be relevant-with some indication, I hope, of the probability of this or that risk being realised-so I am strongly in favour of Amendment 9. I believe that the House as a whole will share that view.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="11013110000164"></a>I turn to my Amendment 8, which suggests that the OBR should not only assess the accuracy of its reports in a post-mortem assessment, as is already required in the Bill, but make,</p>
<ul><a name="11013110000336"></a>"a comparison of the fiscal and economic forecasts previously prepared by it with the corresponding forecast prepared by the Bank of England together with an analysis of the difference between the two".</ul><a name="time_15"></a>
<a name="110131-0001.htm_time15"></a><h5><a name="11013110000357"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="11013110000280"></a>I am concerned that there is an increasing schizophrenia-almost-between, on the one hand, the monetary policy side of things that is managed by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee and, on the other, the fiscal side. It seems that the Bank of England will operate on one set of forecasts, while the Treasury will operate on the basis of the OBR's forecasts, supplemented by the forecasts to which the noble Lord, Lord Burns, has referred. It is not helpful to have two separate forecasts being made when we are concerned with the overall position of the management of the economy. Therefore, I hope that my noble friend is able to accept my amendment.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="11013110000165"></a>In passing, I will express some concern about the Bank of England's forecasts. If I may divert for a moment, I noticed in the<I> Economist</I> magazine a couple of weeks ago the rather strange statement that the increase in VAT to 20 per cent would, because it will be permanent, be almost entirely passed on. That was a strange thing to say, because the extent to which the increase is passed on should of course depend on the elasticity of demand for the various products that are being taxed. I received a courteous reply from the individual in the<I> Economist</I> who had been responsible for the report. He pointed out that he had relied on a statement made by the Bank of England, which also apparently suggests that the 20 per cent VAT increase will be almost entirely passed on. If that is so, we have an extraordinary number of irrational people selling products in this country. Therefore, I really wonder whether we should rely on the Bank of England's forecasts as much as we do.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="11013110000166"></a>We also had some discussion earlier at Question Time on the position of the Bank of England. That is  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1207"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1207</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>another matter, although I again express some concern because we always understood from Mr Gordon Brown that the Bank's sole consideration was to be the rate of inflation, which it was to tackle by use of the interest rate. However, we find that interest rates are not going up at the present time for understandable reasons, which imply that the Bank of England, in making its forecasts and everything else, takes into account a number of factors other than inflation, as Mr Brown said it ought to do. Perhaps my noble friend might indicate in passing whether he thinks that the remit of the Bank of England has changed.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="11013110000167"></a>Finally, my amendment to my noble friend's amendment suggests that there should be</p>
<ul><a name="11013110000337"></a>"an assessment of the current output gap and when the Office expects the current economic cycle to end".</ul>
<p><a name="11013110000281"></a>My noble friend previously answered a Written Question from me on what assessment had been made of the movement of the economic cycle, which was an extremely important issue under the previous Government. Mr Brown constantly put great stress on the importance of the economic cycle, but time after time he then changed the date when he thought that the cycle had started and finished. There is a case for having this issue clarified by the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="11013110000168"></a>Indeed, the Written Answer from my noble friend referred the matter to the Office for Budget Responsibility, which kindly replied by saying that the OBR had not made any assessment of when the economic cycle had actually begun, although it might do so in future, but it was rather clearer on when the current cycle was likely to finish. The OBR went on to say that it believes that the output gap will steadily decline, as</p>
<ul><a name="11013110000338"></a>"we judged that there was an output gap of around 3.25 per cent in the second quarter of 2010. Our forecast assumes that the output gap will narrow by approximately 0.7 percentage points a year from 2013-14".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 16/12/2010, col. <I>WA</I><I></I><I>222</I>]</ul>
<p><a name="11013110000282"></a>The Office for Budget Responsibility should surely follow this matter very carefully indeed, as that is the whole essence of economic management. Given that we are starting off with excess capacity, it is important in making its forecasts that the OBR assesses to what extent the gap is likely to be closed and, in particular, how quickly it is likely to be closed because of the overall economic situation.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="11013110000169"></a>I very much welcome my noble friend's Amendment 9, but I hope that he may be prepared to accept that, if we do not have a single forecast, there is a case for making a comparison between the forecasts of the Bank of England and those of the OBR and that we should include in the OBR's appraisal a clear estimate of the position on the economic cycle.</p>

However, we recognise that a key purpose of the Bill is to provide appropriate assurances that the good practice already adopted by the OBR

The whole point of an independent Bank of England, and the way the Labour Government set up the independent status of the Monetary Policy Committee and the Bank of England, is that it should be allowed to take an independent view. That independent view will be informed by its own research. This can lead not just to forecasting inconsistency but to policy inconsistency, but that is the price we are going to pay if we think this is an appropriate policy mix. The very distinguished late economist Sir James Meade pointed out many times that this separation could lead to serious policy inconsistency, and he was entirely opposed to it, but none the less, that is the way we have constructed policy-making in this country, and that separation will bring with it the possibility-indeed, the probability-of some forecast inconsistency. However, we should note that recently the Governor of the Bank of England has been making many statements about fiscal policy, which is not his territory. That is very unfortunate. He seems to have encouraged the Prime Minister to make comments on interest rates, which are not his territory either. If this separation is deemed to be a good thing by our Parliament and policy-makers, I hope that the Governor and the Prime Minister will respect it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="11013110000173"></a>The problem I have with Amendment 10, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is that I do not think the output gap is a precise notion which can be believed if you say it is 2.5 per cent or something like that. In the Budget debate and in the debate on the comprehensive spending review, I argued that it is a statistical construct. It has embedded within it a series of statistical assumptions. It was quite striking that in the first OBR report, the definition of the structural deficit was changed, to the benefit, I might add, of the Government's arguments. Therefore, I do not want too much credibility to be put on what is a useful indicative statistic. The weight put on it can be taken too far.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="11013110000174"></a>I strongly support the Government's amendments both on transparency of assumptions and consideration of the risks to which the economy might be exposed. The latter issue, with the OBR now being required to talk about the risks to which the economy is exposed, is very important. For example, let us suppose that we had had an OBR of 2006 vintage. That OBR could have expressed concerns about the fiscal risk the economy was subject to by being dependent on such a high proportion of tax revenues coming from just one sector of the economy, that of financial services. It would have had the opportunity to say, in facing that risk, that some diversification of revenue sources might be desirable. Similarly, in defining the sustainability of the public accounts, the OBR should take into account the risk to sustainability generated by the foreign balance and by the savings and spending behaviour of

Providing these insights into the risks of public sector financial management would extend the debate about the public finances in a very useful way and would ensure that the debate is far better informed than it has been in the past. So I would like particularly to add the support of this side for government Amendment 9.</p>

I am dubious about the value of giving enhanced status to an assessment of the output gap or when the economic cycle is likely to end for reasons largely already given by the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. The output gap is not an absolutely firm context and figure that is easily grasped and measured. As we saw with the previous Government, a lot of weight was put on the economic cycle because the golden rule about government expenditure and borrowing depended on it. The problem was that whenever a difficulty arose, lo and behold, the definition of the cycle changed to push the difficulty back. It proved to be a far more elastic concept than we thought, and the old Ricardian economic cycle that depended on grain crops just does not obtain in quite the same way today. So while I am sure that the Office for Budget Responsibility may well wish to opine on these matters, and it will be quite interesting to know what it thinks, it is of secondary importance in setting government policy. Indeed, because of its somewhat nebulous nature, I would not want us to put too much weight on it again.</p>

I agree with the spirit of the amendments in both cases, and I shall try to do justice to the points he has raised by explaining how I think the matters are or should be dealt with.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="11013110000177"></a>Amendment 8 concerns the question of economic and fiscal forecasts. On fiscal forecasts, a comparison is actually not possible because the Bank does not produce such a forecast. Rather, it incorporates the official fiscal forecast now produced by the OBR into its own economic forecasts, which reflects the expertise within the OBR and the information that the office as opposed to the Bank has access to. So that is dealt with because there is no comparison to be made.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="11013110000178"></a>Of course a comparison can be made of economic forecasts and, although I would not express it in quite the terms of the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, yes, there may be differences-we cannot get away from that. The important point is that comparisons are made, and this is exactly what the OBR is doing. It set out a comparison in its economic and fiscal outlook, which it published in November 2010, and table 3.8 on page 69 of that document clearly sets out the Bank of England's economic forecast. The OBR has gone further   


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1210"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1210</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>than that because it has also set out its forecast against other key forecasters such as the IMF, the OECD, the EC and the NIESR. So there are those and other opportunities for the OBR's forecast to be compared, including in the annual report on forecast accuracy and in the external reviews we discussed earlier. There are provisions in the Bill to support the comparison analysis that is already being made in the OBR's publications. Therefore, in respect of the economic forecasts, while I agree with its underlying principle, the amendment is not necessary.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="11013110000179"></a>Amendment 10 provides for the OBR to report on the output gap and the timing of the cycle. On the output gap, the current fiscal mandate is based on the cyclically adjusted current balance and, therefore, in order to assess the likelihood of meeting the mandate, the OBR has to compute an estimate of the output gap in order to calculate the structural deficit. It has produced a forecast for the output gap in all three of the official forecasts it has produced to date and also much supplementary analysis-eight pages of it in the November report.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="11013110000180"></a>There is a provision in the charter concerning what data series the OBR should produce. The draft charter states that the OBR must produce:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="11013110000312"></a>"An analysis of the impact of the economic cycle on the key fiscal aggregates, including estimates of the cyclically-adjusted position".</p>

<p><a name="11013110000283"></a>To fulfil this requirement, the OBR must produce an estimate and forecast for the output gap if the fiscal mandate changes. That is already covered.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="11013110000181"></a>On the timing of the economic cycle, the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, and my noble friend Lord Newby have correctly pointed out that we are now in a different position in regard to the economic cycle and its link to the fiscal rules. Under the previous Administration, the timing of the economic cycle was critical to the fiscal rules. It was a judgment under the control of the Chancellor and the controversy caused by changing the date of the cycle in mid-2000 is a perfect illustration of why the OBR has been established. Under the new fiscal mandate, the timing of the economic cycle no longer fundamentally underpins the fiscal rules. This reflects international best practice, where it is acknowledged that judging the end of the fiscal cycle, possibly several years into the future, is extremely difficult and an insufficient basis on which to design rules.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="11013110000182"></a>Nevertheless, and despite this, it will be clear from the OBR's forecast for the economy what its forecast for the economic cycle is over the next five years. One will be able to tell if the OBR expects the economy to move from recession to growth and vice versa. Should the timing of the economic cycle be of particular interest again, I would expect the OBR to dedicate a large amount of analysis to it.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="11013110000183"></a>The provisions which support external scrutiny will ensure that OBR analysis is consistent with international best practice, but at the moment, and in stark contrast to the previous Administration, this is a subsidiary point. While I very much agree with the spirit of the amendment, the OBR is already covering these matters. They are dealt with in the charter and it is not appropriate for legislation to go down to this level of detail. I ask my noble friend to consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

I did not press the amendment or the argument at that time because I was greatly encouraged by the debate, and in particular by the response of the Minister who certainly seemed to be in listening mode on that occasion.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="11013110000187"></a>I was a little disappointed to receive a letter from the Minister dated 21 December, listing the amendment that he has tabled this afternoon. I refer to the Government's Amendment 15. This says that the Public Accounts Commission will have a role in specifying who should be consulted by former Comptrollers and Auditors-General on possible future appointments that they might wish to take up. My amendment says that this advice should be given by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="11013110000188"></a>As I said, I do not wish to detain your Lordships, but I point out that the amendment is based on the 15th report of the Public Accounts Commission. My noble friend Lord McFall was a member of that commission when it reported in March 2008. It referred to the subsequent employment of former Comptrollers and Auditors-General and said that a,</p>
<ul><a name="11013110000339"></a>"C&amp;AG should be required under the terms of his or her contract to consult the Advisory Committee on Public Appointments"-</ul>
<p><a name="11013110000285"></a>it should have been "on Business Appointments"-</p>
<ul><a name="11013110000340"></a>"(currently chaired by Lord Mayhew) before accepting any employment whatever after leaving the post of C&amp;AG and to abide by the decisions of that Committee".</ul>
<p><a name="11013110000286"></a>The advisory committee is now chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Lang of Monkton, and its remit is simple: </p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="11013110000320"></a>"The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments is an independent body which provides advice to the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, or other Ministers if requested, on applications from the most senior Crown servants who wish to take up outside appointments within 2 years of leaving Crown service".</p>

<p><a name="11013110000287"></a>That body has the experience and background to provide the proper advice for any senior civil servant who wishes to take up an appointment after leaving public service. It would in my view be the appropriate body to give advice to former Comptrollers and Auditors-General. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Government have not accepted this. Perhaps the Minister might say why it is that the Government now want to involve the Public Accounts Commission-another layer in between the time when a former Comptroller and Auditor-General would have to consult before he can consider taking up some other appointment. It may well be that the Public Accounts Commission will say to that former Comptroller and Auditor-General, "You must seek advice from the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments". I do not know why we do not go straight to that point in the first place. I had hoped that the Minister would have put that in his amendment. He has not done so and I should be grateful to hear his response.</p>

This amendment is clearly attracting a lot of interest but, just in case noble Lords have come for some other business, let me deal briefly at this stage with Amendment 15, together with Amendment 14 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Touhig. Having  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1213"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1213</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reflected on the points made on this issue in Grand Committee, I agree that clarification is indeed merited on this question of the C&amp;AG taking up future offices or appointments. That is why the Government's Amendment 15 makes it clear that the Public Accounts Commission would specify the person or body, such as the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, that a former Comptroller and Auditor-General should consult before he or she takes up another office or position having left the office of C&amp;AG. We have come forward with that important clarification.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="11013110000190"></a>Amendment 14, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, seeks to name the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments as the body that former C&amp;AGs must consult. However, there is a difficulty in naming a particular body in legislation because names and responsibilities may change over time. The fact that the body recommended in the original report from the Public Accounts Commission is different from that in the amendment makes that very point. While we need to have a degree of clarification which was not in the original Bill, writing in a particular body that exists now but may not exist in time-and was not that recommended only a short time ago by the Public Accounts Commission-means that we need to have the balance of flexibility but the certainty that the Public Accounts Commission will nominate a body up front.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="11013110000191"></a>The Treasury has carried out a search to see whether we could find any similar requirement elsewhere in legislation. The only mention at all of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments is in relation to the obligation placed on it under the Freedom of Information Act, so there is no equivalent hard-wiring in legislation of its other responsibilities to deal, for example, with appointments for former Ministers. We absolutely share the noble Lord's desire that former C&amp;AGs should not just listen to but take to heart the advice of the nominated adviser, just as Ministers and civil servants do. Perhaps it is relevant to say that my understanding of the position of the serving C&amp;AG is that he would be willing to consult any independent authority that the commission nominates about any employment that he proposed to take up after leaving office. This was written into the letter of appointment that he signed before taking up office. What was not written into the letter was a requirement for the C&amp;AG to abide by the decision of the independent authority. It was expected that the decision of that authority would be made public and that that would be sufficient to ensure compliance.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="11013110000192"></a>In respect of future C&amp;AGs, I think it is fair that they should know which person they needed to consult at the start, before they take on the office. It is expected that the person to be consulted should be specified in the appointment letters of all future C&amp;AGs, which would parallel the arrangements for Ministers and senior civil servants. The terms of the C&amp;AG's appointment are agreed between the chair of the Public Accounts Committee and the Treasury, on behalf of the Prime Minister, and would have to be signed off by the prospective C&amp;AG before he or she takes up office. I believe that with the government amendment we are bringing forward, along with how I have described that it will work in reality, we have sufficiently covered

On the basis of that explanation, I ask the noble Lord to consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

He made a fair point in saying that, if we specify a body in legislation, that body could disappear or change with future legislation. The Public Accounts Commission referred to the Advisory Committee on Public Appointments, but I do not think that it even existed. I think that the commission was mistaken and that it should have referred to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. I suspect that ultimately we will reach the point that I have been arguing for and that it will in fact be the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, although the Minister is going to take us on a bit of a route, going through the Public Accounts Commission, to get there. It is a bit like me travelling to Wales via Scotland but I am sure that we will get there in the end. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

As we start this, the 15th, day in Committee on the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill, I am delighted to be able to inform the Committee that there is now agreement among the usual channels on a timetable for completing Committee. As a result of a series of productive discussions, the usual channels agree that Committee should be completed by the end of business on Wednesday this week. This is within the time that has already been scheduled and indicated on the Order Paper. I am sure that all noble Lords who have followed proceedings on the Bill, and perhaps a few who have not, will welcome a return to the effective functioning of the usual channels on the Bill, and I sincerely hope that this means that there is no longer any need for me to ask

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="11013110000196"></a>During Committee so far, the Government have held meaningful discussions with the Opposition and with a number of other Members of the House, in addition to debate on the Bill in the Chamber. As a result, the Government will bring forward a package of concessions on Report, and I am sure that the whole House will welcome that. Therefore, we are in the welcome position of having agreement to complete Committee by the end of Wednesday this week. Equally, I am sure I have no need to remind the Committee that we need to return this Bill to the other place by the end of Monday, 14 February-that is, two weeks today-if the referendum is to be held on 5 May. From the soundings that I have taken, I feel confident that the majority of Members from all parts of the Chamber share this aim.</p>

As he has said, we have agreed through the usual channels that Committee on the Bill should be completed at the close of business this Wednesday. This is the product of good discussions on the substance of the Bill over the weekend and today. Focusing only on the key issues on Report and employing the economy and focus which your Lordships will expect on Report and at Third Reading, the timetable will depend on further agreement between the parties on substantive issues. The Cross-Benchers have played a critical part in getting us to the good point that we have reached, and we now commit ourselves to work hard to try to reach the necessary further agreement.</p>

Before I talk briefly about the amendment, it is unusual for a Cross-Bencher to intervene at this late stage in a Bill, particularly one that has become so politicised. As noble Lords know, Cross-Benchers are independent and not politically aligned. We are very mindful of that and I do not want to lead us in any way on one side or another. However, as many of your Lordships will know, something of an impasse had been reached towards the end of last week and I was encouraged by one or two people to see whether there was any useful role that we might play. I did so in great humility and, given that there seems to be very welcome movement, it is our wish to sink back into the background and again fulfil our role as occasional experts rather than being in the political fray. I say that with some feeling and certainly with some meaning.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="11013110000201"></a>The other thing that has moved me and a number of Cross-Benchers to see whether we could do something useful was the shadow, or the threat, of anything approaching a closure Motion in this House, which

It has never happened before, and as many noble Lords have said it would undoubtedly impair the role that we play in revising and scrutinising legislation. Many of us felt that it was important to try to avert this threat. That is why I am here.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="11013110000202"></a>Last week, Amendment 93, moved by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, was discussed in the Chamber. The amendment seeks to reinstate the right to public inquiry on boundary changes, with many limitations, as set out in the 1986 Act. The outright ban in Clause 12 was felt to be unreasonable and possibly even not sustainable. Nevertheless, there was also a very general acknowledgement that a long drawn-out inquiry would necessarily delay the boundary changes that the Bill seeks to enact. The initial discussion on this amendment took place late on the evening of 26 January, and consequently was not brought to a vote. There is a feeling that if it had, it might have had wide support.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="11013110000203"></a>Amendment 94, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, makes it clear that there would be a reinstated right to oral public inquiry only if the Boundary Commission itself thought it necessary, and that the commission would undertake to limit any inquiries in order to ensure that any changes would be finalised by 31 October 2013, thus not affecting the proposed boundary changes for the election in 2015.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="11013110000204"></a>The question of oral public inquiry remains pivotal. On it hung the negotiation between the two sides of the House and the further progress of the Bill. Amendment 94A, in my name and those of distinguished noble Lords from the Cross Benches, builds on the original amendment moved by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, and on that moved today by the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy of Southwark, in that it caps the time allowed for such public consultation to six months by disallowing a second local inquiry. This makes clear the commitment to complete any inquiries well in time for boundary changes to be undertaken.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="11013110000205"></a>I understand that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, agreed to take Amendment 93A away and come back on Report, an offer that was greatly welcomed by all sides of the House. We are still at such a delicate juncture in trying to move forward on the Bill. My own feeling-my instinct, even-is that we need further clarification at this stage from the Minister on whether the Government can accept oral public inquiry in the Bill.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="11013110000206"></a>In doing so, I am trying again to underline the need to obviate the shadow of any kind of closure Motion. Additionally, although the amendment points to a rocky path ahead, that is nevertheless a pathway down which perhaps we could all go if there is the political will to do so. I believe that this is what we all actually want. I beg to move.</p>

I agree with everything that she said. Perhaps I could add something about judicial review, a subject with which, in a previous incarnation, I have had a certain amount to deal.</p>




<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1218"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1218</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110131-0001.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="11013110000208"></a>It is important to note that the amendment as drafted would reduce judicial review to its proper place in the context that we are discussing. The courts should rarely, if ever, become involved in the activities of this House. That is an approach that the courts always wish to adhere to, although sometimes it is impossible because the law as it is developed requires them to consider applications for judicial review. However, the amendment makes clear that the Boundary Commission is not obliged to cause a local inquiry to be held but gives it a circumscribed power to require a local inquiry. With the amendment worded in that way, I suggest to the House that it would be very unlikely that judicial review would be a problem in future.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="11013110000209"></a>If the Boundary Commission did not require a local inquiry, I cannot conceive that its decision could be reviewed. If there is a local inquiry, again I cannot conceive of circumstances in which it would be possible for there to be judicial review, because, under the clear language of the amendment, the situation into which the Boundary Commission could seek a local inquiry is obviously the sort of issue on which it should properly require the help of such an inquiry.</p>

I agree with everything that has been said by the noble Baroness, Lady D'Souza, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf. I thank the Minister and Mr Mark Harper in the other place for the courtesy they have shown in spending time with me discussing possible amendments to crucial aspects of the Bill. I take the view-I know that I am not the only noble Lord who does so-that the Government are certainly entitled to get their business through this House. However, the Bill would benefit considerably from improvements to Part 2. I am delighted to hear from the Leader of the House that concessions will be brought forward. The Clause 11 formula of a 5 per cent band either way for an electoral quota is simply too rigid to allow for proper consideration of geographical considerations and local ties. It is wrong in principle for Clause 12(2), which we are now debating, to abolish the power of the Boundary Commission to hold a public inquiry.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="11013110000211"></a>The Boundary Commission process, including public inquiries, has served this country very well. It has maintained public confidence by a transparent process which has avoided even the suspicion of gerrymandering which blights so many other democratic countries. The Boundary Commission needs to retain some form of discretion to call for an inquiry, at least in those cases where it considers that it is necessary, with appropriate safeguards. I am sure that improvements can be made to the statutory scheme to promote efficiency and reduce delays but there really is no case for abolition. I very much hope, and expect, that the Minister will tell the Committee that this is one of those matters on which the Government intend to bring forward concessions.</p>

The amendment to reinstate public inquiries into Boundary Commission proposals provides your Lordships' House with an opportunity to start edging back from the precipice. It builds on an amendment moved by the opposition Front Bench which your Lordships debated last Wednesday. Although the Cross-Bench amendment that we are debating is more restrictive than ours, we willingly support it in the interests of breaking the deadlock on Part 2. It is a sensible and practical proposal for which we are grateful.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="11013110000213"></a>Clause 12 will, if enacted, abolish completely-indeed, it would go further than that and ban-the right to hold a local public inquiry into the recommendation of a Boundary Commission. The Government have chosen to put in the place of a public inquiry an extended consultation period by written submission of eight weeks. It is our submission that this is not an adequate replacement. Part of the function of a local inquiry is to provide people with a fair hearing and an explanation of why a proposal has been turned down. That is essential to the legitimacy of the process and we believe that it improves the decision-making process as well. Perhaps one of the most telling facts is that in every single case where the Boundary Commission was proposing significant changes, such as an increase or a decrease in the number of constituencies in a particular locality, its initial proposals were in every case amended following a public inquiry, so public inquiries are at their most valuable when the recommendations under consideration are the most dramatic. That fact is particularly salient in the context of this Bill which provides for a boundary review based on a reduction of 50 constituencies and the new set of rules dominated by a rigid electoral parity rule.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="11013110000214"></a>As the heads of the four Boundary Commissions have made clear, those factors mean it is inevitable that the next review will result in considerable changes to the electoral landscape, so considerable in fact that the Bill states in Rule 9(2), in Clause 11, that the Boundary Commissions are not permitted to take into account Rule 5(1)(d),</p>
<ul><a name="11013110000341"></a>"inconveniences attendant on such changes",</ul>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="11013110000216"></a>As we debated in your Lordships' House last week-I recommend that your Lordships read <I>Hansard </I>to see the relevant quotes-even psephologists who are sceptical about the value of public inquiries have said that on this occasion, in this context, they should be retained. Indeed, they have made the point that, while political parties have tended to be the major participants in inquiries, the scale of change that will be brought about by the next review is likely to provoke a much greater level of involvement by individuals and groups of local people. That is one of the reasons why we on this side of the House have not been willing to drop this matter.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="11013110000217"></a>I accept that there is a case for amending the current provisions in the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 so that boundary commissions have some discretion about whether to go ahead with an inquiry,  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1220"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1220</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>even where the basic threshold is met. However, the amendment proposed by the Cross Benches addresses that issue. The amendment that we moved last week provided that element of discretion. The variation on our amendment, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady D'Souza, the noble Lord, Lord Woolf, and the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, has tweaked the drafting on that point and made the position clear. We are grateful for that.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="11013110000218"></a>There is also the point about judicial review, made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, in the dead of night last week, which he makes again today. I will not repeat what he said, because he said it a lot better than I ever could. His intervention on Wednesday was a powerful one and I very much hope that the Government will listen to it.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="11013110000219"></a>The Cross-Bench amendment keeps our initial six-month limit on a local inquiry but states that no secondary inquiry should be allowed. Given that these are very rare in practice, we have no objection to that change in the proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="11013110000220"></a>I hope that the Minister, in responding to this debate, will be able unequivocally to accept this amendment. It has nothing to do with partisan advantage. It is a practical proposal concerned with the legitimacy of the process for drawing constituency boundaries. Helpfully and constructively, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, confirmed last week:</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="11013110000222"></a>Local inquiries can occasionally develop a life of their own. I wonder about the six-month limit because I can fairly easily foresee a legal argument arising out of a consultation that had not been satisfactorily concluded in this six-month period. I say to my noble friends on the Front Bench that I have some concern about the concept of a public inquiry in this context. Having said that, I add something that they may not welcome quite so much. I very much agree with the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, when he said that the Boundary Commission needed some "discretion"-I use his word. I hope-indeed, I think the whole House hopes-that the Government will find it possible to meet the spirit reflected in what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, has said and what I am saying in sympathy with what has already been said: that whether it is a local inquiry or not-and I have concerns about the concept of a local inquiry-there needs to be some element of discretion for the Boundary Commission.</p>

<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1221"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1221</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is in the spirit of the statement. However, I do not see or hear anything about the conventions on Report. As the Leader of the House will be aware-although I stand to be corrected-the rule of thumb is that Report shall be allocated half the number of days of Committee. That is the convention of the House. This is what this side and that side have insisted upon in opposition. My simple question is: has there been any discussion or agreement on the number of days allocated to Report?</p>

The answer is that we have not yet agreed the number of days on Report. However, as I pointed out in my statement, we will need to complete Third Reading on the evening of 14 February in order to get the Bill back to another place in time for Royal Assent. Various conclusions can be reached from that.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="11013110000225"></a>As far as concerns conventions, almost from day one the Bill has been a scenario of broken agreements and conventions. I very much hope that we can all agree that it would be sensible to move forward on the basis of how the House traditionally handles Report, within the rules. I am hopeful that we will be able to deliver the Bill on time.</p>

I thank the noble Baroness for her amendment and for the helpful spirit in which she moved it, and all noble Lords for the general tenor of the Committee debate. As was indicated in some contributions, we have already had debates on the shape of the consultation process, most notably last Wednesday evening, when opposition Amendment 93 was debated. It was similar to Amendment 94 in a number of respects, but not identical in one crucial respect. My colleagues and I have listened with care to the arguments and strong opinions of both sides, expressed last week, today and, it is fair to say, in a number of other debates in Committee when the issue of public inquiries was raised.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="11013110000228"></a>I thank the noble Baroness for the valuable contribution that she is making, not only with this amendment but in the process of discussion and negotiation on the Bill. I hope that she knows that I am as keen as she is to find a satisfactory resolution to these matters. A week ago, she made clear during a short debate the desire of the Cross Benches that both Government and Opposition should engage in discussions in order that progress could be made on the Bill "with dignity and resolve"-I think those were her words. We welcome  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1222"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1222</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that sentiment. As we have made clear, the Government are open to considering reasonable improvements to the Bill provided that they do not compromise its fundamental principles. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, quoted me saying last week that there was no objection in principle to the idea of oral hearings.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="11013110000229"></a>The Bill establishes a consultation process that the Government consider is already an improvement on the process set out in the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986. That Act allows one month for written representations followed by a local inquiry if objections are received from an interested local authority or from 100 or more electors. A further month for written representations follows where a commission revises its recommendations, with the discretion to hold a second public inquiry. The Bill extends the period for written representations from one month to 12 weeks, with a second period of 12 weeks where recommendations are revised.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="11013110000230"></a>However, as has been pointed out, the Bill as it stands removes the facility for local inquiries. Having considered the detail of the amendment, and recognising and acknowledging the spirit in which it was moved, our concern about its detail is that it effectively could reintroduce the current system of local inquiries, which, as my noble friend Lord Mawhinney indicated, has not always been the best means of conducting these matters. At least one inquiry in the previous general review lasted for 12 days, and a number of inquiries lasted for 10 days. I indicated last week why we did not wish to go down that particular road of public inquiries. However, we heard the points made that they could nevertheless be important safety valves. It was the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe, who said last week that an inquiry can be an opportunity for people to have their say. That is certainly something that we very much recognise.</p>

<a name="110131-0001.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="11013110000231"></a>Like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, I do not wish again to go over all the arguments made last week, including some of the academic arguments for and against the public inquiry system. However, I said last Wednesday that we had listened carefully to the concern of those who argue that there should be some oral element to the boundary review process. We have listened to the concerns of those who consider that this will be the first such review under the new arrangements-one of the points made by the noble and learned Lord in response to my reply last week-and in the review at which the Commons will first assume its new size, there ought to be some means by which the commission's proposals can be presented publicly and debated in a public forum. The noble Baroness, Lady D'Souza, encouraged me to go further than I did last week. I can assure not just her but the Committee that considerable discussion, consultation and consideration has been undertaken since last week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="11013110000232"></a>I am in a position to say that the Government propose a public hearing process, enabling an opportunity for the public and the parties to express their view, and provide sensible discretion for the Boundary Commissions to ensure that the timetable

This obviously would be put in the Bill. This process can be carried out in a modern and efficient manner to meet the timetable.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="11013110000233"></a>I think and I hope that my reply is very much in the spirit of the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady D'Souza. Perhaps I should remind the Committee that together with this-because it was very late last Wednesday-the Government have already said that we will, in addition, provide for an initial counter-representation stage. Nothing I have said today detracts from the concession we made to the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, last week, whereby all written representations received during the period allowed for representations to be made on the commission's initial proposals will be published, and there will follow four weeks for comments on the representations. Indeed, we would wish the public hearings to which I referred kick in upon publication of the initial Boundary Commission proposals. The proposal in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, emanated from recommendations from the British Academy report on the Bill, and we believe that it will provide scrutiny for the arguments put forward by others.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="11013110000234"></a>These two changes-a public hearing stage, aimed at improving public understanding and letting the public have their say in the process, and a counter-representation period-represent substantial changes to the proposals that were initially in the Bill. I hope that the House will agree that the Government have been willing to show considerable flexibility and a willingness to accommodate reasonable concerns, reasonably expressed. We remain very happy to discuss the detail of how these proposals will operate-obviously with the noble Baroness who has proposed her amendment and with the official Opposition. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, and the noble Baroness will, in the light of what I have said, feel able not to press their amendments.</p>

Before I perhaps comment on the detail, I also thank all noble Lords who supported my amendment. One of the major features was the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Mawhinney, when he said that there should undoubtedly be in the Bill some discretion for the Boundary Commission to do what it has to do, because it has a long history of doing some quite useful work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="11013110000236"></a>What the Minister said about ensuring that there will be public hearings for political parties and the public is extremely important and very welcome.

The Statement is as follows.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="11013110000241"></a>"With your permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the situation in Egypt. First, may I apologise on behalf of the Secretary of State for his absence today? The House may be aware that he is attending a Foreign Affairs Council meeting today in Brussels, where this issue is at the top of the agenda.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="11013110000242"></a>While the calls for political reform have been peaceful, general unrest has become increasingly dangerous, with elements of violence leading to lawlessness in some areas of major cities such as Cairo, Alexandria and Suez. Severe restrictions on freedom of expression, including closure of both internet access and mobile phone services, have only fuelled the anger of demonstrators. We have called on the Egyptian authorities to lift those restrictions urgently.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="11013110000243"></a>I am sure that the House will join me in expressing our deepest sympathies to all those affected by the unrest in Egypt, including the families and friends of those who have been killed and injured. Casualty figures remain unclear, but it is estimated that at least 100 people have died. On Saturday, the army took over responsibility for security in Cairo, and its role has so far been welcomed by protestors. Our aim throughout these events has been to ensure the safety of British nationals in Egypt and to support Egypt in making a stable transition to a more open, democratic society.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="11013110000244"></a>I turn first to consular issues. There are estimated to be 20,000 British tourists in Egypt, the majority of whom are in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, where, according to our latest information, the situation remains calm. We estimate that there are a further 10,000 British nationals in the rest of Egypt.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="11013110000245"></a>On Friday 28 January we changed our travel advice to advise against "all but essential travel" to the cities of Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Luxor, due to the severity of demonstrations there. On Saturday 29 January,  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1225"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1225</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we heightened our travel advice further to recommend that those without a pressing need to be in Cairo, Alexandria and Suez leave by commercial means where it was safe to do so. Those in Luxor are advised to stay indoors wherever possible. A daily curfew remains in place throughout Egypt from 3 pm to 8 am.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="11013110000246"></a>Cairo airport is open but has been operating under considerable difficulties. The situation was particularly difficult yesterday, but our ambassador in Cairo reports that it has eased a little today. Flights are operating but are subject to delays or cancellation. The majority of British nationals have been able to leave Cairo airport today. We estimate that around 50 British nationals will remain at the airport overnight, to depart on scheduled flights tomorrow. The situation also appears to be improving in Alexandria, with road access to the airport now secure. We have staff at Cairo airport working around the clock to provide assistance to any British nationals who require it. We also have staff in Alexandria, Luxor and Sharm el-Sheikh, who are providing very regular updates about the situation on the ground in these parts of Egypt and staying in close touch with tour operators and British companies on the ground.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="11013110000247"></a>Additional staff reinforcements from London and the region have been sent to Egypt to help embassy staff to maintain essential services in these difficult circumstances. A 24-hour hotline is available for British nationals to call if they need assistance or advice. I am sure that the House will join me in recognising the hard work and dedication shown by all our staff, both in Egypt and in London, in responding quickly and professionally to the unfolding events.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="11013110000248"></a>I turn to the political situation in Egypt. The United Kingdom has major interests at stake in Egypt, which has played an important role as a regional leader, including in the Middle East peace process. We are also the biggest foreign investor, with a cumulative investment of more than £13 billion. The scale of these protests is unprecedented in Egypt over the past 30 years. We have called on President Mubarak to avoid at all costs the use of violence against unarmed civilians and we have called on the demonstrators to exercise their rights peacefully.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="11013110000249"></a>In response to the growing protests, President Mubarak announced on 28 January that he had asked the Government to resign. On 29 January, he appointed the head of the Egyptian intelligence services, Omar Suleiman, as his vice-president and Ahmed Shafiq, most recently Minister for Civil Aviation, as Prime Minister. Further Cabinet appointments have been made today. However, demonstrations have continued and are now focused on a demand for President Mubarak to resign.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="11013110000250"></a>It is not for us to decide who governs Egypt. However, we believe that the pathway to stability in Egypt is through political change that reflects the wishes of the Egyptian people. This should include an orderly transition to a more democratic system, including through holding free and fair elections and the introduction of measures to safeguard human rights. This kind of reform is essential to show to people in Egypt that their concerns and their aspirations are being listened to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="11013110000251"></a>We continue to urge President Mubarak to appoint a broad-based Government who include opposition figures and to embark on an urgent programme of peaceful political reform. We are also working with our international partners to ensure that these messages are given consistently and that technical and financial support for reform is available.

I declare an interest as chairman of the British Egyptian Society and a member of the British Egyptian Business Council.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="11013110000255"></a>The Statement makes it clear that the unrest that we have witnessed in Egypt has developed very rapidly over the past few days, particularly in Cairo, Alexandria and Suez, as the Minister mentioned. The casualty figures, at more than 100 dead and many more injured, are very high. They seem to be a high proportion of those who were demonstrating. The numbers have been estimated variously as 10,000 at the beginning of the demonstrations and 20,000 most recently and, given those numbers, the casualty figures seem very high. I wish to associate these Benches with the expression of sympathy given by the noble Lord to all those who have been affected, in particular the families and friends of those who have been killed or injured.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="11013110000256"></a>Can the Minister tell the House whether there were fewer deaths after the army was brought in to replace the police? From the reports that we have all read and certainly from the Statement that the Minister has made, it seems that the army was more acceptable on the streets as a regulating force and that possibly it did not use some of the lethal force that the riot police seem to have deployed originally. Can the Minister confirm that there were many more people demonstrating yesterday than had been the case the day before and that, as a result, the curfew hours have now been extended? I think he mentioned the time of three o'clock in the afternoon, but originally it was four o'clock. I wondered whether that was as a result of those increasing numbers on the street.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="11013110000257"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to convey the good wishes and the thanks of the whole House to our embassy staff in Cairo and elsewhere in Egypt, particularly the consular staff who have been working so hard. On that point, the FCO's business plan has a commitment to deliver a smaller consular staff in future. Is the Minister satisfied that our embassy has sufficient consular staff to undertake the very heavy burden that has fallen on them, given the large number of British people currently holidaying in or visiting Egypt? He  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1227"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1227</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>mentioned a number who have been deployed in recent days. Is that the rapid reaction force from the Foreign Office and can he tell us how many consular staff are on the ground in Egypt at present? I trust that the travel advice which he was kind enough to detail will be updated regularly and that we shall be able to see that on the FCO website.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="11013110000258"></a>On the Egyptian Government's reaction to demonstrators, can the Minister tell us whether the UK Government or the EU has reacted to the reported use of low-flying F16s by the Egyptian air force? Have they asked about why those aircraft were deployed? Clearly, the street demonstrations today and tomorrow will give us a clearer insight into what is going on, but that seemed to be a quite extraordinary use of F16s.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="11013110000259"></a>I have two more specific questions. First, can the Minister tell the House anything about what is happening to the financial markets in relation to what is going on in Egypt? There has been some reporting on that. I make it clear that I do not ask that because of the great British investment in Egypt-as the Minister said, some £13 billion-but because of the impact that further financial pressure will have on the Egyptian Government's ability to look after its own people. Secondly, can he say anything about the widespread reports of looting, not particularly from houses but-as we have heard from Professor Zahi Hawass, who today I believe has been appointed as a government Minister-from museums? Egypt's artefacts are a glory not only to Egypt but to the whole world and it is important that we keep track of what is happening in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="11013110000260"></a>Many of your Lordships will be very concerned about what will happen over the next few days in Egypt and in the wider region. Egypt has a huge and growing population and, as has been discussed at the UN and elsewhere, for the past 10 years there has been a desperate and growing shortage of jobs in the area, particularly for the fast growing youthful population. Unemployment and rising commodity prices over the past few months have been a real problem throughout the whole region.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="11013110000261"></a>I visited Jordan last weekend and Libya the weekend before and the impact of both unemployment and rising prices is evident, particularly in those countries where there are few natural resources to combat them, especially where there is a rising problem of debt and no ability to subsidise prices. In some areas there has been very heavy subsidising of essential commodities. Money has been put into the system to try to create more jobs and in some countries there have been direct subsidies into citizens' bank accounts in order to keep these problems under control. However, these safety valves simply are not available where there are energy shortages and job shortages as there are in Egypt. Do the Government recognise that this is not just an Egyptian problem, but a regional one? We have seen what has happened in Tunisia and we have seen the unrest, albeit in a more limited version, in Libya, Jordan and Lebanon and elsewhere.</p>

However, the Minister may recall, as I do, the ill fated American initiative on this issue-which was spearheaded by President Bush and I think Vice-President Cheney-which tried to impose a view of Arab reform in the Middle East. That was rejected completely by the countries of the Middle East at the time and I hope the British Government will do everything they can to resist that sort of imposition. I have no reason to think they will be looking for that sort of imposition. It is enormously important that the solutions to these problems are found within the countries themselves. We have to recognise that there is an inevitable dilemma between the benefits of stability and security on the one hand and the benefits of freedom on the other.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="11013110000263"></a>The Egyptians did begin a reform programme. There were a number of constitutional amendments, as I am sure the noble Lord is aware. There was a move towards facilitating opposition parties and indeed the setting up of a human rights commission in Egypt. This is not nearly enough and we have to look forward to what can be achieved by the new Government to whom the noble Lord has referred, including, most importantly, free and fair elections and a programme of peaceful political reform. We wish that not only for peace and justice in the Middle East's most populous state but for the wider Middle East and, in particular, the Middle East peace process. We should not forget that Egypt has been a real force for moderation and engagement in the Middle East peace process when other states in the region perhaps have taken a rather less constructive attitude.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="11013110000264"></a>In supporting the main thrust of the Statement which the Minister has repeated, can I ask him to assure the House that we will be kept up to date? Tomorrow there is a call for 1 million people to turn out on to the streets of the Egyptian cities we have been discussing. That will be a crucial day. I trust that the Minister will do everything he can to make sure that the House is kept informed of developments.</p>

Those good wishes mean a lot and I am very glad to ensure that they are conveyed to those concerned. The rapid reaction force of staff, to which she referred, is involved in the process. She asked whether we are satisfied that in normal times, if one can use that phrase, we have the right kind of consular support for the substantial number of British tourists and for the still relatively small but growing trade, industrial and investment links with Egypt. The answer is yes, we do. We have examined the staffing very carefully and think it is the right amount, but we are in a highly abnormal situation and we must obviously reinforce the consular numbers as quickly and as effectively as we can. I am not sure of the precise number of consular staff now in Egypt but, as I mentioned earlier, 20 more have been added over the past few days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="11013110000266"></a>I will deal now with the noble Baroness's other points, which seem to me extremely apposite. I agree that the number of deaths seems high but we are dealing not just with what is going on in Cairo-an enormous city of, I think, about 20 million people, so twice the size of London-but with the many other areas and towns across the whole of this country of 80 million people as well. It is regrettable but not totally surprising that when real violence and anger break out on the streets the deaths are high. She asked whether there were signs that the army has been doing better in its relations with the demonstrators than the police, whose first wave of response was violent and insensitive. It seems it is. Again, there are variations across the country but there are all sorts of anecdotes indicating that the army personnel and the crowds are in some sort of rapport on occasions. That is a very healthy development, which one hopes provides the foundations for an orderly transition to some degree of stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="11013110000267"></a>The noble Baroness is right about the curfew. It was extended yesterday by another hour from 3 pm to 4 pm. She also asked about the low flying aircraft. I am afraid we are talking about internal decisions of the existing or recently renewed Egyptian Government regarding how they dispose of their security forces. I cannot add anything to that as to why those they chose to fly the aircraft or what the psychological impression was intended to be. On the whole, I am not sure it was terribly helpful in terms of reassurance because hands pointed skywards and said that they were American aircraft and so on, so it probably did not help the general atmosphere.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="11013110000268"></a>Regarding financial markets, the Egyptian stock exchange I think is closed again today; it may have opened for a short while. It was closed yesterday, obviously, and the ratings of stocks and shares are sharply down. The crude oil price in the region has hit $100 a barrel and seems to be moving upwards-that affects us all, as we well know when we go to the garage petrol pump. The region has 66 per cent of the world's oil reserves-not so much in Egypt, although it does have oil and gas.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="11013110000269"></a>The noble Baroness asked about looting, and again I do not have details, but we have seen evidence of quite widespread looting and she asked particularly about how this might endanger the antiquities and museums which contain some of the most precious items, familiar to us all, marking the ancient glories of Egypt. Our understanding is that the Egyptian Government are well aware of their responsibilities and have posted special guards round the museums. As this is an internal matter, I cannot guarantee that is going to be totally effective. There were some demonstrations rather close to the museums, but there are guards round them and people are aware, and we have offered some reminders of the importance of preserving these precious objects at a time of violence on the streets.</p>

Many causes have been analysed by all sorts of experts on these occasions. These are countries with a very large youthful population who are very short of jobs. Youth unemployment is always a danger. It is an era in which protest becomes e-enabled, with the ability to mobilise through the internet vast organisations of protest with the click of a button. With mobile phones and the support of an endless cascade of television media the whole speed at which protests can spring up, as has happened in Egypt, is vastly accelerated. Add to that a toxic mixture of rising food prices, rising fuel prices and the longing which is always there-and is one we salute-for liberty and greater freedom, particularly of press and media expression, and you have the kind of mixture which simply requires a match to light it, and up it goes. That is what has happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="11013110000271"></a>I give a firm assurance to the noble Baroness and your Lordships that I and my colleagues will seek to keep the House fully informed as the situation unfolds but, for the moment, speculation as to how it will unfold is difficult. One wants to be optimistic and see moderate, balanced regimes emerge, aware of their international and regional responsibilities. That is possible, but it is also possible that the whole event could take a much darker turn.</p>

Does my noble friend agree that comments by senior British statesmen in the Middle East that stability is perhaps to be traded for pluralism and democracy are unhelpful, and that, although stability is deeply important in that volatile part of the world, pluralism is equally so? It does not behove our Government to take a position whereby we do not seek to uphold the wishes of the people and instead somehow trade off a peace process that is going nowhere with a desire for a false state of stability?</p>

Something that I have learnt-in particular, in my dealings with the Commonwealth, which does not really come into this issue-is that democracy, the rule of law and good governance are the foundations of stability, investment, jobs and trade expansion. Where those things are not adhered to, or at least there is no trend towards them, problems arise that lead to challenges-not in every country; we can think of exceptions to that generalisation, but that is the scene. I do not think that the pattern of differentiation hinted at in my noble friend's remarks is entirely justified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="11013121000004"></a>The certain and central truth is in my noble friend's other observation that the UK has a long history in the area, not all of it bad. I am always interested in the way in which many countries with which we might have had bad relations in the past are extremely pro this country-I am thinking of countries slightly further to the east in the Gulf-and are constantly asking for stronger renewed links with the United Kingdom. Some of them have recently been saying to me, "Where is the United Kingdom? Please will you come back?", so not all the history has been bad, although some of it has been very awkward indeed. The history of our relations with Egypt has had its good moments and its terrible moments over the past century, and certainly for the past 40 or 50 years, as we all vividly remember.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="11013121000005"></a>As to the practical matter of routes to the airport and getting nationals out, we are watching that carefully. If it were necessary to think in terms of special charters and so on, we would move immediately, but so far we are finding that the commercial airlines, including British and some non-British airlines, have capacity. The airport is operating again today better than it was and, most importantly, the routes to Cairo airport are clear and properly guarded in a way that it was feared they were not the day before yesterday and yesterday. The situation can change at any time, but at the moment it looks a little better. I hope that that is helpful to my noble friend.</p>

The spectre of the Iranian revolution still haunts the Middle East. The Minister will recall that at that time our embassy was rather dazzled by the Peacock Throne and that the revolution went downhill from Mr Bakhtiar, a liberal democrat, to end with the mullahs and Ayatollah Khomeini. How serious is the danger of such a decline? We must recognise not only how Egypt, the most populous Arab country, would be affected but, because of the linkage of the Muslim Brotherhood and other less moderate forces to the rejectionist forces in the Middle East, the blow that would result to the Middle East peace process.</p>

Revolutions and massive street protests can take unpredictable paths. I think that the analogy with the Peacock Throne and the fall of the Shah is not strong. There has been deep recognition for some time that the pattern of rule in Egypt and the far from fair and free elections conducted last year were paving stones on the route to trouble and that, although one cannot always assess the exact moment of conflagration, there were dangers. I said earlier that the power of electronic media, including the internet, in mobilising people and protests at lightning speed should not be underestimated. Some people have mentioned the machinery of Twitter, Facebook and all those other things. They can convey and gather information and organise people at fantastic speed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="11013121000008"></a>The dangers were seen. Now the task, not for any individual country but for all responsible states men and women around the world, is to see that the pattern unfurls in a moderate way and that the more extreme elements-the younger hotheads in the militant Muslim Brotherhood, the jihadists, and so on-do not hold sway. My view is that there are many sensible, wise and talented people in Egypt and a strong middle class who, although they might be frustrated by past events, have a strong enough voice to give us some hope that moderation will prevail.</p>

Exactly a year ago, I was with the Foreign Minister of Egypt and a party of parliamentarians from 15 European countries. We were en route to Gaza and could get in only via Egypt. It strikes me in particular that Egypt's alliance with Israel in effect to keep the lid on Gaza cannot possibly prevail in the aftermath of what is happening. Whatever Government come in, they seem almost certain to want to review that rather loveless alliance. Is the Foreign Office having due regard to the possible consequences of what seems to me to be almost inevitable? I think, for example, of the border between Gaza and Egypt. As the Minister will know, the Egyptians built the wall along that border only a year or two back, and it has been tunnelled under relentlessly.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="11013121000010"></a>One would hope that whatever the immediate consequences in that dimension, there might be the prospect-one hopes and prays-of a balance of voices within Israel itself shifting more to that part of Israeli opinion, political and non-political, that desperately wants to break out of the box that Israeli policy is currently in. That is in the hope that in due time-I realise that these are hugely complicated matters and that it takes all sides to tango-one could move away from the continued colonisation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem and into a positive mode that could in the end see a general resolution of this ghastly combination of factors. I ask the Minister whether the Foreign Office is alive to all this-I am sure it is-and whether it will be able to exert some constructive influence and pressure to reach a positive outcome.</p>

Foreign Office Ministers, particularly junior ones, have to be quite careful when it comes to taking out a crystal ball and making bold forecasts, because this is a particularly fluid situation. My noble friend has done a pretty good job himself in raising certain crystal-ball issues, and these are very much in my mind and that of my noble and honourable friends and their advisers in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He is absolutely right that we now have to look at implications and try to be one step ahead of the unfolding scene. Gaza and the Israel-Palestine situation, oil and energy supplies throughout the region, and the now increasingly unfashionable pattern of nepotism-which seemed to cause so much anger in Tunis and was clearly a feature in the riots in Cairo, and which was a feature in other contexts as well-all need to be looked at, together with the position of other countries all around the region.</p>

Is it wise of the Government to be calling on Mubarak to take a lead in a transitional time? I wonder about that and the fact that we keep hearing about the Muslim Brotherhood when it is in fact a minority. It does not enjoy widespread support but inevitably has some support and will be part of any coalition in any transitional period.</p>

We have to take the situation as it is and, at the moment, the leadership and the power remain in the hands of Mr Mubarak. It is perfectly true, as my noble friend says, that tens of thousands of people are calling for his removal, but others are equally determined that he should not be removed. We will have to see how this works out. In the mean time, it seems reasonable to suggest to those who are in the Government of Egypt, with its new personnel, that the right path is the one to which the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, rightly referred. They must press towards democracy if they want the stability and better life for the people of Egypt that many in the streets are shouting for.</p>

I am interested in a number of questions in relation to whether there will be a change in the notification process as a result of Clause 12. The new Section 5 that Clause 12 inserts into the 1986 Act provides:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="11013121000050"></a>"Where a Boundary Commission have provisionally determined to make recommendations affecting any constituency, they shall take such steps as they see fit to inform people in the constituency ... (a) of the effect of the proposed recommendations and ... (b) that representations with respect to the proposed recommendations may be made to the Commission during a specified period of 12 weeks".</p>

<p><a name="11013121000048"></a>First, can the noble and learned Lord give us some indication of what timetable the Government envisage for the first boundary review under the Bill, which has to conclude by 1 October 2013? When do they envisage that those provisional reviews will be published? Do they envisage that there will be one review for each country or region, or will the review apply to the whole United Kingdom-perhaps excluding Northern Ireland-all at once? I am particularly keen to know how the resources of those who may have to respond to those issues will have to be deployed.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="11013121000026"></a>Secondly, how do the Government envisage that there will be notification to the public of their right to make representations? This might be apparent if I thought about it more, but what is the effect of subsection (3) of the new Section 5? Will its effect be that, where there are new proposals, new Sections 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(b) will apply again with exactly the same time limits? If the Boundary Commission makes a provisional proposal that is then changed for whatever reason, will it be necessary to advertise the proposal in precisely the same way and will the commission need to advertise again that representations can be made?</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="11013121000027"></a>Separately, do the Government envisage that the boundary commissions will each issue guidance on what they will do to comply with the new Section 5? If the boundary commissions will issue guidance, will that be in draft form so that this House can see it before the conclusion of Report so that we get some idea about how the new Section 5 will operate?</p>

It is very encouraging to have had that earlier response from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, to the amendment moved by the Cross-Benchers. It was particularly encouraging that the noble and learned Lord responded and took the initiative, because earlier today I was reading a blog-strangely enough-belonging to the noble and Lord, Lord Rennard, in which there appears a comment by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, who wrote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="11013121000051"></a>"There has been a potential (and sensible) deal available on this Bill for at least the past two weeks and the failure to clinch it is (in my view) mainly on the government side. The irony is that the deal has substantial Liberal Democrat support".</p>

<p><a name="11013121000049"></a>I am glad that the deal has been clinched, and I am glad that it was the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace, who came here to do the clinching, as it were.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="11013121000029"></a>On Clause 12, although almost everyone in this debate has talked about "the Boundary Commission", I remind the House-the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace, does not need reminding-that there is more than one such commission in the United Kingdom. Although England and Wales might have a combined boundary commission-I am advised that they have separate commissions, but that means that my argument applies a fortiori-there is otherwise a different boundary commission in each of the four countries of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="11013121000030"></a>On this matter, and on other matters, how are the Government going to achieve a measure of consistency in the work carried out in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England in relation to, for example, appeals? Following the passage of this Bill, will guidance be

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="11013121000031"></a>Obviously, local hearings are the important issue that we have been dealing with recently, but there are a number of other issues on which it would be invidious if one decision was made in Scotland and different action was taken in England. It could be that in entirely similar circumstances, an oral hearing was held in Scotland but not in England, or vice versa. It would be helpful if the Minister in his reply could put this into a United Kingdom context and talk about the collaboration and co-operation that he envisages among the boundary commissions.</p>

I was just a bit wary when the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, mentioned me coming here for the clinching, particularly for an amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady D'Souza, but I understood the spirit in which he made his remark.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="11013121000033"></a>I shall pick up on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes. He was absolutely right to remind the Committee that in fact there are four Boundary Commissions responsible for Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England. One of the issues that we will want to address in preparing the amendment which I indicated in the earlier debate is that of consistency. The important point is consistency, but it need not necessarily be one of exactness, which raises issues of how much should be set out in the Bill and what should be left to the guidance of the Boundary Commissions themselves. That is something we want to work through with them.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="11013121000034"></a>The noble and learned Lord asked whether the Boundary Commissions would provide guidance on how they will carry out the review. Prima facie this is a matter for the commissions, but the practice in the past has been for them to do so. It is my understanding that the secretary to the Boundary Commission for England confirmed for the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee of the other place that they intend to do so again for this review. However, the question of draft guidance is a matter for the Boundary Commissions. I do not think that it has been produced in the past, but if the noble and learned Lord has information to the contrary, I would be interested to hear it. Moreover, I am not aware of any being ready to be published at the moment. In fairness to the Boundary Commissions, it would be difficult for them to produce draft guidance given that we are still at the stage where changes are being made. Indeed, as I indicated in my responses to the amendment moved last week by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, and that moved by the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, on how long it would take to put these matters online, and indeed the matter that was debated earlier today regarding public hearings, it might be rather difficult for the Boundary Commissions to produce  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1238"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1238</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>draft guidance ahead of the Report stage when your Lordships are still debating what the actual shape of the consultation will be.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="11013121000035"></a>I was asked when the initial recommendations would be published. That is entirely a matter for the commissions. I was also asked by the noble and learned Lord whether the commissions have to advertise in the same way for the initial and the revised recommendations. My information is that, yes, they would have to do that. I shall give a little more clarification on a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes. It is certainly not the Government's intention to issue guidance on how the commissions should interpret the legislation, but I understand that the commissions work together on issues that are of common interest and common practice. While not issuing them with guidance on how to do that, we would certainly give them every encouragement to work together. It is also my understanding that each Boundary Commission will produce a report, and certainly I do not think it is intended that there would be one UK report. What I could not be certain about is whether there would be separate reports produced at different intervals for each of the regions of England. I really do not know whether that has happened in the past. But, again, it is certainly not my understanding or anticipation that there would be one mega-UK report. There will be reports from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and, I assume, England, but I do not know whether the Boundary Commission for England would wish break up its report into separate regions. At the moment, I am not in a position to say.</p>

<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="11013121000036"></a><b><a name="110131-0002.htm_spnew20"></a><a name="11013121000074"></a>Lord Falconer of Thoroton:</b> The way it is done at the moment is that Boundary Commission reports are issued within England or Scotland covering a particular part, usually a county, because there are limits on being able to cross particular boundaries. You have to decide within a particular area which constituency will go where. We know that that is not going to be the position here, so while I understand completely that there will not be a UK-wide report, I am keen to try to ascertain the extent to which the countries of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will, as a matter of practice, be divided up between areas of, say, the eastern region, the East Midlands and the West Midlands. That is significant in terms of how resources are dealt with by political parties in looking at the particular issue, even though it may well be that the Boundary Commissions have not resolved how to do that at the moment. I would ask, therefore, whether they will produce guidance indicating how they are going to do it or does one just have to wait until a particular report covering, for example, the north-east or the south-west of England is produced so that resources can be put to dealing with the area at that particular point? That is what I was interested in.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="11013121000037"></a>The noble and learned Lord took my questions as relating to inquiries, but my question was really about the timing of the guidance. I have with me a document from the Parliamentary Boundary Commission for England covering the procedure at local inquiries. Of course the commission could not possibly have that ready yet because only this afternoon did we find that there are now going to be local inquiries. Having raised the matter, is it envisaged that further guidance

However, I am much more focused on the order of batting and the timing.</p>

<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="11013121000038"></a><b><a name="110131-0002.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="11013121000075"></a>Lord Wallace of Tankerness:</b> The answer I gave was not intended to be specific to the issue of public hearings, but rather was meant to be illustrative of where there obviously will be changes from what is set out in the Bill at the moment as a result of amendments to be brought forward at the Report stage in response to the amendment from the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, about counter-representations. That is why I wanted to make the point that we cannot really expect the Boundary Commissions to produce draft guidance when they do not know what they are actually going to be asked to deliver. Clearly, we will have to examine what the issues of public hearings and counterproposals mean in terms of timing in the coming weeks. However, as I just indicated, it has been the practice in the past that, as the secretary to the Boundary Commission for England confirmed for the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee of the other place, the commissions again intend to issue guidance. The point I sought to make was that I did not think that they had issued draft guidance in the past, and I certainly would not anticipate any draft guidance before next week or whenever we debate the Bill on Report.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="11013121000039"></a>I am also advised that the Boundary Commission for England published its recommendations on a county basis, which coincides with what the noble and learned Lord said. It is certainly a matter for the Boundary Commission itself to determine how it will report. It could use regions, and I understand that it would be consistent with the powers in the Bill for it to do so. But I envisage that this matter will become much clearer when the Boundary Commissions get the Act of Parliament, as we hope, and they can respond. I have no doubt whatever that we will hear what the respective Boundary Commissions propose in terms of bringing forward reports.</p>

What will happen when a ripple effect is caused by the five-yearly review of constituencies which are all on the maximum and there is no slack in the system to take up? Surely the Boundary Commission will have to report on huge areas because of the ripple effect on each constituency which has already met the 76,000 plus 5 per cent limit. Will the Government take into account this ripple effect on Boundary Commission decisions when finally they make their statement on the commission?</p>

Whether it would work out like that is a matter of conjecture. However, it underlines the fact that these matters are probably better left to the Boundary Commissions. They should determine how they issue their reports and deal with these points, rather than Ministers or the legislation being prescriptive in that sense. It should be permissive rather than prescriptive.</p>

However, it might be helpful to them-it would certainly be helpful to the House-if the noble and learned Lord could be prevailed upon, either now or on Report, to think out aloud, to an extent, on this and to indicate in general terms his expectations as to what would constitute satisfactory publicity and consultation.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="11013121000043"></a>We live in an age in which there is greatly increased scope for publicity and consultation through new technologies. For example, the use of social networking would be available to the Boundary Commissions if they were intent on communicating with the generality of electors. I hope that they would be. This would be consistent with the principle upon which the Government have agreed that, after all, it would be proper to allow public inquiries to be held. The key principle is that the constitution belongs to the people-not to the Government and certainly not to the boundary commissioners-and we are all the servants of the people. However, it is through the drawing of boundaries and the subsequent election of Members to the House of Commons that the people of this country give their democratic authorisation to the political class, to Members of Parliament, to form a Government and to take decisions on their behalf; and it is through the drawing of constituency boundaries and the holding of further elections that Governments are called to account.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="11013121000044"></a>This is such a fundamental feature of our constitution that we have taken the view as a House-and the Government have agreed-that the public should have their say not only through written representations but in oral submissions, either uttered by themselves or their representatives, at public inquiries. However, if that process is fully to engage the citizens of this country and be fruitful, it follows that there has to be effective communication between the boundary commissioners and the people.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="11013121000045"></a>We cannot overemphasise the importance of the spirit in which this is done. I hope that the noble and learned Lord will be able to say that he expects the publicity and consultation to be much more than perfunctory; that he expects it to be full-hearted and thorough. There might be a temptation for the Boundary Commissions to make the process relatively abbreviated-not least because they are being asked to proceed on a more rapid timetable than in the past. It will be a genuine challenge for them to transact all the processes involved in redrawing the boundaries in the timescale that the Government have permitted. It should be possible, but it would more difficult to do it to the timescale set by the Government in the Bill if they are to be as thorough and as generous in their publicity and consultation as we hope they will be. It is important that the Government state that they expect a thorough and genuine consultation.</p>

Citizens will need to be confident that those factors-special geographical considerations, local authority boundaries and local ties-have been genuinely and fully taken into account. There will inevitably be scepticism about that because of the difficulty of reconciling a proper weighting of those considerations with the imperative-on which, I fear, the Government still insist-that there has to be the rigid quota of 76,000 electors per constituency, with only a small leeway of 5 per cent either side, a point to which by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours drew attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="11013121000047"></a>Given the difficulty that there will be in reconciling and balancing these various factors, it is all the more important that there is effective communication with our citizens so that they have confidence in this process. I hope that the noble and learned Lord will be able to indicate now, in general terms, that that is the spirit and the practice that he would expect from the Boundary Commissions. Perhaps when we come to this issue again on Report and have the benefit of seeing the Government's amendment and their redrafting of Clause 12, this consideration and requirement will be clearly incorporated into it.</p>

Following on from what the Minister said on the briefing about the Boundary Commissions working together, as he knows only too well I am strongly in favour of devolution-as he is-and, where appropriate, different solutions north and south of the border. I am also not too keen on Governments giving directives-particularly this Government, but that is another story.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="11013128000002"></a>However, given that we are talking about elections in the United Kingdom, some degree of consistency and guidance is important. Earlier today I read the words of Bruce Millan, one of the greatest Secretaries of State for Scotland, who many noble Lords will recall with great affection. When he was shadow Secretary of State in a debate in the other place-this may seem a long time ago but it is still relevant today-he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="11013128000050"></a>"On Tuesday I drew attention to the fact that there were differences in approach between the English, Scottish and Welsh Boundary Commissions-for example, with regard to overall numbers. The Scottish commission uniquely among the three started with a pre-determined total and worked from that. Subsequently that total had to be adjusted. I thought that it was wrong in principle that the commission should start with a predetermined total. That approach is not compatible with what happened in England and Wales. It is worrying that there are different approaches to the interpretation of the same rules in the three countries. This is another argument for looking again at the rules.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="11013128000051"></a>There were differences in approach by the three commissions to rule 6-the geographical consideration rule. There were also differences in approach in practical terms as to what the commissions did about movements of population after the enumeration date. It is not clear that any commission is entitled to take into account any change in population beyond the enumeration date. The English commission believes that it is not empowered to take any movement of population into account. That has given rise to considerable dissatisfaction south of the border, because England's enumeration date was 1976. There have been tremendous movements in population since then. The Scottish commission took a more relaxed view. Whether it was entitled to do so is a matter of considerable argument. That should be looked at".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 3/3/83; col. 428.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="11013128000003"></a>That points to some of the problems that can arise if there is not close co-operation between the four Boundary Commissions under what I think is the general benevolent guidance of the Government. I know that the Minister cannot give an instant answer, but I hope that he will take this away and look at it to see whether some more guidance should be given, particularly if the rigid figure of 600 is going to be adhered to. I imagine that that is going to make it very difficult for the Scottish, English, Welsh and Northern Irish Boundary Commissions to work in similar ways. They are working necessarily to different totals within different geographical areas, and some guidance from the Minister might be appropriate. I am not expecting an instant answer, but it is worth while having a look at it.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="11013128000005"></a>The provisions of this Bill are a bit different from those of the past. The 1986 legislation made a stipulation with regard to newspaper advertisements, and that is not in this Bill. We are leaving that to the discretion of the Boundary Commission. When I was replying to an amendment moved on Wednesday by the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy of Southwark, who was talking about online advertising, I indicated that again it was a matter for the Boundary Commissions. However, as there had been use of online advertising for the purposes of the Boundary Commissions' work during the last general review, I have every confidence that it will be done again. I am sure there is no way in which the Boundary Commission is going to have a perfunctory regard in ensuring that the proposals are widely publicised. All parts of the House-it should be a matter not just for Government but for Parliament-should be confident that the commissions will continue to adhere to the highest standards that they have shown in the past, irrespective of seeking representations that will strengthen their recommendations. There is a high level of expectation there, and I do not think there has ever been any suggestion that the Boundary Commissions have not lived up to that.</p>

I am sure, as the noble and learned Lord suggests, it will wish to be thorough in its consultation, but the question of what it may see fit by way of publicity and consultation, given the pressures it is going to be under, and the pressures of time as well, will depend to an extent on the standard and expectation that the Government express. That is why I hope we shall hear from the noble and learned Lord a sentiment very vigorously expressed, that he would expect no less of the Boundary Commission than the utmost thoroughness of engagement to ensure that every one of our citizens is aware of the proposals that would affect their constituencies and genuinely have the opportunity to make their representation should they wish to make them.</p>

May I give the Minister a scenario with which many constituency organisations across the country may well be confronted? Imagine six Conservative seats in a county all on the margin of 79,800. In other words, they have taken up the 5 per cent slack above 76,000, making a total of 79,800. When the review takes place, they will all have to change. The date when that information is made public is very important because the constituencies in the county next door will want to know exactly what is happening on the boundaries for those six constituencies. Whatever decision is taken with regard to those six will affect the adjacent county where there equally might be Members of Parliament of the same party who are arguing over seats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="11013128000014"></a>Is there a timetable which will be made available to deal with what would happen in those circumstances where all constituencies are all on the 5 per cent-plus margin, at 79,800, and where automatically they have to start crossing boundaries to sort out the new quota?</p>

The answer does not vary, inasmuch as it will be a matter for the Boundary Commission to take into account the likelihood of any ramifications of its decisions at that point and the extent to which it publishes, either county by county or region by region. This is not a matter which, with the best will in the world, we could stipulate in legislation. We must leave that to the good sense and discretion of the Boundary Commissions.</p>

I was trying to get at two strands. The first, as I think everyone agrees, including the secretaries of the Boundary Commissions, is that it is going to be a testing timetable to deliver the first review by 31 October 2013. I agree with the noble and learned Lord that it is for the Boundary Commissions to determine how they will do that, including when they will make their announcements of provisional proposals; how they will divide up the four countries; and the method by which they will announce how representations will be made. When legislation is going through Parliament, it is not unreasonable or unusual in this House to ask that the body concerned, without in any way infringing its discretion, sets out its broad proposals. That helps us then determine the validity or otherwise of a timetable, particularly a timetable such as this. I ask the noble and learned Lord-</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="11013128000024"></a>My point, if I might revert to it, was: without in any way interfering with the discretion of the Boundary Commissions, if we were able to get some indication about how it would be done that would be helpful to show that it can be done and, just as importantly, it would help the other groups-in particular, the political parties-to prepare their resources for what everybody agrees to be a quite testing process. Secondly and separately, resources provided by the state for this are important to get the requisite high standards and to ensure that consultation will be proper. When we return to this on Report, it would also be of value if there were some indication of how the resources have been worked out and how we are to be satisfied that those resources are adequate. However, I will not stand in the way of Clause 12 standing part at this stage.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="11013128000026"></a>The commissions first published a great deal of advice and ask for comments from everybody and then they considered those comments. Overwhelmingly, the comments made at that stage were made by the local political parties. It is quite rare for communities to form a view at that stage. I know that noble Lords opposite have made great play about this provision-that it is disrupting the natures of old communities. When it came to the actual inquiries which I went to there was, first, lots of advertising: it was on the radio and in the local newspapers. I suppose they could now use e-mail and all the rest of it. When the two inquiries which I attended actually took place, no representatives from the local communities turned up at all although there were substantial changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="11013128000027"></a>The people who turned up at those inquiries were the local Conservative representatives, the local Labour representatives and the local Liberal representatives. It became an absolute haggle: "We'll move that ward out but have that village back, please". In that haggling the Labour representatives usually won, in my experience. They are very good at haggling on that basis. However, do not believe for a moment that an outraged community is going to turn up in droves at these inquiries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="11013128000032"></a>Amendment 100, however, has fine breeding because it is another from the stable of the British Academy, whose thoroughbreds have been praised throughout these debates. It relates to the discussion that we have just had because it is perfectly clear that the commissions have a big task on their hands to complete the work before them by 2013. In particular, the English commission faces a tough task. It would be very regrettable if there was any slippage in the timetable, because it leaves only 18 months for parties to choose their candidates and for those candidates to bed themselves in. That is even without the possibility, which must still exist even under the Government's fixed-term Parliament legislation, of an earlier general election. It really is crucial that the Boundary Commissions do not get behind with the task.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="11013128000033"></a>The Government have been comforting throughout on the question of the resources that will be made available to the Boundary Commissions. That is important, but the British Academy study argues that an additional weapon in the commissions' armoury would be the appointment of assistant commissioners. This amendment, as I understand it, in effect repeats the provision of the 1986 Act in that regard by providing for the appointment of assistant commissioners. That may, it occurs to me, also have a part to play when the Government bring forward their detailed proposals for implementing the spirit of the amendment spoken to earlier today by the noble Baroness, Lady D'Souza, in providing for oral hearings in some form or another. I hope that this modest, technical proposal-it is of course not saying that the commissions have to appoint assistant commissioners-sourced as it is from the true experts of the British Academy study, will find favour with the Minister. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="11013128000037"></a>When the previous Government looked at a whole range of methods of engaging the public in policy formation-of which this would be a part-we came to the very clear view that fundamental to all forms of consultation was the need for the public to know what had happened to their contributions to the debate.  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1248"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1248</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>That was crucial for the credibility of the process and it avoided cynicism creeping in about what had happened. I think that this new clause is entirely consistent with that principle. I understand that it might be thought unnecessary to put such a provision into the Bill, but it might also be thought to be a sound principle that could be relied upon and about which the Boundary Commission could be relied upon to make a judgment. Putting in into the Bill in the way that my noble friend proposes with this new clause would signify the importance of such feedback, and I very much hope that the Minister will look favourably on it. I do not think that it fundamentally compromises the Government's objectives in the Bill and it could play an important part in building public support for the process.</p>

I do not think that any amendment to the clause is needed but, if the Minister is prepared to look at the proposal favourably, as I hope he will, I should be grateful if he could make it clear that all forms of publication should be used. Obviously, the web should be deployed but we should also bear it in mind that, even today and despite the best efforts of the previous Government, large sections of the population are excluded from the web. Therefore, I should be grateful if the Minister could make it clear that he would expect the Boundary Commission to use all forms of publication.</p>

In recent days and weeks, the people of Cornwall and the Isle of Wight have given us to understand in no uncertain terms that they have very strong views about how constituencies should be drawn in their parts of the world. Given the radical and wholesale changes that the provisions of the legislation will entail, I think that we should be prepared for considerable strength of feeling and for vigorously expressed representations not just on the part of the political parties but, certainly in controversial cases, on the part of many members of the public. It is, as my noble friend Lord Wills suggested, important that people have feedback and that they should know that their representations have been listened to, gathered up and presented for careful consideration by the boundary commissioners through the activity of assistant commissioners, as my noble friend Lord Lipsey has proposed.</p>

My noble friend Lord Lipsey is proposing that an assistant commissioner should look at all the written representations relating to a particular provisional recommendation and publish the effect of those written representations. That is important because it means that the representations are being considered and the public as a whole can see them all in context. It also seems to be of relevance in determining whether a public inquiry is appropriate. If a proper analysis is carried out, which is what an assistant commissioner will do if the proposal of my

The effect of the amendment in the names of the noble Baroness, Lady D'Souza, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, and the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, is that, even if the technical requirements are satisfied, there will be a public inquiry only where it is helpful-that is, the Boundary Commission will have the discretion to say no if a public inquiry will not help in any way.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="11013128000041"></a>Therefore, I respectfully suggest that the proposal of my noble friend Lord Lipsey will be of value, first, in ensuring that written representations are properly considered and that that is apparent; secondly, in properly analysing what issues there may be in relation to a particular provisional recommendation; and, thirdly, in deciding whether, in exercising its discretion to have a public inquiry, there are sufficient issues for the Boundary Commission to bite on to be sure that such an inquiry will be useful. I respectfully suggest that the noble and learned Lord considers this amendment in the context of the public inquiry amendment and comes back on Report to tell us what conclusions he has reached.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="11013128000043"></a>The new clause proposed in Amendment 100 requires two things from the Boundary Commission as it consults the public on any proposed changes to constituency boundaries: it must publish all the representations that it receives on provisional recommendations relating to an area, as well as publish a formal response written by assistant commissioners which is very much focused on those written representations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="11013128000044"></a>It has usually been the commissioners' practice to appoint assistant commissioners to manage the process of local inquiries, and the noble Lord seeks to apply this practice to the consultations under the provisions of the Bill. As I indicated earlier in the Committee's deliberations, and as I think has been touched upon by a number of contributors to this debate, the Government propose a public hearing process enabling an opportunity for the public and parties to express their views. We need to consider how best to achieve that so as to ensure that the timetable for completion of the Boundary Commission's reviews by October 2013 is met. It is fair to say that in order to do so we will need to consider all the existing provisions concerning consultation in the round, and I hope that that gives some reassurance. The Government have committed to further action on how consultation is undertaken by the commissions not only in terms of public hearings but in terms of counter-proposal provisions as well. On that basis, I urge the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We have done so not because we oppose Clause 13 standing part but just in order that we might hear the Minister respond to some questions.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="11013137000002"></a>Last week we heard from noble Lords concerning Cornwall and the Isle of Wight, as my noble friend Lord Howarth of Newport reminded us. However, we also had a long and interesting-and, I think, worthwhile-debate on Wales, to which Clause 13 relates. The clause amends Section 2 of the Government of Wales Act 2006 so that the Assembly constituencies are those specified in the Parliamentary Constituencies and Assembly Electoral Regions (Wales) Order 2006, as amended. The effect of this change is that any future alterations to parliamentary constituencies made under the new rules introduced by the Bill will not affect Assembly constituencies.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="11013137000003"></a>We appreciate that without the first part of Clause 13 the reduction in the number of Westminster seats in Wales made necessary by Clause 11 of this Bill would see a comparative reduction in the number of Welsh Assembly seats. It is not this part of Clause 13 that we object to; we do not wish to see the representation provided for the people of Wales by its devolved institutions affected by legislation which will cut that representation at Westminster. However, the remaining parts of Clause 13 are included to deal with interim reviews of constituencies in Wales which might happen to be being undertaken under the terms of the Government of Wales Act 2006 which are ongoing or have not been implemented at the time when Part 2 of the Bill comes into force.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="11013137000004"></a>We want to raise again the particular impact that the Bill's proposals will have on Wales. We wish to ask the Minister whether there might be a phased reduction in the number of Westminster constituencies due to be lost in Wales under the terms of the Bill. If there is not to be a phased reduction, perhaps there is a case to be made that the amount of the reduction be delayed until after the result of the March referendum on powers to the Welsh Assembly and any attendant transfer of power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="11013137000005"></a>The Minister will recall-he is, after all, an expert on this point-that last week he made the comparison with the cut in Scottish Westminster representation following devolution. We would argue that that cut in seats happened only after law-making powers had been transferred to Holyrood. In holding a referendum to extend primary law-making powers in the light of the Government of Wales Act 2006 and the Calman Commission, Wales will, in a way, be catching up with Scotland in this respect. Perhaps it is appropriate that,

I look forward to hearing the noble and learned Lord's response in due course.</p>

I do not think that it would be right for us to seek to reduce the number of constituencies that return Members to the Welsh Assembly, but I think we should appreciate that, if we are going to legislate to cause these boundaries to cease to be coterminous and to diverge, problems will arise and damage will be done politically.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="11013137000007"></a>My noble friend reminded us that last week we considered two amendments on this issue. One proposed a phased reduction in the number of parliamentary constituencies in Wales and the other proposed that the reduction should be delayed until such time as the people of Wales had voted to have primary law-making powers transferred to the Welsh Assembly. Both would be helpful mitigating amendments, but let us recall, in the mean time, that the Welsh Assembly, unlike the Scottish Parliament, does not have primary law-making powers and that policy for Wales is made, on a very large scale, in the Westminster Parliament. There is a block grant which transfers resources from London to Cardiff. Home affairs, criminal justice, social security, pensions and, of course, defence, foreign policy and very major areas of policy are determined still for Wales by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="11013137000008"></a>It follows from that that it is a responsibility of Members of Parliament representing Welsh constituencies at Westminster to work in close relationship with their colleagues who are Assembly Members in Cardiff. They need to be able to talk to each other about the interests of the constituents that they jointly serve. The needs of Wales need to be represented by Welsh Members of Parliament at Westminster and as things are, they are well represented by Members of Parliament of all parties at Westminster. It is easier for them to do that job because the constituencies of Welsh MPs are the same as the constituencies of Welsh Assembly Members. When that ceases to be the case, it will be far more difficult for Welsh MPs and Welsh Assembly Members to work closely and effectively together in the interests of their shared constituents. There will overlapping of boundaries. There will be cases in which Welsh Members of Parliament will have to try to represent, at one and the same time, the interests of two Welsh Assembly constituencies which may not be in agreement about what it is that they would like their champion in the House of Commons to be arguing for. There will be a muddying and a blurring of responsibility. It will be more difficult for people to do their job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="11013137000009"></a>Of course, the noble and learned Lord, like others in the Chamber, is very well aware of the experience in Scotland.

This is one reason-there are other powerful reasons-why I believe that it is undesirable to reduce the number of constituencies in Wales, or, if the number of constituencies in Wales is to be reduced, we should do it at a gradual pace. The service that their elected representatives are able to give to their constituents will be impaired if we lose the existing alignment of boundaries.</p>

Indeed, a similar end was procured in relation to Scotland through primary legislation in 2004. I am not sure whether it was when the noble Baroness, Lady Liddell, was Secretary of State, but if it was not, she probably instigated it, and it was to secure the size of the Scottish Parliament, notwithstanding the significant reduction in the number of Scottish seats at Westminster. I am pleased to have heard the noble Lord confirm that he has no objection to that part of this Clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="11013137000011"></a>The noble Lord did inquire, however, about the transitional provisions and took the opportunity to raise again the issues which were pretty thoroughly debated one day last week-I cannot remember which day it was; possibly Wednesday night. We had a thorough debate and I do not propose to go into all the arguments again. Suffice to say that it is the case that, even now, the Welsh Assembly has powers given to it under framework powers in primary legislation, or under legislative competence orders, to promote measures in the Welsh Assembly. As I indicated on that occasion, the underlying principle of the Bill is to ensure equality of constituencies throughout the United Kingdom and I have still not been given any answer as to why a seat in Cardiff should be smaller than a seat in Belfast, Edinburgh or Birmingham. I do not think that we can pursue that matter much further this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="11013137000012"></a>The transitional provisions are intended to deal with interim boundary reviews which have already been begun by the Boundary Commission for Wales and have not been completed or have not yet been implemented at the time when Part 2 of the Bill comes into force. The commission will be able to decide whether to continue with any reviews which it has in hand but the consequence of continuing with any reviews would be that, in practice, they would apply only to the boundaries of Assembly constituencies.</p>

Such an order would therefore affect the Assembly constituencies and, where appropriate, Assembly electoral regions, but would not have any effect on parliamentary constituencies,

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="11013137000016"></a>I do not want to go over old ground too much, but this Bill was introduced very quickly. It passed through another place before many Members there had fully digested its implications, particularly the fact that it is the starting point for what I call "permanent revolution" in the electoral geography of our country-converting them all into carpetbaggers traipsing around the country looking for a new seat. That penny might have been slow to drop, but I am told by Members of another place-they have many great uses to this House-who have kept in close contact with people down the other end, that it has. I think that if the Bill were introduced into the House of Commons today, it would have a much rougher ride than it did. Indeed, if we all had a few pounds for every time an MP-dare I say it, a Conservative MP-had clapped us on the back and said, "Keep up what you're doing in the Lords", we should be very much richer.</p>

Rather disgracefully, the House of Commons in 1969, on the instructions of the Government, voted down an order to introduce boundary changes proposed by the Boundary Commission, so this would not be unprecedented. It is perfectly conceivable, at any rate, that in 2013, when the Commons sees the damage that the Boundary Commission will inevitably have to wreak in redrawing the maps within the limit of 5 per cent and 600 constituencies, it might not fancy it. Although to vote down an order in those circumstances would be an act that required the most careful consideration, the Commons might want to do that.</p>

There is real merit, although we will debate this more fully later, in what the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, is saying, because it would give the House the opportunity to consider not only the effect of what is being done but what an independent body-for example, a commission set up to look at the size of the House of Commons-had said about whether it was appropriate to reduce the size of the House from 650 to 600 and, if that was not appropriate, what the appropriate figure, if any, was to reduce the House to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="11013137000029"></a>Those of us who have been enjoying the provisions of Committee have come to know well the views expressed by the cross-party committees in both Houses on the lack of proper constitutional process on the Bill. I know that noble Lords enjoy hearing me repeat old favourites, so I say again that the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee in the House of Commons and our Constitution Committee have said that there should have been a public consultative process before the Bill came to the House and pre-legislative scrutiny to enable it to be properly considered. Those points are added to by the fact that it has been very difficult for the Government to justify precisely how they get to the figure of 600. The Leader of the House saying that it is a nice round figure perhaps lacks the intellectual and constitutional justification that one looks for in this significant change in the House of Commons. The lack of intellectual justification and of proper process goes to an important constitutional point. The House genuinely feels uneasy about a majority in the House of Commons and a political majority in the House of Lords-that is, a political majority of the Liberal Democrats and the Tories over the other parties in the House-being able to push through a change in the size of the House of Commons, which reputable independent experts think has been chosen as a means of favouring the governing party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="11013137000030"></a>It is worth quoting a statement that Mr Mark Field, the Conservative MP for Cities of London and Westminster, endorsed on Second Reading in the other place. Mr Straw quoted from the statement put on the Conservative website by Mr Field. Referring to Mr Field, Mr Straw said:</p>

<p><a name="11013137000032"></a>Therefore, there is a legitimate argument that this is being done for party political advantage. The importance, therefore, of my noble friend proposing the super-affirmative procedure is that if, as I hope, we adopt the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, a process will be in place that will ensure that the Government can undertake proper arrangements to look at whether the figure is right, and that when we pass that amendment-I hope that we do so-and debate whether we bring Clause 11 into force, we will be informed by a report of a body that is beyond reproach. I hope that the noble and learned Lord will consider my noble friend's amendment in that context.</p>

The legislation provides for seismic constitutional and political change but has been all too little considered hitherto. There was not only the lack of public consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny to which my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer has referred but the reality of the way in which the Bill was transacted in the House of Commons is that the Committee stage was entirely perfunctory.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="11013140000002"></a>At Second Reading in another place some Members of the other place expressed considerable anxiety about the way in which things were being done. For example, Mr Simon Hart, a Conservative Member of Parliament, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a><a name="11013140000108"></a>"I wish to address the issue of honesty. Let us not try to fool people about this Bill. Let us not pretend that it is a response to some kind of great public desire or thirst".</p>

<p><a name="11013140000100"></a>He did not necessarily want the Bill to fail because he accepts the foundations on which it was constructed, but he continued:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a><a name="11013140000109"></a>"It is the process, not the principle to which I object".</p>

<p><a name="11013140000101"></a>He went on to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="11013140000122"></a>"there is a fine line between political reform and political vandalism".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 6/9/10; col. 120.]</ul>
<a name="110131-0002.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="11013140000003"></a>If the House of Commons passed this legislation in the pretty shallow and perfunctory way in which it did-with a very brief Committee stage and very important sections of the Bill, including Clause 11, not being thoroughly examined in Committee-it follows that the other place must have the opportunity in due course to consider again whether it has done the right thing. If the orders made under the Bill were in effect to go through simply on the nod under the negative resolution procedure, that would not be good enough and the House of Commons would not be performing its proper constitutional role. Therefore, the simple affirmative procedure is probably the right procedure to be adopted for decisions on orders made under this legislation.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="11013140000004"></a>I have some reservations that the super-affirmative procedure would create too much scope for obstruction and too much scope for the intervention of party political interest in the eventual decision-making.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="11013140000005"></a>However, it is imperative that, when the other place comes to make decisions on orders under the Bill, it should do so consciously and deliberately, which the

The amendment would subject all delegated powers conferred by the Bill to the affirmative resolution procedure. As I understand it, the noble Baroness, Lady McDonagh, will not move her amendment proposing the super-affirmative resolution procedure, so I shall confine my remarks to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="11013140000007"></a>There is no doubt that the Government recognise the value of parliamentary scrutiny. Indeed, that is why, in both Houses, we have sought to ensure that Members have had adequate time to debate the provisions of this Bill in detail. I cannot accept the allegation made by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport, that somehow or other the proceedings in the other place were perfunctory. I cannot remember offhand how many days were spent in Committee of the Whole House or on Report, but I know that every effort was made by the Government to ensure that those provisions in the Bill that were not subject to more detailed consideration in Committee were the ones with which the Report stage started. I think that I am right in saying that the only substantive clause that was not debated in the other place was that on which we have just had a brief clause stand part debate on the breaking of the link between the parliamentary constituencies in Wales and the constituencies of the National Assembly for Wales. That is not an unimportant matter, but I do not think that it is the most controversial part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="11013140000008"></a>None the less, we do not believe that it is necessary to apply additional parliamentary procedures, as suggested in the amendment, to those powers in the Bill that are not already subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Moreover, it is worth noting that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has not recommended that any such procedure should apply to these order-making powers. Like our predecessors, we attach considerable importance to what that committee says and, indeed, to what it does not say.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="11013140000009"></a>One exception to that was that the DPRR committee recommended that the power to make a transitional or saving provision in Clause 8(4) should be subject to the negative procedure. However, as we indicated when the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, raised an amendment on that matter, the Government have made it clear that they intend to deal with this point by removing the power and instead making explicit provision to deal with the only scenario in which we would anticipate the power being necessary: namely, to ensure that, where a parliamentary by-election is called after the AV provisions are implemented-were they to be implemented-but before the first general election, that by-election would be held under first past the post.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="11013140000010"></a>There are a number of reasons why the amendment is not appropriate. Noble Lords may find it helpful if I briefly set out why I think that the increased scrutiny that the amendment seeks is unnecessary in relation to the delegated powers contained in the Bill that are not already subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="11013140000011"></a>First, it is not appropriate to make the order implementing or repealing the alternative vote provisions following the referendum subject to additional parliamentary debate. I think that we had some debate around this when we considered Clause 8, which was probably before Christmas. The relevant provisions in Clause 8 do not give Ministers wide-ranging powers about when the provisions can be brought into force or repealed; quite the opposite, they impose a number of clear, binding duties. The effect is that Ministers must bring certain provisions into force-or, indeed, repeal those provisions-depending on the outcome of the referendum. Furthermore, if there is a yes vote, the provisions will already have been debated in full during the passage of this Bill and the order would simply implement the will of the public as expressed in the referendum.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="11013140000012"></a>Fundamentally, subjecting the order-making powers in Clauses 8(1) and 8(2) to the affirmative procedure would change the nature of the referendum. As we also debated when we considered Clause 8, the referendum would become indicative rather than binding, since the order giving effect to the referendum result could subsequently be prevented from taking effect if the order was voted down. The Government believe that voting reform is a significant constitutional reform on which the people should have their say. Once they have had their say, this should not be thwarted by further procedural process.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="11013140000013"></a>Another key power on which the amendment seeks to impose an additional parliamentary procedure is that in paragraph 20 of Schedule 1, which provides for an order to be made to determine the maximum expenses recoverable by regional counting officers. That power replicates an existing power in the Representation of the People Act 1983 for parliamentary elections, which is similarly not subject to any parliamentary procedure because it is purely of an administrative nature.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="11013140000014"></a>By contrast, I think that it is sensible for the Bill to provide-as it already does in Clause 9-that the power to amend legislation in order to make purely consequential further changes to implement AV should be subject to the affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="11013140000015"></a>On those grounds, I hope that your Lordships will agree that an additional parliamentary procedure for orders that are not already subject to the affirmative procedure in the Bill is neither necessary nor appropriate. No doubt we will return to the important points that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, made about the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, and I would propose to deal with these points then. In the mean time, I urge the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, to withdraw his amendment.</p>

Many of my friends believe that the AV referendum should have been indicative in the first place. I would not necessarily go that far, but I accept that if, on the day, the only two people who turn up at the polling station are the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace, and myself, both of us voting yes, there might be a small problem with the legitimacy of proceeding in those circumstances, to which a political solution will have to be found.</p>

I quote from his "new politics" speech, delivered in May last year:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a><a name="11013140000112"></a>"I'm talking about the most significant programme of empowerment by a British government since the great reforms of the 19th Century. The biggest shake up of our democracy since 1832".</p>

<p><a name="11013140000102"></a>In the same speech, recalling the "anger and disappointment" felt by thousands of people who were turned away from the polling stations on general election night, he declared:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a><a name="11013140000113"></a>"You must be confident that, come polling day, your voice will be heard ... Under this government's plans, you will"</p>

<p><a name="11013140000103"></a>However, we know, as the Committee has heard before, that as a result of gaps in our electoral register, many millions of people are going to be denied a voice-indeed, any acknowledgement of their existence-in the two central proposals contained in the Bill.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="11013140000019"></a>The Government are fond of saying that this Bill is underpinned by the principle of equality, but you cannot get equality on the electoral playing field on the basis of a grossly unfair or unequal register. This is particularly so in respect of the proposed boundary changes, which are to be drawn on the basis of the December 2010 register, from which it is agreed that upwards of 3.5 million eligible voters are missing.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="11013140000020"></a>Putting that problem on one side, I think that the problem of underregistration also has a significant bearing on the referendum on the alternative vote,   


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1260"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1260</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which is the subject of Part 1 of the Bill. As we are well aware, the Government intend that the referendum will be held on 5 May next, which, in our view, would be an unsuitable date. Even if the referendum goes ahead on that day, the referendum will at least be contested on a marginally more up-to-date electoral roll than that to be used for the boundary changes, if for no other reason that there is still time to put missing people on the register. If the referendum was not going to be held so soon, this would allow even more time.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="11013140000021"></a>Happily, the Bill provides for that eventuality. Following the Committee's acceptance of the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Rooker, the Bill will not actually require a referendum to take place until October of this year. We believe that that extended deadline provides an important opportunity for the registration problem to be properly addressed and sufficient leeway for the acceptance of Amendment 102.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="11013140000022"></a>Amendment 102 is concerned with the commencement of Part 1 of the Bill. If accepted, the amendment would require the Electoral Commission to certify,</p>

<p><a name="11013140000104"></a>before the AV referendum is held. The amendment would not require a certain percentage of eligible voters or resident adults to be registered. In previous debates, that was felt to be an unreasonable target. Indeed, there was some disagreement about what the right percentage target would be. The amendment would simply impose on the Electoral Commission a requirement to judge whether local authorities are doing all that they reasonably should to ensure that as many people as possible are registered to vote.</p>

As my noble friend has reminded me-I cannot remember which Minister replied-the noble Lord, Lord McNally, in an Oral Question some months ago maintained that it is not a legal requirement to register.

Therefore, the register of December 2010 is probably more comprehensive than one that we might imagine in future. Delaying the referendum, perhaps until October, might mean that people would drop off the register rather than be fully and comprehensively covered by the one that will currently be the basis of the referendum.

In the context of a potentially low turnout, which the House will perhaps want to debate again on Report, the differences likely to result from the unequal participation of social groups such as young people and others could have a major bearing on the outcome of the referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="11013140000035"></a>It is very rare that we resort to a referendum in Britain. When we do, we should ensure that it takes place on an even basis. In the interest of fairness, I urge the Minister to consider our amendment with some care. I beg to move.</p>

The first is the general principle that we need to improve registration. I have argued before that we have something of a postcode lottery in how good registration is from one local authority to another. That general point relates to this debate because the amendment would require that we deal with that before the referendum. I suspect that the Government are concerned only about whether they could do so in time. However, we must start the process.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="11013140000037"></a>As an adviser to the Electoral Commission, I have felt for a long time that we need to improve the registration process. I do not think that anybody on either side of the House disagrees with that. My experience is that until we get an agreement on a body that will raise the standard by saying what that standard should be across the country, some local authorities will carry out registration extremely well, others will do so very poorly and others will be in between. We know which local authorities perform well and we know which perform very badly. The in-between group is more difficult to identify. The Electoral Commission must have a duty placed on it to come up with a standard in electoral registration that local authorities must achieve.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="11013140000038"></a>Having just filled in my registration form again, I know that the form suggests very heavily that not to fill it in accurately is illegal and that one would risk prosecution. It implies that registration is a legal requirement in exactly the way that was described in the earlier intervention. I would like the Electoral Commission to have a duty to say that all local authorities have to make every effort to get people on to the register. I recognise that there is a time problem in relation to this amendment and the referendum, but I do not see why we should not make a start. We could do that now. It would be possible to say that, given the variable standards at the moment, the small number of local authorities that we know do not make the effort have got to do so. Perhaps we could then build on that for future occasions, when we would expect the Electoral Commission to say that all local authorities have reached a minimum standard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="11013140000039"></a>The issue of underrepresentation in key areas is crucial. We all know that some areas have much greater underrepresentation than others, and we all know that  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1263"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1263</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>some local authorities in those areas to not make anywhere near enough effort to get people registered. Those are the authorities that we should focus on. It would be very good news if the Government said to the Electoral Commission, "We expect you to send out to those local authorities a note warning them that if they do not raise the standards in their area and do more to make sure that people are on the electoral register-and do that at least as well as the best local authorities-you will continue to breathe heavily down their neck until they deliver the standards that you expect".</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para122"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="11013140000040"></a>Underrepresentation is a major problem. It has distorted so many issues that we have debated in the Bill that we should not allow it to continue. What troubles me is that the Minister and the Government have made no effort to find a way of addressing the problem. I ask that in due course they take up this amendment and extend it beyond the referendum to a general expectation of local authorities and the Electoral Commission that they apply that standard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="11013140000042"></a>The noble Lord's speech was very interesting. In effect, he distinguished between whether efforts should be made to improve the registration system and the way in which that might be tied to a particular part of the Bill. That is exactly my position. I have no problem with trying to improve the registration system. However, there could be big questions of cost, not least arising from any prosecutions that may take place, for example of large numbers of 16 to 18 year-olds. That prospect appeared to lurk in what the noble Lord, Lord Bach, said. Those issues can be considered on their own merits. What would not be sensible-this is where, for once, I am on the side of my Front Bench-would be to tie those to a provision of a particular Bill as a condition before something comes into effect.</p>

We want its result not only to be legally binding but to have moral force. It will not have moral force if it is mired by a low turnout among those who are already registered. It will have less moral force if, unfortunately, it is conducted on a register which is demonstrably incomplete and inaccurate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="11013140000045"></a>If there is to be an important moment in the national life in consideration of a major constitutional change, we should expect the Electoral Commission to take every reasonable step to ensure that there is a high level of registration. It is then for the campaigning groups to do all they can to ensure that there is a high turnout. This can be done and it should be done. The decision taken by the people at the referendum will have a greater validity. It will be more convincing if it takes place on the basis of fuller registration.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="11013140000046"></a>It is timely to have a drive for improved registration because we know that local authorities will have fewer resources in years to come, and that in the next few months they will perhaps still have the resources to mount the drive to improve electoral registration. We also know that given the housing benefit changes that are due to come in, more people may be obliged to move home. We will see more people coming off existing electoral registers and perhaps not getting on to new electoral registers. Before we see the full unfortunate consequences of those benefit changes, we should have a drive to improve electoral registration. It would be particularly timely and appropriate for that to take place in the next few months, certainly to ensure that we have the most complete and accurate electoral register possible when the referendum takes place, and as an investment in the electoral register for future elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="11013140000047"></a>For all those reasons, I support the amendment of my noble friend Lord Bach.</p>

Part 1 provides among other things for the referendum on the alternative vote, for the entitlement to vote in the referendum and for conduct of the referendum. The proposal in the amendment is that the provisions should not come into force until the Electoral Commission has certified that every local authority has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the electoral register is as complete and accurate as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="11013140000049"></a>It will come as no surprise that the Government wish to resist the amendment. To be fair, it is a variation on a number of the amendments debated earlier in Committee, when debating Part 2, on whether the Boundary Commission's review should commence until the Electoral Commission had certified that every local authority had taken all reasonable steps. We believe that the amendment would cause a serious risk of delaying the referendum.</p>

Before that debate, I was detained by severe weather and was unable to get to the House, but I have noted what was said and I heard the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, say on other occasions that his intention was not to rule out 5 May, but to provide a lifeboat, whereas this amendment would, to all intents and purposes, rule out 5 May. In fact, the delay could be so substantial, perhaps even indefinite, if the relevant certification could not be provided, that the lifeboat might even be sunk before it was launched. I cannot understand why we should put ourselves in a position whereby perhaps one local

<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="11013140000051"></a>It should also be borne in mind that there is no such obligation in elections where democratic engagement is at stake. Why impose this obligation for the referendum? No one is suggesting that legislation should be introduced to delay the elections for the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh National Assembly, the Northern Ireland Assembly, or indeed the council elections that are due to take place on 5 May until we have received a similar certification from the Electoral Commission. Given that all these elections are also to take place on 5 May, if that is indeed the date when we hold the referendum, I hope that the turnout will be such that the elected bodies taking office following 5 May will enjoy the moral force of turnouts that enable them to discharge their responsibilities.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="11013140000052"></a>Electoral registration officers across the United Kingdom are already under a statutory duty to take all steps necessary to maintain the registers. Perhaps for clarification, I am advised that it is an offence to fail to provide information to an electoral registration officer when requested. That relates to what the noble Lord, Lord Soley, said. There is a distinction between that and the issue of whether it is an offence not to register. The Electoral Commission also has a statutory responsibility to promote public awareness of electoral registration and elections, and to set and monitor performance standards for electoral services.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para132"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="11013140000053"></a>That then takes us to the report quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Bach, which has been quoted in a number of our earlier debates. There is no disputing the importance of accurate and comprehensive registers, but the commission's report on the performance standards for electoral registration officers in Great Britain, published last March, showed that just fewer than 96 per cent of electoral registration officers met the completeness and accuracy of the electoral registration records' standard in the past year.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para133"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="11013140000054"></a>I hope that noble Lords will agree that the available research does not suggest that drastic steps such as delaying the referendum are needed. That is particularly so given that the amendment would also risk imposing onerous obligations on the commission. As the noble Lord, Lord Soley, and my noble friend Lord Newton indicated, that is a different matter from wanting to encourage electoral registration. I hope that it is a given across the Committee that we all wish there to be an increased number of people on the electoral register. Indeed, as my noble friend Lord Tyler and, to be fair, the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, pointed out in an earlier debate, during the general election campaign there was a registration drive and a large number young people in particular registered. We had the benefit of those additional people on the registers who are therefore able to vote in the referendum.</p>

So they are already measuring and, against that, they found that just under 96 per cent had made it. I do not think there is any dispute in this Committee about the importance of electoral registration. We wish to pursue pilot studies to compare the electoral register against other public databases so that we can identify people who are not currently on the register. If the trials are successful, we will roll this out nationally to ensure that registration officers are aware of what has been shown up by the trials so that they can better target people to get them on the register. There is a commitment to improve the rate of electoral registration but we cannot accept that the referendum should be postponed, possibly indefinitely, awaiting the kind of certification which this amendment proposes. Therefore, I beg the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I tabled this amendment in the hope that it would contribute towards an agreement on the Bill, in particular so that the referendum on the alternative vote could be held on 5 May this year. I even had hope last week and, of course, after today's proceedings I have even more hope.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para135"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="11013140000060"></a>The thinking which underlies the amendment is that, although there is a clear and close deadline set by the Government for the referendum, the timing for the completion of Part 2 of the Bill on the Boundary Commissions' reviews and changes to constituencies is not so tight. The Government's timing on Part 2 is that it will be completed in good time-perhaps by October 2013-for use in the general election of 2015. From the almost 100 hours that I have spent listening to discussions during the passage of the Bill so far, I am well aware of the political imperative for the Government that the Bill should not be split and that there is a link between Parts 1 and 2. Because my amendment still permits and requires the work on the constituencies to keep going forward, I do not consider that the link is broken.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para136"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="11013140000061"></a>I shall briefly explain my amendment. If Parliament agrees that the Bill be passed, the work of the Boundary Commissions would go ahead because they are required by this amendment to make their reports as if Section 11 of the Act were in force. These reports would therefore be subject to the provisions of Section 11 because they have to carry out their work as if Section 11 were in force. When these reports are complete they will be laid before Parliament by the Secretary of State who will set by statutory instrument the appointed date for the coming into force of Section 11. As the date for the coming into force of this section would be set by statutory instrument it would require affirmative resolutions of both Houses.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para137"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="11013140000062"></a>What is the advantage of deferring the coming into force of Section 11 until it is needed, while the actual operation of the section continues in the mean time? In my view, there are at least two advantages. First, it will strengthen in practice the hands of citizens who wish to make representations about the Boundary Commission's proposals because Section 11 will not actually yet be in force. Secondly, and more importantly, it will give time for further examination, in particular independent examination, of the practical consequences of the smaller House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="11013140000063"></a>During the course of the debates in this House, there has been a recurring theme that 600 was a rather arbitrary figure-I choose my words carefully-and that the consequences may not have been fully worked through. So I think that it would provide time for an independent examination of the practical consequences of the proposals on constituencies that are in the Bill. This point has been made in the debates and it was made this afternoon, in a short trailer-I think that is the word-by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, when he rather approved this idea. It is always very pleasant to have a trailer that is favourable so perhaps the drama itself may actually be favourably received.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="11013140000064"></a>What I have suggested may be relatively small advantages but I think they are worth having, particularly because my amendment does not slow up the work required by Section 11 in the period before it enters into force. Will the Minister think carefully about the independent examination of the practical consequences of the decisions on the constituencies? In my view it could be done under my amendment-I think it would be right to do that. However, at some stage there is a strong feeling in the Committee that we should not just let it happen without any independent examination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="11013140000065"></a>To summarise my amendment: the Bill passes, the work goes on including the work on Section 11 but, just as in the well known show business phrase that the show is not over until the fat lady sings, in this case the show is not over until the Secretary of State lays a statutory instrument setting the date for it to come into force and affirmative resolutions of both Houses are agreed. That is what I might call the political equivalent of the fat lady singing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="11013140000069"></a>The Political and Constitutional Reform Committee in the other place was even more scathing. It stated:</p>

It has not been accompanied by any compelling international comparisons, nor by any information on what the Government proposes should be the size and role of a reformed upper House. The reduction would, on current plans, be made entirely from the backbenches, with no proposals to reduce the number of Ministers or of others on the Government payroll sitting and voting in the House, thus increasing the extent of executive dominance of Parliament. The savings that the Government claims, but has not proved, the reduction would lead to, would make no discernible impact on the national deficit, amounting as they do to around one millionth of the annual budget of the National Health Service. There may be a case for reducing the number of Members"-</p>

<ul><a name="11013140000125"></a>"but the Government has not made it".</ul>
<a name="110131-0002.htm_para144"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="11013140000070"></a>The Government's failure to offer any proper explanation or evidential basis for the proposed reduction in the size of the other place is worrying. Its legitimacy may have been eroded yet further by revelations on BBC's "Newsnight" by its political editor, Michael Crick, who said that the Conservative Party is orchestrating an operation to ensure that any of its current Members of Parliament unseated by the reduction to 600 are shipped off up the Corridor to your Lordships' House instead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="11013140000071"></a>Mark Field, whom I cited earlier, said that,</p>
<ul><a name="11013140000126"></a>"the current proposals for AV and the reduction in number of parliamentary constituencies are being promoted by Party managers as an expedient way to prevent our principal political opponents from recapturing office".</ul>
<p><a name="11013140000107"></a>It is possible to make light of those matters, but it gravely undermines our Parliament that such allegations are swirling around this proposal.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para146"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="11013140000072"></a>The amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Williamson of Horton, reflects that anxiety and would provide a sensible mechanism to address it. It raises issues that will need further consideration, but its crucial element, which is attractive and allows legitimacy for this major change in our constitution, is that it allows for an independent body to be set up, populated by people who are experienced and have respect, to look at the issue and come to an independent and authoritative conclusion before implementation of the change. We would need to discuss how best that would be achieved, how and when it should take place. For example, if the independent body reported within nine months to a year; there was then a vote in Parliament before the completion of the work of the Boundary Commission; and the Government were willing to contemplate some delay in the completion of the work of the Boundary Commission while not endangering the review before the next election, the aims of all in this House could be satisfied.</p>

<a name="110131-0002.htm_para147"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="11013140000073"></a>This is a test of the sincerity of the Government's position in stepping back from the precipice. It allows the Bill to go through, but it gives the opportunity for proper, independent consideration of an important aspect of our constitution. I am glad that the noble Lord the Leader of the House is to answer the debate, because we will get an authoritative answer. I really hope that he will respond by saying that he accepts in principle and that we can discuss the detail further.</p>

Earlier on the point was made that the problem with the reduction to 600 is that it increases the size of the executive relative to the Back Bench. That point was taken on board by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace. He said he did not think the legislation should be altered but he wanted to think about it. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, provides an excellent opportunity for a structured way in which we could look at that very important question and come up with a solution without amending the Bill. That should also commend it to the Government who have already endorsed the point that lies behind it.</p>

<p><a name="st_225"></a>
<a name="11013140000082"></a><b><a name="110131-0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="11013140000161"></a>Lord Strathclyde:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, for having introduced this amendment, which he did with characteristic modesty as this was his idea. As he was speaking, I could tell that he had struck a chord in the House and it was no surprise that my noble friend Lord Newton rose to support him. I was going to say that within this amendment there is a germ of an idea, but that belittles it too much. I thought maybe a seed, but really it is a sapling of an idea that we would like to work on.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="11013140000083"></a>I must refute the suggestion made by the noble and learned Lord that this part of the Bill is fundamentally partisan. It is not designed to be and I know that he accepts that. I can understand why some Members of another place might think that it is, but it is not. The amendment provides that the new rules for drawing up constituency boundaries would not come into force upon Royal Assent, as the Bill provides, but that a boundary review would still be conducted on the basis of the new rules. The new boundary provisions would be commenced only once the Boundary Commissions had reported and following a debate in both Houses. The intention could be that Parliament could consider how the commissions had applied the new rules in drawing up constituencies and then consider whether the boundary reforms should be made. The existing legislation, the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, would remain in force in the mean time, and Parliament would then effectively have the choice of commencing the new rules or retaining the 1986 Act rules.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="11013140000084"></a>While I understand that the amendment has been brought forward in a creative and helpful spirit, I am going to explain in a moment why the Government cannot accept it as it is, not as a knee-jerk reaction, but for two principal reasons. The first reason is that it would break the linkage in the Bill between the entry into force of the new boundaries following the review and the commencement of the provisions on the alternative vote in the event that there is a yes vote in the referendum. We have debated that linkage at length, and I understand that there are different views across the House. However, the Government have set out their stall on the matter, and we believe that the current position in the Bill is the right one.</p>




<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1272"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1272</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110131-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="11013140000085"></a>The second reason is arguably even more important as we are concerned at the implications of the Boundary Commission conducting a review with the rules for doing so as if it were on probation. This is the point that my noble friend Lord Rennard made. It is one thing to ask this House and the other place to consider objectively the rules to which the commission should work when setting new boundaries; it is quite another for Members of Parliament, many of whom have a party-political interest in the outcome of such changes, to be shown the practical results of the application of a set of rules which would potentially be applied at a forthcoming election and then be asked to evaluate the merits of the proposals and to consider which set of rules they prefer.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="11013140000086"></a>The effect of the amendment would be that shortly after October 2013, when we expect the commissioners to report, Parliament and, in particular, the other place would be asked to vote on two alternative maps: one with 650 constituencies and one with 600. For me, that is a serious change in the nature of the scrutiny role that the House as a whole undertakes when the recommendations of the independent Boundary Commissions are put before it, and I have strong reservations about taking such a step. In addition, if the recommendations were rejected, constituencies would remain as they currently are until the next review, by which time, in England at least, they would be 20 years out of date. There is also the question of whether we should provide for considerable time and resource, not least that of the general public who contribute to these reviews, to be expended on a review that would have no guarantee of ever being implemented.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="11013140000087"></a>Having said that, I understand the issues that have been raised in debates about whether the size of the House of Commons set by this Bill at 600 MPs is the right one. I can see that this amendment, perhaps in part, is a response to that since it would ask Parliament to let the review proceed and put off the decision on whether to accept the new rules until after it has had a chance to see the resulting constituency map.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="11013140000088"></a>I have set out why the Government consider that approach goes too far. The Government have also been clear that the proposed size for the House of Commons set in the Bill is the right one. However, we would be open to bringing forward a provision on Report for a review under independent supervision after implementation of the new constituencies of the impact of 600 seats and requiring that that begins in a timescale determined in the Bill.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="11013140000089"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, finds that a helpful suggestion on going forward, and I am sure that he will reflect on it. Moreover, we would be extremely happy to discuss it with him further. However, for the reasons I have outlined, I would ask him to withdraw his amendment.</p>

The noble Lord's reply implies considerable pessimism about the coalition's success in achieving an affirmative resolution in both Houses. I would say that the Government are highly likely to achieve an affirmative resolution in both Houses since the material that we are dealing with is material that they have put into their own Bill. I am therefore not convinced by that argument, but I am convinced of the strength of the Government's position on it. That is my first point.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="11013140000091"></a>Secondly, on the more important question of the independent review, I note that the Government have gone some way towards accepting that there should be an independent review. That is something, but it is not exactly what would result from my amendment, which would make the independent review available before the coming into force of Section 11, so there is a significant difference. I therefore conclude that, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, the Government have not actually clinched anything on this amendment-I think that is the phrase. I am, however, interested in the extent of the commitment to an independent review, what it would be and when it might come into force.</p>

I suppose that successive Governments who did so much good would also occasionally get things wrong, and this is one of them. I shall just explain the current situation for registration both now and historically. We have household registration, which means that a form goes to each household, be it a flat, a house or a bungalow, and one person in the household fills out the form on behalf of all others living there. That person is normally mum, who fills out the form for her children who are aged over 16, and her husband or partner. If we think of our own situations, whatever type of family relationships we have or the people we have shared our homes with in the past, there is always one person in the household who takes responsibility for things such as voter registration, paying bills and so on. The result is that we have a fairly accurate register that is one of the cheapest in the world to administer.</p>




<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1274"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column 1274</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110131-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="11013140000094"></a>As part of the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009, the previous Government included a section that will change that system so that each individual will be responsible for registering themselves. We need to look no further than Northern Ireland to know what will happen if this change is implemented. In 2002, when the Electoral Fraud (Northern Ireland) Act was passed, under which individual registration was introduced and each person had to register themselves, 10 per cent of the public were lost overnight from the register, which went from 96 per cent to 85 per cent of the population.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="11013140000095"></a>When an investigation was held into the loss from the register, it was found that it consisted mainly of three groups of people. The first group consisted of young people, first-time voters and 18-25 year olds, the second group consisted of people in areas of high social deprivation, and the third group consisted of people with mental health disabilities. Mencap has produced a useful report in Northern Ireland should anyone wish to look at it.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="11013140000096"></a>Before implementing such provisions across the rest of the United Kingdom, we should consider the fact that there are sections of the population here that are not similar to that in Northern Ireland. For example, Northern Ireland does not have a very mobile population. There is no high provision of privately rented, insecure tenancies of a year or under; there is very little multiple occupancy; and it has a stable population-people do not move far from their parents and grandparents. The rest of the United Kingdom has a large population of ethnic minorities; a recently arrived, large population of inward migrants; a huge private rented sector of tenancies of a year and under; and many multi-occupancy properties. Many people also move for jobs. We know that something like 20 per cent of the population of Great Britain moves every year.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="11013140000097"></a>At the last general election, just over 45 million people were registered. If what happened in Northern Ireland were to happen in the rest of the UK, we would lose 4.5 million people from the register in addition to the 3.5 million that are already missing. This would amount to 8 million. Academics suggest that we would lose another 10 per cent because of the reasons that I have outlined, which would remove another 4 million people from the register. This would mean that almost 12 million people in this country would not have a stake in the democratic election of our Government.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="11013140000098"></a>In Northern Ireland in 2005, some 160,000 voters who did not complete registration forms were reinstated on the register. I therefore do not understand why the Government, when looking at their databases to increase registration in this country, could not do something similar to what has been done in Northern Ireland. As I said, there were 160,000 more voters at the 2005 elections.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="11013140000099"></a>We have an opportunity to change this situation now because we have not yet moved to individual registration, which was initially envisaged to happen post the 2015 election. I am now confused because I believe the Government might soon introduce these provisions. Perhaps the Leader of the House will come back to me on that if it is envisaged that the new system will be in place by the 2015 elections.</p>

I also hope that the Government will consider bringing in an average number to each constituency, rather than a simple limit on 600. If this number of people falls off the register-and we all know the areas that will fall off the register-when you combine the current under-registration and the fall-off in the new register, in certain parts of the country some of these constituencies will have something like 150,000 eligible electors, not registered electors. That is not good for our society, in which we have so many people who do not have a stake in the democratic election of our Government. That creates weak communities and ends up creating bad government. I beg to move.</p>

It seems to me that since the boundary review will depend on electorates as of 1 December 2010, the only effective change brought about by this amendment would be to change the electoral registration system in Northern Ireland. Did she consult any of the parties in Northern Ireland, or indeed the Northern Ireland Assembly, in suggesting that the basis of electoral registration in Northern Ireland be changed in this amendment? Would it generally be accepted that the only effect of making that change in registration processes in Northern Ireland would be to delay the entire boundary review beyond the date of the next general election in 2015?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="11013144000007"></a>My noble friend Lady McDonagh is absolutely right; this is a mistake that the former Labour Government made. It is a pity that the noble Lord, Lord Wills, is not here today to hear this because he was the principal architect of it, but it worries me. My noble friend has great experience of running the Labour Party and understands these things intricately, and I give all credit to my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours. He opposed this individual registration on every opportunity in this House-again and again-vigorously and consistently, and no one paid any attention to him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="11013144000008"></a>This kind of legislation reminds me that a lot of the thinking in some of our legislation comes from middle-class, middle-aged people sitting in drawing rooms in the south-east of England.

Many years ago, I was the chairman of the Scottish adult literacy agency. A large number of people cannot read and write and are unable to fill in this form; they need someone to fill it in. I can go through category after category of people who would need help as they would be reluctant and unable to fill in that form. It is very difficult for students away from home and for people overseas. My son is working out in Bolivia at the moment, but he is still going to come back and will be entitled to vote. We can think of all sorts of examples of how this will make it difficult to vote.</p>

They do not all sit round the dinner table every night discussing these kinds of things. They lead a hard, difficult life. They might have difficulties with poverty or literacy, or they might be confused, in many cases, and need that kind of help. I hope that more people will come and support this.</p>

I have never been able to understand why the Liberal Democrats supported that. I understand that the Electoral Commission, in its various reports, kept on promoting the principle. However, the Liberal Democrats must have been aware of the dangers that would arise, even in some of their own seats such as the one that includes Bermondsey. Bermondsey is in a seat that could be gravely damaged through the introduction of individual registration, and I simply cannot understand why they seemingly allowed it all to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="11013144000012"></a>My own view was very simple; there was a problem to be resolved, and that was fraud within the electoral system. That, I suspect, was the driving force behind those who argued for it. They chose an extremely expensive way of resolving the problem, whereby the whole of the United Kingdom would be subject to

Without going into detail, most Members of the Committee will understand precisely what I mean. There is a problem in certain parts of the United Kingdom, which had to be dealt with.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="11013144000013"></a>On two occasions under two separate Bills, I came up with a recommendation that would have sorted out that problem by giving local authorities the right to opt for a particular status whereby they would be given additional resources to sort out the problems in their areas, but the Labour Government unfortunately turned it down. Indeed, I lobbied almost every member of the Labour Cabinet about it to try to get them to understand the importance of avoiding individual registration, which will do immeasurable harm to our party in the longer term. Now we have it in place at a time when local authorities' budgets in this area are not ring-fenced and when local authorities will not place the money that is necessary to ensure a high level of individual registration.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="11013144000014"></a>I welcome my noble friend's amendment, and I hope only that the Government will accept it. They will not, of course, because they too have been convinced by this rubbish recommendation from the Electoral Commission, which should have known better.</p>

<p><a name="st_234"></a>
<a name="11013144000015"></a><b><a name="110131-0003.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="11013144000113"></a>Lord Falconer of Thoroton:</b> I, too, stand convicted of being convinced by the rubbish recommendation of the Electoral Commission. I believe that the principle of moving to individual registration is right. Apart from anything else, the concept of modern citizenship is that the task of registering to vote should no longer be the preserve of the head of the household. However, if the principle of individual registration is correct, the practicality involved in the best way to get there is more complicated. As the experience of introducing individual registration in Northern Ireland has shown, the consequences can be catastrophic if you get the process wrong. The very swift introduction of individual registration in that part of the United Kingdom in 2002 led to a collapse in the number on the electoral register, with a fall of around 119,000.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="11013144000016"></a>Learning the lessons of that experience, the Labour Government legislated to introduce individual voter registration according to a clearly phased timetable based on the twin principles of ensuring the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the electoral register. That process gave the Electoral Commission a central role in determining whether the final move from household to individual registration was safe to proceed with, and the transition was based on a two-stage process-a voluntary phase and a compulsory phase. The legislation made it clear that the voluntary phase would not finish before 2014. In 2014, the Electoral Commission would then be required to assess, based on trends in voter registration, whether the collection of identifying information should be made obligatory. Assuming that a positive recommendation was agreed by Parliament, compulsory individual registration would follow in 2015.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="11013144000017"></a>The timetable received explicit backing from the Conservative and Liberal Democrat Front-Benchers in the other place. It is a matter of deep concern that the Government have now abandoned those pledges and that they intend to tear up our carefully formulated

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="11013144000018"></a>As I have already noted, the rush to the production of individual registration in Northern Ireland produced a dramatic fall in registered numbers. The Electoral Commission subsequently reported that the new registration process disproportionately impacted on young people and students, people with learning disabilities, people with disabilities generally and those living in areas of high deprivation. We must not repeat that outcome when the system is introduced in Great Britain. That is especially important in view of the Electoral Commission's report of March 2010, which identified who was least represented on the electoral register.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="11013144000019"></a>The phased implementation of full individual registration by autumn 2015 was intended to minimise as far as possible the risk of worsening under-registration. The Government already intend to cut seats and redraw boundaries on the basis of an electoral register from which 3.5 million eligible voters are missing. The premature rollout of individual registration would increase that number and, over time, would distort the planned boundary revisions even more. I do not support the policy of reversing the move to individual registration. However, I do support making sure that it is done properly.</p>

I do not want to say "We are where we are", although we sort of are where we are. Two or three years ago, I think that I would have allied myself with noble Lords on the Back Benches opposite, but the law was changed by the previous Government with cross-party support. Provision was made for an eventual move to individual registration in the rest of the United Kingdom under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act. The Electoral Commission supports a move to individual registration, and Her Majesty's Government are committed to speeding up the process of registration in Great Britain because, as is widely known, the current system of household registration is vulnerable to fraud. Although the number of cases of electoral fraud is low, the perception created by them undermines confidence in the electoral system as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="11013144000024"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady McDonagh, asked whether we are speeding up the process. The answer is yes. The Government are speeding up the introduction of individual voter registration by making it compulsory from 2014. Under the new plans, the voluntary phase of individual registration will be dropped and, instead, Great Britain will in 2014 move directly to compulsory individual registration. If this amendment were passed, it would delay the commencement of one of the central provisions of the Bill, and this would prevent a boundary review from being carried out in time for the next general election. I am not suggesting that that is the noble Baroness's motive, but it would be the effect if it were to be agreed. As the Committee knows, we must proceed with a boundary review to ensure that when the next general election is held, boundaries in England are not 15 years out of date and do not continue to exacerbate the inequality that is present in the current system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="11013144000025"></a>Returning household registration to Northern Ireland would, we feel in government, be a detrimental step that is likely to lead in time to the widespread perception of fraud that was so prevalent in Northern Ireland before 2002. We want to prevent that from returning, with the consequent undermining of confidence in the political process in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="11013144000026"></a>It has been an interesting and useful debate, and I urge noble Lords to run a campaign on it, but they should do it outwith the provisions of the Bill, and I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

I will quickly answer a few questions and come back to a couple of points. This amendment would make no difference whatever in Northern Ireland; the 2002 Act has been superseded by the Electoral Registration (Northern Ireland) Act and we are reinstating and registering people who had not even filled in forms. If the Government were to agree to continue with household registration, I would have no problem in removing Northern Ireland from the provisions of this amendment, but it would not make any difference, as I explained. They have reinstated some 160,000 voters already, and I remind the House that this has not resolved issues of fraud but has disfranchised adult children, people in areas of social deprivation and people with mental health disabilities.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="11013144000028"></a>On the second question that was asked, yes, I do appreciate that it would have an impact on the second boundary and that the current boundaries would be the ones that were drawn up on the register at the end of last year. I am in no way seeking to delay the current Boundary Commission redrawing in my amendment. I particularly want to thank my noble friend Lord Foulkes. I have lived in households that have adults with literacy issues, and it is obvious that one person in the household takes responsibility for registration, bills, paperwork and so on. This is not an old-fashioned concept of the head of the household; it is about understanding families and understanding that everyone has a different responsibility and everyone helps everyone else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="11013144000031"></a>I want to say why my amendment is different from earlier amendments which laid down that the referendum should not take place on 5 May. In our earlier debates, the arguments that we concentrated on for not having it on 5 May were that it clashed with the Welsh Assembly elections, the Scottish Parliament elections and the local authority elections, that this would lead to a lot of political noise-particularly as Liberal Democrat and Labour candidates fought each other-and that that would not be an atmosphere in which there could be sensible consideration of this issue. Those arguments are all valid. My amendment is compatible, I admit, with 5 May as a referendum date. It is three months after Royal Assent. We have only to give the Bill Royal Assent on Thursday night. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, will be delighted if we achieve that timetable. Stranger things have happened in these Houses of Parliament, so it would be possible to have it on those days. All that the amendment lays down is that there must be three months between Royal Assent and the referendum to consider the matter. That is three months for information, persuasion and contemplation before decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="11013144000032"></a>Let us consider the present state of public opinion. I am taking a large poll done by YouGov in September last year. It asked first whether people had heard of AV and knew what it was. Roughly one-third said yes, they had heard of it and knew a bit about what it was. Of that one-third, I bet that half were lying-they did not know what it was, though they may have heard of it. One-third said that they had heard of it but they did not have a clue what it meant, and one-third had neither heard of it nor had a clue what it meant. That is the information backlog that we face as we run up to the referendum on this issue. There is a huge job of

Those arguments, which anyone studying the House's proceedings on Part 1 of the Bill will have heard quite often, are difficult and balanced and need the most careful consideration. The electorate must think very hard about what they are doing.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="11013144000033"></a>The suggestion that this can be done in less than three months is not right. Yes, in that time a referendum can be held-the Electoral Commission can do its work, the ballot papers can be printed and so on-but we will not get a properly valid answer. I say that whether it is the answer that I want, a yes, or the one that many noble Lords want, a no. It will not be properly valid because the people will not have had long enough to contemplate the proposition put before them.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="11013144000034"></a>If the verdict seems invalid, that will have consequences for legitimacy. The side that loses will be able to stand up almost immediately and say, "It was fixed. It was cooked. This referendum is not the considered view of the British people. It's a referendum held at a time to suit a political timetable". Why on earth the Liberal Democrats want the referendum on 5 May continues to escape me, but they clearly do. That would cast doubt on the legitimacy of the verdict.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="11013144000035"></a>It is also true, of course, that had the House made faster progress on the Bill-I do not attribute blame on all this; I am delighted that we are now belatedly making progress-the Bill might by now have been law and the campaigning able to be started, so there would have been time to inform the public. However, the passage of time has meant that the time available for contemplating the actual issue in the referendum has been squeezed. My amendment says that it must be squeezed no further. There should be a three-month period between Royal Assent and the referendum. I hope that this is a common-sense proposition in a common-sense amendment and that therefore it will become a consensual amendment around the House. That just shows that I am a very hopeful sort of a chap. However, it should be understood that the argument is as I have set it out. If the Government reject it, it will be for reasons quite other, and arguably less reputable, than the House and the country have reason to deserve.</p>

Therefore, what happens in the polling booth is of great interest to me, as indeed it should be to them. The question is, in what circumstances is it more likely that the AV referendum will be won? I put to them two distinctly different scenarios: one where a person walks into a polling station, having heard a campaign, and votes for it deliberately, in circumstances where it is highly likely that those who are opposed to it will not bother going to the polls. The advantage of having a referendum day on its own is that it would concentrate the minds of those who were in favour of change to go and vote, whereas those who were against change would, more likely than not, simply stay away.

The provisions of the amendment are not compatible with a 5 May date: we do not need to look at our diaries to ascertain that. However, I agreed entirely with the rest of his speech. There is not enough time to do the job properly. There never was, in my view. As the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, said, this is a fundamental matter. The Liberal Democrats also know my position. They know that I support electoral reform and I want PR, but this is a dishonest form of AV. In my view, it is a corrupt form of voting. The coalition has chosen the date to match the election date. That is fine; that is the coalition's responsibility. I am quite happy with that. I do not have a view whether it should be held on that or another day, but the Lib Dems will be severely punished for holding the referendum on 5 May for lots of other reasons. I think that it will be lost. However, it is sad to have a referendum on the major constitutional issue of our voting system-we have never had such a referendum-and to lose it due to insufficient time being given to the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="11013144000038"></a>I do not want to labour the point but one has only to look at what happened in New Zealand and read the information that was published by the New Zealand electoral commission that went out to individuals. I cannot envisage anything remotely like that being provided here in terms of quality and quantity, and then being taken on board by the electorate. Our Electoral Commission might push out a lot of leaflets but pamphlets and booklets are needed rather than leaflets. This matter goes well beyond two sides of A4. The information must be assimilated and debated if it is to be successful. The assessment was that 10 weeks were needed, which is how we have the date that we have, which was debated in this House back in December. We knew that the Bill needed to get Royal Assent before the recess in February. The assessment was that it could be done in 10 weeks. Mechanically, it can be done. Intellectually and educationally, I do not think that it can be done. That is what I think is wrong with my noble friend's amendment. It should have been six months, but that is the Government's responsibility. They have rushed this Bill. There was no need to rush it within a year of the general election. It could still have been done on the election date. I appreciate that the devolved elections come only once every four years, and if that is the key test that more people go out to vote, so be it. However, I just do not think that it can be done in the way that hearts and minds can be won. We will get a poor result. I think it will fail, but it will be for the wrong reasons. I wish it were for the right reasons. I will not support it; I will campaign against it, but I would rather that it failed for the right

From my noble friends-who are friends as well as noble friends-what we have here is excuse-gathering. It is always "if only" this had happened or that had happened, people would flock to the banner of PR. People are not interested. In the main, people are quite happy with first past the post because of all its benefits, which have been discussed many times before and I do not intend to go into them. There is always an excuse from the people who support PR that people do not understand it and there is also the deception that people have not been educated about it. Pro-PR people really do not take any account of how they sound. They sound arrogant saying, "If only people were educated, they would learn the error of their ways and flock to the banner of proportional representation". It is not true.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="11013144000040"></a>I will not spend more time speaking about this, but I intend to clear up something, although sometimes it is like a bingo hall in here when you get the clickety-click of the little clicker of the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, as he counts the number of times people have contributed. That is fair game. However, I would like to point out something to him. In the context of this, he is either completely unaware of or not interested in studying the way in which the other place operates, or he is quite content to spread misconceptions. I understand from my noble friend that a misconception has spread among the Liberal Democrats. The blog of the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, says that Tommy McAvoy-it is quite insulting, actually- "muttered just four words" in the House of Commons in so many years. I do not really mutter. I have never been accused of muttering before. Clearly, either through lack of knowledge or deception-he can tell me which it is-he implies that I could have spoken there; but any politician worth his salt in here who is not intending to deceive people knows full well that Whips do not speak in the other place. I will give way in a moment, once I finish my point, and I will give the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, all the merit it deserves, whatever it is. A side issue is that my good friend Alistair Carmichael-he is a good friend even though he is a Liberal Democrat-is now silent. Does that mean that he is reduced to muttering?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="11013144000044"></a>I will raise a completely new matter. I make no apology for that, except to the Minister for not alerting him, because I did not know that there would be an opportunity today to raise this. I doubt if officials have cottoned on to this, unless they are really top-notch. The matter was raised yesterday in <I>Scotland on Sunday</I>. The Minister may have picked it up, because he lives in Scotland, as I do, and may have seen the paper. The matter was picked up today by the dailies and I alerted my Front Bench to it earlier. It is a new and genuine worry about having the election and the referendum on the same day. It was raised not by me but by the association of returning officers in Scotland, which said that it would be impossible to do the count for the Scottish Parliament elections on Thursday evening and make the announcement on Friday morning-as was the case in the past-because of the complications arising from having two elections together and the possibility of making mistakes in the middle of the night. We know the difficulties that arise when one has to work through the night.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="11013144000045"></a>It is a genuine worry of all parties in Scotland-certainly of the Labour Party and of the SNP Government, and I understand that at least some Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have expressed concern-that this will mean that on Friday morning there will be total confusion about the outcome of the election, because it will take some time to go through the count on Thursday night and Friday, and probably the result of the Scottish election will not be known until Saturday or Sunday. That will create tremendous problems-with the additional member system that we have, when constituencies are counted before additional members-for parties to know which of them will be in power, for there to be discussions between them about possible arrangements or for the largest party to decide to go ahead. It will create tremendous problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="11013144000046"></a>I will not blame the Minister if he has no immediate response to this, because the matter has just come up recently and I only became aware of it on Sunday. It would be helpful for all of us if he would look at that, take it away and ask officials-particularly officials in Scotland and in the Scotland Office, in discussion with the Scottish Executive-what the problems are and whether there is any way that they might be ameliorated.</p>

However, it seems that this is a scam by the first past the posters to attack a PR fair voting system. It is inevitable with a PR system that one will not get an instant result. That has never been the case and no one has ever claimed that it was. So what if it takes 48 or 72 hours to count the votes because they have been cast in a fairer system than first past the post?

They are raising genuine concerns as non-political civil servants who work for local authorities. However, I draw the attention of my noble friend to Belgium, which has this PR system. It is seven months since the Belgian election and the country still does not have a Government. That is probably a better example. In Scotland, we can manage it rather more quickly than that.</p>

Indeed, following on from the previous amendment, I suspect that the Leader of the House may secretly or quietly agree with it. He may not be able to say so, because, as he reminded us, he is now in government. However, the amendment is sensible and I ask the noble Lord at least to take it back and consider it carefully. Also, the point of my noble friend Lord Foulkes about what appeared in the Scottish press yesterday is well worth the Government considering, if not responding to tonight.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="11013144000051"></a>This amendment is not contrary to the will of this Committee, due to the second Rooker amendment that is now well known in political history-the one that this Committee passed on 30 November stating that the voting system referendum must be held at some point before 31 October next year, which is clearly within the three months that this amendment mentions. The amendment of my noble friend Lord Rooker was subtle but important. It was hastily dismissed by the Government at the time of its passing, but perhaps they now regret that. It would have eased the pressure under which the Government find themselves.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="11013144000052"></a>By recommending a gap of three months between Royal Assent and the holding of the referendum, this amendment facilitates a period of proper preparation, including, most importantly, a proper information and education campaign on the difficult issues that the public are being asked to vote on, which are not that simple. We were reminded about New Zealand, which, when it changed its voting system in the early 1990s, provided a year-long information campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="11013144000053"></a>I remind the Committee that Amendment 6 to this Bill, moved a long time ago, advised that a gap of between six and 18 months be inserted into the timetable for the referendum to allow for preparation and an information campaign. This amendment falls far short of that, but is moved with the same motivation. It seeks to facilitate a state of affairs that is an improvement on the 10 weeks or less that the Government's timetabling will provide the Electoral Commission with to disseminate information about the poll. It is less than 10 weeks in which to inform the public about an issue which Electoral Commission research informs us there is perilously little information or knowledge about.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="11013144000054"></a>This is not the proper context in which to be asking the public to make such an important decision, whether you are for this form of AV or for first past the post. Officials and interested participants should be given adequate time to provide this information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="11013144000058"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, asked questions about the Scottish association of returning officers. I will certainly look into the questions that he has raised. Earlier in Committee we discussed this and the information we had at that time was that there would be no problem in Scotland. It will be interesting to see whether that has changed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="11013144000059"></a>The view of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, was that people are not prepared. Interestingly, he said a number of things in support of the amendment. The amendment provides a three-month delay, as though they would not be prepared now but they would be prepared if there were a three-month delay. I am not sure that is right. I think people have a perception about AV and I am not sure that there will be an enormous difference between the 10-week limit that we have at the moment and three months. The Government see no compelling reason to fix the length of the period for this referendum to a minimum of three months.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="11013144000060"></a>It is worth reminding noble Lords opposite that the previous Government worked to swift timetables in organising the 1998 devolution referendums. This referendum was announced as far back as June or July. The Bill was introduced in July in the House of Commons. Of course, as has been recognised, I do not know when the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, tabled the amendment but it would mean that a target date of 5 February would have to be set, and that is later this week. If that target were not met, the provision would need to be given retrospective effect so that the referendum period could still begin three months from the date of the poll; for example, on a date before the Bill receives Royal Assent, and neither is desirable or necessary.</p>

The Electoral Commission expanded on that in its briefing on 7 December and said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a><a name="11013144000099"></a>"We have been working with local Counting Officers and Returning Officers to prepare plans on the basis of a referendum on 5 May 2011, alongside the other polls planned for that day, and in our most recent assessment we said that sufficient progress has been made for us to be confident they will be well run. Similarly, those intending to campaign at the referendum will have been developing their plans for the date specified in the Bill as introduced".</p>

<p><a name="11013144000095"></a>So a good deal of work has already been done by the registration officers and those who wish to run the campaigns have been working on their material.

First, he said that practical arrangements could be made by 5 May and I said precisely the same thing myself. That was never in question. The question is whether a legitimate debate can take place in so short a period. The only argument which I think I heard him use against that was the argument from Scottish and Welsh devolution. He did not say what the exact timetable on those Bills was but that the referendums were carried out quickly. That is true, but there is no analogy between the two. The issues of Scottish and Welsh devolution had been matters of the most intense debate in Scotland and Wales. There had been a failed attempt with a referendum about 10 years before the critical referendum took place. There was not a moment when this was not in the public eye in Scotland and Wales, with one political party having a change to the Government's arrangements as its central and single objective.</p>

Noble Lords will remember how the last general election was marred by scenes of voters queuing for hours, a shortage of ballot papers and the electorate being denied access to polling stations. Sadly, this is routinely the experience of millions of disabled voters at every election for every tier of government. There is also a worrying lack of accountability as there is currently no way for people to appeal when they are wrongly denied their right to vote, other than by mounting an expensive, onerous and bureaucratic legal challenge.</p>

Some provision has been made in the Representation of the People Act and the Electoral Commission has produced some helpful guidance. However, local authorities do not always implement it and more still needs to be done at local level to ensure that elections are fully inclusive.</p>

Local authorities knew that 14 per cent of the polling stations they intended to use would not be accessible to disabled voters, but very few authorities outside Northern Ireland made any effort to tell voters about the accessibility of their polling stations or to offer an alternative option to them.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="11013144000070"></a>The right to vote is laid down in statute, the European Convention on Human Rights, and, most recently, in Article 29 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but, in practice, voting is still a right denied to many disabled people. We need to bolster the legislation to guarantee that right. Of course, the Bill can do that only for the referendum, but I would hope that if we can get it right on this occasion, that could set the standard for all future elections.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="11013144000071"></a>Amendment 103 would give the chief counting officer a duty, rather than a power, to give regional counting officers and counting officers directions requiring them to take specified steps in preparation for the referendum. Amendment 104 would require that such steps should include ensuring that adequate provision is made for disabled voters. Amendments 105 and 106 lay an analogous duty on regional counting officers, for a region; and on counting officers, for voting areas within that region. Amendment 107 further adds to the matters on which regional counting officers should give direction to counting officers,</p>
<ul><a name="11013144000103"></a>"directions about the discharge of their functions in relation to voters with disabilities",</ul>
<p><a name="11013144000096"></a>and,</p>
<ul><a name="11013144000104"></a>"directions requiring them to address any complaints from voters arising from the administration of the referendum".</ul>
<a name="110131-0003.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="11013144000072"></a>Amendment 110 creates a robust duty for the Electoral Commission to ensure that voters are able to access information about the referendum, and strengthens its general duty to give specific guidance on achieving equality of access to the voting process. Amendment 114 and Amendments 116 to 119 would require counting officers to ensure that the polling places used for the referendum were accessible to disabled voters, to notify voters of any polling stations that may not be accessible, and to provide details of alternative voting options.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="11013144000073"></a>The Electoral Commission has stated-and I fear that the Government may say-that it does not believe that the amendments are necessary, given the duties and responsibilities already laid on counting officers and the Electoral Commission by existing legislation. Existing legislation is not working, as the Polls Apart surveys have demonstrated, so we clearly need something more.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="11013144000074"></a>I have brought forward a reasonable set of amendments designed to address the situation. If they can do it in Northern Ireland, they can do it in the rest of the United Kingdom. I very much hope that the Government will see their way to accepting the amendments, thus helping to expedite the passage of the Bill through your Lordships' House. I beg to move.</p>

We are proud to have him as a Member of this House and greatly welcome his contribution not only to debates on the status and position of disabled people in our society but much more widely.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="11013144000076"></a>The situation that the noble Lord has described to us is a disgrace. It may be that, as the Electoral Commission has suggested, legislation is more or less sufficient, or ought to be, to ensure that the proper requirements of disabled people within our electoral system are accommodated, but evidently it is not working in practice. Whether that is a matter of lack of financial resources or, more likely, that it is a matter of attitudes and culture I do not know. But in all events, we need to take energetic and determined steps to greatly improve the state of affairs to which the noble Lord has alerted us.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="11013144000077"></a>It may be that the amendments he has proposed are the kind of practical amendments needed to supply some of the deficiencies in existing legislation and regulations. Again, I do not know for sure, but it seems to me that the measures that the noble Lord has proposed are modest, practical and reasonable, and it is hard to imagine what objection could be made to them. But whether or not legislative change is the key to improving the state of affairs that he has described, ensuring that disabled people are included as they should be within our electoral and broader political systems, it is evident that there needs to be leadership and drive to ensure that the attitudes and the performance of professional staff in this field, and I daresay also of the political parties, are greatly improved.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="11013144000078"></a>I therefore look forward to the response from the Minister. We should all be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, for calling our attention to a matter of serious concern and on a purely bipartisan basis. There is no party politics in this. I am sure it is universally agreed around the House that the arrangements that govern elections and certainly the holding of this particular referendum will in practice ensure that disabled people are in no way inhibited or debarred from participating.</p>

The noble Lord said that this was a reasonable set of amendments and we on the opposition Front Bench agree. We think they are all sensible as well as reasonable and that they should be supported around the House in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="11013144000080"></a>Our advice to the Government is that they should go away with these amendments and think very carefully indeed about how they can implement them. If they do not, I suspect the noble Lord will come back on Report and will have very wide support around the House from all sides so that these practical suggestions can be put into effect. As I say, the opposition Front Bench support these amendments.</p>

Perhaps I may say at the outset that the Government enormously welcome the principles behind these amendments. I shall give him a very full reply and I hope that he will consider it before Report.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="11013144000082"></a>Similar amendments were debated in the other place and the Government stated their commitment to ensuring that everybody has an equal opportunity to cast their votes in this referendum. It is right and important that every effort is made to ensure that all individuals, with or without disabilities, are able to exercise their democratic rights. The Bill already contains significant provisions to ensure that voting is fair for all. This includes those voters with disabilities. Existing anti-discrimination legislation also already imposes duties on public authorities which are directly targeted at involvement in public life. Specifically, the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 was amended to include a duty on public authorities to promote the equality of individuals with disabilities.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="11013144000083"></a>Ensuring that ballot papers and polling stations are accessible to all is already a duty that counting officers will need to take forward. For the purposes of the referendum, the chief counting officer will also be able to give directions to counting officers on how they discharge these functions.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="11013144000084"></a>The Government have discussed aspects of the Bill with Scope, which does important work in directly supporting people with disabilities and whose reports are taken very seriously by government. We have already made some changes to the ballot papers to reflect its suggestions and have given the chief counting officer power to modify the voter-facing forms to make them easier to use and understand. However, as has been debated in the other place, the Government are not convinced that the amendments that have been tabled on this issue are the best way of achieving the commendable aims that underlie them.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="11013144000085"></a>In many instances, the chief counting officer and regional counting officers will already have the power to do what the amendments propose. Amendments 103 to 106 would turn these powers into obligations, which would not add anything to the commission's available options and may be actively damaging. If we take away the commission's discretion to decide when it needs to issue, for example, directions or guidance on disability issues, the commission may have to do work when its efforts could more usefully be directed elsewhere. That might impinge on the commission's activities in other areas. I know that the commission treats disability issues very seriously and is mindful that it is important to ensure ease of access where possible but, given its other commitments in the referendum, we need to give the commission the room to judge what action is necessary to support the aims of these amendments.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="11013144000086"></a>The commission provided some very helpful briefing on this matter when the same subject was raised in the other place. The briefing highlighted that,</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="11013144000087"></a>The chief counting officer will issue guidance and directions to RCOs and COs that will cover their duties in relation to accessibility and disabled voters under relevant equality and electoral legislation. These include: ensuring that polling stations meet the accessibility requirements of the DDA; ensuring that information, forms and notices relating to the voting process are available in alternative, accessible formats; making available enlarged sample versions of the ballot paper in polling stations; and providing a tactile voting device in each polling station to enable voters with visual impairments to vote.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="11013144000088"></a>The commission points out that, as at other elections in the UK, voters who have a disability may ask polling station staff for assistance with voting or may take someone with them to the polling station to help them cast their vote and that people voting by post may ask someone to help them with the process of completing their ballot paper and postal voting statement.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="11013144000089"></a>The commission will continue to work with Mencap, the RNIB, Scope and other representative and advocacy organisations to ensure the referendum that is managed and delivered in a way that ensures that all electors are able to participate effectively.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="11013144000090"></a>The way in which the obligations in these amendments will interact with the very important legal obligations that are already imposed by the Disabilities Discrimination Act and the Equality Act is also a cause for concern. Indeed, these amendments may add relatively little in a substantive sense. If the aim is to ensure that the rights of disabled voters are protected, surely that is best served by clarity of understanding about what is required by law. It would be very unfortunate if a multiplicity of obligations and a confused understanding of how they interacted stood in the way of precisely that sort of clarity, but I fear that that is one potentially serious effect of accepting these amendments.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="11013144000091"></a>The Government welcome the debate prompted by these amendments and encourage further dialogue, and I offer any further dialogue that the noble Lord would like, so that it may be brought to bear not on this poll alone, but on the current electoral legislative framework to identify whether improvements can be made in the round. The Government will keep under review ways in which the democratic process can be enhanced, and of course we welcome the views of Scope, the Electoral Commission and members of this House in that debate.</p>

<a name="110131-0003.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="11013144000092"></a>The aim of enhancing equal opportunity for all voters is admirable and I strongly support it, but the Government are not persuaded that amending this Bill in this way is the right way to achieve these important aims. I have spoken at some length, as I promised I would, and I hope that the noble Lord will find some encouragement in my words. I hope also that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

The powers in Clause 66 allow us to gather such information as is necessary to help the Government to decide what provisions to make in future secondary legislation, powers which also enable the Government to review the operation and effect of policies that are under way. The matters that the noble Baroness seeks to cover are all, I believe, potentially germane to these issues, and are therefore covered in principle by the existing powers.

<p><a name="1101314000010"></a>I apologise for the wording in this amendment. As originally worded, subsection (1)(b) referred to "special glass" and not "energy efficient windows", and when I changed the amendment I regret I did not change the explanatory paragraph below, which talks about the glass. I anticipate the amendment in this form is unlikely to be accepted by the Committee but if the Minister was minded I am sure he could change it.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000011"></a>It is important that we try to encourage people, as we are in this Bill, to spend their money on energy efficiency measures, but we have some that carry rather a high rate of VAT. The supply and installation of this equipment can be charged at a 5 per cent rate and I hope the Minister will look at this favourably. I suspect the Minister will say that this is something he must talk to the Treasury about, and I appreciate that point; but if we are serious about this we need to be consistent across the board on how we apply VAT to energy efficiency measures, products and installation. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="1101314000012"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="1101314000096"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> I was a member of the Treasury team when VAT was first introduced in 1972. It was one of the principles of the then Government that it should be as simple a tax as possible. There were of course some major exclusions from VAT, for instance all food and children's clothes, but I well remember my noble friend Lord Higgins, who was dealing with the Finance Bill, saying that it was a simple uniform tax to be extended across the range of products and services, apart from those that were specifically excluded.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000013"></a>Since then Governments, no doubt of all persuasions, have found themselves led down a path of adding more complications to VAT. I have sympathy with what my noble friend has suggested, because these are clearly energy-saving and carbon-saving measures, which one would wish to encourage. However, to use VAT and the tax system to do that seems to me to go against the principle of keeping VAT as simple a tax as possible.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000014"></a>VAT is now substantially higher than it was when it was first introduced, for reasons that we can all understand, although that is not within the competence of the Committee. Wisely, my noble friend's amendment places this firmly in the hands of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, although it could not be with anybody else, as my right honourable friend the Chancellor is the Minister in charge of the tax system. However, I sound a note of caution on beginning to extend lower rates of VAT to other services and products, notwithstanding that one might have some sympathy with what is being sought. Having said that, I should be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in reply.</p>

We are all too well aware that the Treasury looks at these issues with a sharp eye and intensive scrutiny at any time, but in this age of austerity that position is likely to be intensified. As the noble Lord indicated, the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, is seeking to build on the 5 per cent reduced rate of VAT that already applies to a number of installations that relate to energy conservation, both to encourage householders to install energy-saving facilities and as a clear earnest of the Government's intent that these issues are significant enough for us to look at them in this regard, albeit not quite as we do food and children's clothes, which attract no VAT. Nevertheless, the 5 per cent rate relates to a clear priority area; it is an exclusive area. In her amendment, the noble Baroness wants to extend that area.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000016"></a>I am not in the slightest doubt about the merits of doing that and I think that, in the framework of the Bill, we should indicate that we think that this will give substance to the Bill's principles. However, like the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, I acknowledge-no doubt the Minister will also indicate this to the Committee-that it is difficult to write Budgets in the framework of energy legislation when that is the preserve of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Treasury. I would not be at all surprised if we had a somewhat guarded response to the amendment. However, we already have provision of the reduced rate in this area and the amendment would not add a great deal, although the Treasury might argue that the cost would be significant. Nevertheless, the amendment fits in with the pattern of reduced rates of VAT in this area and I hope that the Minister will indicate that, at the very least, the Government have an open mind on the issue.</p>

However, we have been advised that this proposal would not fall within the scope of the Energy Bill, since taxation can only be amended in a Finance Bill. Therefore, as my noble friend Lady Maddock anticipated, I can confirm that taxes are indeed a matter for the Treasury and that the Chancellor keeps all taxes under review and announces any changes as part of the Budget process. We understand the thrust of what she is arguing, but I hope that on the basis of what I have said, my noble friends will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We have touched on it from time to time at earlier stages, and I have said that some of the issues that arise in relation to the Green Deal also arise in relation to smart meters. The Government will need to consider the implications of the two programmes. I should probably make it clear at the outset that I am in favour of a roll-out of smart meters, but there are a significant number of consumer issues which arise in relation to the installation of such meters which, if wrongly handled, will lead to some resistance and backlash against them.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000020"></a>Smart meter installation is different from the Green Deal because the Green Deal is ultimately a voluntary scheme that the householder or landlord can take on board, and then he can decide whether it had been a good deal for his premises. With smart meters, the obligation is on the supply companies to install them. They are already beginning that installation, and some of them, particularly British Gas, already have a substantial programme under way. However, we should look at the implication for consumers. As colleagues will know, one of the problems in the energy market has been the ease with which people can switch and the potential cost of switching in terms of both the supply company and the method of payment.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000021"></a>If we have a wholesale introduction of smart meters-which make it more difficult, more costly or more of a hassle for the consumer to be able to say, "I'm fed up with the way this company is dealing with me; I want to switch to the next company", or "I'm fed up with paying by pre-payment meter; I want to go on to direct debit" or whatever the choice is-and if the meter itself, the system under which the meter operates or  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC264"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column GC264</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the terms on which it is supplied make that more difficult, then we have significant consumer detriment. We must remember that the energy market is not one that is characterised by deep trust of consumers in their suppliers. Nor is it the case that the regulator has substantial powers over the peripherals: it has substantial powers over the supplier, but there is no real protection in relation to energy products or services in the same way. Installation of smart meters could lock people in to their current system unless we provide that the meters are reasonably interchangeable, compatible and available in a way that allows people to switch both method of payment and supply.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000022"></a>We have to bear in mind that the introduction of smart meters is not so universally supported as it probably is in this Room. Research by Consumer Focus a couple of years ago, as well as evidence from <I>Which</I><I>?</I>, showed fairly deep resistance to it, and some misunderstanding. So there is some mistrust at the consumer end, to put it at it mildest. We also know that in other countries where similar programmes have been adopted there has been some resistance-for example in some states of America and, on broader human rights grounds, in the Netherlands. So it is a delicate area. If we are to achieve introduction with minimum consumer resistance and minimum delay and challenge, we need to be able to reassure the householder that the meter that they are installing will not stop them switching should they wish to change tariff, company or the method by which they pay.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000023"></a>So, Amendment 32C deals with the degree of compatibility. This is not just an issue of standards, because we have been talking about standards for smart meters for at least 10 years before we have introduced a single one, and we are still at a position where we do not have a common standard. It would obviously help if at this point we already had a standard, but the issue here is compatibility, which need not necessarily mean a single standard or specification. It is important that we can reassure consumers that installing a meter will not inhibit their choice.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000024"></a>Amendment 32B deals with a slightly more ticklish issue. When the supply company or their agent is required to go into households and install a smart meter, how will it deal with trying at the same time to sell other products that are related to the smart meter, or that could be made to be related to it? Protecting consumers during the installation process is essential if we are not to meet with some resistance. On the one hand, there is the possibility of mis-selling in these circumstances; on the other, some devices are coming on to the market that would make it much easier for consumers, on the basis of the smart meter, to know what was causing their energy consumption to increase and how they could control it. The basic smart meter primarily gives the supply company that information, although it also tells the consumer at any given time what their level of consumption is and the cost of it.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000025"></a>The amendment would allow information to be given to householders about other products that could help them to make sense of and use smart meters, but in a way which does not amount to hassle or to a situation where their mandatory presence inside the consumer's house can be misused to sell particular  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC265"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column GC265</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>products. The amendment effectively requires the marketing material to be in a written form so as to protect the householder from being misled or mis-sold a related product.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000026"></a>I have no doubt that the Minister and his officials will have comments to make on the exact wording, as will the supply companies; but unless we recognise this as a potential problem, we could find ourselves in some difficulty. In one sense we are ahead of the game in that some installation programmes are going on and we know that there will be no standard design or specification before 2014 at the earliest. We could therefore already be locking people in. We need to ensure that, as the programme rolls out, we minimise the degree to which that can happen in future.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000027"></a>I hope the Government can at least take on board these concerns and look at the best way of dealing with them in terms of the legislation and reassuring householders that smart meters will not inhibit their choice or lead to their being ripped off in some other way when the installation takes place. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="1101314000028"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="1101314000102"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> My Lords, like the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, with many of whose remarks I entirely agree, I, too, have been trying to keep in touch with what has been going on-indeed, ever since I was offered the chance of installing a smart meter by one of my suppliers, only to be told that I could not possibly have it because it was in a porch and, therefore, accessible to anyone passing the house. It seems to me that these are the kind of things that must be dealt with.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000029"></a>I think that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has not fully taken account of the extent of the discussions, which have been going on now for some time, between the Government, the industry, Ofgem and consumer groups. These discussions have been extremely positive and seem to me to have been exactly the right way forward. We now have the Government's prospectus-issued in July, I think-and a draft code put out by the Energy Retailers Association, which works with Energy UK, that sets out how a code might deal with precisely the points to which the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, drew our attention.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000030"></a>I am told that this has attracted comments from the consumer organisations, which are clearly interested in seeing how it will develop. In terms of securing a system that is both clear and at the same time offers flexibility-and flexibility is something that the industry has tried to build into the system; there must be some flexibility in how this will be done-a code which can be more easily amended in the light of experience may be better than trying to establish firm statutory rules, such as those in the amendments which the noble Lord has moved.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000031"></a>One of the points right at the heart of these discussions is that the right of changing your supplier has to be built into the system. I have had a letter from my noble friend's department only this morning in response to a representation that I made to him a couple of weeks ago. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1101314000082"></a>"Common specifications will also be the means for achieving 'inter-operability', which means that suppliers can use smart meters installed by other suppliers, allowing easy switching."</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000032"></a>It seems to me that that is the kind of standard which the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, was looking for, and I think it is now firmly taken on board by both the industry and the department. Indeed, I have been told that the question of maintaining the right to switch suppliers has been regarded as a sine qua non. It has to happen with the installation of smart meters, and nothing in the system should prevent it, given that it is the way in which competition can be made to produce benefits for the consumer. A voluntary code that balances flexibility to provide the customer with information, while at the same time guaranteeing their rights, would be a very desirable way forward. I do not know what my noble friend will say but, against that background, the amendments might be regarded as being overprescriptive.</p>
<h5><a name="1101314000086"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000033"></a>This will be a major exercise. There are 26 million or 27 million smart meters to be installed by 2020, as we were originally told. The target was then changed to 2015 or 2016. It will be a huge operation. Many consumers will find it quite a hassle. It is not unlike the problem-although it is not quite as serious-with insulation and other such matters that were raised in our discussion of the Green Deal. The consumer protection aspect of this is very important. I shall certainly look forward to hearing what my noble friend has to say on that. However, I am encouraged by what I understand is going on between the various parties-the industry, the bodies representing the installers, consumer groups and so on. This is the right way to approach it and, I hope, to get the right answer.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000034"></a>One thing in the noble Lord's amendment with which I wholly agree, and it is very much in the code, is that installers should not use their presence in a consumer's house to bully them into taking other products which may or may not be related to the ones that they are selling at the time. We have all been subjected to that. One has to be robust and say firmly, "No thank you". However, the installers should not do it. The noble Lord will find that that is firmly in place when the code comes out. The companies that we will be dealing with will have a firm policy on that, and, no doubt, disciplinary proceedings for those against whom complaints are made. While supporting entirely the motives behind the amendment, I would like to think that the discussions that have been taking place, which have been intensive and are ongoing, may produce a result that combines protection for the consumer with the flexibility that is necessary to ensure proper competition and room for development.</p>

We thank him for introducing the subject of smart meters so that we may discuss certain aspects of their operation. On his first amendment, on marketability, we understand that a balance must be struck between information provided to the consumer and possible salesmanship at the time of installation. He is quite right to draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that only 20 per cent of consumers view

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000036"></a>On the question of smart meters and interoperability, as we know, at present consumers cannot change supplier without changing meters. We understand that there could already be something approaching 2 million smart meters in the marketplace, although the exact number is not known. It would be very interesting if the Minister could provide us with any figures. At Second Reading, my noble friend Lady Smith raised the question of interoperability. The Minister has since written to us to say that he has had discussions and will do his utmost to make sure that, as far as possible, interoperability will be maintained. What exchanges has the Minister had with the energy companies in this regard? I draw to his attention that this is a vital area for consumer confidence, and ask whether there are indeed ongoing conversations with the industry.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000037"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, drew to our attention the fact that the Energy Retail Association has produced a draft code of conduct for consultation, building on suppliers' current work on a draft voluntary code of practice on vulnerable consumers and accurate billing. Our understanding is that, when the code of practice comes into place, this interoperability should be a standard requirement. Perhaps the Minister can comment on whether, by the time the regulations are drawn up, smart meters will be not only entirely interchangeable between credit and pre-pay systems but completely interoperable between energy companies.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000038"></a>That leads me to ask the Minister a few general questions that are afforded by this opportunity. Does he have in mind perhaps undertaking a review of consumer protection in this field? It is a huge area and could benefit from such a constructive operation. Furthermore, does he have in mind a strategy to deliver consumer benefits? These smart meters are not simply a new device that will allow the "market to provide", as he said. Perhaps we cannot simply install them and hope that they will work. There will have to be a strategy to ensure that the consumer benefits are realised and, indeed, a constant interactive review of the rollout strategy to ensure that all the opportunities are not missed. At the moment there does not seem to be any monitoring framework in mind. There are also no minimum standards to encourage not only general acceptance among consumers but some knowledge of what they are looking at when they see a smart meter. The whole consumer field could be greatly augmented by undertaking a constant interactive review. Lastly, has the Minister thought about an independent smart-metering delivery campaigns body to monitor these situations and perhaps to give him guidance on extra help to low-income and vulnerable consumers?</p>

It is important that we have a code that is as robust as possible, not least because this process will be carried out without a clearly identifiable body responsible for consumer protection. We have previously had gas and electricity consumers councils. After that, we had the combined one and Energywatch, which was folded into Consumer Focus, which, of course,

Many people have grave doubts about whether the citizens advice bureaux as presently constituted have the resources. They certainly have sufficient locations, but the question remains whether within these locations they will have people with the expertise to take on the protection of consumers when matters such as smart metering arise.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000040"></a>As has been pointed out, there is a great lack of public confidence in the energy suppliers in this country. That is quite a sizeable achievement, because for many years we were able to point to British Gas, the Post Office and one or two other companies as being the kind of companies that people could depend on and trust. Now, in large measure, either through commercial incompetence or greed-in the case of the Post Office it is not really greed, but I certainly would not acquit the others of a charge of greed-the public lack confidence in these companies.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000041"></a>The rolling-out of meters will go on for some time. We will have something like 18.5 million households with gas and another 24 million with gas and electricity, and then there are small businesses, shops and the like. So we could be talking about somewhere in the region of 45 million-plus meters being installed over a relatively short period.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000042"></a>One of the hallmarks of this process at present is that it is shrouded in secrecy. The lack of transparency about the discussions taking place between the Government and the companies is, in many respects, quite astounding. There is not that much that we need to concern ourselves with in terms of commercial secrecy, but we need to know a great deal more. If we are not going to have what many of us would regard as appropriate bodies for consumer protection, if we are likely to have a lengthy period in which this rollout will take place and if we have a conspicuous absence of transparency in the planning and the bringing down, even intermittently, of tablets from the mountain, it is important that we have as robust a code as possible.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000043"></a>While we may get the usual claptrap from the Minister about the words in the amendment not being the exact words, we want reassurance. The public deserve reassurance. We as consumers will be paying for the installation of these meters even though they will be owned by some electricity or gas supplier. It must be made clear that we will have these meters for a long time. I remember that one of the past arguments against smart metering, at a time when there was not quite the environmental edge to the debate that there is now, was that these meters were robust enough to last for 40 years. It was the "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" kind of argument. We are going to be saddled with these damn things for a long time, so we should ensure that they are the right ones, that they are sufficiently flexible, that we begin to get clear indications of the intentions of the companies and that there is to be a sufficiently strong and robust process of consumer protection throughout that period.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000044"></a>To each of those requests, I would expect some kind of lukewarm response from the Minister, such as, "We'll do our best. We're all trying very hard, chaps". Until such time as we can get something more robust than that, the least that we can hope for is a decent code of practice. My noble friend Lord Whitty has

The words may not be exactly what are required but, if the message can be got through and if at Report we can get something to reassure and protect consumers, we will not have made too bad a fist of this part of the Bill.</p>

I am sure that he did not mean that.</p>

I am disappointed to hear that from a man who was on the government Benches for 13 years. We all know that smart meters started before we got into government and that consumer protection was not high on the noble Lord's list then. Maybe he was internally debating with his own party; I hope so.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000051"></a>I am also extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and the opposition Front Bench, who telegraphed to us their message on these important issues before this event. It is a fundamental subject for us to address. At its heart, as the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, would say, is unwelcome sales activity on the one hand and interoperability between companies on the other. Those are the two salient points of his amendments.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000052"></a>I begin with a couple of factual issues to set the scene. We estimate that there will be 46 million smart meters. The noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, was right on that, which is excellent. We know that British Gas has rolled out around 250,000 so far; it told me so this  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC270"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column GC270</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>morning. We also know that the average cost to British Gas is around £300 over a lifespan of 20 years. I hope that that deals with the comments of the right reverend Prelate.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000053"></a>On the thrust of this argument, it is absolutely fundamental that customers are protected from unwarranted and unwelcome sales activity. However, we must not ignore the fact that at times sales activity may be welcome, which we must bear in mind in legislating on this matter. Thanks to the previous Government, we already have powers available to us for consumer protection in the Energy Act 2008, which stands at the moment. It is fundamental that Ofgem is carrying out what I could not believe was called a "spring package" and will issue recommendations on how interoperability and the various issues that are absolutely fundamental to smart meters will be rolled out this summer. As I said, the Energy Act gives us powers to act on this. I do not believe that, as the noble Lord, Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan, suggests, companies go into smoke-filled rooms for clandestine meetings with Ministers to discuss these things. These matters have been discussed and aired openly because it is to companies' advantage to work with the customer. After all, it is the customer who will be taking these on board.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000054"></a>As I said earlier, I am so concerned about these two issues that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has raised that I had a meeting with the chief executive of Centrica this morning. We went through it line by line. I must say that I was impressed by the way in which that company is determined to roll this out. I am also impressed that it is co-operating in a very difficult technical area with Scottish Power and E.ON and has relationships with RWE and EDF. Understandably, they are looking at how the technology develops, particularly in the use of telephones. British Gas is currently working with Vodafone and we hear now that British Telecom has come in with a product. It is a complicated product that is evolving. As Ministers, we will monitor and make sure that this has the consumer confidence that all of us in this Committee want to see. With that in mind, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="1101314000055"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="1101314000111"></a>Lord Oxburgh:</b> On cost, does the Minister agree that the purpose of rolling out smart meters is to save money and to make our electricity generating system more robust and less expensive? It is unlikely to offer the prospect of reduced prices, but it could offer electricity prices that rise a little less rapidly than they would have done otherwise. It should be a double win. The companies will avoid the inconvenience and cost of having people come round to read meters. They will also get a much better understanding of the power requirements of different parts of the community at different times, which will allow them to manage the electricity system better. From the consumer's point of view, they avoid the inconvenience of inaccurate and late bills, with which we are all familiar. They also get the opportunity, if they so wish, to manage their consumption in a way that will lower their costs. This should be a win-win proposition. The Government and the companies-if they believe this, as I hope they do-have a responsibility to spread the word abroad.</p>

On the basis of the figures that have just been given, the cost will be about £14 billion over 20 years. What hard estimates have been made of the savings when set against £14 billion, which is not an insignificant amount for consumers to have to bear?</p>

Perhaps I could press him again on that, because I understand that some consumer protection provisions are contained in the Energy Act 2008. Does he think that they are sufficient, or will they be repealed? As we all appreciate, energy companies are working on behalf of their shareholders rather than consumers. What discussions has the Minister had with consumer groups in addition to those with energy companies?</p>

<p><a name="1101314000058"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="1101314000114"></a>Lord Marland:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, for his commentary on this issue, which partly answered the question of the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester. It is mutually beneficial to both parties that smart meters are introduced. As I mentioned, Ofgem has consulted all groups closely to find a way forward. It is for it to report and to determine whether there should be a tightening of existing powers under the Energy Act following its spring package.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000059"></a>The total financial benefits of introduction are as yet unknown. There are a number of ways in which one could look at them. An executive of British Gas told me this morning that, when she was young, her father used to sit her down in front of the electricity meter to see it going round and round and to show the cost that was being incurred in the household. As  I have said, I have sat my own children down and said, "Look, this is what's going on"-I have one of those little boxes, which I commend to your Lordships. They are horrified that, at one point, it shows 298 an hour and then, at another, 130 an hour. There will obviously be a lifestyle change, which we cannot begin to assess, as people seek to reduce the cost of their electricity. I discussed with Centrica this morning the likely impact on bills. We estimate that there will be a saving  of £14 to £15 on an electricity bill net of the cost of installation.</p>

<p><a name="1101314000060"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="1101314000115"></a>Lord Whitty:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part in this debate. The Minister said that provisions exist in the 2008 Act and it is clear, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, that some progress on a voluntary code of practice has been made. However, this section of the Bill is intended to move that forward in a way that meets anxieties that interoperability and householders' freedom of choice are protected.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000061"></a>I should probably have declared a past interest: until last month, I was the chair of Consumer Focus. There has been some engagement, but not all our points have been met, in particular the issue that, from the word go of the rollout, consumers should not be subject to cost when they switch. The Minister has already consulted with British Gas and Centrica. There  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC272"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column GC272</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are about 250,000 smart meters out there. The estimate is that, by 2014, there will be 4 million, most of which will be British Gas. This is before the standards on interoperability have risen. My understanding is that, at the moment, if British Gas customers who have one of these smart meters want to switch, they will effectively be in dumb mode if they switch to another supplier whose meters are not compatible. Likewise, if they are on pre-payment but wish to switch, the smart-meter systems for pre-payment and for direct debit, for example, are not compatible.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000062"></a>In many ways, I am pleased that British Gas has taken the initiative in starting to roll these things out for all the reasons that people have given-we want them out there as soon as possible. However, the fact of the matter is that we are going to have a whole number of them that are not compatible and, unless we lay down principles in this Bill, that will continue. Those principles need to apply to the ongoing rollout and they need to apply to the standardisation that is introduced beyond 2014.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="1101314000063"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, that the manner of meeting those requirements can be flexible. I am in favour of a strong voluntary code of practice covering this area, but the principles that lie behind my amendments should surely be in primary legislation. I accept that these amendments are probably too complicated and that ongoing discussions and outcomes need to be taken into account when we reach the final draft, but I would be concerned if we were to pass the Bill without the principles of, in particular, no detriment in terms of choice and no mis-selling being written into the primary legislation.</p>

Therefore, it will not be possible for us to deal with the outcome of these discussions in relation to this legislation. It will require a subsequent electricity/gas Act to accommodate it, unless we are going to have some kind of magic SI brought in at a later stage to take account of the discussions. Has my noble friend thought of this point?</p>

As I understand what the Minister was referring to, he was speaking about the discussions involving the regulations that Ofgem is going to bring forward as part of its spring package, which-confusingly, as he says-will emerge in the summer. That is not necessarily the end of the line. I hope that, by the time the discussions are finalised in, shall we say, the late spring, the outline of this part of the Bill will be clear to Ofgem and those with whom Ofgem is consulting. If it is not, the situation to which my noble friend Lord O'Neill refers arises.</p>

It may be that the Government can interpret that sufficiently widely to intervene, but I am not necessarily convinced of that. This is effectively the last piece of legislation before the main part of the rollout is going to occur and, unless we have those principles embedded in primary legislation, the Minister's leverage with Ofgem and the supply companies will be more limited as we go down the line.</p>

<p><a name="1101314000070"></a>I shall return to this amendment in perhaps simplified form at a later stage in this process. Some of us who sit through energy Bills are pretty convinced of moving in this direction. As the noble Lords, Lord Teverson and Lord Oxburgh, said, the aim is to reduce the cost of electricity, both in terms of supplying it and in terms of the cost to the consumer. That will work only if the consumer is in a position to interpret the information that a smart meter gives effectively and proactively and if the smart meter installed at the beginning of the process is still relevant to a changed supply tariff or method of payment for the householder at any given point. The principles need to be laid down here. This is not a matter that we should avoid as we go on through the passage of the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This amendment caused me to look at mine more carefully. There are four pages of information, which normally I fail to look at-and most of the time when I need to look at it I find it too complex and I understand it less after I have read it than I did before I read it. On tariffs, the first tranche of units used by a normal consumer is at a significantly higher level of charge than the ensuing tranche. Some consumers may have even more divisions, but I have two and, as it is for most people, the first units used are far more expensive. On 23 December 2010, my first units were 20.1p each and the next units after I had finished those were a quarter less at 14.55p. I do not know whether that completely replicates what other people have, but it seems fairly representative.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000002"></a>We have two issues affected by tariffs generally. When I learnt economics as a corporate economist,  we learnt that on the whole when prices were high  you demanded less and that when they were less you demanded more. That was a demand curve, in which  I am sure all noble Lords are well versed.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000003"></a>We are really trying to do two things in the Bill. One is to reduce the amount of electricity and energy used in the nation, thereby reducing carbon emissions. The other is to reduce fuel poverty by investment in making houses, dwellings and business premises more energy efficient. Yet these types of tariff-higher at the beginning and less at the end-mean that the market signals that we are trying to do exactly the opposite. That is why I have tabled my amendment in this way. I will be interested to know whether the Minister criticises the way in which it is written, as the noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, seems to think he might.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000004"></a>I would like to probe this area particularly. There should be a better way of doing this, which is what my amendment attempts. First, it says that things should be the other way round, so that there is an incentive to keep energy consumption relatively low and that those normal consumers who suffer fuel poverty are charged less. Having tried to table a suitable amendment, I absolutely agree that it is difficult to encapsulate exactly how that should happen, which is why it suggests a general scheme of what we are trying to achieve. At the end of the day, the arbiter would probably have to be Ofgem. We want the electricity units used by an average household for essentials to be at the lower rate, with a higher rate after that. Overall, the outcome should be revenue neutral. I say, maybe from my work as an economist, that the existing dual-pricing function is probably an indication of a monopolistic marketplace. You certainly do not have perfect pricing here. At another time, maybe we will want to address that.</p>

<p><a name="11013118000005"></a>Unfortunately, the amendment does not state that pre-payment meters should not charge significantly more than ordinary electricity tariffs, thus heavily and severely working against the poor and the fuel poor. We might consider that another time; perhaps it goes back to the smart meter issue. However, that is not what the amendment is about. It is about trying to bring a much more just tariff into the industry. The only way in which that can happen is through legislation. I beg to move.</p>

When I looked at my own electricity bill, I noticed that I was being charged nearly 30p for the first 900 units, after which the price dropped to about 13p; I obviously must have a word with the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, to see where he gets his from. I argued that that way of charging seemed cack-handed. As my noble friend said, it seems to defy the laws of supply and demand and their relation to price. The greater the demand, the greater should be the price. When I asked other customers and neighbours, they confirmed that they, too, were charged nearly double for the initial units that they consumed.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000007"></a>I further argued that the first few thousand units should be relatively cheap-near the break-even point of the supplier-and that the more you consume, the more expensive the units should become. Therefore, the more you use, the more you pay per unit. I am afraid that I have no idea what the break-even point for energy suppliers is but, if they are able to charge some customers below 10p a unit for daytime use, it must be somewhere below that-around 6p or 7p per unit. I presume that Ofgem would know exactly what the break-even points are for each supplier and, if not, it could find out. It begs the question whether energy companies should be required to disclose the break-even points and the changes throughout the year, which could then be verified either by auditors or by Ofgem.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000008"></a>I like the wording in the new clause proposed by my noble friend Lord Teverson. Subsection (2)(a) says that,</p>
<ul><a name="11013118000073"></a>"the number of lower priced initial units shall represent the average amount of energy required for a household of that size to keep warm, clean and fed to a modest but acceptable standard".</ul>
<p><a name="11013118000009"></a>I suggested at Second Reading that it would not be too difficult for energy companies to obtain the council tax banding of each property, so that they could differentiate between, say, band A and band D properties. Obviously, a single person living in a bedsit would not require the same amount of energy as a couple with 2.4 children living in a three-bedroom or four-bedroom house. As things stand at the moment, there is little or no difference in the tariffs for living in a bedsit or a six-bedroom house. That is wrong. The person in the bedsit is paying a much higher proportion of their energy bill at the higher initial rate that is currently charged. Perhaps the electoral roll could help in determining how many adults live in each property.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000010"></a>If we are going to try to do something about fuel poverty, I believe that the way in which we charge customers must be changed, which is the whole thrust of my argument. In 2008, there were 4.5 million  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC276"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column GC276</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>households in fuel poverty. I believe that, after the recent cold snap of November and December, this figure jumped dramatically, perhaps to 6.5 million households, 50 per cent of whom are pensioners. Those in badly heated homes are more prone to illness, which just pushes the problem and the cost on to the NHS. It was not surprising to read in the papers recently that energy companies have been cashing in on the cold snap and increasing their profit margins by 50 per cent. I am glad that Ofgem is investigating; it will report its findings on excessive profit margins in March. Consumers feel hard done by. Some whom I have asked feel that they are being ripped off.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000011"></a>Can Ofgem make energy companies change their tariff structure? I realise that energy companies are profit-making public companies, some of which are foreign owned. Can, as the amendment provides, the Government introduce regulations to force companies to change their tariff system so that the initial units supplied are at a lower cost to the consumer than the remaining units? Subsection (2)(c) of the amendment provides that,</p>
<ul><a name="11013118000074"></a>"overall, the new combined tariff should be revenue neutral to the energy supply companies".</ul>
<p><a name="11013118000012"></a>I hope that the energy companies are willing to discuss this.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000013"></a>The thrust of my argument is to get as many of the 6.5 million households currently in fuel poverty-that is 26 per cent of total households-out of fuel poverty. I believe that progressive charging may be one way of achieving this. It would act as a real incentive for all households to reduce their consumption and to take up the Green Deal.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000014"></a>I received a useful letter this week from my noble friend Lord Marland, saying that the Committee on Climate Change looked into introducing rising block tariffs two years ago, before the recent hike in energy prices. It said that rising block tariffs would have an adverse impact on fuel-poor households, as they generally require more energy to heat their homes to an acceptable level. This is because the fuel poor tend to live in less energy efficient homes. Many of them, including pensioners, tend to spend more time in their homes. This suggests that a rising block tariff would make it more expensive for them to heat their homes to an adequate standard and make it more difficult to remove them from fuel poverty. The Committee on Climate Change concluded that rising block tariffs,</p>
<ul><a name="11013118000075"></a>"should not be introduced until fuel poverty has been addressed through targeted energy efficiency improvement and other fuel poverty measures".</ul>
<p><a name="11013118000062"></a>Quite so; I cannot argue with that. But is this not exactly where the Green Deal comes in? If the tariff system was changed and these households took up the Green Deal, they should be much better off.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000015"></a>There is a curious statement in the Minister's letter. It said that,</p>
<ul><a name="11013118000076"></a>"at present suppliers can, with a degree of certainty, recover their fixed costs from the higher tier charges".</ul>
<p><a name="11013118000063"></a>I bet that all companies wish that they could get away with that. In the real world, if a company charged double for the initial units sold in order to cover its  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC277"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column GC277</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fixed costs, it would not make any sales, as it would be undercut by competitors. Surprise, surprise, the energy companies are able to fix their pricing so that they can recover their fixed costs by charging a higher initial tariff. That does not seem right.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000016"></a>What are my expectations for this amendment? I do not know about my noble friend Lord Teverson, but I am not expecting the Minister to accept it. It would be a first in this Committee. I am not even expecting the Minister to come back with a government amendment-although that would be nice-as it might be putting the cart before the horse. If the Committee recalls, the Committee on Climate Change concluded that rising block tariffs,</p>
<ul><a name="11013118000077"></a>"should not be introduced until fuel poverty has been addressed through targeted energy efficiency improvement".</ul>
<p><a name="11013118000064"></a>I agree. The Green Deal should be allowed to get under way before rising block tariffs are brought in. I would like an assurance from the Minister that this will be looked at again, although not by the Committee on Climate Change, because it is probably not the most appropriate body to do so-but good for it for looking at this. Its report was not even 250 words long, so it is difficult to assess how it approached the subject. It did consider, however, whether a subsidised price should be charged for consumption to cover basic needs. It occurred to me that the £2.7 billion spent annually on winter fuel payments should be better targeted to those most in need and perhaps paid directly to their energy supplier.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000017"></a>The number of households in fuel poverty has already exploded and is likely to increase further as, if the papers are to be believed, electricity bills will have to rise by a further £500 per annum per household to pay for a new generation of environmentally friendly power stations. It seems quite extraordinary that, in our civilised society, over one-quarter of households live in fuel poverty, 50 per cent being pensioners, in many cases having to make the choice between fuel, food and perhaps their health. I think that changing the tariff structure is worth investigating, after consultation with energy suppliers and perhaps Ofgem, as it dovetails neatly with the ambitions of this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="11013118000018"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew32"></a><a name="11013118000087"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> I find this a confusing debate. First, we have an elegant contribution from the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, explaining how there is a failure in the structure of the market and the present pricing arrangements. We then get an endorsement of this from the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, who, with the greatest respect, is riding one of his hobby-horses. We are all entitled to do that, but half way through the business he changes horses and is not very sure whether he is going one way or the other.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000019"></a>One of the factors in making the Green Deal successful for consumers will be rising gas and electricity prices, because the Green Deal will make the savings that much greater. It will make the savings that much greater that much earlier if the initial block of electricity or gas units consumed is as high as possible; it is then the second tranche from which you may make some savings. That appears to be a recognition of the fact that we anticipate that, certainly for the rest of this  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC278"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column GC278</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>decade, energy prices will continue to rise for a variety or reasons-changes in generation, shortage of supply or volatility of supply because of Middle Eastern uncertainties. All these things will, in varying degrees, result in a steady increase. That is one of the attractions-perhaps not the most compelling one-of the Green Deal. The amendment would in many respects undermine the attractive features of the Green Deal.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000020"></a>Equally, the climate change committee has argued that the majority of fuel-poor households have structural deficiencies which require more electricity to be used in keeping the rooms warm. Therefore, the priority must be to get people's homes improved. The apparent attraction of making the price of the initial tranche lower is complicated by the fact that these people are always going to be the ones who will go into the second tranche to keep their houses warm. There are elements of contradiction in both arguments.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000021"></a>We have mentioned the role of Ofgem as a potential arbiter-a body that could hold the ring. Although Ofgem's function is in part to protect the consumer, it is also to promote competition. The argument advanced by the proponents of privatisation and subsequent liberalisation was that, after liberalisation, you would have a competitive market in which the players would change the manner in which the old state monopoly had dealt with pricing issues. In fact, as we have seen, while it was apparently in the interests of the state monopoly to behave in a particular way, it is in the interests of these private oligopolies to behave in much the same way, in that they have not radically changed the nature of pricing.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000022"></a>Some of us have sought to introduce arguments about the injustice of the pre-payment meter to many households, although not all, as pre-payment meters suit consumers in a number of households, perhaps because people are there only part-time-the house may be a second home in a rural area, for example. The point that I am getting at is that it was only through the threat of intervention on the part of the last Government that we began to move on this issue. I think that only one company-Scottish and Southern-was prepared to change its pricing structure in relation to pre-payment meters. There may have been others, but that is the one that I remember from the big five or six in this area.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000023"></a>I do not think that Ofgem has the power to do this at the moment and I am not sure that it would want to do it. The argument advanced by the climate change committee is somewhat tentative, but it has some weight. If we are going to try to deal with the question of consumption and price, the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, provided an elegant solution. I respect him for that, but I am not sure whether it is the ideal solution. We have had a reasonable excuse to have a good debate, but I am not sure whether at this stage this is really the best way in which to deal with the problem. It would be preferable if we gave the regulator powers that it ceased to have some time ago to go in and explore this, if not independently to change it. I know that its powers are being reviewed; it certainly does not have the powers to interfere at this stage, as I understand it. But if it was to be given those powers following the government review, that might be a way in which to deal with the matter.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000024"></a>I am not certain that this amendment will achieve what it is trying to do in respect of the poorer households that spend a fair amount of money heating their homes. It is unlikely that we could get a tariff structure to enable all the heating of the poorest people's homes in the country to be done on the lowest tariff. If we could get that, we would go some way towards alleviating the problems faced by the disadvantaged. Equally, we might well put ourselves in the position of having disproportionately higher prices for the second tranche, which might reach a level that brings additional people into fuel poverty. So we seem to be damned if we do and damned if we do not.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000025"></a>I am a bit confused and I am sure that other noble Lords are as well. It may be that listening to me has made matters worse. If we are to deal with this issue, we really need to deal with it on the basis of far stronger and more comprehensive evidence than we have at the moment. The present system does not work, but I am not sure whether something as flip  as this amendment will necessarily come up with the answers that quickly.</p>

In reply to my noble friend, could the Minister tell us where we are in getting the utility companies to simplify their bills and make them clearer? If the Green Deal is going to work and people are going to understand where their energy savings are, the bills need to be better. In the past, you might try to work out the payback on new technology. We had a condensing boiler and it was really complicated to look back over a year-we had changed suppliers at the time-to work out what we were saving. I think that in the end I did work it out and we had saved at least a quarter of the gas in a year with the condensing boiler, but it was no mean feat. Given that the Green Deal depends on people understanding such things and that we know that we will not all have smart meters in the near future, it would be helpful if the Minister could tell us a little about that.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000027"></a>I support my noble friend Lord Cathcart on what we need to do to help those in fuel poverty, but I cannot agree with him on trying to do it on council tax bands. The banding of your house does not relate to your ability to pay the council tax or any other bill. That is why I have been so against it for so many years. However, I support him in his aim to do something about fuel poverty. I have probably declared my interest before but, like the noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, I am involved with National Energy Action, which is a charity trying to do something about the fuel poor. We have been doing it for over 25 years now.</p>

The smart meter arrangements, which we have just been describing, will remove nearly all the justification for that concept. It would be useful

If any step is needed, it really should be a very small one. Smart meters should certainly make the handling of pre-payment meters identical to conventional ones; there need be no difference in charge. I presume that pre-payment meters will be managed the same way as top-up phone cards, so the whole thing should be straightforward.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000029"></a>Inverted tariffs can work. They have been used for water in Sydney, Australia-you get your first so-many cubic metres of water at a particular price and, as your water use goes up, so does your price. That is not quite the same, because a lot of subsequent use of water would be for watering large lawns and things of that kind, which is not quite what we are talking of here. Also, in my Shell days, we used something like this in Nigeria, where the company gave away a certain amount of electricity-enough to run a refrigerator, a number of light bulbs and a television-and charged consumers only when they went above a particular level. Those things have worked and have been used to alleviate poverty. Whether this is quite the way to do it, I am not sure; I am with the noble Lord, Lord O'Neill. However, there is an important idea here.</p>

It is an object of public policy to reduce fuel poverty, and it is an object of public policy to reduce consumption of energy, yet we have a structure of hugely complicated tariffs for households-2,500 tariffs, or whatever it is-the net result of which is that the poor pay more, and that the more you use the less you pay. That is an absurdity arising from a combination of an oligopolistic market, a history of the standing charge, and a sort-of ideology behind the Ofgem intervention about cost reflectivity. If you were really trying to achieve the outcomes that successive Governments have declared, you would restructure and regulate the market in the direction proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000031"></a>Obviously, there are complications. There will be winners and losers. I disagree with the climate change committee and, to some extent, with my noble friend Lord O'Neill-the bulk of the fuel poor are fuel poor because of the price that they pay for electricity, not because they have to use more of it, even though it is true that a programme of improving the energy efficiency of buildings would ideally predate any change in the tariff structure. A sub-group of the fuel poor have to spend to use an enormous amount of energy to meet minimum comfort levels, but the majority are hit because of the prices that they have to pay within the properties that they occupy.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000032"></a>There would have to be some sophistication of the proposition made by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson. The crude definition is a rising block tariff, but it is not necessarily the only way in which to act. The Government would be well advised to ask Ofgem, the energy companies and everybody else in the field to look at the whole concept. Until we effectively reverse the structure of

The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, has a big idea here. I suspect that the noble Earl is correct that the Minister will not leap overboard and grab this amendment, but we need to think radically here and ensure a proper analysis of how the restructuring could be done effectively with minimum collateral damage.</p>

I doubt whether the Government will accept it, not least because although this has been an interesting and informed debate, the cross-currents have been very sharp and very obvious. In seeking the objectives that we all seek, the question of strategy is difficult. I doubt whether this Bill can stand the strain of carrying an amendment which indicates that the whole of the tariff position should be restructured as far as the electricity companies are concerned, particularly given that we are short of information.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000034"></a>First of all, the companies are short of information about which households ought to have preferential treatment. I very much enjoyed the thoughtful and considered speech of the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart. He took us with him in terms of the objectives, but council tax will not do as a measure of the relative strength or weakness of household economies. We are in the historic position-as the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, identified-that this initial tariff is the old standing charge written into a new pricing framework. Now there are elements of a standing charge which companies have to meet.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000035"></a>However, our consideration with this Bill is, how do we make the Green Deal effective? I listened very carefully to my noble friend Lord O'Neill, who indicated the difficulties of both ends of the spectrum in this argument. In terms of making the Green Deal effective, it would complicate matters enormously if we were also saying that in a short period of time, we would be changing the nature of the pricing policy. There is enough of a problem with pricing anyway. We all know that we have a terrifying situation at the moment with world energy prices and the issues faced by consumers. None of us knows what lies ahead, but it is unlikely that energy will become significantly cheaper in the foreseeable future. Therefore households treat energy bills with great seriousness.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000036"></a>Can this be solved along the lines of this amendment? In due course, I think it would probably need to be. We have to get away from the issue of why the pricing policy is as it is. The Bill has to deliver the drive towards the Green Deal. The priority has to be to emphasise to households that they must pursue strategies to reduce the consumption of electricity. It is consumption that we have got to reduce or, more accurately in many cases, we have got to reduce waste, given that our houses are so ill-equipped for the circumstances.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para66"></a>

This has been a very useful debate, but I fear that if the concept in that amendment was put into  the Bill, we would complicate matters enormously in  terms of the impact on households. We would therefore fail with the main strategy to which we are all committed under the Bill. I hope the Minister will take a similar view.</p>

I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Davies; I am not expecting to have an amendment to get rising block tariffs into the Bill. I am asking the Minister to assure us that this will be looked at, so that the Green Deal can take effect first, and then the whole issue will be considered after the Bill is done and dusted.</p>

The noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, drew this matter to my attention several months ago, as did the noble Lord, Lord Teverson. I am extremely sympathetic to it, but this debate has thrown up the different and slightly schizophrenic aspect of this tariff system. On the one hand we have the inequality of it, and on the other we have to take into consideration things like the fuel poor, inefficient houses, time tariffs, colder parts of the UK and so on.</p>

<p><a name="11013118000040"></a>There are two fundamental things that I can suggest to the Committee. The first, as I said earlier, is that we are going to carry out a full-scale review of fuel poverty and its implications. We will be announcing that review in the very near future, and it will look into the various aspects that noble Lords have brought up here. Secondly, I recognise that this is a complicated issue, not a simple matter which the Committee can debate now and then present a conclusion on. I can therefore suggest-and we have already started work on it-that officials within the department should look very closely at this in order to determine its operability without reference to the climate change committee, and between Committee and Report stage we will have the opportunity to explore it further with noble Lords who may wish, with officials, to see whether there is merit in this amendment. That is a genuine offer. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Davies, that this is not a matter for this Bill as it is a complicated issue that needs considerable thought. Therefore, despite the merits of the amendment, I ask the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, to withdraw it.</p>

<p><a name="11013118000042"></a>Again, the quantum of fuel poverty concerns not so much the amount of energy used but the cost of that energy. That is what we have seen in the huge increase in the number of fuel poor, which has risen primarily in response to the very substantial increases in energy prices. This debate has exposed the problem that the current tariff structures are just not right They are not right in terms of a competitive market, in terms of serving consumers, or in terms of justice within our society. For that reason, I welcome the Minister's remarks that this area is to be looked at further and that, although this might not be exactly the right solution, it is something that will be pursued. I look forward to hearing the outcome of that.</p>

<p><a name="11013118000043"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, that I do not see the conflict between this and the Green Deal, which is not about reducing emissions or energy consumption in a household to zero but about making energy efficiency within our stock of dwellings much better-as I know that he knows, and which I know he supports. So I do not see them in conflict at all.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000047"></a>Clause 70 concerns access to the register of energy performance certificates, and the Government have suggested through subsection (1) that access to these documents or data on the register should be determined through regulations. Subsection (2) contains a list of such issues that may be included in the regulations. As we raised in our amendment earlier, it would be helpful if the Government could clarify whether the regulations and list of areas in subsection (2) are intended to be discretionary and what other areas the Government have in mind. Can the Minister confirm whether the legislative approach adds more or less certainty to the process?</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000048"></a>In Amendment 33ZA, we aim to clarify what should be included in the regulations relating to the disclosure of energy performance certificates. We consider that in this area it would be helpful to make linkages with other aspects in the Bill such as the Green Deal. The information contained on an energy performance certificate provides a helpful baseline for understanding the energy efficiency of a property and helps Green Deal improvers and bill payers to track how efficient a particular improvement has been. The regulations made under the clause should include provision to disclose such information to enable Green Deal participants, improvers and bill payers to make informed decisions about what Green Deal and energy efficiency measures may be appropriate for their property. This amendment is based on a belief that consumers and their advisers should have the best information to decide what measures may be appropriate for a property. Baseline information through these energy performance certificates is vital for the decision-making process. If the Government agree with the sentiment and are as concerned as we are that the Green Deal scheme should work, we would hope to see them come forward with an amendment of that nature at Report.</p>

<p><a name="11013118000049"></a>Our second amendment, Amendment 33CA, is a stand-alone requirement for a landlord or property owner to pass on energy performance information to new tenants or property buyers so that those persons can appreciate the current energy efficiency performance of the property and take steps towards improving it. These improvements may or may not be funded through Green Deal finance.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000050"></a>The drafting of the amendment is based largely on Clauses 12 and 13, which outline requirements for property owners and landlords when selling a property or letting it out. We have also sought to clarify further the meaning of "valid" for the purposes of disclosure. The certificate being presented must be current, by which we mean that it should relate to a period that is no more than one year from the date of issue and that,</p>
<ul><a name="11013118000078"></a>"the person required to provide the certificate has no reasonable grounds to suspect that the energy performance information on the certificate is no longer accurate"-</ul>
<p><a name="11013118000065"></a>for example, where a landlord may have made structural alterations to the property.</p>

Having heard what the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, said in introducing his amendments, I think that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if I dealt with the rather different issues raised by our amendments by degrouping them. I shall therefore not speak to them now.</p>

Far from feeling that I have drawn the short straw as the Whip, the opposite is the case. Not only is my noble friend Lord Marland taking the particularly complicated areas but-far more importantly-this is such an easy Bill. It is a Bill on which we are agreed across the Committee, so it is a great delight. Our purpose here is to refine how best to achieve the Bill's objectives. That may not have been the noble Lord's experience in the past, but if he watches me through these proceedings, he will notice how happy I am.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000054"></a>Amendment 33ZA provides that sufficient information must be disclosed to enable those involved in the Green Deal to decide what measures are appropriate for a property. However, Clause 70 is not intended to make data available for this purpose. If someone was considering how to improve a building's energy efficiency, they would commission an EPC, which would include recommended measures to improve the energy efficiency of the building and form the basis of advice by a qualified Green Deal adviser on the most appropriate measures for the property.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000055"></a>The Green Deal adviser would calculate exactly how much money would need to be borrowed and the number and amount of repayments et cetera. This is all part of the discussion that a householder will need to have with the Green Deal adviser as part of the potential transaction. We do not consider it necessary or appropriate to stipulate this level of detail in legislation.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000056"></a>Amendment 33CA provides that where a property is to be sold or rented out, the seller, prospective landlord or their agent must provide an EPC free of charge to a prospective buyer or tenant, the EPC should be no more than a year old and the person providing it must not believe that it is inaccurate. It has been a statutory requirement under existing regulations since October 2008 that an EPC is made available free of charge to a prospective buyer or tenant when a property is put on the market by the seller or prospective landlord. In the case of domestic sales, there is a duty on the agent to be satisfied that an EPC has been commissioned before marketing a property. A similar duty will be extended to agents in respect of domestic rentals and non-domestic transactions later this year.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="11013118000057"></a>As for the accuracy of EPCs, which is what the noble Lord is flagging up, I assure noble Lords that, under existing regulations, a duty of care is placed on

The only change that this amendment would introduce would be to provide that EPCs must be less than a year old. At present, an EPC can be up to 10 years old. In deciding on an appropriate validity period, we need to strike a balance between ensuring that an EPC contains up-to-date information and not requiring sellers or prospective landlords to incur unnecessary costs. In future, where improvement works are funded through the Green Deal, there will be an obligation to produce an updated EPC to capture the impact of the work on the energy efficiency of the property. While there will not be such an obligation where Green Deal finance was not used, it would be sensible for them to obtain an updated EPC that reflected the impact of any other work, because it will benefit them when seeking to sell or rent out the property. However, it is unnecessary to introduce a statutory obligation in such circumstances. I hope that noble Lords have found my explanation reassuring and will withdraw their amendment.</p>

It deals with the requirement in Clause 72(2) that a supplier must provide its domestic customers with information regarding one or more of its lowest domestic tariffs. In other words, it is an obligation on the supplier to ensure that the consumer knows what the lowest tariff is so that they can move to that tariff. This was so central to the coalition's programme that it was referred to in the programme itself, which said:</p>




<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC288"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column GC288</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="11013135000024"></a>"We will increase households' control over their energy costs by ensuring that energy bills provide information on how to move to the cheapest tariff offered by their supplier".</p>

<p><a name="11013135000021"></a>I therefore welcome the clause and its fulfilment of that commitment.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="11013135000005"></a>Of course, it is also true that there is a history of people moving to heavily advertised tariffs only for that tariff to change after a reasonably short time, often without notice during the period of the switch. This is a relatively modest attempt to ensure that this does not happen. If the householder switches on the basis of the supplier's advertised lowest tariff, there should be no change to that tariff until after a period of 12 weeks. This seems a reasonable protection for the householder and would make a reality of Clause 72(2), which in itself is an important principle and one that I welcome. I beg to move.</p>

He makes a good point: it would not help consumers if information on lowest tariffs was often quickly out of date. The amendment would require the Government to guarantee that a supplier's lowest tariff was available to customers for 12 weeks after information about that tariff had been provided to them on their bill, thereby allowing them sufficient time to consider the information on their bill and to act on it before their supplier could move the goalposts and change the price.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="11013135000007"></a>The powers that we are seeking in the Bill would allow the Government to require suppliers to inform customers about their lowest tariff and how to switch to it. It is a feature of our competitive market that energy suppliers are able to react to changes in the market through dynamic pricing. The amendment would effectively prevent suppliers from making changes to the price of a tariff for a period of 12 weeks, which is not the intention of these proposals. Such a requirement would limit suppliers' ability to react to changes in the market and may lead to a more conservative pricing strategy, risking higher prices for customers across the board-in other words, the law of unintended consequences, which we have been looking at in other areas.</p>

<p><a name="11013135000012"></a>In light of our debates at the start of the year on energy market reform and on the mix of energy sources that will be needed for the foreseeable future-including new nuclear-we thought it important to draw renewable and low-carbon generation into our debate today so that the Minister might underline those aspects of it that he sees as being important within the framework of the Bill. It is important to encourage the Government to deliver on their promises, most notably that they demonstrate how new nuclear will be up and running by 2017-18, despite the proposals for operators to take on much more of the cost and liability. We also think it important that the Government deliver on the further stages of CCS and provide clarity on the future of fossil fuels as part of the energy mix and their relationships with the Green Deal. The Government should also provide clarity on the future of ROCs and FITs-the feed-in tariffs for renewable energy. We think that it is important for the Minister to explain this, because it will be important for consumers, both businesses and households. The price element of this is the subject of the next amendment. I beg to move.</p>

I have tabled this amendment to strengthen the incentive to invest in more gas storage. I took account of what my noble friend said in response to the amendment, but I have now made it my business to gain a better understanding of the considerable complexities of this sector of the energy market. How to ensure security of gas supply has become increasingly important, particularly in the light of the anticipated running down of the UK's own indigenous supplies from offshore sources. It is for this reason, no doubt, that the industry, successive Governments and the regulator have all rightly been very concerned to make as sure as they can that gas consumers will be assured of a continuous supply.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000002"></a>Since Second Reading, Ofgem has published-on 11 January-a consultation paper headed <I>Gas</I><I> Security of Supply</I><I> Significant Code Review</I>. I will come back to that. However, several other important reports were published in earlier years. In May 2007 a long report was published by the consultant Oxera, headed <I>An Assessment of the Potential Measures to Improve Gas Security of Supply</I>. Three years later the previous Government commissioned a report, this time by the consultant Pöyry, headed <I>GB Gas Security of Supply and Options for Improvement</I>. In April the previous Government published a policy statement headed Gas Security of Supply. Last November there was a joint DECC and Ofgem report, <I>Statutory Security of Supply Report</I>. Noble Lords will be relieved to know that I do not intend to quote more than a tiny portion of those reports. It would have been quite an effort even to bring them to the Moses Room.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000003"></a>The reports, which I hope I am summarising accurately, come down to this: although the risk of what one might describe as a "black swan" event-one of low probability but high impact-hitting the supply of gas to the UK market is very low, it is acknowledged by all that it is not impossible. It could be a combination of adverse events, such as pipeline accidents, import

The previous Government's provisional conclusion, therefore, was that some additional measures are needed to deal with that remote possibility.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000004"></a>The various reports examined and evaluated several options in great detail. The DECC policy statement of last April concentrated on five options. I will read the relevant two paragraphs from that April 2010 report to the Committee. On page 7, paragraph E.30 of the executive summary says, under the heading "Enhanced financial incentives to balance demand and supply":</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11013141000066"></a>"The Government supports Ofgem's work with industry to examine the case for greater use of market prices with enhanced incentives in the balancing regime"-</p>

<p><a name="11013141000005"></a>one needs to hang on to those words-</p>
<ul><a name="11013141000076"></a>"in particular by ... unfreezing cash-out prices in an emergency; and ... further finessing the cash-out regime in market conditions (outside an emergency)".</ul>
<p><a name="11013141000061"></a>The next paragraph, under the heading "Supplier obligations", says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11013141000067"></a>"The Government is considering the case for strengthening shipper/supplier obligations, such as through Public Service Obligations",</p>

<p><a name="11013141000062"></a>or PSOs, as they are widely known in the business. Those are the two preferred options that have been considered.</p>
<h5><a name="11013141000077"></a>6 pm</h5>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000006"></a>The earlier reports considered a number of other options. One is often described as sharpening the balancing mechanism-the balance between supply and demand-so that the effect would be more immediate. This would be done by modifying what is called the uniform network code, which is itself a massive document, running into several volumes of print. I confess at once that I have not studied it in detail. However, I can understand what it is saying. It is about strengthening the market mechanisms by changing the code so as to make it more effective and profitable and, if gas supply is interrupted, more costly to the supplier. The other option is to strengthen the existing public service obligation to require increased storage capacity, which could be done by giving Ofgem the power to amend the suppliers' licences to require more investment in storage.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000007"></a>What sharpening the balancing mechanism means in practice is to increase sharply the cost of the failure to deliver gas. Industrial and commercial customers could have a right to sue the supplier for those costs caused by an interruption, because they would be the ones who would be asked to interrupt their supplies. It is widely accepted that it is inconceivable that one should deliberately cut off the supply to domestic consumers, for all the obvious reasons. It is the industrial and commercial consumers who are asked to turn off their supply. That is the balancing mechanism.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000008"></a>It is often not recognised that there is an existing public service obligation for gas. It has existed ever since the privatisation of the industry and constitutes an absolute guarantee of supply for a one in 50 winter, but is a guarantee to domestic consumers only. The obligation was originally placed on the supplier and is now placed on the transporters-the gas grid-and the local distributors. The cost is recovered from the consumer via the grid charges to the suppliers.  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC293"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column GC293</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The obligation is to guarantee three or four days of supply if demand exceeds supplies. Strengthening that existing PSO would be achieved by amending the licence of the suppliers to require them to have more than three or four days' storage. They might go to 20 or even 30 days of storage. In Germany, the figure is 80 days and in France it is 90 days. I fully concede that the circumstances of those two countries have been very different, because the UK has its own indigenous source of supply. However, increasingly, we now rely on supplies piped from overseas. The argument now for approaching a storage figure more comparable with those of our neighbours seems to be a strong one.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000009"></a>One might ask what the essential difference is between the two options. Under the supply mechanism-the one which includes strengthening the balancing mechanism-the remedy for an interruption would be a high cash penalty and the risk of having to pay cash compensation to the industrial and commercial consumers cut off. Under the PSO option, the existence of higher storage capacity would be intended to avoid the risk of interruption at all.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000010"></a>This can be illustrated by explaining what the effect would be on a large industrial consumer of gas-for example, a very large baker such as Rank Hovis McDougall. The nub of the case is that RHM requires gas and not cash. If its business is interrupted because of the interruption of gas supplies and it is unable to bake bread for all its customers, including supermarkets that may be all round the country, it will lose its business. No amount of cash compensation for the short-term interruption of supply could possibly compensate. But surely there is also an argument of principle. Is it not better to prevent the failure of supply before the event, rather than to find suppliers and compensate customers after the event?</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000011"></a>This is the nub of the difference between the two solutions that the Government have been considering. Yet, the Government have come down in favour of strengthening the balancing mechanism via the uniform network code. That is the proposal in the consultation paper of 11 January this year entitled <I>Gas Security of Supply Significant Code Review</I>. Clause 77 allows Ofgem-in the Bill it is always called GEMA, something I get very confused about-to direct a modification of the uniform national code.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000012"></a>My Amendment 34A provides an additional power. It is an addition and not an alternative to the strengthening of the balancing mechanism. It strengthens the PSO by giving Ofgem power to amend the licences to provide for an obligation for a higher level of storage. I stress that it is an addition. The amendment does not seek to remove the strengthening of the balancing mechanism, the power in Clause 77(1), but to add a new subsection. I see these two as complementary. My amendment merely empowers-it does not direct-Ofgem to act.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000013"></a>One may ask, then, why the amendment is necessary. PSOs may become necessary. If the strengthening of the balancing mechanism is shown not to be enough to ensure gas supplies, then it may be necessary to reinforce them with an enhanced PSO. The amendment would ensure that it is on the statute book. It will be  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC294"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column GC294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there as a power. I am assured that a great deal of the preparatory work would be done by Ofgem and by the companies, so that they would be ready, if it became necessary, to respond more quickly to a requirement to hold higher levels of storage. If one had to start from scratch, with no existing statute provision, it might take six or seven years before one could have the storage. If all the preparations had been made-as would be expected if this was actually in the Bill-it could be half, or less than half, that time.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000014"></a>I think that this is a worthwhile amendment and I hope that my noble friend may be able to smile on it. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="11013141000015"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew69"></a><a name="11013141000083"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> My Lords, I support this amendment and compliment the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, on covering pretty well the whole of the case. Like him, I was approached by a company called Gateway, which is in the business of constructing storage facilities-or would like to be in the business of constructing storage facilities. My understanding, which the Minister will perhaps confirm, is that at the moment we have around 5.9 billion cubic metres of gas storage facility in the UK, and that we could need in extremis to double that or-instead of storing the four or five days' worth of gas that we have at the moment-go up to 20 days' worth. The consumption of this additional gas is not on a pro rata basis; it tapers because other things would happen.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000016"></a>My point is that the balancing mechanism is essentially the market mechanism, which assumes that this will be fine if we have a gas storage facility that blows up, as happened a few years ago. World market conditions were not affected to any great extent by that but we still had to buy in additional supplies. If something happened in the United Kingdom that in some way interrupted or interfered with our present indigenous supplies, we would not be affected by world prices. On the other hand, there could be a world crisis and an interruption to supply because we may well be the last in line for Russian gas supplies. There are reasons why we would be last in line in a world crisis, not least because for a long time we were self-sufficient and exported gas. There were periods in the 1990s when we changed the nature of our gas contracting and, as a consequence, we have tended more towards short-term contracts than long-term ones. Therefore, we have less of a claim on access to the world market.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000017"></a>The point I want to make is that it is fine to use the market-balancing mechanism when there is, in effect, a UK problem, but when there is a world problem, it becomes exceedingly expensive. If we are to be prudent, it is necessary for us to look at what would be regarded as getting the balance right between the two options. Neither of them is exclusive. In the case of the PSO, we would give a signal to the market that our very low level of storage ought to be increased.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000018"></a>When we touched on this subject at Second Reading, the Minister told us, "I have just signed the document offering planning permission", and said that this may well go ahead. Something like 15 projects at present enjoy planning permission but nobody sees the need to act on them because there is no clear indication that the Government are prepared to give them active support by way of a PSO. We need additional supply if

I have no reason to doubt that, although I accept that Gateway is in this business and will want to enhance its case, which is not unreasonable. The same could be said for the gas traders who have been successful in tipping the balance the other way. It is necessary for us to have a clearer indication.</p>
<h5><a name="11013141000078"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000019"></a>Am I right in saying that we have somewhere in the order of 5 billion or 6 billion cubic metres and that if we were to double that it would probably afford us supplies to meet the demands of 20 days or slightly beyond that? I do not think that we need to go anywhere near the French or German models because we still have access to the North Sea and some long-term contract facilities with Norway and the like. However, we are not guaranteed supply.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000020"></a>As for the one in 50 winter statistic, I have spoken to people from British Gas who used to do balancing in days gone by and they say that the 1929 winter is perhaps a better base year to take than the winter of 1963, which is normally referred to. I imagine that the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, being a geologist and a specialist in these matters, could give us chapter and verse on this. I merely raise this point to indicate that there is a debate here, not only between the two options, but also on the option of the PSO and whether the wisdom currently embraced by Ofgem and DECC should be revisited. An amendment of this nature would merely put on the statute book the opportunity for us to deal with a fuel shortage should we have a third bad winter in 50 years within the next four or five years.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000021"></a>As we move through 2015 the implications of the Large Combustion Plant Directive will become that much clearer. We will no longer be able to access coal-fired generation in the way that we have in the past and, until nuclear comes along, there will be an enhanced dependence on gas-fired electricity and the other purposes to which gas can be put. There will be a need for an increase in storage because we will be consuming more gas. I am not confident that the supplies that we have presently would be sufficient to be accommodated by a balancing act. The chances are that if we have a rotten winter in Britain, it will be mirrored by our neighbours 20 or 30 miles away across the Channel. If that is the case, the price of gas will rise and the costs of the balancing mechanism will be extremely high.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000022"></a>Whether or not we accept the optimism of the Government about the likely outcome of our present economic travails, we hope that by 2016 or 2017 our economy will be expanding. We will have to use more electricity, and more of that electricity than we have at present will be dependent on gas.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000023"></a>I take that as just one simple example of the likelihood of an increase in demand for gas, a likelihood which may not be capable of being economically addressed by the option that the Government are currently favouring in exclusion to the other. I would ask that the PSO be included as an additional option in the Bill. It will give the industries the opportunity of some certainty, and we will then have the likelihood of investment in what is an expensive, although not such a technically difficult

If we were to indicate that a PSO option was there, it is quite likely that the planning applications will be exercised. Some of the applications that have been granted will be taken up and used; at the moment they are not being acted upon. Enhancing our storage facilities is therefore a very prudent approach to our energy supplies. We should do so because we may well find in future, when we are in danger of running short of gas, that market conditions are extremely unfavourable and supplies are very expensive. It is probably better to give the nod to the spending of some money now rather than waiting for a solution which could well be far more expensive in the future. For these reasons I am happy to support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin.</p>

The debate has so far shown that UK gas storage capacity is too low in terms of the crucial insurance policy that it represents for this country either against a direct cut-off of gas supplies; or against sharply rising prices of such supplies, perhaps due to a cut-off somewhere else when we find ourselves at the end of the supply line. It would be helpful if the Minister could confirm that UK gas storage capacity is much lower than that of other EU member states-not just the ones cited, but quite a few more. Is our vulnerability really also not lower than theirs? Now that North Sea gas is running down, I believe that our vulnerability is every bit as high as theirs.</p>

<p><a name="11013141000025"></a>Gas storage has to be an important element of both our and the European Union's long-term energy security policy, along with other elements such as the diversification of supplies, the diversification of pipelines, more interconnectors between member states and more competition in the single market. The right honourable gentleman the Prime Minister is going to Brussels at the end of this week to discuss all those issues, because that is the topic of the European Council this week. I hope that it will make progress on all those issues. We need to put ourselves in a better position than we are now, so far as gas storage capacity is concerned. As the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, the simple way to achieve that is through the PSO. That is the thrust of the amendment and why I support it.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000026"></a>I ask the Committee's forgiveness for straying slightly outside this piece of legislation when I ask the Government whether they are considering a minimum requirement for gas storage in the European Union on each member state. That is highly desirable, as it has proved for oil. If it were to be introduced, it would likely be helpful for this country. There was a great deal of opposition from the suppliers when the oil requirement was introduced in the 1970s, but you do not hear anything about it now. It is taken as the most natural thing in the world that we and every European Union country hold-I think-40 days' supply of oil. Working now for an EU minimum that would apply to all member states would be worth while. If we were to move down that road, the amendment would put us in a position to meet any obligations. It would therefore make our

We would be showing other member states that we were serious about working for this, even though we were merely introducing a potential power to do it.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000027"></a>I see no particularly good arguments for resisting the amendment. After all, it does not impose an actual obligation on anyone; it merely makes it possible to do so without further legislation if it can be shown objectively to be both necessary and desirable. I therefore hope that the Minister will give serious consideration to it in his reply.</p>

<p><a name="11013141000028"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew71"></a><a name="11013141000085"></a>Lord Oxburgh:</b> My Lords, I briefly add my support to this amendment. The noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, is right that our dependence on gas will undoubtedly increase over the coming decades; as renewables and other sources of low-carbon energy come in, gas will be very important. It is equally true that the amount of storage that we could get away with when we had the North Sea producing at full rate could be relatively small, but it is also clear that the storage that we have today is inadequate. I will not go into the details, but something like 10 to 20 days' supply is what we should be thinking of today. This will not happen without regulation of some kind. The supply companies have no incentive to do it, and what both industry and the consumer need is gas, not compensation.</p>

<p><a name="11013141000029"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew72"></a><a name="11013141000086"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, all that needs to be said about this amendment has been said by informed Members of the Committee. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, on his amendment, which was supported so strongly by my noble friend Lord O'Neill, who also knows energy issues so well. It reinforces the case.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000030"></a>I am always worried when this issue of days crops up. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, indicated that France and Germany are different from the United Kingdom. They have been massively different historically because we have had our own indigenous resources. Our needs for storage are therefore very different from the needs of those and other countries in Europe. When I was charged with responding on energy matters for the previous Government, I always used to shudder when the "Today" programme would say, "The French have 90 days' security of supply and we have four". One felt the shudder go round the nation because of a colossal risk that we were all taking with energy. That is not so, and we must not spread alarm, but we must make provision for the future in a significantly changing situation, and we need to adjust to it. As the noble Lords, Lord Jenkin and Lord O'Neill, indicated, we are talking about a significant increase over present storage capacity. However, we are different from those other countries.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000031"></a>There were one or two occasions in the past when the United Kingdom's position at the end of that supply line cost us and we paid higher prices for gas in some circumstances. One remembers that enormous row with the Germans, who had to go to the European Community over the extent to which German companies seemed rather better at availing themselves of the available gas from Russia than we were. So this is an immensely serious issue, and there is no doubt that  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC298"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column GC298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>storage is the key issue. We have a range of suppliers, but a range of suppliers is no good if we do not have the storage capacity to deal with potential interruptions. There will always be limited supplies as far as gas is concerned, and it is obviously the case that we have issues regarding our own supplies.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000032"></a>I hope the Minister will accept the crucial point made by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, in his amendment-that this is in addition to what is in place at the moment. It is an empowerment that we might need. We might not need it, but if we do not, then it will not be utilised. However, it would be remiss of us if we did not guarantee that this power was in this Energy Bill. I therefore hope the Minister, who I know has to wrestle with all sorts of difficulties in responding to even the most constructive of amendments, will appreciate that the Committee expects a positive response.</p>

When I was shadowing my current role during the Labour Government and spoke on a number of occasions about gas storage, they reassured me that we had enough storage and that we were in very good shape. Indeed, now that I have got to the position that I am now in, I largely agree with them. That does not mean that we should be complacent or should not press hard for greater gas storage. But the facts are as follows: we have 16 days of storage available and we have under construction another 25 per cent. Maths is not my strongest suit, but as the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, can tell us-because maths is his strongest suit, along with running and jumping and other things-that gives us just over 20 days' storage.</p>

<p><a name="11013141000034"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew74"></a><a name="11013141000088"></a>Lord Moynihan:</b> Spot on!</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said quite reasonably that we should compare ourselves to other countries. Obviously, Germany and France have more than that, but they do not have their own gas supply. They are entirely reliant on what used to be called the old Iron Curtain countries for their supply. I would be concerned about the security of supply in the light of some of the endeavours that they have been through. We in this country still produce 50 per cent of our own gas and we are still finding more gas, which will not, admittedly, stop the supply being eroded, but will decelerate the erosion. We have a secure contract. The noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, suggested that we must have good long-term contracts; we probably have as good a long-term contract as any country in the world with Norway, from whom we receive 20 per cent of our supply, managed by Shell, the former company of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh-and a marvellous job it does as well. My own view is that we have a very significant secure supply.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000036"></a>Let us look at the matter of storage. Yes, we have given planning permission to various endeavours, but at the moment the cost of storing gas is significantly higher than the price of storing oil, so not unsurprisingly  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC299"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column GC299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people are giving due consideration to the commercial viability of this project. Of course, part of the thing that we must do in government is to weigh up the pros and cons and absolutely ensure that the nation has security of supply, which is fundamental to all Governments, and to be able to gauge that. We have not had a greater opportunity to gauge that than the unfortunate months of November and December last year, which were beyond record for bad weather, when we came through with flying colours. There were certain countries-and we shall not mention the names-that did not do so. Given the tests that we have had, we have come through with flying colours.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000037"></a>We should not be complacent, of course. That is why we have acted swiftly to engage in planning permission and to make it much easier for big infrastructure projects to be authorised quickly. But we cannot sit in government and insist that certain things are going to be carried out unless they have gone through proper consultation. In many ways, the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, gave me the answer to the question posed by his excellent amendment. Ofgem is already considering our requirements and carrying out a significant code review consultation, which will be produced at the end of February, on the resilience of our gas energy supply. It would be right for us to take on board what Ofgem has to say, to review it and then carry out what powers are necessary to ensure that, if there are areas that need to be dealt, the Government deal with them.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000038"></a>I hope that that sets the scene for the current gas supply situation. I hope that it answers a number of the excellent questions that noble Lords have asked and allows my noble friend Lord Jenkin to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="11013141000039"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew76"></a><a name="11013141000090"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> Perhaps the Minister could answer two questions. First, could he give us the number of billion cubic metres we have in storage at present? Secondly, am I right in saying that the effect of the amendment would be permissive rather than prescriptive? If it is only permissive, why not include it?</p>

<p><a name="11013141000040"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew77"></a><a name="11013141000091"></a>Lord Marland:</b> I thought that I answered the question on the storage available. I do not know precisely what amount is in storage as of today, but we have capacity for 4.6 billion cubic metres with another billion cubic metres of capacity in construction.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000041"></a>As for enablement, it is not for the Government to be too prescriptive. Already, in months, 25 per cent of gas storage is under construction. Already, we have tested that against difficult winter conditions. Already, we have found that it is satisfactory. As I mentioned, Ofgem is carrying out the review, so it would be wrong at this point in proceedings to pronounce on findings that might be different from those of the Government or us in this Room. We should listen to what it has to say, take it on board, and perhaps use powers available to us.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000042"></a>Let us not underestimate the difficulties. The noble Lord referred to Gateway, a company with which I am familiar. Its issue has been one of planning. The problem has been in Lancashire, if my memory serves me right. There is nothing that we in government can do about that if the local authority does not determine that it is the right thing to have.</p>

I thought I understood him to say-perhaps he did not-that if it came to the conclusion that the UK needed more gas storage as part of its studies, action would be taken. Does that mean to say that its findings could come in time to make an amendment to the Bill? That could be important. My second question about the Ofgem inquiry is: is he willing to make sure that Ofgem is brought quickly up to date with this debate, so that it can take it into account in its study?</p>

<p><a name="11013141000044"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew79"></a><a name="11013141000093"></a>Lord Marland:</b> The noble Lord makes a point. Of course Ofgem will be brought up to speed with what we are doing. I do not think that its review will have drawn the conclusions that we want by the time we have finished the Bill. There is some presupposing that people are sitting in knowledge. I have heard many different suggestions in this Room already today about how much we have or do not have in storage, and about what we should or should not have. It is up to the Government to look carefully at the facts and accelerate procedures where we think that should be done, as we have already done by 25 per cent-and we have been in government for only nine months; maybe a bit longer now. We have a level of comfort that is correct-not just in our own judgment; a whole range of sources tell us that we have it correct. The previous Government felt that it was the correct figure. If the information that results from the review shows us that we need to enact, we will. Ofgem itself has existing powers to modify licences and introduce new licence requirements, and may well do it itself. Of course this is very much a subject for debate, evaluation and continuing process, and I hope that satisfies the noble Lord.</p>

I feel greatly reinforced by the strength of the case which they have made. It would not be wholly unfair if I said that I was a little disappointed by the Minister's reply.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000046"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, asked whether it would be open to Ofgem in its consultation to come forward with a proposal which said, "Yes, all right, we will strengthen the balancing mechanism but we also think that there is a case for increasing the amount of storage and that this will require some further measures". That was a critical question, and I am not sure that I understood the answer.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000047"></a>We are talking about future demand and supply over a number of years. I have been provided with a chart, compiled by a consultant, which draws on all the various forecasts of demand for gas. If one looks ahead up to 2025, which is after all only 15 years ahead, one sees that the forecasts vary from a reduction in demand to three-quarters of the present level to an increase of a quarter. Those are huge variations, reflecting the uncertainty with which we are confronted when dealing with supply. We have tended to talk about supply, but the balancing mechanism is essentially a balance between supply and demand. If there is such a

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000048"></a>Yes, it is true that we have an indigenous supply, which is why our figure would, for the moment, be lower than that in our neighbouring countries-as I indicated in my opening speech. There may also be another Buzzard-type discovery in the North Sea. A recent discovery of gas quite close offshore certainly helped supply here. However, we must be cautious about what we say after the past two winters. Everybody has recognised that the electricity supply has been quite seriously affected by the recession and that the point at which we reach concern has therefore moved three or four years further forward. Why is that not the same for gas? We got through these last winters because there was a considerable measure of operating below capacity, which I hope will not continue. So here is another element of uncertainty.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000049"></a>We need to give more consideration to these matters. I shall certainly discuss what the Minister has said with those who have advised me. It may be that the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, is right and that we will get the Ofgem report before we reach the Report stage of this Bill-it looks a little less likely than it did before the weekend, but it is a possibility. We have another energy Bill coming up, which will affect among other things energy prices and the powers of Ofgem, so we may have another opportunity. I shall reflect; I hope that the Minister will do so, too. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="11013141000050"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew82"></a><a name="11013141000096"></a>Baroness Smith of Basildon:</b> My Lords, I put this forward as a probing amendment to clarify the issue of liability in the event of an oil spill. There are two triggers for the amendment. The first is the group of clauses that we are coming on to discuss and the second is the debate that we had thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, towards the end of last year on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. It was while researching for that debate that I thought more about the issues of liability if we had a spill in this country. I understand that with the Deepwater Horizon spill the costs are huge-around $20 billion and still counting. I am not clear on the issues of liability in this country, which is an area of concern. This seems an opportune moment to raise it during our proceedings on the Bill.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000051"></a>There is a two-pronged approach to this. First, there are technical ways in which to do everything that we can to avoid such a spill. Secondly, we could have an insurance policy in case a spill was to occur. That is the reason for proposing this amendment. At the moment, should there be a significant oil spill, the costs would fall on the taxpayer. Would that be at a national or a local authority level? This amendment seeks increased liability cover to be required before drilling in the UK. The recent report from the Energy and Climate Change Committee in the other place dealt with this issue and highlighted liability as an area that needed significant improvement to protect the taxpayer. The financial requirements currently placed on the industry are under the offshore pollution liability agreement, but my understanding is that they are quite weak. A significant oil spill would leave taxpayers disadvantaged, because they would face potentially huge costs in order to clear a major spill from the ocean off our shores.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000052"></a>In proposing this amendment, we want the Government to ensure that any new offshore drilling licence is granted only when the licensee has proved its ability to meet the full costs to address the direct and indirect consequences of an accidental release of oil that occurred as a result of any operations on the UK continental shelf. The Government should also ensure that compulsory third-party insurance cover is obtained for all small exploration and production involved in drilling operations in the UKCS. When we discussed this issue before, the Minister was content that the current arrangements for monitoring in the UK were perfectly adequate. Indeed, we have some of the toughest regulations and inspections in the world, but the HSE has warned about the increase in the number of serious accidents and spills. It has said that the industry's performance is not good enough and has urged it to up its game.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000053"></a>The monitoring and regulations that we have in place are significantly better than those that existed in the US at the time of Deepwater Horizon. However, I was concerned that the department's evidence to the committee confirmed that just one inspection of a deepwater rig will take place in 2010-11. I appreciate

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000054"></a>There are technical improvements that the Government could undertake. I am sure that the Minister is aware of the issues surrounding blow-out preventers and how they could be improved. Obligations might be placed on companies installing such rigs to have significantly improved blow-out preventers, doing everything that they could to prevent a blow-out and an oil spill. However, in case there was an oil spill, it would be helpful for some clarification as to where responsibility lies and whether measures could be taken via insurance on the licensees, as indicated in my amendment. Could the Minister consider that?</p>

<p><a name="11013141000055"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew83"></a><a name="11013141000097"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Smith of Basildon, raises some interesting points with her amendment but I wonder if its terms are quite right. She is asking for an ascertainment of financial capability at the time of the granting of a licence. However, if a requirement is to be imposed, it needs to be a continuous obligation-that is, something that is tested at regular intervals. A licence is granted at one point in time but a spill may occur many years later, when the financial position of a company is quite different.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para122"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000056"></a>Secondly, it is not so much a question of whether the applicant has sufficient funds, but of whether it has access to funds via insurance. It is probably much easier to demonstrate that there is adequate insurance to cover what might reasonably be expected to follow than to look at a company's balance sheet. I also say to the noble Baroness, wearing my accountant's anorak, that auditors do not certify things as being "true and accurate". Doubtless if this amendment found favour with the Minister the correct wording could be formulated.</p>

<p><a name="11013141000057"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew84"></a><a name="11013141000098"></a>Baroness Smith of Basildon:</b> I am very grateful to the noble Baroness; her contribution was extremely helpful. Certainly, it was not the intention that the time of applying for a licence should be the only time when financial capability was assessed. The insertion somewhere in the wording of "continuous" would be extremely helpful, as is her point about access to funds via insurance. The contrast I was trying to draw was with the Government's policy on the nuclear industry. Currently it is the Government's policy that a nuclear power company would have to be responsible for all the costs of decommissioning for some time-indeed, for the foreseeable future. In our previous debate we talked about 100 years or so. It seemed that equal responsibility should be taken by oil companies. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her suggestions.</p>

Most of the cross-examination on this issue highlighted the fact that caution should be the order of the day in assessing the level of cover that an operator would require. Caution is needed because there is a massive difference between the majors and

The representatives of the commission, when cross-examined in the last few days, highlighted the fact that they had not had the opportunity to discuss this issue, which is a valid and important one to raise. I welcome the fact that an amendment has been tabled so that we can consider it. However, the representatives had not had an opportunity to sit down with the insurance industry to look in detail at the exposure-the level of cover required-and the impact on the industry as a whole.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000059"></a>We in this country have a proud and, in my view, wise policy of encouraging independents to come on to licences alongside the majors to add further expertise and bring additional value to the table on safety, drilling expertise and well knowledge. I would be cautious about taking too much of a blanket approach to this at the moment-one which did not take into account the exposure that was being sought by the noble Baroness for different licence-holders and different companies on the same licence. The direction of travel in which she is heading is one that the industry will need to follow. This will inevitably be a major issue as the industry moves forward, both in the United States and elsewhere. It is a subject that will require detailed consideration between government, the industry and the insurers to come up with the best possible method of moving forward to ensure that, on the one hand, there is cover but, on the other, we do not end up with just a handful of majors and lose the independent sector. It has contributed so much to the development of the North Sea and has a commitment to safety that is as great as that of anybody else operating there. That is my only word of caution.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para124"></a>
<p><a name="11013141000060"></a>This is a highly complex area, which needs a good deal of further reflection, but I welcome the fact that the noble Baroness has brought this to the Committee. It is an important issue and she knows my interest in the subject. I hope the Minister responds equally positively about the importance of this issue and of continuing discussions between the Government, the insurance industry and the operators-and not just the operators but the drillers-to make sure that there is appropriate cover, but that cover is not required to the point at which we lose a significant section of the industry, which so far has contributed greatly to the development of the North Sea.</p>

I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Moynihan for his comment as a practitioner in this field. I should preface any remarks that I make with a reminder that, in my former life, I spent most of my time trying to sell insurance to oil companies and to make myself even richer, so I was all in favour of them buying as much insurance as possible. However, in my current role, I see that a balance has to be struck and that I was wrong at the time-or only partly right. My shareholders thought that I was right.</p>

<p><a name="11013143000002"></a>The Government are in full agreement on this. We have seen the Select Committee's recommendations and we are evaluating them at the moment. The noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, makes the point that we must not rush into this or have knee-jerk reactions. Of course, when the Government issue licences, a fundamental

This pooling arrangement is fairly unique and it gives us a number of solid assurances. There are two imponderables that need evaluation. One is the quality of insurance cover. Obviously, if the insurance provider is not of A-graded quality, particularly with a longer-term liability situation, that would be a concern. That needs looking at rigorously. Then there is the matter of the quantum.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000003"></a>Two things are going on, as the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, said. The first is the inquiry that is happening in the United States. We would not want to prejudge what is happening in that inquiry, which we want to evaluate. Also, we want to evaluate the Select Committee's comments, which are valid. I hope that the noble Baroness will understand that the Government take this matter seriously. She has been persuasive in taking an important line. It is very much in the country's interest that the subject of pollution should be managed very carefully indeed.</p>

As new licences are being issued for drilling, probably as we speak, this is clearly an issue that needs to be addressed with some urgency, although I take on board entirely the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan. I understand from the Minister's comments that the Government are looking at this matter and that we will return to it. With that information, I am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="11013143000006"></a>I feel that there is a lack of clarity about why this chapter is coming forward at this time. It is entirely appropriate-indeed desirable-that the Government move to consolidate the four pieces of legislation that currently exist in this area.

Their role almost seems to be that of an arbiter, though it seems stronger than that.</p>
<h5><a name="11013143000046"></a>7 pm</h5>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para129"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000008"></a>The Explanatory Notes clearly state:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11013143000043"></a>"The Chapter gives the Secretary of State new powers to seek information about the progress of access negotiations; and where there is no realistic prospect of negotiations succeeding, to issue a notice granting relevant rights, without an application from any party".</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para130"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000009"></a>In reality, I am not sure that that is how it works. The information that I have had from the department is that there has been a request to the Secretary of State to intercede where there has been no agreement. I think that we would want to avoid the Secretary of State becoming an arbiter in what is a commercial agreement or disagreement between two parties. If the Minister could give some clarification on when it would be appropriate for the Secretary of State to intervene, that would be helpful. The tone of the clause goes against what the Minister has said throughout this Bill: that it is market driven; that the market will provide; that the Government should not intervene. Yet here we have stronger government intervention.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000010"></a>That intervention may be appropriate-I am just trying to seek the reasons why. I gather that this is the first time in 10 years that any company has sought the intervention of the Secretary of State. A note that I have had today says that possibly more would be forthcoming. Is that an indication that more are in the pipeline? Or has someone made an application-although there are not the powers to do so, and it is not what the Explanatory Notes say? Is it trying to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut because, in one case, the Secretary of State has been asked to intervene to help negotiations? We then bring forward legislation which gives power to the Secretary of State to intervene in ongoing commercial negotiations between two companies.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para132"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000011"></a>Where does the Minister think the current provisions are defective? Why do we need to bring these provisions forward? Where an application has been made to the Secretary of State now, I am not clear what the difference is. It seems to be that the impetus can come from the Secretary of State to seek information on why the negotiations are not taking place or are not proceeding in an appropriate way, rather than someone seeking the Secretary of State to intercede. There is a difference here and I am not clear why that is. There is a legal remit at present for the Secretary of State to intervene, but that does not seem to be what is being put forward in this legislation.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para133"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000012"></a>What discussions have the Government had with the industry and what was its response? The information from the department indicates that the industry is working to update its code of conduct, which is absolutely correct in order to reflect the new framework it is operating in. However, I understand that the industry has concerns that investment may be affected or hindered in some way. I wonder whether that problem has been raised with the department and what discussions are taking place to address it?</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para134"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000013"></a>So I am seeking further information and clarification, and the reasons why the legislation is coming forward. Is it a reasonable response at this stage to have this  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC307"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column GC307</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>kind of legislation coming forward where a Secretary of State intervenes in commercial negotiations having never done so before?</p>

<p><a name="11013143000014"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew89"></a><a name="11013143000051"></a>Baroness Northover:</b> My Lords, this chapter is designed to replace the current legislation on third-party access to upstream petroleum infrastructure. Perhaps I can further clarify what information the noble Baroness has already received; she obviously has a good grasp of what this section seeks to do. It relates to access to offshore pipelines, platforms and processing facilities and to the onshore terminals and pipelines to which they connect. The existing provision, which in part dates back to 1975, has grown piecemeal. As the noble Baroness said, it is scattered over four Acts of Parliament. The procedures are not fully consistent; the definitions are not well aligned and some kinds of facilities are not explicitly covered, which is why the provision needed to be updated.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para135"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000015"></a>The need for third-party access is increasingly important. This is the significant point. Even after four decades of exploitation, there are 20 billion barrels or more that might still be produced from the UK continental shelf. The remaining pockets of oil and gas are typically individually small. Many are not large enough to justify dedicated pipelines or processing facilities. Economic development of these discoveries will increasingly depend on getting timely access to existing pipelines-where these have spare capacity-and on getting reasonable terms for that access. This is the kind of shift that helps to explain why this has been brought about. The time is therefore right to overhaul the existing legislation and to make sure that it is fit for purpose in this situation.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para136"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000016"></a>Of course, dispute resolution should not be a routine process. Third-party access can be and in the overwhelming majority of cases has been, as the noble Baroness acknowledges, agreed amicably between the parties involved. We have every intention that this should remain the case. We are fully engaged in and fully support the industry's work to develop its own voluntary code of practice for infrastructure access. Disputes will nevertheless happen and negotiations will from time to time break down, so it is necessary that the Government should have the means of resolving an impasse where it occurs. This chapter therefore re-enacts the existing legislation, but as a unified process that has full coverage of all relevant pipelines, platforms and terminals.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para137"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000017"></a>Clause 78 sets out the basic procedure for resolution of disputes about access. It specifies the scope of the procedure-that is, the pipelines and other facilities to which it applies; the right of a person seeking such access to apply to the Secretary of State for the rights if unable to secure them by negotiation; the procedure that is to be followed; certain matters that are to be taken into account; and appropriate safeguards for the interests of the owners and others with existing rights. Finally, subject to that procedure and the safeguards, it sets out the powers of the Secretary of State to issue a notice granting appropriate rights to the applicant.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para138"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000018"></a>These provisions make two key changes. First, the current legislation provides a safeguard for the reasonable requirements of the owners for transport or processing of oil and gas and for the entitlements of other users  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC308"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column GC308</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>who already have rights to the infrastructure for transport or processing. The Secretary of State must be satisfied, before making an access notice, that doing so will not prejudice these requirements or rights. In general principle, this is clearly right but, on reflection, we think that an unqualified requirement on this point will prove unduly restrictive. There will be circumstances in which introducing a third party into an existing facility will reduce, at least temporarily, the capacity available to others. If nothing else, the making of a physical connection is required, which entails a risk of interruption to operations.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para139"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000019"></a>We think it desirable that the Secretary of State should have a similar flexibility in determining terms for access. Accordingly, we have qualified the safeguard provision for existing capacity requirements or rights so that such rights and requirements can be effected, provided that suitable compensation is available to the affected users. The other innovation is that the access notice has effect only if accepted by the applicant within a defined time. This meets a concern that has been raised in discussion with the industry. We think that it will provide a helpful degree of clarity for all involved.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para140"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000020"></a>The noble Baroness made reference to this being left to the market. I emphasise that the market model applies to the Green Deal, and we are moving on to another part of the Bill here. I hope that she can see the case that is being made for why, in these circumstances, these measures need to be taken forward.</p>

<p><a name="11013143000021"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0001.htm_spnew90"></a><a name="11013143000052"></a>Baroness Smith of Basildon:</b> I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving a detailed explanation, although I am not really sure that she understood fully the points that I made. I apologise if there was not enough clarity in what I said. I have asked that a copy of the brief that was e-mailed to me today by her department should be given to her as well. I shall make sure that she receives that.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para141"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000022"></a>We have heard so many times about what the market mechanism will provide under the Green Deal. Previously, in this area of policy, it has been more about the commercial arrangement than market mechanisms, but the Government seek to alter that-as I understand it, on the basis of one case in which the Secretary of State has been asked to intervene. Is this an appropriate way in which to progress? Although the Secretary of State has been asked to intervene, the new clause gives the Secretary of State powers to seek information on how negotiations are going and then to issue a notice granting rights. I am concerned that the Government feel that they could be acting on behalf of one of the participants in a commercial arrangement. I am not sure that that is prevented from happening in the clauses we are discussing.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0001.htm_para142"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000023"></a>I am happy for the noble Baroness to take this away and come back to me on this matter. There was another point that she did not address. Some companies have put it to me that such a clause, whereby there can be direct intervention by the Secretary of State in what was a commercial arrangement, could impact on the investments of those companies in the industry. That is quite a serious matter, and I asked whether there had been any discussions with the industry on investment.

Good questions have come from the noble Baroness, which we would not have dealt with in Committee otherwise. First, as the Minister says, these provisions give the opportunity for small oilfields to be exploited when the infrastructure and investment in that would not otherwise allow that at all. Secondly, to pick up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan-although he is not in his place-it must make it possible for smaller, independent oil companies to exploit those opportunities, which would not otherwise be there if there was no sharing. The pipelines that are already there are in a certain way a ransom strip. They are a monopoly of a facility that has been invested in, rightly, by those organisations, but they give undue leverage to those organisations. Also, the fact that this legislation is here means that commercial deals will almost certainly be done, whereas they might not be if it was not here. So this is a good clause in the Bill.</p>

I note several things in relation to what the noble Baroness said. I point out that the briefing, which I hope she received all of, says that, while there are understandable differences of view-infrastructure owners are wary of change, but potential users are often strongly in favour-the industry is broadly speaking supportive of the case for change. On the point of whether the Government should be involved in something like this or whether it should simply be left to commercial negotiations, EU law requires the provision of a dispute resolution procedure for access to upstream gas pipelines.</p>

<p><a name="11013143000026"></a>My noble friend Lord Teverson pointed out that we have a responsibility as the UK Government to ensure that these resources are accessible. The fact that they are, as I have mentioned, in smaller pockets and may need that kind of sharing of infrastructure makes it even more important now that this is addressed. That is why that is being done: it is in the national interest that it is done and not simply left to market forces to resolve in these circumstances. On that basis, I hope the noble Baroness will feel that I have adequately addressed the issues that she has raised. If she remains concerned, we can have further discussions. In the mean time, I hope she is happy for this clause to stand part of the Bill.</p>

I just make a point by way of introduction. Nobody reading this amendment could have a clue what it was about. The reason for that is that it is a striking example of the Bill adopting the process of legislation by reference to earlier Bills. I am sorry my noble friend Lord Marland is not here. I have raised this matter with the Law Commission because the gas and electricity Acts are now virtually indecipherable; it is impossible to find one's way around them. It is high time that there was a consolidation. Having said that, I will move on.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000029"></a>The real problem that the amendment addresses is that one of the provisions of the Energy Act 2004 that is being applied to this Bill is Section 157. Section 157(2) established three grounds on which an energy supply company can be put into administration. One is that the company is unable to pay its debts. Another is that it would be just and equitable, under Section 124A of the Insolvency Act, to wind up the company in the public interest-for instance to stop fraud or criminal activity. The third ground-this is what the amendment is about-is that the court must be satisfied that the company is likely to be unable to pay its debts. The 2004 Act applied to network companies; this Bill would apply it to supply companies. My amendment would delete that third ground-of a company being likely to be unable to pay its debts-for administration as it would apply to supply companies.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000030"></a>To put it in layman's terms, this means that the petitioner for a special administration order must be able to convince the court that, while the company in question is currently quite solvent, it is at risk of becoming insolvent, perhaps because the scale of liabilities that it faces looks excessive in relation to the foreseeable value of its assets. How far ahead? It is a very uncertain test. The reason for the third test was that it enabled a company's directors, who after all should have the best view of the likely future circumstances, to apply for insolvency administration. That cannot possibly apply here because the only people who can apply for administration under this Bill are the Minister or Ofgem. The directors cannot do so.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000031"></a>There is another reason why the test should not apply here. Those who followed closely the tangled affairs of Railtrack in 2001 can recognise that it is open to political abuse. I do not propose to go into the long and tangled story, which was reported the other

It was only on the basis of cash flow projections over a lengthy future period that the Government could proceed.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000032"></a>A test that requires that kind of assessment to be made is quite different from the other two tests. It is inherently inappropriate, particularly here where we are dealing with energy supply companies which are operating in volatile, competitive markets. It is made doubly inappropriate by the fact that the tests can be abused for political purposes.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000033"></a>My amendment would simply remove that test altogether as it would apply to energy suppliers. My noble friend may have better ways of doing this, but I do not think that that test is appropriate in such a case as we have here, where only Ofgem or the Secretary of State-not the directors of a company-are able to use it and where it would be inherently very difficult to apply. I beg to move.</p>

It went on at least twice as long as we are destined to do. The noble Lord indicated that he has found a slight impediment in that Act. All I can say is that I did not see it at the time and I do not understand it now, so good luck to the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="11013143000035"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="11013143000059"></a>Baroness Northover:</b> My Lords, I must say that I am incredibly impressed at the thoroughness with which my noble friend Lord Jenkin has read this Bill and that I hope that he very much liked Clause 78, which indeed consolidated and hopefully improved existing provisions.</p>

<p><a name="11013143000036"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="11013143000060"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> I had intended to say just that, because I was checking the Bill and saw that, indeed, the earlier clauses had been repealed.</p>

If a party applies to the court for an ordinary administration order, the court may grant it if it is satisfied that a company is unable to pay its debts or is unlikely to be able to pay them. Administration under the Insolvency Act 1986 is a business rescue procedure with the survival of the company as its primary objective. If entry to administration were available only to a company that could not pay its debts at the date of commencement, the rescue of viable businesses might be jeopardised. For this reason, administration can be entered also when a company is likely to become unable to pay its debts. The provisions in the Bill apply these same principles to energy supply company administration.  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC312"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column GC312</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>They follow the same tests for insolvency as the Insolvency Act. My noble friend's amendment would require the court to apply a stricter test for insolvency when considering applications for energy supply company administration than it does for applications for ordinary administration.</p>

<a name="110131-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="11013143000038"></a>I make it clear that the Secretary of State would apply for an energy supply company administration order only as a last resort and to prevent the risk of financial failure spreading to other companies. I hope that I have reassured my noble friend that we are seeking simply to keep the procedure in line with that which applies elsewhere for other companies. I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="11013143000039"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="11013143000062"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> My Lords, I am grateful for my noble friend's explanation, but I have to say that I do not think that she has taken account of what I said. Under the Insolvency Act, which introduces this third test, the directors of a company can apply to put the company into administration. After all, they are the ones who are best able to decide whether the company is likely to be unable to pay its debts in the future. In this case, that does not apply. The directors are forbidden to do it; only the Secretary of State or Ofgem can make the call. I see that my noble friend has been given an explanation. It would nice if the Committee could hear it, too.</p>

<p><a name="11013143000040"></a><b><a name="110131-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="11013143000063"></a>Baroness Northover:</b> It is amazing what enlightenments can come when one listens to one's noble friends. Funnily enough, I have come to this conclusion: the Secretary of State will no doubt wish to discuss any application for an energy supply company administration order with company directors in advance. Directors will be able to contest the application in court. However, enshrining a duty to consult directors in the legislation could lead to delay. The Secretary of State needs the flexibility to act quickly if the company's position is posing a threat to the rest of the market. When we see what has happened recently in other areas, we realise why this is extremely important. I hope that that helps to elucidate why this is in this provision.</p>

This has caused anxiety, particularly in the light of the Railtrack case. However, having heard her, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="1101312000003"></a><b><a name="110131-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="1101312000712"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Howell of Guildford):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (William Hague) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="1101312000004"></a>I wish to inform the House that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, together with the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development, is today publishing the second progress report on developments in Afghanistan. It follows the first report covering November published on 14 December 2010.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="1101312000005"></a>The report focuses on key developments during the month of December.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="1101312000006"></a>ISAF operations continue to put pressure on the insurgency. More areas have been cleared of insurgent influence and, importantly, those areas are now being held. Increased ISAF and Afghan National Security Force operations are restricting the insurgents' ability to launch complex attacks. These gains are an important sign of progress, but they are not irreversible.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="1101312000007"></a>The Afghan National Security Forces continue to grow. By late December the Afghan National Army had reached a total size of 146,000, and the Afghan National Police 116,000. Further work is necessary on reducing attrition rates and increasing leadership quality. Training, mentoring and coaching programmes continue to improve overall Afghan National Security Force capability.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="1101312000008"></a>British forces, partnered by forces from the Afghan National Army, have temporarily extended their operations to secure greater freedom of movement along Highway One. This is to link the economic and population hubs of Helmand and Kandahar. Improved freedom of movement will enable ISAF and the Afghan National Security Forces to increase security in both provinces.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="1101312000009"></a>The Afghan High Peace Council convened further road shows to publicise the Afghan Peace and Reintegration Programme and to give guidance to provincial governors in Kandahar, Herat and Jalalabad. These followed an earlier road show held in Mazar-e-Sharif.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="1101312000010"></a>The Afghan Government have continued to make progress on its National Priority Programmes, in particular on financial and economic reform and health and education.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="1101312000011"></a>Elders and community representatives for the Marjah district in Helmand have agreed that elections for a district community council should be held in February 2011. This is an important reflection of growing confidence in Marjah.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="1101312000012"></a>The Helmand Police Training Centre, opened in December 2009 with UK support, is now enrolling 150 new recruits every three weeks for eight-week  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS58"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column WS58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>courses. In the last week of December, the 2000th recruit since its inauguration graduated from the centre. Two UK-funded buildings were opened in December: a new detention centre and a temporary facility for juvenile prisoners. The UK supported training for Helmand's statutory justice officials on criminal law and on judicial ethics. The UK-funded Helmand legal aid office hired the province's first female paralegal.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="1101312000013"></a>Regional economic co-operation was strengthened further with the 11 December signing of an agreement for the construction of the Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India (TAPI) gas pipeline. The presidents of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Turkey met in Istanbul on 24 December 2010 to discuss security, infrastructure, trade and culture. We welcome this continued commitment to promoting peace and stability in the region.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="1101312000014"></a>I am placing the report in the Library of the  House. It will also be published on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website (<a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>)  and the HMG UK and Afghanistan website (<a href="http://afghanistan.hmg.gov.uk/">http://afghanistan.hmg.gov.uk/</a>).</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="1101312000016"></a>My honourable friend the Minister for the Armed Forces and I wish to make the latest of our quarterly statement to the House with details of the inquests of service personnel who have died overseas. We remain deeply grateful to all of our service personnel who are serving, or who have served, in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="1101312000017"></a>Our most sincere condolences go, as ever, to the families of those service personnel who have lost their lives in the service of their country, and in particular to the nine who have died since our last Statement. All of the families whose loved ones have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country, or who have otherwise lost their lives in connection with the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, remain very much in our thoughts.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="1101312000018"></a>Today we are announcing the current status of inquests conducted by the Wiltshire and Swindon coroner, and other coroners in England and Wales. This Statement gives the position at 25 January.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="1101312000019"></a>I have placed tables in the Libraries of the Houses, which outline the status of all cases and the date of death in each case. These tables include information about cases where a board of inquiry or a service inquiry has been held.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="1101312000020"></a>Our departments remain committed to working closely together to improve our processes and to continue the Government's support for coroners conducting inquests into operational deaths. As a result of these improvements, the dedication of coroners and the support from both departments, 130 inquests were completed in 2010, compared with 58 inquests being completed in 2009. There are no outstanding inquests into deaths prior to 4 December 2008.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="1101312000022"></a>Since October 2007, additional resources have been provided by both departments for operational inquests. These resources have been provided to the Wiltshire and Swindon coroner; Mr David Ridley due to the repatriation of service personnel at RAF Lyneham and the formation of the MoD Defence Inquests Unit in 2008. These measures have been provided to ensure that there is not a backlog of operational inquests.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="1101312000025"></a>There have been a total of 435 inquests into the deaths of service personnel who have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, including 11 service personnel who died in the UK of their injuries.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="1101312000034"></a>The Government are committed to ensuring that assistance is available for those victims and witnesses of crime most in need of support.

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="1101312000039"></a>This Statement sets out the forthcoming changes to the current Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) structure, which the CPS is introducing from 1 April 2011.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="1101312000040"></a>Under the current CPS structure, there are 42 areas aligned to individual police force boundaries. These areas are presently organised as 13 regional groups. In the new structure, the 13 groups will become 13 new larger areas, with a Chief Crown Prosecutor (CCP) supported by a number of deputy Chief Crown Prosecutors to provide leadership across the new areas.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="1101312000041"></a>This change builds on the experience and success that the CPS group structure has provided over recent years. It establishes a solid foundation for the future and provides the CPS with greater capacity, capability and flexibility to respond to the challenges that lie ahead.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="1101312000042"></a>The CPS has carefully considered the changes taking place in the criminal justice system (CJS) and believes that the new structure will provide a better strategic fit with its partners and places the CPS in the best possible position to deal with the modernisation of the CJS including digital working. The new structure will also provide an improved service for serious and sensitive casework, especially work received from regional intelligence units and regional asset recovery teams.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="1101312000043"></a>Under these new arrangements there will continue to be a strong presence in each police force area with dedicated teams working with local police forces and senior CPS leaders to provide a strong focus on local liaison, partnership and accountability.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="1101312000060"></a>I have today laid before Parliament the Government's responses (Cm 8007 and Cm 8009) to the House of Commons Health Select Committee reports <I>Public Expenditure: Second Report of Session 2010-11</I>, which was published on 14 December 2010 and <I>Commissioning: Third Report of Session 2010-11</I>, which was published on 18 January 2011.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="1101312000061"></a>We accept the level of challenge presented in our modernisation of health and social care but we are clear that these changes are necessary and that the funding announced during the 2010 Spending Review, coupled with more efficient delivery systems, will allow the required change to take place across the health and social care sectors. These changes will bring about closer working across the sectors creating services that will be more responsive, more personalised and more preventative with better outcomes for those who use them.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="1101312000062"></a>The starting point for the committee's inquiry into commissioning has been the previous committee's findings on the significant shortcomings of the current arrangements for commissioning in the NHS. We welcome the committee's conclusion that more effective commissioning is the key to delivery of efficiency gains. The White Paper, <I>Liberating the NHS</I>, sets out a new direction for the future of commissioning, intending to put commissioning decisions in the hands of those who are closest to patients themselves-GPs.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="1101312000063"></a>The Health and Social Care Bill introduced into Parliament on 19 January takes forward the changes to the NHS set out in the White Paper and further developed in December's legislative framework and next steps.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="1101312000064"></a>The programme of modernisation we have set out is essential both to drive efficiency in the short term, and help ensure that the NHS meets the ambition to achieve outcomes for patients that are amongst the best in the world.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="1101312000067"></a>The Government have today announced the climate change levy (CCL) exemption for supplies of gas in Northern Ireland will be replaced with a lower rate from 1 April 2011.</p>




<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS62"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column WS62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="1101312000068"></a>Following discussion and agreement with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2011 to remove the exemption and replace it with a lower rate for a transitional period of 1 April 2011 to 31 October 2013, after which the main CCL rate for gas will apply in Northern Ireland. During the transitional period such supplies will become subject to the levy at a rate of £0.00059 per kilowatt hour, which is 65 per cent lower than the full rate of CCL on gas for business and public sector consumers. Domestic consumers do not pay CCL.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a><a name="1101312000069"></a>Following consultation with the European Commission, the Government consider it is unlikely that it would be able to secure re-approval for the exemption. The measure is therefore necessary to ensure compliance with European tax law and state aid rules.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="1101312000070"></a>To give gas suppliers and business gas consumers certainty over their tax affairs, this announcement is being made early to allow energy suppliers and businesses in Northern Ireland time to start to prepare for the introduction of the lower rate on 1 April 2011.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<a name="1101312000072"></a><b><a name="110131-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="1101312000718"></a>Lord Shutt of Greetland:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Owen Paterson) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="1101312000073"></a>The House will be aware of the announcement made by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) on 21 December 2010. In that statement, the PPS confirmed that, following a review of all the available evidence including that given to the Hamill tribunal, it concluded that the test for prosecution is met in respect of two persons for an offence of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and one person for an offence of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="1101312000074"></a>As I informed the House in my Written Statement of 16 December 2010, the Hamill inquiry intends to complete its report by the end of February. It remains my intention to publish the report as soon as practicable, but in light of the legal proceedings against these three individuals, I have decided not to publish the inquiry's report until the legal proceedings have concluded; to do so would certainly jeopardise these individuals' right to a fair trial. I understand from the inquiry that it is also the family's wish that the legal proceedings are not prejudiced by the publication of the report. In the meantime, I am exploring ways of ensuring that the report is safely and securely stored between its completion and its publication.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="1101312000075"></a>Once the legal proceedings have concluded and the inquiry's report is delivered to me, I am responsible for its publication. In anticipation of this, I have asked a small team of officials to commence the checking of the inquiry's report in relation to human rights and national security matters, as outlined below. I intend   


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS63"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column WS63</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to adopt the same approach as was used for the checking of the reports of the Bloody Sunday inquiry and the Billy Wright inquiry.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="1101312000076"></a>I am advised that I have a duty, as a public authority under the Human Rights Act, to act in a way that is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). To fulfil this duty, I need to take steps to satisfy myself that publication of the report will not breach Article 2 of the Convention by putting lives or safety of individuals at risk. I am advised that these obligations must be met by me personally, in my capacity as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="1101312000077"></a>Although the inquiry is also a public authority under the Human Rights Act, I am not entitled to rely on the inquiry to satisfy my Article 2 obligations and I have a duty to assess this myself. I also have a duty to satisfy myself that publication will not put national security at risk, for example by disclosing details of sources of protected information.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="1101312000078"></a>I have established a small team to assist me in carrying out this necessary exercise. The team will be formed of the Northern Ireland Office's principal legal adviser and an adviser from the Police Service of Northern Ireland. This team will be granted access to the report under strict terms of confidentiality and for the sole purpose of carrying out the necessary checks, and they will report directly to me alone. Sir Edwin Jowitt has agreed that this team can carry out the checks on the inquiry's premises while the report remains in the custody of the inquiry. I understand that the report will be made available for checking today.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_69"></a><a name="1101312000079"></a>I want to publish the report in its entirety. Should any concerns about the safety of any individual arise, my first course of action would be to consider whether these can be addressed through alternative means. Were I to reach the conclusion, on advice, that a redaction to the text might be necessary, I would consult Sir Edwin Jowitt. In the very unlikely event that any redaction was deemed necessary, my intention would be to make this clear on the face of the report.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a><a name="1101312000080"></a>It is not possible to estimate how long the legal proceedings against the three individuals will take. I assure the House that once they have concluded, I intend to publish the report as soon as possible. Once a timetable for publication becomes clear, I will update the House accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_73"></a><a name="1101312000084"></a>Automatic enrolment will play a major part in reinvigorating the pensions landscape, bringing millions of individuals into pension saving.

<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2011" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS68"></a><b>31 Jan 2011 : Column WS68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para694"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_694"></a><a name="1101312000707"></a>The Government announced in a Written Ministerial Statement on 15 September 2010 that preparations were under way to launch an open market process to resolve the future of the Tote. This followed the announcement in the Budget of 22 June 2010 that the future of the Tote would be resolved within 12 months in a way that secures value for the taxpayer and which recognises the support the Tote currently provides to the racing industry.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para695"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_695"></a><a name="1101312000708"></a>The Government can now inform the House that the first stage of that open market process has been successful. The Government are pleased with the level of interest shown in the process. Eighteen indicative proposals were received, each of which has been assessed against the Government's objectives.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para696"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_696"></a><a name="1101312000709"></a>Following this review, a selected number of parties has now been invited to advance to the next stage of the process where they will receive more detailed information. The Government expect to be in a position to provide the House with a further update in the spring.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para697"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_697"></a><a name="1101312000710"></a>Given the commercially sensitive nature of the process, the Government will not be making public the details of the individual proposals received as part of the open market process nor the identity of those parties that have been invited to participate in the next stage.</p>

<a name="110131-wms0001.htm_para698"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_698"></a><a name="1101312000711"></a>The Government can also confirm that in the event that the Tote is sold on the open market, they will honour the commitment of the previous Government to share 50 per cent of the net cash proceeds of sale with racing. The proceeds will be made available over the Spending Review period (or longer if the sale proceeds are particularly high) because of the broader fiscal position and the need to spend the funds consistent with EU state aid rules, but the Government will pay interest on the outstanding balance in the normal way. The Government look forward to working closely with racing in the event of an open market sale to design appropriate arrangements.</p>

The Governments of countries neighbouring Burma are aware of the potential for increased flows of refugees following any upsurge in fighting, as are the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) which provide assistance to Burmese refugees in Thailand. Members of the NGO Committee for the Co-ordination of Services to Displaced Persons in Thailand (CCSDPT) have undertaken contingency planning for possible increased humanitarian needs on the Thailand-Burma border. The Department for International Development (DfID) is providing about £1.6 million this financial year to two CCSDPT member organisations for food, housing, other supplies and improved access to legal assistance for Burmese refugees in Thailand.</p>

It is expected that the fund will focus on aid delivered inside Burma. However, a number of alternative means are available for delivering aid to Burma cross-border from neighbouring countries. In 2010, the Department for International Development (DfID) provided £825,000 in cross-border health sector aid to ethnic minority groups inside Burma.</p>

The CQC is the independent regulator of health and adult social care in England and has a key responsibility in the overall assurance of essential levels of safety and quality of health and adult social care services. It also has responsibilities for:</p>
providing independent assurance and publishing information on the safety and quality of services;registering providers of regulated activities (including National Health Service, adult social care and independent sector healthcare providers);monitoring compliance with a set of registration requirements;using tough enforcement powers, if necessary, to ensure service providers meet requirements;assessing the performance of providers and commissioners;undertaking special reviews of particular services at a national level, looking across providers and commissioners of health and adult social care;monitoring the use of the Mental Health Act; andhelping manage the impact of regulation on service providers and commissioners.
<a name="110131w0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_24"></a><a name="11013117000047"></a>Discussions are taking place between the department, HFEA, CQC and other regulatory bodies on the transfer of the functions currently carried out by the HFEA and how they will be discharged in the future, including the scope for streamlined and lighter touch regulation. The proposals will be subject to a public consultation later in the year. Subject to the ongoing discussions over the forthcoming months, we envisage that the consultation will include seeking comments on the body or bodies best suited to take on the range of information functions currently discharged by the HFEA.</p>

<a name="110131w0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_25"></a><a name="11013117000048"></a>Around 80 per cent of the centres currently licensed by the HFEA are either also regulated by the CQC or are in premises the CQC regulates. The streamlining of regulatory functions, with the resulting removal of overlap between the regulatory bodies, is expected to generate savings from the rationalisation of support functions, including human resources, information technology, legal services and communications. In the financial year 2009-10 the HFEA's operational budget was £7.2 million. We envisage savings not only in these costs but also in the cost to the regulated bodies of having to demonstrate compliance with the current regulatory systems. Analysis of this will develop during the consultation process.</p>

The results have been published (<I>Optical Radiation Emissions from Compact Fluorescent Lamps</I> M Khazova and J B O'Hagan, Radiation Protection Dosimetry, 2008, 131(4):521-525; doi:10.1093/rpd/ncn234).

<p><a name="wa_stpa_31"></a><a name="11013117000057"></a>The results did not suggest that the emissions were likely to cause health effects in the general population, although HPA issued precautionary advice because approximately 20 per cent of the open (single envelope) CFLs studied emitted levels of ultraviolet radiation that could result in the guideline levels recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection being exceeded by people exposed within less than 30 centimetres (one foot) of the light bulb. In encapsulated (double envelope) light bulbs, the ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by the outer glass container. This advice is available on the HPA website at: <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/NewsCentre/NationalPressReleases/">www.hpa.org.uk/NewsCentre/NationalPressReleases/</a> 2008PressReleases/081009Emissionsfromcompactfluorescentlights/.</p>

We agree with the assessment by the United Nations office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights that despite its legal framework of protection there remain many human rights challenges. A low awareness of human rights results in only those with sufficient resources being able to access the justice system. Insufficient human and financial resources mean that the police and judicial systems are not always in a position to enforce the rule of law. The police lack the capacity to investigate serious crimes, especially those relating to domestic violence, which is of particular concern.

G7 tax wedge data for high income individuals are not immediately available for 2000 and 2010. However, a limited range of data is published by the OECD in its annual <I>Taxing Wages</I> document (latest edition published May 2010-<a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/19/13/45118806.pdf">http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/19/13/45118806.pdf</a>).</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_124"></a><a name="11013117000192"></a>As of April 2010, the top rate of income tax in the UK is 50 per cent. This rate was introduced by the previous Government, and will remain in place for the time being. However, we believe that high marginal tax rates are not good for the UK and we will continue to look at the yields from different taxes, including the 50 per cent rate, to ensure that they remain an efficient and effective way of raising revenue.</p>

In April 2009, the National Audit Office published a report (<I>HC 297 2008-2009</I>) that carried out an in-depth review of the value for money of UKTI trade services and found that UK Trade and Investment has in place a robust system of assessing delivery and has put in place extensive arrangements to obtain regular and systematic feedback on the quality of its services.</p>
