That is why we are in close discussions with them and why so much work has been done with stakeholders on the proposals in relation to the introduction of the entry-level stewardship scheme in 2010, the final design of which will be announced later this year. The House has huge expertise in farming and in land issues in general, which is of inestimable value to my department. I am well placed to take back those views and concerns. The question of farming and food is of interest to everyone who lives in this nation.

The issue of religious freedom is due to be raised at the EU-India human rights dialogue in New Delhi later this year.</p>

India is the largest recipient of UK bilateral aid, and on 20 January this year the Prime Minister announced that he would invest another &#163;825 million over the next three years. Does the Minister know, however, that the Dalit population has the worst poverty and health figures? How much money will DfID direct to the Dalits and how will it be invested?</p>

While in one sense it is a very successful country, it is also a very poor country. There are more poor people in India living on less than $1 a day than in the whole of sub-Saharan Africa. I do not have figures about the precise proportion that is directed at the Dalits, but all our programmes are directed at poor people. Some

We are helping Dalits and scheduled tribes to be included in and to benefit from India&#146;s progress. That is a key focus in all DfID development work in India.

There are 167 million Dalits in India and immigration to the UK will not play any significant part in relieving their problems. The problems faced by Dalits have to be solved by Indians and by programmes to support them. We work hard in those programmes, supporting the Indian Government. The rules for immigration to this country were well set out by my noble friend yesterday. Programmes to give positive discrimination to a significant proportion of the Dalit community, which the Indian Government have been running since 1950, mean that those who have been so favoured will be equipped as high-value-adding individuals and would qualify for possible immigration to this country.</p>

In seeking to apportion blame to the commander on the ground, the Minister in the other place quite improperly implied that he had a choice of vehicles. So as not to cast any suspicion of doubt on the commander&#146;s word, can the Minister confirm that he had to use Snatch Land Rover on that occasion as there were no other vehicles?

That is not a wise thing for anybody to do, especially when there is always an inquiry into any incident. Ministers provide a wide range of vehicles for deployment in theatre. It is for commanders on the ground to decide which vehicles are suitable for which operations. Ministers have been told more than once by operational commanders that they wish to retain the Snatch vehicle for use in certain circumstances. Indeed, in the Statement made in another place last month, it was pointed out that senior operational commanders consider the Snatch vehicle to be mission-critical.</p>

At this time they need not criticism but support, encouragement, and to be given the right kit for the right job. That is not happening and I ask her perhaps to express a view on it.

I am sure that the Government&#146;s consideration of the Bill arose from the definition of a problem. The problem that they identified was that we were suffering because the national planning process, especially where it concerns major infrastructure, was flawed under the present regime and that we needed to do something about that. Then they thought: can we define that? They answered, yes, it is national infrastructure. Then, I am sure, the thinking went: so what do we need to do something about that problem? They then came up with the Infrastructure Planning Commission. The Bill is written the other way round, so we have the mechanism for dealing with the problem before we have defined the problem. I am bound to say that that is a little unfortunate, but there it is; we have to deal with the Bill as it is.</p>

<a name="81106-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08110633000087"></a>My Amendment No. 1 would make it the purpose of the Infrastructure Planning Commission to advise the Secretary of State on the decisions to be taken on planning applications for national infrastructure problems. This is different from the Bill, which largely makes those decisions the prerogative of the commission. I do not apologise for bringing these amendments back to the House; the arguments that we began to advance in Committee are still vital. I remind the House that, under the existing planning regime, all planning decisions are in effect taken by politicians. At the local-government level, where the vast bulk of planning is done, planning decisions are taken by a committee of the local authority acting as the planning authority, and only the very minor decisions are decided in a delegation process. However, even the delegation process is subject to politicians&#146; approval.</p>

<a name="81106-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08110633000088"></a>The departure from this is when an application is called in either because it is nationally significant or because it is inconsistent with approved plans. Then it goes to the national level and becomes the prerogative of the Secretary of State. That political decision-making may have been criticised for the way in which it has been administered, but in general it has lent great strength to the planning system, and although people

There are flaws in the Bill, not least the fact that that process is now to be eroded because the decisions are to be taken by a planning commission. We really need to ask why there is a need to depart from a well-tried and proven process.</p>

<a name="81106-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08110633000089"></a>In earlier discussions, the Minister has made much of the difficulties caused by the present appeal process. In that instance, she is acting in a quasi-judicial capacity. She must have a thorough and detailed review of absolutely everything to do with the application, which may involve a departure from the planning process. In many cases, it almost certainly involves overriding the views of a local authority. However, that is a very different process from the one that we are now discussing, which is a decision-making process not an appeal process. There is a clear distinction.</p>

<a name="81106-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08110633000090"></a>One of the interesting facets of the Bill is that, in its conclusion, there is no appeal procedure at the end of the process, with the possible exception of judicial review. If I understand matters correctly&#151;I have no doubt that the Minister will tear me to shreds if I am wrong&#151;the judicial review will be relevant really only with regard to process. If the process is correct, there will be no scope for judicial review. The purpose of these amendments and others that we have tabled later in the Bill is not least to try to ensure that the process in the Bill, particularly on decision-making, is so robust that it is not susceptible to the possibility of judicial review. If it is so susceptible, we are likely to lose most of the advantage of expedition, which this Bill is supposed to bring about. That is a very important point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08110633000091"></a>Amendment No. 1, which would bring the decision to the Secretary of State, is reinforced by Amendment No. 101, which would give Parliament the power to review a Secretary of State&#146;s decision. It would be an order-making power, which could be set aside by a negative resolution by either House of Parliament. Bearing in mind particularly that the parliamentary processes would be subject to a timetable to be established in the Bill, if these amendments are agreed, we would have a much more robust process which would secure the new situation against review.</p>

<a name="81106-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08110633000092"></a>I find it really difficult. I understand the views of the CBI and major infrastructure providers that Ministers and MPs should be kept out of the planning process. I have a long and bitter experience of the existing system, which too often has provided prevarication, obfuscation and delay at what I would call the ministerial stage. This is not a particularly political point, because it has been going on for a very long time. But we need to realise that we are not discussing an appeal process, but a decision-making process.</p>

<a name="81106-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08110633000093"></a>I find it humiliating that at the national level we cannot behave and take decisions which are no more than parallel to the decisions we expect members of local authorities to take on a day-to-day basis. We expect them to be efficient and decisive. We criticise them if they do not deal with applications with sufficient speed, which has been a regular problem. It worries me that Ministers in Parliament apparently are not and cannot be trusted to do the same. As politicians at the national level, are we such a different breed that we

It simply is unbelievable to me. When you consider the scale of some decisions that some local authorities are obliged to take in relation to their size and functions, they are at least as significant as any decision that we are requiring to be made by a Secretary of State with the approbation of Parliament. There is no difference in scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08110633000094"></a>While I understand to some degree why the Government have drafted the Bill in this way, it is wrong. The Bill sets out to bring change to the system. There is no disagreement between those of us on this side of the House and those on the Government&#146;s side that the system needs to change. But, if we are going to change the system, we have to realise that Parliament and government cannot stand aside from change. It is part of what is necessary.</p>

We are living through times of change and in an environment, particularly as regards climate change, in which change will become absolutely necessary. Members in both Houses of Parliament will not be immune from the process. I suggest that we begin to think about it quite seriously. Amendment No. 1 and the accompanying amendment would help to bring that process forward. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08110633000097"></a>My amendments are more modest than those of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, but if he chooses to divide the House, we will support him. I propose a system of ratification by the Secretary of State of a decision taken by the Infrastructure Planning Commission. I am prepared to acknowledge that the work that goes into considering representations, the local impact statement, the testing of evidence and so on is a matter for the IPC. In Committee the noble and learned Lord, Lord Boyd of Duncansby, said that individual decisions are,</p>

<p><a name="08110633000633"></a>It did not occur to me at the time whether that might demonstrate a lack of faith in the robustness of decisions taken by Secretary of States hitherto&#151;many decisions over a long period&#151;or indeed in decisions that in the future will be taken by the Secretary of State when they do not go through the IPC. We are not proposing the abolition of the call-in procedure whereby something that would remain a local decision is called in by the Secretary of State. It goes through an inquiry process, but the final decision is taken by the Secretary of

The noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, said that what we proposed&#151;the Secretary of State at the last stage&#151;was,</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000750"></a>&#147;increasingly suspect and anachronistic, as a Minister is subject to political pressure&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/10/08; col. 20.</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000634"></a>But we believe that these big decisions are political in nature.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08110633000098"></a>It was also said that it would be wrong for the Secretary of State to be both judge and jury in the case of a government-sponsored project. As the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, pointed out, those of us who have experience of local decision-making are used to being confronted with a council-sponsored project that has to go through the planning process and where proper planning criteria are applied as well as all the propriety matters. My amendment would not, I believe, amount to reopening these matters. There is a distinction between bringing out the issues going through the whole detail of the process and drawing a conclusion. I believe that it would be both right and possible for the Secretary of State to consider the issues brought out but perhaps come to a different conclusion.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08110633000099"></a>We have heard a great deal about the need to avoid delay&#151;I do not depart from that&#151;but I do not think that requiring the Secretary of State to look at the evidence, consider it with her or his advisers and so on, would amount to the catastrophic delay that is being presented to us. If there is a problem with the Secretary of State being required to take the final decision, how did it come about that the new Secretary of State for Transport was able to publish a decision on the expansion of Stansted Airport six days after his appointment? Perhaps he spent the whole of the six days working on this&#151;I do not know&#151;but it seems unlikely.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08110633000100"></a>I asked a Question about this, framed in less direct language, on 13 October, and I referred to comments made by the Minister. Despite that, the Government did not realise until quite recently that there might be some connection with the Planning Bill and the Question went to the Department for Transport rather than it being connected with CLG. In any event, the Question has not yet been answered. I will be interested if the Minister is able to give an answer today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08110633000101"></a>Amendments Nos. 4 and 106 would provide for the Secretary of State to require the commission to take back and reconsider the whole or any part of its decision. To us, that is less desirable than the more radical approach but the Secretary of State may well think that the IPC should reconsider, for instance, conditions attached to a decision. But, overall, big projects are political matters and we feel that the Secretary of State should be seen to have responsibility for them.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08110633000103"></a>It is reasonable that the Secretary of State and Parliament must be fully concerned with the national policy statements that are drawn up and approved. The Secretary of State designates and is responsible for the national policy statements and must lay them before Parliament. It remains to be settled whether parliamentary approval is to be required&#151;I think it should be&#151;and that is the purpose of Amendment No. 34, to which we shall come later. However, the question which now arises on Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 101 and the others is whether the Infrastructure Policy Commission, working within the national policy statements established by the Secretary of State&#151;and, I hope, approved by Parliament&#151;should now have the power to take the decisions on proposed developments and projects; or should it have only a consultative role, leaving the decision, or at least ratification, to the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08110633000104"></a>There are extensive provisions in the Bill on the pre-application procedures; for example, on the duty to consult the local community and to publicise. There are also detailed provisions on the handling of applications by the commission. I think that we can seriously ask what is to be gained by transferring the role of decision-making to the Secretary of State and reducing the role of the Infrastructure Planning Commission to an advisory role. If we can get right the basic building blocks consisting of the national policy statements and parliamentary approval, we can leave the specific development and project decisions in the hands of the commission. We do not need to add a further stage of submission to the Secretary of State.</p>

I think it is true that the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, has never been an elected representative. I have been, in a number of roles, including vice-chair of a planning committee. All of us in this House and in the other place must be very concerned at the degree of disengagement that the public feel regarding political decisions, and no more so than in planning decisions. We all know how in any community a planning issue of a major development can stir a feeling of frustration and concern which is probably never reflected in any other process in our democracy. But we are talking about a representative democracy, and that is why inserting a ministerial longstop at the very end of the process, as proposed in the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith and my noble friend Lady Hamwee, will be critical in terms of public perception. If it is not there&#151;even if it is very rarely used&#151;that will be interpreted as the bureaucrats having won, which would be extremely dangerous.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08110633000107"></a>In my view, going to the courts is not a proper longstop. I hope that everyone in your Lordships' House agrees that regular recourse to judicial review on these matters is something that we should avoid at all costs. Therefore, it is surely much better that the final court of appeal, as it were&#151;the final check to make sure that the process has been correct&#151;should be a Minister rather than judges, somebody who has been elected.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08110633000108"></a>I hope that the Government will reflect very carefully on what the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and my noble friend Lady Hamwee have said. If we do not put in place that longstop, the public will interpret this change in the law as yet another move away from engagement by the public in the political process. At a time when the United States has come alive again, and people are a great deal more involved and interested in what is going to happen to them in terms of political decision-making, we would be stepping in the opposite and wrong direction.</p>

I have carefully listened to the debates in Committee and have, of course, read <I>Hansard</I>. I have reflected on the arguments through the prism of my 35 years of experience in the planning arena where, for the most part, I was on the receiving end of decisions made on planning applications.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08110633000110"></a>I have become more and more convinced that the Government&#146;s architecture for the new planning approach&#151;separating policy-making from decision-making&#151;is correct. The years of delay inherent in the old system, which have been rehearsed many times in this House, are threefold but interlinked. First, the tangle of policy, which took much time to unravel; secondly, the lengthy processes in use at the inquiry; and, thirdly&#151;and this is the point in question today&#151;the delay involved in a Minister taking a decision following an inspector&#146;s report, which often took as long as the inquiry itself. The Bill seeks to solve all these problems and, I believe, does so satisfactorily.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08110633000111"></a>Let us not forget that all the delay and expense which the old system created have a deterrent effect on developers and funders alike at the very time when so much of our infrastructure is in urgent need of replacement. The amendments would reduce one of the elements of delay by referring back a decision of the IPC to a Secretary of State, with the lorry-loads of material gathered at the hearing going back to be trawled through by officials for a final decision by the Secretary of State. This is in the name, as I understand it, of the principle of democratic accountability. However, in Committee, this argument for accountability was shown to be quite misplaced. A Minister reaching a decision fulfils a quasi-judicial function. He is constrained; he must act independently; he is not open to parliamentary persuasion; he is not a free agent. It is said that the IPC is unaccountable, but, as the Minister pointed out on the first day of the Committee stage, while the commission is unelected, that does not mean that it is

It will operate within statute, within the powers given to it. It will be appointed by a Secretary of State to whom it will report. Senior appointments are subject to pre-appointment scrutiny, and it will make full reports which will be the subject of judicial challenge. Indeed, the independence of the commission, with its body of experts, is a strength, not a weakness, and it will come to be welcomed by the public because it will not be seen to be a rubber stamp and it will not be a judge and jury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08110633000112"></a>The late Lord Denning once said in relation to a Housing Act inquiry that it was infinitely better that the man who heard the evidence and the arguments should decide the case, but that Parliament had decreed otherwise. Here, in this new system, the body which hears the evidence, finds the facts and balances the arguments will be just that, and we should welcome it. I oppose the amendments because they will bring the dangers of additional cost and delay without any corresponding benefit.</p>

It has run through the debates in another place and has figured substantially in debates in this House at every stage of the Bill. I have received, as have, no doubt, many noble Lords, a sheaf of representations on this issue. It will not surprise noble Lords who were perhaps not in the House yesterday that I have received a lot of information and advice from those who are concerned with the energy infrastructure of this country. I have also had evidence from a variety of statutory and voluntary bodies which seek to argue the case that has been argued by my noble friend and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08110633000114"></a>I find the argument slightly difficult. At Second Reading, I made my opinion very clear, which is that the key part of this process is the approval of the national policy statements. In Committee, I moved amendments to require that those statements be approved by both Houses of Parliament. Amendments on this Marshalled List would have the same effect. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, who said at the beginning of his speech that the structure of the Bill is the wrong way round, because the process starts with the national policy statements. When they are approved&#151;howsoever that is done&#151;the planning commission takes possession of the individual applications. We have to consider this the other way round, and it is a difficult process.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08110633000115"></a>However, we will come to the other question later. I was delighted to hear what the noble Lord, Lord Williamson of Horton, said about that.

I am not sure that I would go the whole way with the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, who said that the new Secretary of State for Transport was able to take the decision on increasing the number of flights on the first runway at Stansted in a matter of six days. As Financial Secretary in 1970, I think I approved the expenditure on the Thames Barrier in rather less time than that. But, of course, it had been

I was puzzled as to why my predecessor had not taken the decision and signed the authorisation but, under the rules, as anyone who has served in government will know, my officials were not allowed to discuss that at all. I did not ask them, because I knew that they would not be able to tell me. So the point about the right honourable Geoff Hoon taking a decision in six days is not wholly convincing.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08110633000117"></a>I have occupied the position of Secretary of State for Industry and been, therefore, concerned with industrial developments and related issues. I have been Minister for Energy and concerned with investment; in those days, it was primarily about the North Sea. But I have also held office as the Secretary of State for Environment and been responsible for the planning process. No doubt, in the eyes of applicants or opponents, I was seen to take an astonishingly long time to reach a decision required by the Secretary of State after an appeal on a planning application. So in a sense I have seen both sides of this. I was interested in the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Hart of Chilton, who has much longer experience on this matter than me, on where he saw the balance lie.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08110633000118"></a>I find this an extremely difficult decision, largely because I start from the proposition that I should like to support my Front Bench. When I was a Minister, I liked my Back-Benchers to support me, although they did not always do so and it could sometimes be rather painful. At the same time, I have been mightily impressed by the weight of evidence from those who will be responsible for producing the infrastructure investment which lies at the heart of this Bill. It is in order to accelerate the process of vastly needed investment, not just in energy but in other infrastructure projects, that the whole of the first part of the Bill has been introduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08110633000119"></a>I addressed a conference the day before yesterday, in the City, which happened to be hosted by the City Forum and was headed &#147;Nuclear renaissance&#148;. I was asked to talk from the point of view of the political and planning aspects. I described for that audience on Tuesday the argument between, on the one hand, those who would hope to invest in major infrastructure projects and those responsible for bringing them forward and, on the other hand, a mixture of the environmentalists, who make their views very clear, and the constitutionalists, who feel that somehow this has to be a political decision. I said that on the whole I had the impression that the former group was winning the argument. The noble Lords, Lord Williamson of Horton and Lord Hart of Chilton, reflected what I have come to regard as perhaps the better view. I will not vote against my noble friend&#146;s amendment but, as I have discussed with him at some length over recent weeks, I think that I shall find it difficult to vote with him. I shall probably abstain.</p>

I believe that, if we can achieve the full authority of Parliament behind the national policy statements, it will be perfectly acceptable for the IPC to implement and carry out the will of Parliament. If the NPSs have the full authority of Parliament and the IPC makes its judgment in the light of that authority, Parliament will have spoken, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said in Committee, and the decision will be unchallengeable. However, if the decision were questioned or reversed by a set of civil servants answering for the Minister but at one remove from the detailed analysis of the project, that would be a travesty of democracy and justice and would probably hold up the projects for no good reason; it may even make them challengeable in court.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08110633000122"></a>Why would the Secretary of State come to a different decision, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, suggested? In my view, the Secretary of State would either be taking a decision for reasons of party politics in the constituency concerned or he or she could be ignoring the recognised and overriding local circumstances, which would have been thrashed out in public at an open hearing conducted by the IPC. Thrashing things out in public and having an open decision-making process are not synonymous with the ministerial decision-making process, with which the phrase &#147;behind closed doors&#148; seems to fit more readily. In conclusion, I believe that if we get Clause 9 right, we will not need ministerial involvement in the IPC decisions. I therefore give my full support to the Government on this issue.</p>

I will say a little about the Conservative Party&#146;s policy, the evolution of which I had some involvement with, in a strange way. If the Conservatives were in government, they would strongly resist the amendment, because it strikes at the heart of the Bill. I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, on the national policy statements, which I think should be the start of the process, but I agree with much else of what he said. He is right to be concerned about delays in the process.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08110633000124"></a>The reality is that we have never had in this country a planning system that allows us to promote infrastructure. Britain&#146;s infrastructure lets us down in all sorts of ways. I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, when he says that people are disaffected because of bureaucracy and their inability to intervene in the planning process. I suggest that what frustrates people is their inability to understand why we cannot deliver infrastructure programmes in this country as we used to be able to do in the 19th and early 20th centuries and as Europe does now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08110633000125"></a>I declare an interest, more for reasons of form than for reasons of substance, as a campaign director for Future Heathrow, which not only deals with the expansion of Heathrow but campaigns for the extension of the high-speed line to Heathrow and further north&#151;I made a speech about this in Manchester two years ago. The two should go together. That hinges on one of the most important aspects of the Bill: how we deliver an integrated transport system in the UK.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08110633000126"></a>As I said, the evolution of Conservative policy on this is interesting. In the 1980s, I set up an organisation called the Labour Planning and Environment Group, a group affiliated to the Labour Party and of which I was chairman. We ran a number of successful conferences and invited members of the Conservative Front Bench to speak&#151;although not the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, who might remember those occasions&#151;and they did. The Secretary of State spoke at them because we were drawing together local authorities and business to address problems.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08110633000127"></a>We never dealt with the infrastructure problems. They were not part of the discussion then, which focused on things such as out-of-town shopping centres. However, there was recognition by all of us, almost across the political spectrum, that the infrastructure planning process in Britain was seriously flawed. We all know the importance of infrastructure&#151;roads, railways, airports, sewers, water, the lot&#151;but the most important part of delivering it is the planning process. If you get that wrong, an awful lot of other things go wrong as well, which is what has happened.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08110633000128"></a>I do not want to speak for long, so I conclude with a&#151;slightly long&#151;example. When the high-speed rail line opened in 2007 between the Kent coast and Paddington it had been about nine years in construction, while the French high-speed line had already been open and running for 10 years. Why? Was it because the British are not capable of building it fast? Was it because we did not have the money? Was it because of the urban density of the south-east? There is an element of truth in that; the density of the south-east corner of the UK is a problem. But urban density is a problem in Belgium and Holland, too, but they have a high-speed line. The financing is different here from France, and the French were better at getting that through.</p>

<a name="81106-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08110633000129"></a>However, a major cause of the delay was planning. People were travelling around Europe at 180 miles per hour, then coming through the tunnel and slowing down to about 80 miles per hour&#151;in the country that had invented the train, started the industrial revolution and achieved all the scientific progress that enabled that revolution to take place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08110633000130"></a>The construction of the high-speed lines in Europe and Britain should warn Members to think twice before voting for the amendment. If you take away the independence of the infrastructure committee and place it within a political process, certain things will happen; the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, will know this as well as I do. If I am invited, as a local resident or politician, to object to something that local people say that they do not want, I will use every weapon in my arsenal to slow it down. That has happened for years, which is why we need a system in which we accept that

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08110633000131"></a>I beg those who are thinking of voting for the amendment&#151;particularly the Liberal Democrats, but also the Conservatives&#151;to go into the Library before they vote and ask for maps of transport infrastructure in the European Union countries. There is heading after heading: France, Italy, the Benelux countries and all the others, and the links between road, rail and air. That is integrated transport, to which we all pay lip service in this country but do not deliver. Looking at the maps, you get to the Channel and see one little link to London, with talk in just one section of a proposed west coast line.</p>

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08110633000132"></a>Britain is left out of it. The noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, signed the single market treaty and believed in it very strongly. Whether you are pro-Europe or anti-Europe, if you are part of a single market, the last thing you want to do is design an infrastructure that excludes you from it. We are doing that, and it is a serious issue.</p>

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08110633000133"></a>Noble Lords who vote for this amendment will strike at the heart of the independent process. If it is accepted, we will lurch right back into the situation, which we all agree we want to get away from, of constant delays to infrastructure projects which are necessary for the United Kingdom&#146;s economic development. It does not help anyone if we lead people to believe that they can slow something down and stop change happening. Of course, people often object to change and of course it causes problems when it takes place, but you deal with that by addressing the problems caused for people; you do not just accept that slowing it down is a good thing.</p>

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08110633000134"></a>My final warning is that if anybody thinks that either the objectors or the developer got any satisfaction at all from the planning process on terminal 5, they should forget it. It upset just about everyone. The one good thing that came out of the terminal 5 inquiry was that it made many people, myself included, go away and look at what was happening with regard to airports in continental Europe and ask why Heathrow was going downhill so fast. That was the only good thing about it. Everybody came out dissatisfied. It did us no good at all. I ask noble Lords please not to support the amendment. I ask noble Lords on the Conservative Front Bench, in view of their own history on this matter, not to push the amendment to a vote, and if they do push it to a vote, to look first at the maps of Europe and ask themselves whether they want Britain to end up as an offshore island that is cut off from the incredibly dynamic European economy, and with an infrastructure system of which we, as the first industrial power, ought to be slightly ashamed.</p>

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08110633000138"></a>I have a fairly straightforward question for the Minister. If the IPC&#146;s decision is wayward, or is, in the Minister&#146;s view, unacceptable, or if circumstances change fundamentally after it has given its decision, can the Secretary of State intervene either to quash the decision or to challenge it in a court? What powers does the Secretary of State have in those circumstances? I support the system of national policy statements. It is a sound system and Parliament should have a crucial role in it. I also support the thrust of the amendments in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and my noble friend Lady Hamwee. As the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, so succinctly said, the Secretary of State does not consider these matters lightly. Teams of officials work on inspectors&#146; reports. One should get a valid, properly scrutinised and well considered decision from a Secretary of State. These major projects are deeply political and the buck should stop with the elected Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08110633000140"></a>I am concerned about the apparent elevated status that ministerial involvement in this process seems to be accorded. Under the present planning system I cannot imagine even a Government whom I support, confronted with an unpleasant decision 18 to 20 months away from a general election, grasping that nettle and courting unpopularity in their constituencies. Frankly, in the unlikely event of the Liberals ever securing a place in government, I imagine that, faced with such a choice, they would do the honourable thing and resign, because their ability to grasp nettles of any kind is virtually unknown.</p>

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08110633000141"></a>I therefore draw an analogy in this instance with the MPC, a body set up with the express purpose of denying ministerial political involvement by the Treasury in virtually every circumstance in the determination of interest rates. I offer the House the information that the interest rate has today been cut by 1.5 per cent, a cut of such magnitude that no politician would ever have had the guts to make it. Even with the respect that I have for Alistair Darling, a friend of many years&#146; standing, I do not think that any politician would have taken a chance like that. I do not think that the IPC is about taking chances, but it is about

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08110633000142"></a>Frankly, in my 40 years and more of political involvement, the degree of courage shown across the political spectrum has not been of an order to indicate that political accountability would enable people to make that kind of decision. It is near hypocritical for people to tell us that Ministers like taking unpopular decisions and that they will go boldly on and take the consequences. They do not do that. They certainly do not do it in council groups where, as I understand it, there is no political involvement in the planning committee and there is no attempt by Whips to interfere, or so I am told. Certainly, no one would ever put anything on paper&#151;conversations never took place and meetings were never held. We know that these things happen and that little councils sometimes come to decisions for daft reasons, in the almost certain knowledge that the applicants do not have the resources to appeal. Where the applicants do have the resources to appeal, they appeal and appeal and appeal, and the infrastructure gets into a dreadful state. We are not able to sustain the kind of economy or the kind of environment that is becoming ever more important in these sorts of debates.</p>

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08110633000143"></a>There is a large dose of hypocrisy in what is being said today.

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08110633000145"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, quoted my intervention in Committee, and it may be said, as someone who has just been acting as counsel in a planning inquiry in Scotland, and having just received a positive response from Ministers to my client&#146;s application, that it ill behoves me to take issue with the involvement of Ministers. However, I do so, and I do so in this context. The architecture of the Bill is to set up a new procedure to deal with large infrastructure projects. As I see it, the national policy statements are at the core of that. To that extent, I agree with those noble Lords who have suggested that we have got the Bill the wrong way round; not that it matters at the end of the day, but the key issue is the national policy statements, which will set out the strategic direction for the construction of infrastructure in our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08110633000146"></a>Against that, the role of the IPC is critical and crucial. It will take decisions in an independent and quasi-judicial manner. Independence is at the core of the role of the Infrastructure Planning Commission. It is absolutely critical. To that extent, the amendments that have been tabled are almost wrecking conditions, because of the way in which they would go to the heart of the operation of the Infrastructure Planning Commission.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_342"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 342</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08110633000147"></a>I draw noble Lords&#146; attention to Clause 102(3), which sets out the role of the commission in taking these decisions. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08110633000679"></a>&#147;The Panel or Council must decide the application in accordance with any relevant national policy statement, except to the extent that one or more of the following subsections applies&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000635"></a>That is absolutely clear. The national policy statements, which have gone through the procedure set out in the Bill, subject to whatever parliamentary procedure is finally agreed, are the determining factor. One of the key subsections is Clause 102(7):</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000751"></a>&#147;the adverse impact of the proposed development would outweigh its benefits&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000636"></a>I suggest that that will be at the core of much of the IPC&#146;s consideration. The IPC will have before it the national policy statement, which may very well support the application that it is considering; but the adverse impacts of the development on the locality are the key consideration.</p>

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08110633000148"></a>I suggest that the body that is most able and which ought to take that decision is that which is charged with receiving all the evidence and, to the extent it is necessary, testing it. That is the IPC. To have, otherwise, the intervention of a Minister goes to the heart of the independent and quasi-judicial nature of the IPC. The amendments, particularly those from the Liberal Democrat Benches, suggest that the decision, once the IPC has taken it, would be subject to ratification by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State&#146;s alternative, as I understand it, is to remit the decision back to the IPC.</p>

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08110633000149"></a>On what grounds would the Secretary of State undertake that function? It would only happen if the Secretary of State felt for some reason that he had got it wrong. If I were on the IPC I would send it straight back because to countenance a remit on that basis would go to the heart of the independence and the quasi-judicial nature of the function that I as a member of the IPC had been charged to fulfil.</p>

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08110633000150"></a>With the greatest respect to those who tabled the amendment, it is a dangerous proposition for the House to contemplate. It is also dangerous for the Secretary of State. Let us imagine that the IPC has taken a decision in accordance with the NPS, to the effect that there are adverse impacts from the development but those adverse impacts do not in its judgment outweigh the benefits of the development; so it makes a judgment in favour of the applicant. In some communities, particularly the more middle-class and vociferous communities, there might very well be a vociferous campaign to try to overturn the decision. That would come, for example, through questions to Ministers and newspaper campaigns, as pressure increased on the Secretary of State to remit the decision back to the IPC. That goes to the heart of the constitutional arrangements that the Bill sets out&#151;that there should be a clear division between the strategic direction which the IPC is implementing, and the independent, quasi-judicial decision on the individual applications.</p>

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08110633000151"></a>I wish to raise two final matters. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, suggested that one needed a long stop&#151;the Secretary of State, not the courts. In fact, the courts are always a long stop. They are the long stop now and they are the long stop in the Planning Bill, because we

The courts will always have a function. I, too, am concerned at the delay that may very well be occasioned by remitting back or involving the Secretary of State in any way. I echo what has been said by other noble Lords, and recall the words of a chief executive of one of our major utilities companies, who told me that in his opinion this was the most important Bill that Parliament had considered in the past 50 years, because it was critical to achieving security of energy supply and meeting the challenges of climate change. After recently debating climate change and energy matters, we should keep these issues at the forefront and defeat these amendments.</p>

Perhaps I may take up two points that may not have had as much exposure as they could have. The first relates to the views of all those trying to carry out infrastructure who have written to many of us and made their views well known. They include the CBI, the British Chambers of Commerce, the transport industry, the UK Business Council for Sustainable Energy, the British Wind Energy Association and the Renewable Energy Association. The list goes on. These are the organisations that we are expecting to produce energy-saving measures, let alone to maintain supplies of gas and electricity and build the infrastructure to create the new transport links. These are the organisations that are asking us to get on with the job and not proceed with an amendment that they believe would&#151;if the Secretary of State were to take his responsibilities seriously&#151;create delay. It would slow things down, which would mean waits of more months. The Secretary of State could intervene but then be distracted by other matters. Not only would there be delay; there would be the uncertainty that came from not knowing on what basis the Secretary of State was coming in possibly to exercise a different judgment from that of the independent experts. One would expect noble Lords on these Benches to believe that independent expertise had merit in its own right. We on these Benches do not inherently believe that politicians will always exercise superior wisdom over and above the views of the experts in these circumstances.</p>

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08110633000153"></a>I have been subject to local pressures. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, has cited a parallel example involving local councillors who have to stand up to an awful lot of pressure at the local level. In trying to achieve affordable housing schemes, I have had the letters through the post box, anonymous phone calls made to my wife in the day, the local protests making themselves known in the very unpleasant ways that they do, let alone the formal representations from national lobby groups and the rest. I know how councillors feel. When a project is unpopular it requires great powers of leadership at the local level to stand up to these pressures and say yes. It is very difficult for politicians. If my affordable housing schemes can cause so much hostility and resentment, how much greater will it be if we are considering large-scale national infrastructure projects? A nuclear power station will multiply by 100 the pressure on politicians. I suspect that if we take the Secretary of State and frontline politicians out of the equation and allow the independent,

On 1 January 1983, the Treasury Solicitor rang my brother, shortly after he became a Silk, to say that the Secretary of State for Energy, my noble friend Lord Lawson of Blaby, had decided to brief counsel to the inquiry and to ask my brother if he would undertake that role. Two-and-a-half years later, I was in the British Embassy in Tokyo and coincided with the late, great Walter Marshall, whose accent a number of noble Lords will have in their minds&#146; ear. He kindly said that although the quality and quantity of the questions which my brother had asked had greatly prolonged the inquiry, which at that stage had been running for two-and-a-half years, he was satisfied that those on the technology and the hazards absolutely needed to be asked. He said that provided the questions were asked only rarely and there was confidence that they would not have to be repeated, he, at the receiving end, was happy for them to be asked.</p>

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08110633000155"></a>I understand the pressure of the questions that have been brought to us and I can understand them more readily, because of the Sizewell B case. At about the same time, I attended a public seminar conducted by the noble Lord, Lord Flowers, on the transportation of irradiated fuel. That was not strictly a planning matter but it was an analogous situation. He said that he was totally satisfied with the safety of the urban transportation of irradiated fuel. I was the only Member of Parliament to attend, but I was an urban MP. However, he realised that there would be very grave public apprehension about that process and that, therefore, it was important that by one means or another, the public should be satisfied that the right decisions were being taken.</p>

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08110633000156"></a>What we are contemplating in the Bill would confer a major responsibility on the IPC to explain and justify its decisions on a host of matters to the general public and to the specific public, in the context of specific applications. It would be welcome if the Minister said a little about the discharge of that responsibility on the part of the IPC. In the mean time, I am minded to follow my noble friend.</p>

That seems to be a wide proposition. I do not express any view about the desirability of applying that doctrine in this case, but it seems to be a doctrine of very general application which would have a great effect on the machinery of government in our country.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Williamson of Horton, started by saying that this is the fundamental clause, and indeed it expresses the fundamental purpose of the Bill. Therefore, I am grateful that we have had such a serious, thoughtful and expert debate on this group of amendments.</p>

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08110633000159"></a>I do not want to repeat the arguments that I set out at length in Committee; they have been well rehearsed this morning. However, I believe that the weight of the argument has been with the Government. Despite my best efforts&#151;and I shall continue to try to persuade the opposition Front Bench&#151;the amendments still seem to suggest that an independent body making final planning decisions is a step too far because Ministers should be seen to be, and indeed be, politically accountable, and that the Secretary of State can and should continue to have a residual role at the end of the planning process.</p>

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08110633000160"></a>I find it slightly odd that noble Lords opposite accept the scale of the challenges that we face, together with the logic of the NPS and what it is designed to achieve, but that they are still reluctant to follow that logic when it comes to the role of an independent Infrastructure Planning Commission, which will bring greater certainty, transparency, expertise and efficiency to the final planning processes.</p>

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08110633000161"></a>The question before us&#151;it was posed by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, in Committee, and I shall return to it because it is the right question&#151;is: where does accountability more properly and effectively lie in the new system set up in the Bill? What are we trying to achieve through the changes in the Bill, and how can that best be secured in the new processes that we have put forward and amended since Committee?</p>

<a name="81106-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08110633000162"></a>The case that I want to reinforce this morning&#151;it has already been made by many of my noble friends and by noble Lords across the House&#151;is not simply that the Bill provides for a stronger and more certain response to the formidable challenges that we face in terms of energy and climate security, but that the process that we have put in place brings greater accountability and divisibility within the political process and in terms of ministerial responsibility. It also provides a process which will allow for the community to exert greater influence&#151;I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, on this&#151;at different key stages, and, as my noble friend Lord Howarth said, for decisions to be taken by those who have heard and weighed up the evidence and are able to balance national need and local impact, and are as free to reject an application for development consent as they are to accept it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08110633000163"></a>A great deal unites us across the House, despite our different conclusions on the place and role of Ministers. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, agrees that we need to change the system, and few would dispute that or dispute the definition of failure&#151;which is where he started his argument today&#151;or the scale of failure. It has been documented by the Eddington and Barker reports, and by the weight of evidence that has been brought to your Lordships&#146; attention and attested to this morning. In simple terms, that evidence means  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_346"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 346</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that, when it comes to major infrastructure projects, our planning system is so slow, so uncertain and so unclear that most applications are begun &#147;at risk&#148; by promoters. The deterrent effect is the default mechanism. We have heard evidence of the costs of failure. The ports industry has put a price tag of &#163;45 million on the Dibden Bay application process.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08110633000164"></a>The wider costs are borne by the community, which lives with uncertainty and blight for many years. Ultimately, if we fail to build the power stations, reservoirs and roads&#151;the things that we need for our survival&#151;we will all pay a far higher cost. The problems are becoming more urgent. There is no exaggeration in the statement that the great challenge to our generation is to provide energy and climate security together in a way that promotes and guarantees economic and social sustainability.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08110633000165"></a>Those are common challenges for every country, which is one reason why this is such a competitive situation when we are looking for investment. However, we have specific problems in this country. We are the first industrial nation; we have a growing and ageing population, which we need to house; we need to provide transport; and we need to meet energy needs. Much of our infrastructure requires urgent replacement now, and it needs to be done sustainably. At the same time, we need to grow a competitive, knowledge-led and energy-dependent economy. That would be a big enough challenge but doing so in the face of a need to move towards an 80 per cent cut in carbon emissions by 2050 to avert catastrophic climate change means a tenfold increase in renewable generation over the next 12 years. To secure a new supply, the best modelling that we have suggests that between 10 and 20 new power stations and around a dozen major gas storage facilities will be needed by 2020.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08110633000166"></a>The point about competitiveness comes in when you look at the scale of all this. Let us take Shellhaven Port as an example. It is phenomenally expensive, involving a &#163;1.5 billion investment, and it will bring with it the largest logistics centre in Europe. It will generate 12,000 jobs and bring huge regeneration benefits for the Thames Gateway. That is the sort of investment that we need.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08110633000167"></a>To achieve that, we need a predictable, clear planning system, which we do not have but other countries do. It is to other countries that the investment and skills will go unless we get this right in the Bill now. They will attract the skills to modernise their infrastructure because their planning systems are more certain&#151;whether you are talking about Australia, Germany or North America&#151;more welcoming and more liable to manage risk. Why should anyone commit to building our new power stations or ports when what we offer is a process where nothing&#151;timetables, processes, outcomes or decisions&#151;is certain, where national policy is debated and disputed on the floor of the planning inquiry at the final stage, where local interests and impacts are often overlooked, and when countless separate consents are needed.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08110633000168"></a>Therefore, we are putting forward a planning regime for major energy, transport, waste and water infrastructure that addresses those things. Thresholds are set out in the Bill for each sector to capture only those projects  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_347"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 347</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which can genuinely be described as nationally significant&#151;about 45 each year. That is why I do not take the parallel with the local planning decision that noble Lords have been making. The Bill replaces the eight current consent regimes for major infrastructure with a single consent regime. There are three stages in this regime and they are all interdependent.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08110633000169"></a>The first stage in an entirely new process is indeed the national policy statements, which will set out the Government&#146;s overall objectives for infrastructure development, including in relation to need. In some cases, as we have debated, these may specify locations as being potentially suitable for development; in others, they will need to specify criteria against which the suitability of locations can be assessed. In all cases, national policy statements will be subject to mandatory consultation, appraisal of sustainability and an entirely new form of parliamentary scrutiny. The noble Lord, Lord Burnett, referred to the failure of the process in relation to Heathrow&#151;not least because we had no national policy statement.</p>

<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="08110633000170"></a><a name="81106-0005.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81106-0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08110633001322"></a>Lord Burnett:</b> My Lords, I am very grateful to the Minister for giving way. I think there is consensus around the House that there is a very powerful case for these national policy statements. The Minister makes a very powerful argument. She has talked about the planning system being uncertain and expensive and about the fact that we need a predictable planning system. I am moved to ask her whether the Government will alter, or try to streamline, the remaining elements of the planning system which are also unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="08110633000171"></a><a name="81106-0005.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="81106-0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08110633001323"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> My Lords, I can answer that. At the moment, we have an end-to-end review&#151;the Killian/Pretty review&#151;which is looking at just the sort of problem that the noble Lord and I both know exists.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08110633000172"></a>The second stage is about project development. The Bill requires applicants to consult those whose land interests may be affected, the local community, the local authority and statutory consultees. This, again, is a new process of pre-application.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08110633000173"></a>The final stage is consideration by the Infrastructure Planning Commission. Complex projects will be considered by a panel of expert commissioners, with less complex cases being considered by single commissioners. The time limits will be very important. There is a statutory six-month limit for inquiries and a further three months for a decision, both measured from the point at which the inquiry begins. Decisions will be made by the commission, taking into account the national policy statement, the local impacts report from relevant local authorities and any other matters which the commission considers important and relevant. That is the framework in which we are having this discussion on accountability.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08110633000174"></a>The charge here is that, by giving decision-making to an unelected body, the proposals undermine the accountability of such decisions to the public. The argument, which we heard again on Report, is that this in turn is unacceptable because of the significance of these decisions.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08110633000175"></a>I should like to make three arguments. The first&#151;I could not agree more with the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee&#151;is that we fully recognise that the decisions  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_348"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 348</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on power stations, airports and major roads are indeed big political matters. They involve important questions of the balance of the public interest, the national economy and sustainability. Because we believe that so deeply, the essential change that we are making in the Bill is not to remove the Minister, not to reduce responsibility and certainly not to humiliate the Minister, as the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, suggested, but to reposition the Minister, the Government and that responsibility in a way that makes the process visible and actually enhances it.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08110633000176"></a>I am grateful to my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill for a very powerful speech, which drew out some rather uncomfortable home truths. For the first time, Ministers will have to set a clear policy framework for our key elements of infrastructure. They will have to make their case for their policy through public consultation; they will have to set out clearly how sustainability is achieved and where the balance of public interest lies; and they will have to consult and go through parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08110633000177"></a>I believe that the questions raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, are fully answered. Who takes the decision? The Secretary of State takes the decision. Who do the people believe takes the decision? The people will see that the Secretary of State takes the decision in the national policy statement. Who should take the decision? The Secretary of State should do so. Ministerial accountability will be tested in parliamentary scrutiny. That is strengthened by our own amendment that the Government will need to respond to the views of committees of either House. So let us be clear: Ministers will be visible and at the front of the process rather than at the back end where the Minister takes a decision within the privacy of the private office.</p>
<a name="time_9"></a>
<a name="81106-0005.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="08110633000785"></a>1 pm</h5>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08110633000178"></a>My second argument has already been dealt with by my noble friend Lord Hart. He pointed out that because the commission is unelected does not mean that it is unaccountable. I offer two instances. First, it will be appointed by, and need to report on its performance to, the Secretary of State; and, secondly, it will have to give full reasons for its decisions.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08110633000179"></a>The third and the most important argument is that this regime will provide much clearer and more transparent decision-making than the current system. I believe that noble Lords have challenged and demolished the misconceptions about the nature of ministerial decision-making. It is often asserted that these decisions are essentially political acts. This morning, those arguments have been exposed as fragile by planning lawyers and Ministers with years of experience. I agree with the very frank appreciation of the process of decision-making by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, who has so much experience in this area.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08110633000180"></a>Ministers who take planning decisions do so in a quasi-judicial fashion. They cannot be lobbied, or take into account representations received outside the prescribed procedures, and they cannot be challenged in Parliament. But as long as the roles of policy making and decision-taking are so entangled, as they are, there will be an understandable confusion and an obscuration of where decisions are taken.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_349"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 349</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81106-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08110633000181"></a>Under the regime in the Planning Bill, the process will be much clearer. The boundary between policy and planning will be clear and explicit. The current situation where the Secretary of State may in some instances set the policy, promote a scheme and then decide whether it should go ahead, effectively acting as judge, jury and defence counsel, will no longer apply. The basis on which decisions are to be taken will be absolutely clear and fair. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, that the commission will determine applications in accordance with the law. It will not take daft decisions. This is a process of such rigour&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="08110633000182"></a><a name="81106-0005.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="81106-0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08110633001324"></a>Lord Burnett:</b> My Lords&#151;</p>

While, of course, it will need to consider important and relevant evidence and to reject projects where the costs outweigh the benefits, it will have no discretion to apply a different policy other than that set out in the national policy statement.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08110633000184"></a>We are satisfied that the regime proposed in which Ministers are held clearly accountable for overarching policy, and in which individual decisions taken independently within this framework can be challenged in the courts as now, is fully accountable, clearer and more certain than the current system.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08110633000185"></a>I turn to the amendments. If the IPC were only an advisory or recommending body, as the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, would have, much of the logic and the advantage of having ministerial accountability set out in the NPS would be lost; and the speed, efficiency and clarity of a single process would be lost. The incentive for Ministers to produce rigorous NPSs would be greatly diminished and there would be an inevitable tendency to use the decision process to tinker with policy. All that would significantly and unnecessarily increase the risk of challenges and uncertainty. Under our proposals, there would be a clear opportunity to challenge proposals after the IPC decision. The approach recommended by the parties opposite would mean that there would potentially be sequential challenges. That would create more uncertainty. People have said to us, loud and clear, that they do not want that.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08110633000186"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 1 and 101, and to new Clause 101. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, to Clause 101 would require that any decision taken by the Secretary of State be subject to annulment pursuant to a resolution of either House of Parliament, which would exasperate the situation further, adding another layer of delay and uncertainty as everyone waits to see whether Parliament would intervene and annul the decision of the Secretary of State. That would be yet more uncertainty.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08110633000187"></a>On Amendments Nos. 2, 4 and 106, I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has struggled &#147;womanfully&#148; to address the problem about which she feels strongly. As my noble and learned friend Lord Boyd made perfectly clear whether one is talking about recommendation, ratification or reconsideration, one cannot invent a spurious process which simply  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_350"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 350</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>requires the Minister, in all integrity, to rubber-stamp a decision. The Minister would have to revisit the evidence.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08110633000188"></a>A question was raised about why the Secretary of State was able to take a decision in six days on Stansted. I think that rather makes our case. The inspector reported in January; the department considered the evidence extremely carefully over the course of several months; and we had to refer back to the inspector on two occasions to obtain further detail. Ministers were involved throughout the whole process, but it took months to come to a decision. In the end, this is precisely why we believe that those who examine the evidence are the right people to take the decision.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08110633000189"></a>With regret, I cannot accept the amendments. I am sure that the noble Baroness is also aware that her amendments would render the commission inoperable because it would require that all decisions taken under it, including matters such as whether to accept an application or how to examine it, would be subject to ratification.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08110633000190"></a>Before I conclude, I want to make a further brief set of comments. We brought back to this House a number of amendments which I believe address the second of the questions which started my personal debate with the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, on this Bill: we need to be assured that this is a workable process. The job of this House is to ensure that whatever we bring forward will work. We have brought forward a number of amendments which not only strengthen the workability of the process and improve it, but also strengthen accountability. We have strengthened the role of this House by putting an explicit reference in the Bill to its role in scrutinising national policy statements. We have strengthened its sustainability duty. We have given high quality design greater prominence. We have strengthened the role of planning authorities by putting national parks authorities on the face of the Bill. We have clarified the considerations that the Secretary of State should take into account when deciding when to review national policy statements. We have made it absolutely explicit in Clause 12 that all national policy statements should meet the tests set out in the Bill for consultation, scrutiny and appraisal of sustainability. We have given the IPC new powers to appoint legal advisers in the examination of applications and clarified when the examining authority should invite participants to cross-examine witnesses.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08110633000191"></a>The Bill is better and stronger as regards democracy and accountability. All that will add to a process which we have tried very hard to ensure is speedier, clearer, more certain and more transparent. That will ensure that the independence of the IPC is not achieved at the expense of confusion or compromise, and that ministerial accountability is in the right place and will be strong enough for parties opposite to have every confidence in it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08110633000193"></a>Forty years ago&#151;heaven help me when I think of that number&#151;somebody introduced public consultation into the planning system. The planning process has been going downhill ever since. I accept that we are where we are and the position is not satisfactory. The body of objections that we have heard from most Members opposite were unquestionably right in their criticism of the existing system. That is fair enough. The existing system is wrong, but we are not discussing the existing system; we are discussing the Bill. Our amendment would not prolong the existing system. Most people seem to have forgotten Clause 105, which time limits the Secretary of State&#146;s decision. If the national policy statements are appropriately and correctly approved, if the commission, as I would expect it to, properly and equitably follows the processes to its, in our case, recommendation, and in the Government&#146;s case, decision, the efficiency of the system will work perfectly satisfactorily, if&#151;and I admit this is an &#147;if&#148;&#151;we as politicians can behave responsibly and act with sufficient expedition. I entirely acknowledge that under the existing system that has not happened for a host of not good reasons. I find it very sad that the Opposition&#151;sorry, the Government&#151;appear to be rather nihilist in this matter. The time may come when that remark of mine is entirely appropriate, except that I may be sitting over there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08110633000194"></a>My noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern got it right when he said of the remarks made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Boyd of Duncansby, and, effectively, so many other noble Lords on that side of the House, that if the reality is that politicians are not to be trusted with executive decisions, we need to start thinking very seriously because they should not take any executive decisions. If that is the conclusion that we are to draw from this debate, that is why I am depressed and saddened by what I have heard today. This is a significant matter. I have more faith and confidence in the future and in the politicians who we will have in the future. I am not being party political when I say that; I think that we will find that we will change in nature and become more positive.</p>

<a name="81106-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08110633000195"></a>I do not accept&#151;although I have to acknowledge that it is more expeditious&#151;that the continentals have some great advantage in this. If one goes to the continent, there are a great many things that still need to be done. If one asks whether the French system is satisfactory from the point of view of the general populous, the general populous accepts what is done, but on the whole is not very satisfied with it because it has very little input. That may be a wonderful model for a Government, but it is not in keeping with our traditions in this country.</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08110633000204"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the orders arise from two different effects of the 2006 Act on the barring of unsuitable persons from work with vulnerable groups. First, the Act requires us to go through a transition from barring decisions taken under the current schemes by the Secretaries of State, as happens now, to barring decisions under the new vetting and barring scheme, which is to go live in October 2009. The barring decisions under the new scheme will be taken by the new Independent Safeguarding Authority or ISA, referred to in the legislation as the Independent Barring Board. Secondly, the Act was passed in 2006, before amendments to the current List 99 scheme in 2007 which expanded List 99 coverage to foreign offences, so we want to update the Act to catch up with the expansion of the List 99 scheme.</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08110633000205"></a>I thank both the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and the Merits Committee for carefully considering the orders. As noble Lords will be aware, neither committee found anything to comment on in the orders, but the Merits Committee reported the orders because it felt that they were of interest, and published brief supplementary information provided by my officials.</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08110633000206"></a>I have published an information note for noble Lords to support the debate, which explains in detail how we wish to make use of the functions created by the foreign offences order in future proposed regulations on automatic barring. I will not repeat the detail from that note about the automatic barring regulations as the regulations will be affirmative and we will have the opportunity to debate them in their own right. I will, however, outline the main reasons for the orders.</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08110633000207"></a>First, we propose to handle the transition by undertaking it in stages. The transitory provisions order requires Ministers to stop taking barring decisions on new referrals under the current schemes. Instead, it requires the ISA to take the barring decisions on those referrals under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act. Ministers will decide on the remaining tail of existing referrals. Bodies such as employers, who have a duty under the current legislation to make a referral&#151;for example, where they dismiss an employee because of a risk of harm to children&#151;will generally have to make new referrals directly to the ISA. The exception is that  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_355"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 355</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>referrals under List 99 legislation in Wales will still have to be made to Welsh Ministers, who will pass them on to the ISA.</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08110633000208"></a>We aim to bring the transitory provisions order into force by 19 January 2009, a very important date. The ISA will start to take decisions from the date on which the order comes into force, subject to parliamentary approval not only of these orders but of the regulations on which offences will lead to an automatic bar. We aim to lay those regulations promptly if Parliament approves the foreign offences order.</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08110633000209"></a>The main benefit of starting ISA decision-making before the vetting and barring scheme goes live is that it helps us to manage the transition more smoothly. All individuals placed by Ministers on current barred lists will be referred to the ISA. The ISA will then include them, or consider including them, in its barred lists under an order made by Ministers in the spring. By moving decision-making to the ISA from January 2009, we will reduce the number of individuals whom first the Secretary of State and then the ISA must decide whether to bar. Instead, the ISA will take a single decision straightaway. This is the most streamlined and efficient approach. It will also minimise any period, after the new scheme goes live, when current arrangements will need to be preserved while the Secretary of State completes the decisions on the tail of cases that are for him to decide and the ISA migrates those cases to the new barred lists. If I dare, I shall say a little more on this in a moment.</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08110633000210"></a>Secondly, the foreign offences order enables the 2006 Act to catch up with an improvement that was made in 2007 to the List 99 regulations, to which I have already referred. This provided for an automatic bar in the case of a person convicted of a specified foreign offence. We want to have this power under the 2006 Act as well to increase protection for vulnerable groups and to honour our commitment that statutory safeguards under the Act are not less than those under current schemes, including List 99.</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08110633000211"></a>The information note, which we have circulated, sets out how we intend to use that power. It contains a list of offences and the circumstances of commission. We propose that when the ISA is informed of an individual being convicted or cautioned for any of those offences in those circumstances, or convicted of an overseas equivalent offence, the ISA must automatically bar that individual.</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08110633000212"></a>I will say a little more about the transitory provisions order and our reasons for proposing to tackle this stage of transition in this manner. My right honourable friend Ruth Kelly made a commitment to Parliament in January 2006 to put decision-making in the hands of experts who are independent of government. Having the ISA take over decision-making on new referrals at this stage is the earliest possible fulfilment of a major part of that commitment. It also supports the ISA in preparing in a stable and thorough way for the launch of the new scheme, which is scheduled for October 2009. Reducing the number of decisions to bar individuals which the Secretary of State must take&#151;individuals whom the ISA would then have to consider for inclusion on its barred lists&#151;helps the ISA to complete a significant share of those transition cases before the go-live date.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_356"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 356</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81106-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08110633000213"></a>This makes things a bit simpler for the employer and the barred person, because they will have dealings with just one body, the ISA. For employers, the order makes hardly any change to current arrangements. In particular, employers must continue to make referrals in the same circumstances in which they make them now under current schemes. I will highlight one or two of those changes. With the exception of List 99 cases in Wales, employers will have to send new referrals directly to the ISA. Where the Secretary of State now asks for information held by employers, regulators and similar bodies, they will have a statutory duty to provide that information to the ISA. We will make a commencement order to bring relevant sections of the Act into force, and will lay regulations in a few weeks time to prescribe the information that these bodies will have to provide on request.</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08110633000214"></a>The automatic barring of individuals who have been newly convicted or cautioned for more serious offences, which happens now under List 99, will be extended to all the workforces from which persons are barred by current schemes. The offences are listed in the information note. Just as the Secretary of State now writes to persons whom he has barred or intends to bar, the ISA will write to persons whom it proposes to bar, or has automatically barred, informing them of their rights to make representations. If the bar is confirmed following representations, the ISA will write to them informing them of their right to seek leave to appeal, except for the most serious offences where those rights do not apply, and their right to seek permission for a review of the bar after a set period. The ISA will inform them that, before the new scheme goes live, the bar covers the same workforces as a bar by the Secretary of State under the current schemes; and that, after the new scheme goes lives, the bar will cover the wider range of workforces specified by the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act, of which noble Lords are well aware.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08110633000215"></a>Nothing can be more vital than safeguarding children and vulnerable adults from those who pose a serious risk of harm.

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08110633000218"></a>I thank the Minister for explaining why these orders are being implemented and what they aim to achieve. She explained that, to help the transition, it is necessary&#151;indeed, desirable&#151;to undertake it in stages. I observe, however, that these are orders to an Act that has now been around for two years, and that the preparation and reports that were produced for that Act had been swirling around Whitehall for some time before that.  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_357"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 357</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It is a measure of how dependent the 2006 Act was on secondary legislation to fill out the details that we are discussing these very important orders in November 2008. Perhaps the Minister will appreciate why we Opposition Peers so frequently express our unhappiness at being assured that the detail is coming, when we see that years can pass before the full picture of a Bill emerges.</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08110633000219"></a>Of the two statutory instruments, the foreign offences order gives rise to the most serious questions. Maria Miller, my honourable friend in another place, pointed out what a significant part overseas workers play in our workforce. They are as many as one in 10 of the overall workforce. In healthcare, one person in four comes from overseas. It is therefore vital to address the issue of how overseas workers are vetted. The order brings us back to a point which the Conservatives made when the Act was still a Bill: that offences committed overseas must be taken into account. I am unsure why, having thought that the matter was suitably covered then, the Government have now realised that it needs to be examined. None the less, I am grateful that they are now doing so.</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08110633000220"></a>Overseas workers pose a major loophole in the vetting procedure. Put simply, if they have committed crimes in other countries they may not show up on a CRB check. I have two problems with that situation. The first should be obvious: it is not remotely acceptable to have 10 per cent of the workforce or, as I said, in some sectors as much as 25 per cent dropping beneath the radar in criminal background checks, so that we effectively cannot say one way or another whether they should be considered safe.</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08110633000221"></a>The second point follows directly from the first: if people are to be vetted, and if necessary barred, it strikes me as hugely unfair that everyone is not subject to the same rigours. How do the Government intend to make checks on those overseas workers who may or may not have committed an offence? The same goes for workers who have merely spent some time overseas. Presumably, any check on them will turn up nothing for the period during which they were out of this country. I am not sure that it would even be enough to flag up such individuals so that employers are put on notice. What exactly should employers be expected to do with that information?</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08110633000222"></a>What reciprocal arrangements are in place with other countries to exchange such data? I understand that a scheme is in place with Australia and France. But is that all? How are those schemes working in practice? What are the Government doing to obtain information from other countries? How reliable can we expect that information to be? What do the Government propose to do about cases where the offence is a crime in the other country, so may be flagged up by a check, but is not an offence here? Will that person still be considered a risk? How will the Government deal with such disparities in differing criminal justice systems? How will those individuals get through the system if a system is put in place?</p>

It suddenly dawned on Ministers that they are not the appropriate people to make these decisions. Although it has taken a couple of years to get to the first stage of implementation, I am very pleased that, at the very least, as soon as the expert board was created it started to advise Ministers in a formal way, which is a good thing. The Minister knows how supportive both opposition Benches were about the main thrust of this Act when it went through your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08110633000225"></a>It is right that there should be a transitional period; otherwise the burden of cases probably would cause undue delay, and none of us wants that. However, the crucial issue is the extent to which employers and those who may be affected by banning orders know and understand where we are up to in that process of transition, what they have to do in the case of employers and how the ban affects them in the case of banned individuals. How will the Government ensure that all that is clearly understood during the transition phase? Do people know the difference between the ISA and the IBB? I understand that there is no difference. I should like to know why it is necessary for the board to be referred to by two different names.</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08110633000226"></a>On the foreign offences order, we have had a lot of information about the extent to which the exchange of information about offences in other countries has progressed. Clearly, collaboration is not perfect yet. The whole process still relies on two things. The first concerns an employer asking an applicant whether he has worked abroad. What can be done about that? How can we make sure that employers always ask that question? The second thing is whether other countries let us have information about offences when the ISA asks for it. Perhaps the Minister will answer the questions posed by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, which are also in my mind, about where the gaps are in other countries. If the ISA does not ask for the information, because no one knows that the applicant has worked abroad, the whole thing falls apart however good the communication between our law officers and those of other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08110633000227"></a>The information note, which the Minister was kind enough to send us, has 26 pages of UK offences that would result in a bar, either with or without representation. I should like to know who decides about the equivalents of these UK offences in other countries. Some of them are technical and include an element of the age either of the perpetrator or of the victim, which might vary in respect of offences in other countries. Does it have to be done in detail country by country, looking at a list of our offences compared to a list of their offences, or is there an international table of equivalents which can be referred to?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08110633000228"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, referred to a situation where someone commits an offence in another country which is not an offence here. I should like to

Presumably, the authorities in the other country will have no reason to have a record if it is not an offence in that country. I accept that people will be barred for an offence overseas only if that offence is also an offence here. But what if one of our offences is not an offence there? Such a person would not come to the notice of the authorities in the other country.</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08110633000229"></a>That raises two real issues; that is, first, knowing whether a person has worked abroad, so that the questions can be asked in the first place and, secondly, those offences that are offences here&#151;we would like to take them into consideration if someone applies to work with a vulnerable group&#151;but are not offences in the country where the act was committed. Will the noble Baroness clarify the position?</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08110633000230"></a>When the 2006 Act was going through the House one of our main worries was whether people who were accused of one or more minor offences really understood the consequences of accepting a caution in relation to a future career involving working with children. Has the Minister any further evidence on that situation since we first debated the matter two years ago? Has any research been done on the extent to which those who have accepted a caution really understand what it means to them in relation to working with any particular group? I still am worried that when people accept a caution it is because they consider it to be the easy way out rather than going through a court. They may not be guilty of committing an offence, but they may accept a caution without realising the effect it could have on their future career.</p>

Will the ISA/IBB provide guidance for those of us who manage large numbers of people on how we should handle those situations?</p>

<a name="81106-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08110633000232"></a>There is also concern about appeals.

The UK sees information-sharing as a key priority for the next EU work programme, and, as noble Lords will be aware, we have signed the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, which recognises the need to share information for child protection purposes. The noble Baronesses also asked about bilateral efforts between countries. The Criminal Records Bureau is pursuing bilateral agreements, and in her speech the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, referred to the examples of France, Ireland, Poland and Australia on their agreements to exchange information for employment vetting purposes. However, this is difficult territory and so far only three of the 26 EU countries have said that they can co-operate with us on these bilateral agreements. That is an indication of how far we have to go. We recognise that there is an enormous amount of work to do.</p>

<a name="81106-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08110633000235"></a>Noble Lords will be aware of Sir Ian Magee&#146;s review into sharing information on criminality, published in the summer. The review recommends that we expand information flows with other countries. Doing so will provide a more co-ordinated approach, and Sir Ian has said that vetting and barring will be a priority in this work. I was asked whether a clear CRB check provides evidence of a clean record. We agree that this is an important point. As the noble Baroness pointed out, when someone comes from abroad, a clear CRB check does not necessarily mean that they have a clean record. That is why our guidance to schools states that additional checks should made on the work carried out by people overseas. Those checks should include, for example, certificates of good conduct from the relevant embassy. I want also to make absolutely clear the duty on employers because the new scheme is not a substitute for employers&#146; general duties and responsibilities. It complements rather than replaces them. Employers should inquire into a person&#146;s career history, take up references and ask searching questions about any gaps, as they do now. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said that she was not convinced about a flagging scheme because it can only do so much and would mean a massive increase in the scheme&#146;s complexity. If we were to attempt to track through this scheme all employees who travel abroad, that level of complexity would make it unmanageable. It is therefore important to stress that the scheme does not replace the duties on employers.</p>

<a name="81106-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08110633000236"></a>I understand that in the Commons Committee there was a debate on an amendment that would have required the Secretary of State or the ISA to inform a relevant regulatory body like the General Teaching Council or the General Medical Council if we or the ISA became aware that an individual had been charged or convicted of a foreign offence which, had the act been committed in the UK, might have lead to the individual either being barred or considered for it. That is not the same as using the information to bar an individual automatically. The Act provides that if someone is on an equivalent barred list in a foreign country or subject to a foreign order such as a sexual offences  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_361"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 361</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>prevention order, they can be automatically barred. At the moment, the Act does not provide for someone to be automatically barred where there is just an equivalent foreign offence. However, the ISA will be able to take into account information it considers appropriate, which is a wide power that needs to be borne in mind.</p>

<a name="81106-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08110633000237"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley asked about the change of name from the Independent Barring Board to the Independent Safeguarding Authority. The IBB is only the legislative name for the ISA. I appreciate that changes of name, complexity of processes, the order and timetabling of regulations and so forth can be bewildering, but I want to make it clear from this Dispatch Box that we in the department will do all we can to ensure that noble Lords have the information and support they need to scrutinise these proposals in a timely manner. Name changes and timetables should not stand in the way of appropriate and searching debate in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="81106-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08110633000238"></a>All communications with the general public about the vetting and barring scheme will refer to the Independent Safeguarding Authority, which will be the &#147;brand&#148;, and the IBB will not be referred to. All individuals and employers using the scheme will first look at the guidance rather than a copy of the Act, which I am sure will come as no surprise to any noble Lord. We believe that those using the scheme will be clear about the correct name, the ISA. I hope that I have reassured the noble Baroness on that point.</p>

<a name="81106-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08110633000239"></a>We recognise that there are difficulties surrounding foreign offences and that this is not a straightforward area. We have already provided some information to the Merits Committee but we will be happy to go over it. Our full response to the committee has been published in its report, but I want to make it clear that the police provide us with information on the read-across between foreign offences and their UK equivalents. This is important for the ISA. In particular, the UK Central Authority for the Exchange of Criminal Records has developed significant expertise over the past two years in interpreting foreign convictions and a track record is developing in this regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08110633000240"></a>The noble Baroness asked about offences committed abroad which are not considered to be offences over here. There will be no automatic barring in such cases. Only foreign offences which have an equivalent to a UK automatic barring offence will lead to such barring, but I stress again that the ISA will take into account those offences. However, they will not be automatic.</p>

<a name="81106-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08110633000241"></a>I turn to the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, about cautions. ACPO has strengthened its guidance to police forces to ensure that when in the UK cautions are accepted for an automatic barring offence, the individual understands that he or she will be barred. I am not sure whether that fully answers her question, so I will check further into the position with regard to offences for which there is not an automatic bar and come back to her more fully.</p>

Since first reading the Bill, I have been doubtful about the concept of &#147;the Council&#148;. Its role is explained in Schedule 1 but there is no reference to it in the text of the Bill until Clause 60. In the Bill it is always described as &#147;the&#148; council, whereas in practice a new council is formed for each case. It seemed to me that the council was a superfluous concept, fulfilling a role that should be performed by the commission. Accordingly, I introduced a series of amendments in Committee removing &#147;the Council&#148; from the text of the Bill. Those amendments were not accepted, and we are stuck with this wording.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08110633000254"></a>The question now is how best to introduce the concept of the council into the Bill. The council has a very important role; for example, it is the council, rather than the commission, which has the decisive role in assessing applications that are initially examined by a single commissioner. Given this importance, I think that its existence should be acknowledged in the opening clause of the Bill, as proposed in Amendment No. 3.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, did a most valiant job in Committee of identifying references to &#147;the Council&#148;. As we were debating his amendments and issues surrounding the role of the council, a number of noble Lords felt that it was an uncomfortable title for the role which the Government envisage. At that point, I suggested that the word &#147;committee&#148; might more properly reflect that role, but, being less energetic than the noble Lord, and rather than finding all the references, my amendment would allow the commissioners and the Secretary of State to call the council &#147;committee&#148; or anything else they felt was appropriate. That would not disturb the Bill, and the alternative would not even need agreement at this stage. I agree that this is not a hugely elegant solution, but it may be a practical way of addressing something that has the potential for causing confusion.</p>

No doubt the Minister will explain the government amendments later, but, by adding the words &#147;or ending&#148; they make it clear that there needs to be proper consultation by the chairman with the other commissioners and the chief executive before a member&#146;s appointment is ended.

I can understand that something between a panel, which may be just three people, and the full commission is needed, but &#147;council&#148; seems to have an entirely wrong connotation. Apart from anything else, it is not a permanent body, but a group of commissioners who may be appointed ad hoc for a particular inquiry. A completely different body of commissioners may be called the &#147;council&#148; at the inquiry dealing with the next application. The noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, has drawn our attention, with huge persistence, to the fact that this is the wrong word. Whether it is left to the commission to decide, as the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment would have it, or whether the Government should recognise in the schedule that there will be something between the single commissioner, the panel and the full commission, it needs to have a name that conveys

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08110633000259"></a>I serve and have served on a number of bodies where the council is the governing body. Many charities will be run by a chairman and council. There are many others. My noble friend on the Front Bench is familiar with a local authority. Local authorities have an elected council, a body which exists until the whole lot is removed. It is not a peripatetic body, or a peripatetic name for a number of different bodies that may be appointed under the procedure of the Bill. I hope that the Minister might have another look at this between now and Third Reading, because the use of &#147;council&#148; in these circumstances is a misnomer. It is not a council as one recognises it any other walk of life.</p>

The amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, which leaves the subject open, is probably preferable to the rigidity of the Bill. I wonder whether this group would be not more executive than a council, but even &#147;executive&#148; would not describe its function with sufficient accuracy. The only thing on which I think we shall be able to agree is that we do not like the title. It is a little unfortunate. If we could find something better on which we could all agree, it would be an improvement.</p>

The noble Lord has pursued the matter assiduously and I wish that I had a solution, because it will become increasingly clear that, for different reasons, I do not.</p>

<a name="81106-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08110633000262"></a>I will address the amendments in turn. The noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, wishes the Bill to include reference to the council in Clause 1. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, ingeniously suggest a way of improving the terminology. I have tabled a number of amendments in response to concerns raised in Committee about the scope of the power of the chair to end a commissioner&#146;s appointment to the council.</p>

<a name="81106-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08110633000263"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, has consistently raised concerns, both here and in discussions outside the Chamber, that the first appearance of &#147;the Council&#148; is not until Clause 60. Our previous debates were to clarify the role of the council. I am pleased that we now know that it is not a superfluous body, but exists to do a very important job. As he said, several councils could sit at the same time.</p>

<a name="81106-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08110633000264"></a>The noble Lord feels that, as the council takes decisions on nationally significant infrastructure projects under certain circumstances, it should be put up front in Clause 1. Our problem in doing so, and this is not a Jesuitical argument, is that such a clause would not follow the normal conventions of legislative drafting.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_365"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 365</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81106-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08110633000265"></a>We are afraid that it would lead to greater confusion about the role of the council, because the council is essentially part of the operational structure of the IPC. When we set up bodies such as this in legislation, detail on how it will operate is nearly always set out in the schedules. Schedule 1, which is about the IPC, is clearly referenced in Clause 1. It would not make sense to isolate the one activity represented by the council and put it in Clause 1, as the noble Lord suggests. It belongs in the schedule, because it is part of describing how the IPC will work. I am sorry to disappoint the noble Lord on that, but it is sensible to keep things as they are.</p>

<a name="81106-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08110633000266"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 6, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. It was argued in Committee&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has eloquently done so again&#151;that the term &#147;council&#148; could cause confusion as a council is more generally understood to be a fixed body whereas, under the Bill, the council will instead be a more fluid body for different purposes. I fully understand that. The terminology of the Bill was very much an issue for debate at earlier stages. It was felt that &#147;the Council&#148; was still the best expression for the IPC. &#147;Committee&#148;, another obvious candidate, was considered, but it was felt that it might cause confusion with the panels of the IPC, which people might see as being committees of the commission&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, picked up that point previously. Using &#147;council&#148; therefore seemed to solve the problem. It may not be perfect. We have thought very hard about it and I have shared my concerns with noble Lords. We looked at the possibility of replacing the terms in the Bill&#151;replacing &#147;Council&#148; with &#147;Committee&#148;&#151;but it would have generated well in excess of 70 amendments, which we felt was inappropriate at this stage.</p>

<a name="81106-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08110633000267"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee&#151;bless her heart&#151;has ingeniously proposed a different solution, by providing that the IPC and Secretary of State could agree to call the council by a different title if they so chose. The IPC and Secretary of State can agree to do that without provision in the Bill. While I am very grateful for her helpful suggestion, I am genuinely frustrated that the proposal is unworkable, because paragraph 6(1) of Schedule 1 provides that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08110633000682"></a>&#147;There is to be a body of Commissioners to be known as the ... Council&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000637"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 6 would be that, while the Secretary of State and the IPC might agree to call the body something else, in strict legal terms it would continue to be the council. It would therefore not require third parties to call it by a different name; as a matter of law, it would continue to be the council.</p>

<a name="81106-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08110633000268"></a>That would have the strange result that the Secretary of State and the commission could call the body something different from everybody else. One can only imagine the confusion, for example, if&#151;God forbid&#151;there were an application for judicial review of an IPC decision. The parties to the proceedings could call the council by the different name agreed by the Secretary of State and the commission, but the courts would be required to follow the legal interpretation.

<a name="81106-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08110633000269"></a>We have thought about this, and we have come up with a solution that I hope will provide some reassurance. Ministers will now set out the purpose of the council very clearly in guidance under the Bill, and will ensure that information on the IPC&#146;s procedures and structures is widely available, such as on the IPC&#146;s website. We will explain the terminology and ensure that people understand that this is a fluid concept. In fact, it will be explained by its functions, and putting it in guidance will ultimately be the most practicable thing to do. I can see that that may not satisfy noble Lords, but it will in effect address the problem and will not cause the complications which the solutions so generously offered in the amendments would bring.</p>

<a name="81106-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08110633000270"></a>I hope that I turn to a happier note, with our Amendments Nos. 7 to 15, which respond to concerns raised in Committee that the chair of the commission has too wide a scope to remove ordinary members from the council. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, was particularly concerned that there was potential for abuse of that power and that people who might be a thorn in the flesh would be too easy to remove.</p>

<a name="81106-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08110633000271"></a>As debated in Committee, our aim is that the council will be a fluid body. We want to provide the chair with the flexibility to change the council to meet different circumstances and challenges, so we need to provide that the chair can employ the right range of skills for each particular issue that comes before the council. I have looked carefully at what the noble Lord has said and agree that he has raised some important points, and therefore we have put some safeguards in place.</p>

<a name="81106-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08110633000272"></a>The government amendments require that before exercising the power to end the appointment of a commissioner who is an ordinary member of the council, the chair or, if delegated, a deputy chair, must first consult and have regard to the views of the other relevant members of the council, the chief executive and any other commissioner that the chair or deputy chair thinks it appropriate to consult. This means that at least six people&#151;the chief executive and minimum five members of the council&#151;must be consulted before any decision is made to end an appointment of an ordinary member of the council. This builds on the provisions set out at paragraph 9 of Schedule 1, which currently apply when making a new appointment to the council.</p>

<a name="81106-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08110633000273"></a>I think that the noble Lord has said that he feels that those proposals meet his point. I hope that they do. As I say, they are intended only to allow the chair to be as flexible as possible, with the resources available to them.</p>

In the event that we cannot do so and are left with the council, we should make more of a thing of this issue

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08110633000282"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, when we think about how the commission will work and consider applications&#151;and, more importantly, how the applicants themselves are to develop applications and present them in a fair and equitable way&#151;the Bill as it stands is open to some question. The difficulty right at the beginning for any applicant is that they have to undertake a public consultation. Anyone who has been in the public relations business knows that if you want to get a particular answer you can go a long way towards predetermining it by how you ask the question. There is a broad suspicion&#151;I put it no stronger than that&#151;that applicants for planning permission and nationally significant infrastructure projects who have to undertake public consultations on applications will load the way in which they produce that system so as to colour the answer in their favour. It would in fact be remarkable if that did not happen but, if it were to happen, there is no question but that at some point someone would  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_368"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 368</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>say that the consultation was not representative or fair. Then we would find ourselves in a judicial review situation. That is the purpose behind Amendment No. 16.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08110633000283"></a>Amendments Nos. 91 and 95 deal more specifically with the issue of the public examination of the application by a panel of commissioners or a single commissioner. Here the doubts are somewhat similar; there is no question but that at that point the cross-examination of witnesses in public hearings must be seen to be unbiased. The danger is that it might not be. One cannot afford to have a situation in which a request for an order for planning permission is granted when someone can say that the commission&#151;the panel or the individual members&#151;undertaking the cross-examination asked questions of members of the public appearing in the public session in such a way as to predetermine the answers. There is no easy answer to dealing with that issue, but it is a vital matter of public confidence; the public must have absolute confidence in this system if it is not to be distrusted.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08110633000284"></a>I am sorry that the noble Viscount, Lord Colville, is not in his place, because he is much more of an expert in these matters than I am. He apologises, but he is involved in a consultation with a regulator; that date was set in his diary before the dates were set for this Report stage and there was nothing he could do to get here in time. Much as I might wish to do so, I could not keep my speech going long enough to enable him to arrive, nor would the House thank me if I did so.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08110633000285"></a>There is a vital issue of public confidence in the system. We have to ensure that the system not only is fair but is seen to be fair. Probably the people with the most expertise in this field&#151;and there are a lot of them about&#151;are the planning lawyers. I do not fancy myself as an advocate for what I would call the planning lawyers union, but they are very experienced and good at what they do and I would be surprised if one or two of them did not finish up on the commission. Of course, that is up to those who will ultimately undertake the appointments, but it might solve the problem. However, the solution that we have suggested of an independent legal adviser to cover these matters is likely to be seen as more equitable and fair in the interests of both sides of the argument.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08110633000286"></a>The issue is very much about public confidence in the system. Whatever we might have thought about our earlier debate, that was the principle behind the amendment that we moved. In the scale of things, this is a much simpler and more straightforward issue to understand. It is important to get the public outside to believe that the system is not loaded against them. Regrettably, there is already a large concern that the system that the Government are proposing will ride roughshod over all difficulties and objections and will speedily reach conclusions without particular consideration of equity. The Minister has gone a long way towards allaying that concern in her remarks. Government Amendment No. 94 also deals with this issue, albeit in a slightly different way. I look forward to hearing her reply, which I hope will cover exactly how she sees this paragon of unbiased and unprejudiced virtue working. I beg to move.</p>

The examining authority must have all the tools necessary, whether directly or indirectly, to ensure that points are made in a way that it can understand and on which it can act where appropriate. The testing of evidence is central to the amendment to which I spoke&#151;I may even have moved it&#151;in Committee and which is here again as Amendment No. 92, in my name and those of my noble friend Lord Greaves and, gratifyingly, the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews. I am sorry&#151;well, not that sorry&#151;that we got there before her.

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08110633000288"></a>On government Amendment No. 94, is it anticipated, as I read it, that there will be just one person who is the source of legal advice? There are two issues: general legal advice to the commission and assistance to the examining authority in dealing with a particular application. I want to be certain that both are covered by the amendment and not just the first. I suspect that a single individual would not be able to cope. Indeed, a single individual at the level that one wants would not necessarily be available. One wants advocates with great experience of this sort of job, but such individuals may not want to take a full-time appointment with public sector pay. We must allow the commission to cherry pick from the range of talent at the Bar. I became a little uncertain about this as I read the amendment and was not wholly sure.</p>

<p><a name="08110633000642"></a>That seems to cover the same ground, although the amendments are far from identical. One is looking to ensure that there is an opportunity to examine the people who are making the application and to ask whether it has been properly thought through. That must be done in front of the decision-maker.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08110633000291"></a>I referred in our debate earlier to the conference that I addressed on Tuesday. At the conference, a highly qualified lawyer practising in the City made a skilful presentation on the main thrust of the Bill and the new planning process. I was hugely impressed. He had not caught up with all the amendments that were being made in this House, but I do not blame him for that, as that would be a difficult thing to do. However, he laid stress, as we did in Committee, on the need for a forum in which someone can ask oral questions of the applicant and perhaps his expert witnesses. That may come at an earlier stage, but the arrangement is not entirely clear to me.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08110633000292"></a>There was a good deal of discussion in Committee about the oral examination and I was left with the impression that part of the streamlining that the Minister and her department are trying to get will eliminate or substantially cut down the oral examination that may be allowed on an individual application. Again, I may have misunderstood what is proposed, but this group of amendments gives the Minister the opportunity to explain not only what her amendment means&#151;as I said, it is not entirely clear to me&#151;but how she expects the examination will be conducted and when there will be an opportunity for people who want to make representations about the application to cross-examine those who are putting it forward and their expert witnesses. I accept that it may have to be done within a tight timescale. The whole purpose of the Bill is to reach a decision much more swiftly than under the existing cumbersome system. However, it seems to me and to others that to dispense with the opportunity to put oral questions to the applicant and his witnesses is to remove a substantial part of what should be a participative process which will eventually give credibility to the ultimate decision of the IPC.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08110633000293"></a>It may be that I have misunderstood these things and not read them properly. However, having looked at them carefully, I am still somewhat puzzled as to how the Government envisage this process being carried on.</p>

Two important points have rightly been made. These processes must be seen to be fair, and must work in such a way that everyone feels that they have had their say and been listened to properly, that the evidence has been tested thoroughly and the judgment is sound and on the basis of the best possible evidence. Confidence in the process and ensuring that the evidence is properly tested, and that there are the skills and tools available to do that, are extremely important.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08110633000295"></a>When we debated this in Committee, I sensed that there was growing understanding and support for the Bill&#146;s proposal to charge the commissioners with examining  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_371"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 371</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an application, to probe, test and assess the evidence through direct questions, rather than the traditional means of outsourcing this to advocates speaking on behalf of other people. At the end of our exchanges, we were also able to agree that cross-examination was not ruled out in the new regime. I made it clear that the commission can allow participants to cross-examine where it considers it necessary to ensure the adequate testing of any representations, or necessary to allow an interested party a fair chance to put the party's case. In short, this means that if there is a good case for inviting interested parties to cross-examine witnesses, the commission can certainly do so.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08110633000296"></a>However, it was apparent across the House, not least behind me, that there were concerns that the commissioners might not always have the appropriate skill and expertise available to them to question parties in the same way that experienced advocates could, to dig under the evidence, and that they might need support to do that. It was argued in the debate led by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that the requirement for commissioners to consider that cross-examination may be allowed only &#147;exceptionally&#148; might make it more difficult for them to allow cross-examination, and that what we had inserted as a &#147;safety valve&#148; might not function as such.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08110633000297"></a>Members of the Committee asked me to provide assurances, and to come back on Report with a better story and some amendments. I hope that I have done that. First, however, Amendment No. 16 of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, provides that the Secretary of State must appoint a solicitor to the commission for the purpose of advising it on the exercise of its functions, ensuring in particular that the consideration of applications is lawful and fair.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08110633000298"></a>The new clause proposed in Amendment No. 95&#151;which is, of course, closest to where we are&#151;provides that the chair of the commission may appoint a qualified lawyer to act as an advocate to the examination, provided the solicitor of the commission considers them to be a suitable person to act in that role. It further provides that the advocate to the examination can make oral or written representations to the examining authority, and may ask oral questions of any person making representations at a hearing. It also provides that the solicitor to the commission may appoint a suitable person to assist the advocate. Amendment No. 91 is consequential to that.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08110633000299"></a>I understand that noble Lords are seeking assurances that our approach to examining evidence is workable. In that context, I shall go over the opportunities that those coming forward will have to make an oral case. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, asked me to explain how that would work in practice. Most representations to the IPC would be written. They would be so technical that, by the time they had reached that stage, a lot of the discussion and argument on principle may be in-house. There is a good case for prioritising written representations to clarify technical issues.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08110633000300"></a>However, there are two separate opportunities for oral hearings. First, there can be specific oral hearings on any one of a number of topics that are germane to the application. Secondly, and this is unique, there are  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_372"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 372</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>open-floor hearings. That provides two powerful opportunities for individuals, both the promoters and those from the local community, to come and make their case and test each others&#146; arguments.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08110633000301"></a>As I said before, we expect that all commissioners will be provided with appropriate training to carry out their functions, including training in the techniques of testing evidence: questioning, listening and asking the right questions in the right way. However, I absolutely took the noble Lord&#146;s point that commissioners might sometimes need the support of a professional advocate to ensure that the right evidence is tested in the most effective and revealing way. That is what our new clause in Amendment No. 94 is about.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08110633000302"></a>To answer the first point of the noble Baroness, that clause will provide that the chair to the commission may appoint a barrister, solicitor or advocate to provide legal advice and assistance to the examining authority&#151;that could be a panel or a single commissioner&#151;where the examining authority requests it. However, it cannot be a single person. Needs will differ, the scope will differ and the nature of the examination will differ. A counsel with experience in engineering projects or in dealing with different types of witnesses may be required. We have therefore left it as fluid as possible.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08110633000303"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, asks how it will work. Essentially, the advice and assistance that may be provided must be determined by the panel itself when it specifies its needs. It will certainly include the ability of the advocate in question to conduct oral questioning at a hearing, on behalf of the panel, of anybody who comes before it; it may be the applicant himself, or someone from the local community. His function is to probe the veracity and test the quality of argument and the quality of evidence provided. I hope that that addresses the concerns raised.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08110633000304"></a>Our amendment will ensure that the assistance of the advocate would be available should the examining body feel it requires some extra support and forensic skill. It also provides that the chair will have the final say as he or she will have the ultimate responsibility for the deployment of the commission&#146;s resources. We are building in that discretionary power.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08110633000305"></a>On Amendment No. 16 to Schedule 1, the main purpose of the solicitor to the commission would be to provide advice to the commissioners on the exercise of their functions. The appointment would be an appointment of a staff of the commission. I understand what the noble Lord seeks here; I shall try to reassure him. The Bill provides that the commission secretariat will be responsible for the internal running of the IPC, including resource planning, appointments, finance and expenditure. It will be headed by a chief executive, and we do not want to constrain or curtail their power. It is entirely right that the chief executive should have the freedom to plan and manage those resources, including the appointment of staff. It should therefore be the chief executive who decides whether there is a requirement for the appointment of a solicitor to the commission, and he is likely to do so in all probability. It is worth pointing out that similar provisions apply to other public bodies, such as the Competition Commission. Although the Competition Act 1998 does

Therefore, I can put that on the record.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08110633000306"></a>The proposed new clause in Amendment No. 95 is somewhat similar to the proposed new clause in government Amendment No. 94, but it provides that the advocate to the examination may make,</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000755"></a>&#147;oral and written representations to the examining authority&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000643"></a>in addition to asking questions of witnesses at hearings. That question was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. I, too, am not quite sure what the intention of the noble Lords is with regard to the advocate&#146;s role in making,</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000756"></a>&#147;oral and written representations to the examining authority&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000644"></a>However, it suggests that it may allow the advocate to both question witnesses about their evidence, and give evidence about the application. If my understanding of the amendment is correct, I caution against it. I suggest that decisions where an advocate could both give evidence and, as it were, get evidence might be open to a claim of judicial review because of the dual function involved. Therefore, I cannot accept the relevant amendments because that is rather problematic.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08110633000307"></a>As regards cross-examination, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has returned on Report with Amendment No. 92, which seeks to remove the word &#147;exceptionally&#148; from the test in Clause 93(7). I know that noble Lords are concerned that &#147;exceptionally&#148; might make it incredibly difficult for anyone to justify the use of cross-examination. The noble Baroness is aware that I will accept her amendment, and I am very happy to do so. However, I wish to explain what it means in terms of our position on cross-examination in the context of the Bill.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08110633000308"></a>I have said that the Bill sets out a way of proceeding for the IPC that aims in the best possible way to probe, test and assess evidence through direct questions rather than through cross-examination. Consequently, we expect that, in most cases, the examining authority&#151;the panel&#151;will question witnesses and probe the evidence. Direct questioning would be the norm; cross-examination would be used only where needed. That is why originally the Bill contained a reference to &#147;exceptionally&#148;.</p>

<a name="81106-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08110633000309"></a>I have also said that while we believe interested parties should be able to cross-examine witnesses in certain circumstances, we think there needs to be a good case for departing from the norm. We think that the right test is therefore that of when it is necessary to ensure the adequate testing of representations, or that an interested party has a fair chance to put their case. I am sure noble Lords will understand that, given the arguments I have set out about cross-examination and direct questioning, we certainly do not consider that we should invite cross-examination unless it is necessary. However, I should stress that the Bill emphatically does not rule out cross-examination. If the commission concluded that allowing a party to cross-examine was necessary to ensure the adequate testing of any representations or to give a party a fair chance to put their case&#151;these will be experienced people with the highest standards of argument and ability to know

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08110633000310"></a>I have now further considered the strong arguments put by the noble Baroness in Committee. Although I am clear that in the examination of evidence, direct questioning would be the norm and that cross-examination would be used only where needed, I accept that the inclusion of &#147;exceptionally&#148; in the test to decide whether it is necessary to allow cross-examination may send the wrong, rather negative signal to commissioners and make it harder for them to allow cross-examination where it was necessary. Therefore, I am very happy to accept Amendment No. 92. I share her pleasure in seeing my name attached to that amendment, along with her own and that of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves.</p>

We had a full discussion of the provisions for pre-application in Part 5 in Committee and we have given considerable thought to the debate we had on that day.</p>

<a name="81106-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08110633000316"></a>As we set out then, the Government believe strongly that the promoters of major infrastructure projects should carry out the pre-application consultation on those projects. We are trying to initiate a proper dialogue between the promoter and the local community. We believe that the duties must therefore bear on the promoters and that they must take direct responsibility for meeting them. However, we were struck by what the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said about the importance of the guidance that the Government will issue on pre-application consultation. We thought she put it particularly well when she said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000645"></a>We were also struck by the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, about the importance of making sure that promoters are under a clear obligation to  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_375"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 375</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>spell out what responses they have had and what account they have taken of them, so that we can be assured that no corners have been cut. As my noble friend Lady Andrews said in that debate, we believe that the provisions of Chapter 2 of Part 5 represent a robust set of requirements. Promoters must consult local authorities on how to engage with people living in the vicinity of the land. They must have regard to the guidance on different points issued by the Secretary of State and the IPC. They must take account of the responses to consultation and produce a consultation report. Above all, the IPC must be satisfied that the requirements of the chapter have been complied with before it can accept an application.</p>

<a name="81106-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08110633000317"></a>However, having listened to the debate and reflected on it, we think that the requirements could be clarified and strengthened, and the amendments that we have tabled seek to achieve that. First, we have sought to clarify and strengthen the provisions for guidance across the chapter. Amendments Nos. 72 and 80 remove the various provisions in Clauses 42 and 47 that allow the Secretary of State and the IPC to give guidance at specific points in the process. I recognise that those are too piecemeal and, aside from being difficult to follow, perhaps they do not send quite the right message. Amendment No. 81 would therefore replace those provisions with a much clearer new clause that sets out unambiguously that the Secretary of State and the IPC may give guidance on how any of the pre-application requirements of the chapter should be complied with. Crucially, it also requires that the promoter must have regard to that in the guidance. That makes it much clearer where guidance can be given and by whom, and extends the scope for guidance on the part of both the Secretary of State and the IPC across the chapter.</p>

<a name="81106-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08110633000318"></a>Noble Lords may be concerned that this raises a potential for conflict between two sets of guidance. I place on record that we expect the two sets of guidance to be fundamentally different. The Secretary of State will provide high-level strategic guidance on how pre-application consultation should be carried out and how communities should be engaged with. We expect that guidance from the IPC will be based on, and will take account of, that and will focus on the detail of how it expects promoters to apply that in practice.</p>

<a name="81106-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08110633000319"></a>Secondly, we have sought to strengthen the requirement on promoters to spell out what responses they have had and what account they have taken of them. Amendment No. 70 to Clause 37 strengthens the requirement for promoters to produce a consultation report, extending the report to cover consultation and publicity under Clauses 42, 47 and 48. The report must give details of any relevant responses and the account taken of them. We will make sure that the consultation report is thorough and makes clear how responses to consultation and publicity have been addressed by promoters.</p>

<a name="81106-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08110633000320"></a>The new requirements are reinforced by Amendments Nos. 82 and 83 to Clause 54. They make clear that when the IPC has decided whether the promoter has complied with the requirements for pre-application consultation in Part 5, it must have regard to the consultation report, any adequacy of consultation   


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_376"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 376</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>representation by the local authority and the extent to which guidance issued by the IPC and the Secretary of State has been complied with.</p>

<a name="81106-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08110633000321"></a>Amendments Nos. 17, 76 and 77 are consequential. Amendment No. 78 to Clause 47 clarifies how the promoter&#146;s statement of community consultation relates to the proposed application, bringing the drafting into line with the wording used in Clauses 37, 42 and 48. Taken together, the amendments both strengthen the requirements for pre-application consultation and make clearer how they are to be enforced. The Secretary of State and the IPC will be able to provide guidance on any aspect of the pre-application procedure. Promoters must have regard to that, and the IPC must take account of whether the promoter has done so when deciding if it can accept the application.</p>

<a name="81106-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08110633000322"></a>Moreover, the amendments expand the consultation report and explicitly bring it within the scope of the IPC&#146;s decision on whether an application can be accepted.

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08110633000323"></a>I shall speak to Amendment No. 79, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. It seeks to ensure that promoters must consult local authorities on how to undertake consultation with people living in the vicinity of the land. I confirm that that is the effect of the Bill. Subsection (1) requires promoters to draw up a statement describing how they propose to consult the local community. Subsection (2) requires promoters to consult the relevant local authority about what should be in the statement. That has the same effect as the amendment; they are effectively consulting on how consultation should be undertaken. I hope that reassures the noble Baroness and that she will be prepared to withdraw the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Lord is absolutely right in his analysis of my Amendment No. 79; I wanted to be reassured about the &#147;how&#148;. The noble Lord may recall that we used the example of Heathrow, as they did in the Commons. If the British Airports Authority was regarded as being too close to the consultation, it would be regarded with considerable cynicism. That is a big example, but there would be smaller examples. I wanted an assurance that the local authority, which understands the nuances, was consulted on methods and mechanisms as well. I am grateful for the assurance and, when it comes to it, I shall not move my amendment.</p>

It is about trying to get guidance out as early as possible. I know that departments are currently working on national policy statements. As I understand it, as soon as the Bill becomes law the Secretary of State will be able to issue guidance under new Clause 81. They do not have to wait for the commission to be appointed; the Secretary of State could issue guidance and may well wish to issue draft guidance. However, potential applicants out there are

They cannot actually start until they have some guidance on how the pre-application process will work, how they should draw up their applications and in what form they are expected to present them to the various stakeholders in the pre-application process.</p>

<a name="81106-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08110633000326"></a>It has been said in reply that it will be for the commission to produce the guidance, but the Government&#146;s new clause makes it perfectly clear that the Secretary of State can do this and does not have to wait until the commission has been appointed. This process is still at a fairly early stage. One has seen the advertisements for the chair of the commission, and there will be other appointments. I suspect that the process will run for several months before we have a commission in place. In the mean time, I do not see any reason why the Secretary of State should not start to draw up guidance now, or at least as soon as the Bill becomes law, which I hope will be fairly shortly, so that applicants will have a much clearer idea of what will be expected of them in the pre-application process.</p>

<a name="81106-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08110633000327"></a>I wholly welcome the pre-application process; it is a very important stage in the process of an application that will eventually go before the IPC. As I have said, many of those who propose major infrastructure projects want to get ahead with it. I hope that the Minister can provide some assurance and comfort that a start will be made on the guidance process as quickly as possible.</p>

I have met potential applicants who are desperate to know how far they can go before the Act is even in place. That raises an interesting issue as to whether they are able to deal with the technical aspects of their application. If there is a proposal to build a nuclear power station on an existing site, a lot of design work and so on can be done; but we need to recognise that applicants in that situation will want to start work almost while the commission is being established.</p>

Is it in the background of the Government&#146;s thinking that it will be technically possible for applicants, not to put in an application straight away&#151;public consultation and that part of the report would have to be done&#151;but to carry out the great deal of work that they can do? It would be interesting to know the Government&#146;s views on this. One would not wish anyone to cause themselves embarrassment because some of the papers were dated before the existence of the commission, when it is perfectly well known that when the application finally comes before the commission it will be in the proper form.</p>

During the passage of the Bill, few Ministers can have taken as much trouble as the noble Baroness to keep us informed of the Government&#146;s thinking, to answer our points and to ensure that none is lost sight of.

As the House will recognise, here I am particularly concerned with the disability duty.</p>

<a name="81106-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08110633000342"></a>There is an overarching general duty on all public authorities to avoid discrimination, but that can be underpinned&#151;to use the noble Baroness&#146;s own word&#151;by specific duties set out in secondary legislation. I understand that the IPC will be subject to the general duty, but I firmly believe that, when one deals with the complex structure of planning, the more specific duties should be applied to the work of the IPC. The noble Baroness has told me that when deciding which public authorities to list under specific duties, the Government consider such factors as whether the body has significant direct dealings with disabled service users, has a significant impact on the lives of disabled people, could be a significant employer of disabled people and is of sufficient size to support the duties. For planning legislation, the second point&#151;whether it has a significant impact on the lives of disabled people&#151;is important.</p>

<a name="81106-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08110633000343"></a>There is no doubt whatever that buildings and other facilities which are to be accessed by the public have to be accessible by disabled people, and that would certainly include a number of major infrastructure projects. One of the complaints of the disabled community is that their pleas to planning authorities have not been met with much sympathy or acquiescence. On the contrary, they make the point again and again, if that kind of thing can be taken into account early in the design of a project, the necessary facilities for access can be made available at far less cost and in a far more acceptable way than if they have to be added later. I do not want to bang on about it, but it is very important. I know from my brief discussion with the noble Lord, Lord Low, that he fully accepts that view. He asked me to emphasise his support for what we are proposing here. We need the specific duties under the Disability Discrimination Act to be applied to the IPC. I beg to move.</p>

I had hoped that we would have resolved this so that, on Report, I would be able to give the detail. Unfortunately, although progress is being made, we have not quite got there. I take the point made by the noble Lord. In Committee, we debated the difference between general and specific duties. I apologise to the noble Lord that we have not been able to finalise the advice in time for Report. I would like him to accept, on behalf of the people for whom he is speaking, my assurances that this will not fall between the cracks.

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08110633000345"></a>I feel confident in making that case, without reiterating what I said in Committee, because I am of the same mind as the noble Lord. Perhaps I can digress for a minute from the Bill. Last year, we spent a great deal of time in my department developing a policy called Lifetime Homes, Lifetime Neighbourhoods. Essentially, that was the first policy of its kind to address what we need as an ageing society: not only homes in which we can grow old, stay independent, safe and comfortable and which are affordable, but neighbourhoods which are welcoming, inviting and responsive to the needs of people of all ages and of all disabilities. We are now in a process of configuring what we mean by a &#147;lifetime neighbourhood&#148; and what it might look like, whether it be planning communities in a regenerative context or new build communities. We worked alongside groups of elderly and disabled people to make this as sound and effective as it might be. I recently visited the Papworth Trust to look at how it is providing homes in the middle of communities for people with quite severe disabilities. It was a great inspiration to see how integration is effective and happy for everyone concerned. We have this much in mind.</p>

I thank the Minister for her willingness to respond to concerns expressed in Committee about including a duty to consider climate change within the planning process at local, regional and national levels. She has been extremely sympathetic and accommodating. I also thank her for responding positively by placing a climate change duty within the regional spatial strategies&#151;that will be done in a government amendment.

In the government&#146;s amendments, the NPSs and the Secretary of State are called upon simply to have climate change in mind. There is no requirement upon them to contribute to the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.

At a national level, all we have is the provision &#147;to take account&#148;, &#147;to have regard&#148; &#147;to have in mind&#148;, not &#147;contribute&#148;, which is the responsibility laid on people locally and regionally.</p>

As we move towards a low-carbon economy, we need to transform the planning process. Many national infrastructure projects will make a significant impact on our carbon emissions. That is why we require decisions for the development of the national infrastructure to &#147;contribute&#148; to the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.</p>

But where is the mechanism that allows us to measure that, that enables us to hold them accountable? My fear is that, without a mechanism and an explicit duty in the national policy statement and on the Secretary of State, we will fail to achieve the Government's target of 80 per cent reduction by 2050.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08110633000356"></a>As we are giving so much authority to the Infrastructure Planning Commission, we need to send an unequivocal message from the Secretary of State and from the national policy statement to the IPC industry that we simply cannot accept construction that ignores our responsibility to reduce carbon emissions. We must lay on the NPS and the Secretary of State a duty not just to &#147;bear in mind&#148;, not just to &#147;take account&#148; but to &#147;contribute&#148; to mitigating and adapting to climate change. That is why the amendments are important. I beg to move.</p>

After all, we all know that, along with energy policy, climate change policy is one of the drivers behind the Bill. To include specific mention of it at these key points of decision-making is vital. I think that the right reverend Prelate has hit on the right points of incidence. I hope that the Minister will accept that that is a better way than the government amendments to ensure that climate change mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development are at the heart of the decision-making process that the Bill will introduce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08110633000366"></a>In Committee, I introduced an amendment that sought to require the Secretary of State to ensure, before designating a statement as a national policy statement, that the statement was consistent with the terms of the European Landscape Convention, a convention of the Council of Europe that we signed up to a few years back. That amendment received some support in this House. The noble Lord, Lord Williamson of Horton, spoke in favour of it, as, I think, did others. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, who is in favour of wind farms, said that there were suitable and unsuitable places for them. The noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport, also tabled an amendment at that stage that required the Secretary of State to take account of the impact of policy on the,</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000759"></a>&#147;built heritage, scheduled ancient monuments and important landscapes&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08110633000367"></a>Now, the Government&#146;s own Amendment No. 37 requires the Secretary of State to,</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000760"></a>&#147;have regard to the desirability of ... achieving good design&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000648"></a>following the excellent campaign of the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, on that subject. The noble Lord has tabled another heritage amendment, Amendment No. 64, which I hope will be accepted. Landscape has, alas, disappeared except in the restricted sense in which it appears in the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, which covers conservation areas, registered parks, gardens and battlefields, but no more.</p>

<a name="81106-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08110633000368"></a>Hence, my amendment seeks to rectify an omission by adding just four words to the Government&#146;s amendment. It requires the Secretary of State to have regard to the desirability of,</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000761"></a>&#147;respecting high quality landscape&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000649"></a>The phrase, &#147;high quality landscape&#148;, is to be found in the preamble to the European Landscape Convention. If it is thought to be a subjective concept, it is no more so than good design, which the Secretary of State will also now have to take into account.</p>

<a name="81106-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08110633000369"></a>Recently, I received in the post&#151;in common, no doubt, with many other noble Lords&#151;a small pamphlet which described itself as a snapshot of the work of areas of outstanding natural beauty. The covering letter, which was signed by the chairman of the National Association for Areas of Outstanding National Beauty contained the following two glowing sentences. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="08110633000707"></a>&#147;David Miliband commented in 2007, &#145;landscape provides the backdrop and basis for the nation&#146;s tourist industry, which contributes over &#163;70 billion every year to the British economy. What attracts tourists to Britain is overwhelmingly the beauty and character of our landscape&#146;&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000650"></a>There we have it. In the words of one of our most senior Ministers, when it comes to tourism and the famed attractions of this country, landscape is paramount&#151;unless this was just an example of the art of triangulation, which is to say to each audience what will please them and not worry about the contradictions.</p>

<a name="81106-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08110633000370"></a>The fact is that some of our finest landscapes are being industrialised and ruined by wind power stations. That is very much true of the corridor that runs between the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales National Park, with which I am familiar, but there are many other areas as well. In my opinion, the Government should not let that happen. It need not happen. This Bill could be a tool to prevent it happening. The Secretary of State could make use of the terms of Clause 5(5), which provides:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="08110633000708"></a>&#147;The policy set out in a national policy statement may in particular&#148;,</p>

<ul><a name="08110633000762"></a>&#147;one or more locations as suitable (or ... unsuitable) for a specified description of development&#148;.</ul>
<a name="81106-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08110633000371"></a>This amendment would require the Secretary of State to take landscape into account before designating a national policy statement. Let the Government show that they do not always triangulate, but that they occasionally engage in joined-up government, and accept this amendment.</p>

The citizens of this country will have a better future because of it.

The Climate Change Bill, the Energy Bill&#151;to which we bade farewell last night, I hope&#151;and this Bill all have broadly the same objective. Therefore, I hope that noble Lords will not consider it inappropriate if I refer to something we discussed during the passage of the Energy Bill, which refers precisely to the point made by my noble friend Lord Reay.</p>

<a name="81106-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08110633000374"></a>When we were looking at the contribution that wind farms&#151;offshore as well as onshore&#151;should make to achieving our environmental objectives, it was said again and again that it was being held up not by the inability of the regulators to provide the necessary financial flexibility, and certainly not by any reluctance on the part of investors to invest in wind farms, but by two other factors. The first is access to the grid, on which I will not say another word because that is not directly applicable today, and the second is the planning system. The other day I saw an article about wind energy in a newspaper supplement headed: &#147;Where are the wind farms? Blame the councillors&#148;. It is well known that a great many wind farm applications are pending because they have fallen foul of the planning system.</p>

<a name="81106-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08110633000375"></a>The difficulty for the Government and the IPC is how to break through the barrier to achieving the production of the amount of renewable energy to which the Government have committed themselves, while protecting precisely the kind of thing described by my noble friend and on which there has been so much debate. The place to do it is in the national planning statements. They should make it clear to those who are going to make applications based on a national planning statement for energy&#151;I do not know how many statements there will be; one overarching statement for energy and perhaps others for more specific areas of energy&#151;that they have to have regard to the aesthetic and human values related to these issues as well as the need to press ahead with achieving our environmental objectives. That is why I want to speak strongly in favour of these amendments, although I am not particularly wedded to the actual wording. If we are going to make sense of our energy policy we will do so not only by paying attention to the climate change legislation, but also by paying attention to this legislation.</p>

<a name="81106-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08110633000376"></a>Let me say this to the Minister: I do not envy the officials who will have to draw up national policy statements which are going to have regard to these multifarious objectives. However, we cannot go on with applications simply being held up indefinitely because of the opposition of local planning authorities. That is what this legislation is supposed to be about: major infrastructure projects of national significance, and no one can deny that wind farms fall firmly into that category. Here is a classic example of how all three parts of the legislative structure Parliament is now putting in place actually hang together.</p>

A cartoon in one of the papers showed a man rushing in and waving a piece of paper at his wife, saying, &#147;We&#146;ve won! We&#146;re not going to have a wind farm, we&#146;re going to get a nuclear power station instead&#148;.</p>

It is a pity that we have not had an opportunity for separate debates on all three, but of course we need to make progress. I am glad to have the opportunity to say a word about the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Reay. He rightly takes me somewhat to task for omitting a reference to &#147;important landscapes&#148; in Amendment No. 64, tabled in my name and which we will debate later. The reason I did not include the phrase is because, in the formulation of that proposed new clause, I have drawn on the language of existing legislation and it was rather difficult to bring it in. I am therefore glad that he tabled his amendment. I have every sympathy with it and I am most grateful to him for picking up the baton. I hope that the House will look favourably on his proposal.</p>

<a name="81106-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08110633000379"></a>It was my intention to present a bouquet to my noble friend Lady Andrews at this point, but entirely exceptionally she is not in her place. She is there for hour on hour so it is not unreasonable that she may have nipped out for a cup of tea or, more likely, for a conference with her officials. I want to echo the words of my noble friend Lady Whitaker and say that Amendments Nos. 23 and 37 on design are a civilised and important development on the part of the Minister and the Government. I thank the Minister and her colleagues in the DCLG for the thought that they have put into how to promote good design in the new national infrastructure which the development consent regime will herald. My noble friend has responded constructively to the strong views expressed around the House that a requirement for good design should be written plainly on the face of the Bill. I suspect that she has negotiated toughly and effectively with other government departments that did not readily recognise its importance, notwithstanding that good design will save time and money in their projects.</p>

<a name="81106-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08110633000380"></a>I also thank noble Lords who have spoken in a series of debates in which we have made the case for the importance of good design and for the Government finding more effective ways to promote it. There is a world of difference between reliance on generalised aspiration in policy statements and specific duties laid in statute; between the policy for the time being of the Government and the settled will of Parliament. With these amendments, the Secretary of State will have no choice but to insist that all concerned in the new development consent process take conscious thought and make a genuine effort to achieve a high standard of design whatever kind of infrastructure they have in hand. We could not assume that this would have happened without a clear requirement in statute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08110633000381"></a>Of course developers and the commission would have sought to achieve something that worked, but

All the pressures for haste and cheapness would have driven them towards developments that were adequate for their function, but no more than that. If Clauses 5 and 10 are amended in the terms of Amendments Nos. 23 and 37, developers and the commission will know that it is their duty to do their job not only adequately but well. Not only will this requirement make it more likely that highly visible features of our built environment will perform well and be satisfying in appearance, but it will influence our whole national culture of design for the better.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, mentioned, one of the primary aims of the Bill must be to hasten our ability to react to and fight against the danger of climate change that threatens this country in various ways.

He has got it right: there is no doubt that the Bills need to be inextricably linked. The question is whether the Bill and the government amendments go far enough. When planning documents must now definitely contribute to mitigation and so on, the right reverend Prelate&#146;s reference to the words &#147;taking account of&#148; and &#147;having regard to&#148; being in the Bill simply makes the case.</p>

<a name="81106-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08110633000386"></a>This is a very important point and I am disappointed that the Government have not picked up this relationship and made it plain on the face of the Bill. This is not a place for something to be implicit&#151;it needs to be explicit. The trilogy of Bills that we are considering in this Session will have a profound effect for a very long time. Anything which, heaven help us, contributes to dilution or to the possibility of excuses for dilatory action in the present situation simply is not tolerable. The principle of the Climate Change Bill imposes a very strong and difficult programme which has to begin now and go on at least until 2050. The depth of change that is required over that period will be very

<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08110633000391"></a>I would hazard a guess that it was after this proposal was debated in Committee that the Government announced the changes they wished to make to the Climate Change Bill and accepted the advice of the Committee on Climate Change, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Turner, to go for the 80 per cent target. In a sense, that sets the new context in which we should be discussing these amendments. I suggest that even if Ministers wanted to run away from the implication of that in planning terms&#151;which they do not&#151;it would not be possible because the hugely challenging 80 per cent target means that it will be an imperative for Ministers to do what is necessary to ensure that we meet those targets, not because the target has been set, but because we know that meeting the 80 per cent target is the only way that we will contain the temperature rise to 2 degrees centigrade, which is absolutely critical, as the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, clearly pointed out.</p>

<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_389"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 389</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>amendment. We believe that any duties in relation to climate change need to fall on Ministers in performing their role of drawing up and designing the national policy statements. As we have made clear, the ministerial role in the new system is to set out policy in national policy statements that should take account of all relevant policy considerations and be the primary policy framework for IPC decision-making. The role of the IPC is then to examine applications for development consent, taking into account the national policy statement, any local impact report from local authorities, any matters prescribed in secondary legislation and any other matters that the IPC thinks are important and relevant to its decision whether to approve. The IPC is required to determine applications in accordance with the national policy statement except to the extent that one of the exceptions set out in Clause 102(4) to (8) applies. Chiefly, that means that the proposal must not be in breach of the law and its adverse impacts must not outweigh its benefits.</p>

<a name="81106-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08110633000393"></a>There is no question but that the role of the national policy statement is key. Ensuring at the outset that the policy is right and that appropriate weight is given to the various considerations will mean that they are then appropriately examined at each stage of the process. But here comes the reservation. If we were to place duties on the IPC in respect of policy on climate change or any other matter, there is a risk of detracting from ministerial accountability for policy and undermining the principles on which the new regime is built.</p>

Surely the duty needs to fall ultimately on the applicants. That is the issue that we need to get across. If we followed the amendments of the right reverend Prelate, the contribution to mitigation would be shifted across to the applicant, who would have to show how their application made a contribution. That is an extension of what the Minister is saying. It is not enough to discuss this matter just in the context of the planning commission.</p>

<a name="81106-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08110633000396"></a>We could have a very good, general debate about how we influence developers, communities and applicants to do the right thing in relation to sustainability and climate change. There are many mechanisms under which we do that, with responsibility in a number of government departments. Local authorities have a big role to play, as the noble Lord suggested in an earlier amendment. But the key point is the relationship between Ministers, the national policy statements and the IPC. All I seek to do, in acknowledging the concerns that the right reverend prelate has by introducing government amendments, is to ensure that we do not confuse those responsibilities.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="08110633000709"></a>&#147;Before designating a statement as a national policy statement for the purposes of this Act the Secretary of State must be satisfied&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000398"></a>The substance of the right reverend Prelate&#146;s amendment is a responsibility on the Secretary of State to be satisfied that,</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000763"></a>&#147;policies in the statement contribute to the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000652"></a>sustainability, and all those other things. It is the Secretary of State who must be satisfied to that effect. So I do not follow the Minister&#146;s deduction that the amendment in some way diverts the responsibility from where it clearly lies in the amendment, which is with the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="st_125"></a>
<a name="08110633000399"></a><a name="81106-0011.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="81106-0011.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08110633001377"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, my reading of the amendments tabled by the right reverend Prelate is that it is a requirement for each national policy statement to contribute directly to the mitigation of climate change. Within the context of the 80 per cent target and the need to ensure that we do everything we can, there may be certain circumstances in which it cannot do that. What I am arguing for is some overall flexibility, with Ministers having accountability.</p>

<a name="81106-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08110633000400"></a>I stress at once that the concept of sustainable development sits at the heart of planning. This is made explicit in planning policy statement 1, which sets out how the principles of sustainable development apply to planning generally. In 2005, the Government published <I>Securing the Future</I>, a new sustainable development strategy for the UK, which set out five key principles for sustainable development: living within environmental limits; securing a strong, healthy and just society; achieving a sustainable economy; promoting good governance; and using sound science responsibly. The strategy makes it clear that in order for a policy to achieve sustainability, it must integrate all five of those principles, which is necessary if we are to meet the needs of communities while respecting the limits of our environment and resources. We must therefore look at the social, economic and environmental considerations holistically and integrate them in a way that allows us to promote development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</p>

<a name="81106-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08110633000401"></a>It is important to give the House the Government&#146;s understanding of what we mean by sustainable development, which we believe should be the guiding principle for Ministers in preparing national policy statements. That is why Clause 10 places such importance on it.</p>

<a name="81106-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08110633000402"></a>Issues around climate change&#151;and I speak from my position, wearing my DECC and Defra hats&#151;are very important indeed. The noble Lord, Lord Cameron, made the point that however much we are concerned about financial issues or presidential elections, climate change is the mega-issue that we face. That is why the decision by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change to go for putting the 80 per cent target on to the statute book was so important.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_391"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 391</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81106-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08110633000403"></a>Despite that, other elements of sustainable development are also important and we must have regard to them. I think that the House might agree that, alongside climate change, we have to take account of the need to secure our long-term energy supply, for example. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has powerfully and passionately been asking the House and the Government to ensure security of energy supply. It is also important that we have regard to employment and economic growth. We cannot ignore people&#146;s standard of living and, crucially, other environmental decisions, such as preserving biodiversity.</p>

<a name="81106-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08110633000404"></a>This is where we come to the nub of the argument, which I anticipated earlier. The amendments tabled by the right reverend Prelate would require that, before the Secretary of State designates a statement or amends a national policy statement, he,</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000764"></a>&#147;must be satisfied that (taken as a whole) the policies ... contribute to the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change and to the achievement of sustainable development&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000653"></a>Amendment No. 51A would separate climate change from sustainable development and introduce a new clause that would require the Secretary of State to draw up and review national policy statements,</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000765"></a>&#147;with the objective of contributing to the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000405"></a>Our problem with this is that the amendments would elevate the consideration of climate change to such a degree that the other considerations could be marginalised. There could be risks for other policies, including energy policy.</p>

<a name="81106-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08110633000406"></a>We have made clear our intention to undergo the transition to a low-carbon economy. It will be in statute, provided that your Lordships accept it when the Bill comes back on Monday week. That is the context in which all these other considerations come to the fore. It is the difference between where we were in Committee and where we are now on Report.</p>

<a name="81106-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08110633000407"></a>A basic principle of our climate change policy, as emerges in the Climate Change Bill, is that some individual policies may not necessarily contribute to meeting the targets. We have to accept that. As long as our national effort balances and the overall targets, taken together, are met, that is perfectly acceptable. The problem is not philosophical but practical. We do not want to undermine this prospect by requiring each national policy statement to contribute directly to the mitigation of climate change. We think that that would restrict our freedom of manoeuvre, which is why we have reservations about the amendments tabled by the right reverend Prelate. Ultimately, these decisions have to be made by Ministers. They cannot be made by anyone else.</p>

<a name="81106-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08110633000408"></a>We believe that the amendments that we have tabled create the kind of regime that will enable the concerns of noble Lords to be covered without in the end affecting ministerial responsibility. Our Amendment No. 37 makes it clear that addressing climate change and achieving good design are key and essential elements of the notion of sustainable development. Our amendments aim to highlight the particular importance of climate change and good design but do so as part of the broader sustainable development duty. They make it clear that climate change should be at the forefront of Ministers&#146; minds when drawing up national policy  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_392"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 392</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>statements but that that should be done within the broader objective of achieving sustainable development. That is crucial. Clause 10 underpins and frames the Secretary of State&#146;s actions. It ensures that those principles are always at the forefront of Ministers&#146; minds when drawing up and reviewing national policy statements, which is where they should be.</p>

<a name="81106-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08110633000409"></a>If Clause 10 sets out the principle, Clause 5 will underpin the practice. Amendment No. 25 to Clause 5 requires Ministers to include in each national policy statement an explanation of how the policy takes account of government policy relating to the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change. In effect, Ministers must describe how they have carried out their duty under Clause 10 by reference to wider government policy on the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change. This will, of course, include the Climate Change Bill once it is in place, so ensuring, as I have said, that national policy statements themselves are drawn up in the context of the targets and policies that it puts in place.</p>
<a name="time_21"></a>
<a name="81106-0011.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="08110633000797"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="81106-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08110633000410"></a>These duties should then be seen in the wider context of the processes which the Bill puts in place to ensure that the policy set out in national policy statements is appropriate and robust. First, national policy statements will be subject to an appraisal of sustainability, to ensure that environmental, social and economic objectives, including climate change, are properly factored into their development. This will involve an iterative process of collecting information, defining realistic alternatives, identifying sustainability effects and developing mitigation measures. That will then be fully integrated with the wider national policy statement preparation process, involving statutory consultees during key stages and, where necessary, the draft national policy statement will be revised in light of the appraisal of sustainability.</p>

<a name="81106-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08110633000411"></a>Secondly, national policy statements will be subject to public consultation and, as noble Lords have already debated today, subject to parliamentary scrutiny. If, in the process of scrutiny, Parliament were of the view that climate change&#151;or, indeed, design, which we shall come to in a moment&#151;had not been properly taken account of, it could make a resolution or recommendation in respect of that.</p>

<a name="81106-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08110633000412"></a>I emphasise that Ministers will be bound by the provisions of the Climate Change Bill once enacted, and will need to ensure that, taken together, government policy achieves the targets that it sets out. This is the key point: it is taken together. It must be seen as a collective government effort. Inevitably there will be some&#151;I hate to say it&#151;swings and roundabouts, but there must also be some balancing between the different national policy statements. In some areas, it will probably not be possible to show a contribution on climate change, but there will be a national interest in taking that policy forward. All of this happens within the context of the 80 per cent target enshrined in legislation. That is a critical point.</p>

<p><a name="08110633000654"></a>That ties up with what the Minister was saying earlier. Can he confirm that one of the adverse impacts that might offset the benefits of a development would be the fact that it did not contribute to the objectives about climate change? In that case, it seems that what he said earlier&#151;that the overriding requirement of climate change cannot apply automatically to every application&#151;must be right. There must be times when the national need for infrastructure must outweigh that. The Minister is nodding. Perhaps he can confirm that that is what the Bill means.</p>

We undoubtedly face a challenge in terms of the number of generating stations which are due to go out of business over the next 10 to 12 years. One way or another, we shall have to tackle that matter. Clearly, such issues must come into play as well. I hope that satisfies the noble Lord.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08110633000417"></a>I again pay tribute to my noble friends Lord Howarth and Lady Whitaker in relation to government Amendments Nos. 23 and 37 on design. Although I was not present when design was debated, my noble friend Lady Andrews has kept me well informed about them. As someone who has worked very closely with CABE over the years, I am very glad that she has allowed me to speak to those government amendments. I believe that the amendments will considerably enhance the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08110633000418"></a>As regards the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Reay, it is a great pleasure to debate these matters with him. We had a similar debate only yesterday. I very much understand the issues that he raises. His Amendment No. 37A seeks to amend government Amendment No. 37 by adding &#147;respecting high quality landscape&#148; to the requirement for the Secretary of State to,</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000767"></a>&#147;have regard to the desirability of mitigating, and adapting to, climate change&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000655"></a>and &#147;achieving good design&#148;. I do not know whether this will comfort him but the Government have always made it clear that wind farms should be located in appropriate places, and that local concerns should be listened to. I suspect the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, thinks that local concerns have been listened to rather too much as regards those matters. None the less, we believe that the appropriate guidance has been given within the formal planning procedure. I understand that PPS22 on renewable energy of the Department for Communities and Local Government highlights the need to take account of environmental impacts in

The noble Lord asked about sites of specific special interest. I am happy to write to him to give him further detail on that, but there are existing policies for those areas. There are clear duties on public bodies with regard to the statutory purpose of these areas when exercising or performing any function relating to or affecting land within them. However, as I say, I am happy to write to him to provide more detail.</p>

<a name="81106-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08110633000419"></a>I think I have made it clear that design and climate change considerations are component elements of sustainable development. I have no doubt that the desirability of preserving high-quality landscape is another. However, we run into what I call the list problem. One has to be careful of setting out a long list of component parts of sustainable development in the Bill. I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Reay, that impact on landscapes is among the impacts that will be assessed through the appraisal of sustainability, and we believe that it is captured by the notion of sustainable development, which we have discussed at length. I reassure noble Lords that I understand the importance of the new planning process being considered very much in the context of the challenge of climate change. There is no greater challenge that this nation or the world faces.</p>

<a name="81106-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08110633000420"></a>For the reasons that I have expressed, I hope that noble Lords will accept that there is a very germane reason why there still needs to be some flexibility for Ministers. There are some circumstances where climate change is not the only consideration. That is why the amendments that we tabled today probably meet the requirement of the right reverend Prelate. I am happy to have further discussions with the right reverend Prelate about this. I hope that, if he does not agree with me, at least he will accept that we are trying to sing from the same hymn sheet, if I may say that, on the importance of climate change.</p>

Good design is important, and I supported it in Committee, but landscape and siting are equally important. We were given a very good example at the meeting that the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, held before Committee stage, of where a developer insisted on putting some structure on top of a cliff when it could have been moved down the hill and a couple of miles into a wood and been hidden. Not only would the design have been better, but the landscape would have been better. To some of us, the siting of major infrastructure is probably more important in some instances than the design. If the noble Lord would look this way and not just in his wing mirrors, and give a little help to this side of the House, it would be appreciated.</p>

I agree with the noble Lord that the ultimate responsibility lies with the Secretary of State; but because we have before the House a Bill with new powers and with unique authority being given to the Infrastructure Planning Commission, it is all the more important to send out a message. That message must be at the heart of what the Secretary of State says. The Secretary of State and the national policy statement must be bound into contributing to the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. For that reason, I should like to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08110633000430"></a>At the previous stage, I sought to take out the word &#147;suitable&#148;, as applying to a location, on the basis that  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_397"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 397</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>any location could be no more than &#147;potentially suitable&#148;. In several places, the Bill uses the words &#147;suitable (or potentially suitable)&#148;. However, it does not seem to me that anything can be regarded as more than potentially suitable. I felt that the Minister made my case for me, and I shall refer to some of the things that she said on 6 October. She said that the terms were virtually interchangeable, but I do not agree. She added:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="08110633000711"></a>&#147;They highlight that the suitability itself might be conditional on external factors. One cannot set out specific criteria for these situations in all cases&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000656"></a>Indeed. Therefore, because of conditionality, the Bill should refer only to &#147;potentially suitable&#148;. The suitability of a location must be,</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000768"></a>&#147;ultimately dependent on the details of the particular project proposal&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000657"></a>indeed, only potentially suitable.</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="08110633000712"></a>&#147;The IPC would have to look closely at the details ... It would have to look at the specific application and the precise siting of potential impacts to determine whether the application was appropriate to go in the place identified&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/10/08; col. 105.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000658"></a>I could go on, but I think I have probably made the point. I hope that the Minister can explain what I was missing the first time around and what I am still missing in understanding the desirability of both phrases&#151;that to include &#147;suitable&#148; does not pre-empt other decisions that need to be made. That goes to Amendments Nos. 18, 19, 30, 124 and 125.</p>

<a name="81106-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08110633000431"></a>Amendment No. 20 would delete the identification of a statutory undertaker as appropriate to carry out a development. In Committee and in a very long letter sent to noble Lords since then, for which I thank her very much&#151;it was daunting, but as one got into it, it was very readable&#151;the Minister&#146;s argument was that this would mess up Clause 172, which deals with blight. Under Clause 172 the person who bears responsibility for the blight is the statutory undertaker, if identified in the national policy statement. If one is not identified, then it is the Secretary of State. There is a degree of circularity here. If there is only one undertaker, the Secretary of State should sort out the financial matters with the undertaker and that should not override what I see as a certain lack of propriety in identifying one undertaker if there is more than one candidate. If a single candidate is to carry out a particular development as the statutory undertaker, there is no need to identify it anyway.</p>

<a name="81106-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08110633000432"></a>We did not discuss Amendment No. 22 in these terms in Committee, but it seeks some clarity in the Bill, which I hope does little more than reflect what we have already been told, which is to insert a provision that an NPS should set out the extent to which it supersedes any other government policy&#151;that is, planning policy statement, planning policy guidance or other documentation providing planning policy. In other words, it makes the hierarchy clear and ensures that those who apply the policies are completely clear about which takes precedence. In the planning world, I think we are all used to the term &#147;emerging policy&#148;, which is a useful cop-out for, &#147;We haven&#146;t quite settled this, but this is the direction we are going in&#148;. I should perhaps say that with apologies to some planners. It would be helpful to have complete clarity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08110633000433"></a>Amendment No. 24 goes back to suitability. It is an attempt to encompass the assurances that we have been given by the Government. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="08110633000713"></a>&#147;The identification of a location as potentially suitable&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000659"></a>since I do not accept that any location can be suitable full stop,</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000769"></a>&#147;for a specified description of development shall not be conclusive as to the suitability of any site which is the subject of an application for planning permission&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000660"></a>in other words, is outside the IPC regime&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000770"></a>&#147;or for a development consent order&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000661"></a>which would be within the IPC regime. We had many assurances that the IPC is independent and that it is required to pay proper attention to all proper planning matters and to pay attention&#151;more than pay attention&#151;to the local impact statement. I have particular concern that if the Secretary of State identifies a location or a site, no discretion will be left for the IPC or the planning authority and the local impact statement would be completely worthless. I believe that that is not what the Government intend, but it would be worth spelling out here or elsewhere precisely how the suitability point bites and where it does not bite. I beg to move.</p>

I hope my noble friend will accept that if we are to make a success of national strategy in planning&#151;nobody is more in favour of that than I am&#151;identification and ownership of the plan, right down to the immediate community level, is terribly important to enable people to identify with what is being planned so that the spirit is there in implementation. If not, we will have a minimalist approach to implementation, which would be very unfortunate. Where work is done by those with responsibility at local regional level, it is important that it is seen to be taken seriously before national decisions are made, otherwise there is resentment and a feeling that things are being forced upon people, and feet will be dragged. Undermining and &#147;Operation Clawback&#148; will begin. That would be very sad.</p>

I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to them. She focused on the technical aspects of what an NPS is and does, which are set out in Clause 5. Amendments Nos. 18 and 19, together with consequential Amendments Nos. 30, 124 and 125, probe how far an NPS can go in identifying locations as suitable for development by removing the provision that an NPS may identify locations as suitable in the first place.</p>

<a name="81106-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08110633000436"></a>The noble Baroness made it clear that she believes that the Secretary of State should only be able to identify locations that are potentially suitable, making clear that the IPC will therefore have genuine discretion for an independent decision. I take the point she made.  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_399"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 399</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>In Amendment No. 24 she wants to ensure that identifying a location as potentially suitable should not bring with it a conclusive decision about its suitability for a particular project.</p>

<a name="81106-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08110633000437"></a>I will come to her Amendments Nos. 20, 22 and 26 as I go through my speaking note, because I think that they are linked.</p>

<a name="81106-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08110633000438"></a>Perhaps I may deal with the key issue of &#147;potentially suitable&#148; as opposed to &#147;suitable&#148;&#151;whether we are dealing with semantics or a serious concept. The noble Baroness has argued that, in logic, all locations identified in an NPS can only ever be potentially suitable, because the IPC will still need to consider local impact and the other matters in subsections (4) to (8) of Clause 102. If they outweigh the benefits, the application could be refused.</p>

<a name="81106-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08110633000439"></a>I do not think that I made a very good fist of explaining that in Committee, and as the noble Baroness read it back to me I became even more convinced of that, so let me take another stab at it. In the first place, although Clause 5 permits an NPS to identify a location as suitable, it certainly does not mean that the IPC will have no discretion to refuse an application for development at that location. As I said, the IPC will need to consider the issues raised as a result of the tests in Clause 102(4) to (8). However, as the noble Baroness will understand, Clause 5 relates solely to the Secretary of State&#146;s view expressed in terms of policy on an NPS; it does not relate to any decision of the IPC. Clause 5 permits the Secretary of State to come to a clear view about locations that in his or her view are suitable, but the final decision about whether development can go ahead in a location rests with the IPC. That is governed by Clause 102, not Clause 5.</p>

<a name="81106-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08110633000440"></a>Let me be clearer than I think I was in Committee about the definition. There is a defensible difference between policy that identifies a location as suitable and that which identifies a location as potentially suitable. The former is, clearly, more certain; the latter suggests that certain conditions still need to be satisfied or obstacles overcome before a location becomes suitable. Perhaps I can explain this in the context of the IPC&#146;s decision-making framework. If an NPS says that, in the Secretary of State's view, a location is suitable for a particular type of development, the IPC will be required to decide an application in accordance with the NPS unless one of the exceptions set out in Clause 102 (4) to (8) applies.</p>

<a name="81106-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08110633000441"></a>The starting point for the IPC in that case would be that the Secretary of State considers the location to be suitable, and weighed against that would be the issues raised by Clause 102(4) to (8). Those issues could include whether special consideration of alternative locations was required if it was a habitat site, how far alternative locations had been considered by the Secretary of State in coming to the view, and whether there were local adverse impacts that the Secretary of State had not taken into account in coming to that view. However, if an NPS says that a site is potentially suitable, the starting point for the IPC would be that there are matters that must be addressed before the site can be considered suitable. The IPC would still need to come to a view on those matters and would then need to

I think that that is a solid distinction.</p>

<a name="81106-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08110633000442"></a>The amendments would restrict the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to identify suitable sites for NSIPs in a national policy statement and, therefore, his or her ability to take responsibility and accountability for that policy. The noble Baroness will understand that I cannot accept that amendment.</p>

<a name="81106-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08110633000443"></a>Amendment No. 24 goes to the heart of the matter. I should be absolutely clear that if an NPS were to identify a location as suitable or potentially suitable for development, that would in no way predetermine the outcome of a decision whether to grant development consent.</p>

<a name="81106-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08110633000444"></a>The IPC will always be required to consider any application in the context of the provisions for the examination of applications set out in Clause 102, and will be able to refuse consent in the circumstances set out in the clause. However, the noble Baroness has made an important point, which I accept, about clarity and certainty. I understand the concerns, and will take the matter away and consider it further to determine whether we can do something to make this clearer. Clause 5 may not be the appropriate place for clarification, because, as I have said, it is important that we maintain the distinction between policy-making and decision-making. We may be able to clarify this to her satisfaction in the decision test. If she withdraws the amendment, I will give the matter more thought.</p>

<a name="81106-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08110633000445"></a>I will not be able to give the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, as much satisfaction on Amendment No. 20, which deals with statutory undertakers. In Committee, noble Lords argued that NPSs should focus on policy issues alone and should not be distracted by the detail of who should carry out development. I went into this in some detail in my letter, and it is hard for me to improve on that. We may simply have to agree to disagree.</p>

<a name="81106-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08110633000446"></a>There is a pressing reason why this provision is necessary. Clause 5(5)(e) should be read alongside Clause 172, which defines appropriate authority, as she knows, for the purposes of Chapter 2, Part VI, of the Town and Country Planning Act. At the risk of d&#233;j  vu, I must repeat that removing the provision to identify statutory undertakers would result in the Secretary of State, rather than the promoter, becoming liable under the blight provisions in Clause 172. The problem is that this could greatly restrict the content of an NPS, as identifying sites as potentially suitable for development would render the Secretary of State liable for compensation for any blight caused. This would not be appropriate, because it is the promoter who will ultimately benefit from any such development, so they, not the taxpayer, should bear the burden of compensation.</p>

<a name="81106-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08110633000447"></a>Amendment No. 26 would require the NPS to set out how the policy in it relates to the provisions of other policy statements. Noble Lords seek to ensure that NPSs are consistent with one another and have proper regard for the policies that each sets out. Noble Lords also seek to ensure that they reflect the reality of the rest of the planning system and are consistent with it. I certainly agree. Indeed, the Bill is a huge step forward in this regard. For the first time, nationally significant infrastructure will be planned for and decided  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_401"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 401</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>according to a single consent process, rather than through the minefield of consent regimes that we have now. However, it is neither appropriate nor practical to require NPSs to set out how each relates to every other NPS.</p>

<a name="81106-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08110633000448"></a>It is clear that in some cases NPSs will have close links with other NPSs. I recall our debate in Committee on the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley&#151;who unfortunately is not in his place at the moment&#151;on the transport NPSs. In other cases, however, there will be little common ground. On the other hand, NPSs will be linked to a wide range of policies outside the new regime, and those relationships will often be critical. NPSs will have to justify their policy within the wider orbit of relevant policies on transport, energy, the environment and planning, with the objective of contributing to the achievement of sustainable development. NPSs will need to explain and give evidence of those relationships. However, they will be different in each situation and will therefore be complex, so it would not be practical to place a requirement in the Bill that would constrain them artificially.</p>

<a name="81106-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08110633000449"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 22 would require each NPS to set out the extent to which it supersedes policy in a planning policy statement or any other statement of government policy. I sympathise with the purpose of the amendment, but if an NPS were to render policy out of date, this should be clear. However, NPSs will usually be narrowly focused. They will set out policy only on certain types of infrastructure above the threshold. The main thrust of this policy will apply above the thresholds set out in the Bill, although obviously as statements of government policy they will influence the TCP system to a degree.</p>

<a name="81106-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08110633000450"></a>Planning policy statements and White Papers are fundamentally different as they are drawn up for different purposes. For the IPC, the NPS is the primary policy framework. When other planning policy statements and White Papers with their own particular purposes and functions are out of date, they are either revised or replaced with another document with a similar purpose. The problem with the amendment is that there is a blurring of the line between different types of policy statement, which is not very helpful. Under the TCP system, the decision must be made in accordance with the statutory development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. The point raised by the noble Baroness is rather complex and I have replied in a rather elaborate way. If she will allow, I should like to write to her on this point, which is important and should be placed on the record.</p>

I will not press the point on the statutory undertaker, although I still think that Clause 172 should be sorted out instead of being prayed in aid as the excuse for keeping Clause 5 as it is. Clause 5 should not give a particular statutory undertaker an advantage if there are other candidates. Clause 22 is complex. We will have to have confidence that the NPS will make the position clear if there is scope for confusion, but I look forward to what the Minister might write.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08110633000452"></a>As regards Amendment No. 24 and the other amendments to which it is linked, in substance if not in drafting, I absolutely take the point that Clause 102, on the decision-making process, probably is the place to deal with that issue. I am pleased to hear what the Minister has said and I am even more pleased that she will think about it further. To have something in the Bill that says no more than we have heard from the Government but makes absolutely clear the position would be extremely helpful and would give a lot of reassurance to people who have more cynicism about these matters than I should wish to express at this point. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="81106-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08110633000456"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, Amendment No. 21 on assessing flood risk adds to the list in Clause 5(5), so that it would read:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="08110633000715"></a>&#147;The policy set out in a national policy statement may in particular ... set out the flood risk of identified locations&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000662"></a>When the Housing and Regeneration Bill was debated in this House, I moved similar amendments on flooding. Your Lordships will be relieved that I shall not regurgitate all the arguments. The House is only too well aware of the arguments and the problems. So I shall cut to the chase. Earlier this summer, my noble friend Lord Rotherwick sponsored an excellent debate on flood management. Then the noble Lord, Lord Davies, repeated a Statement on the Pitt report. Following the floods in 2007, there have been a number of Questions on flooding.</p>

<a name="81106-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="08110633000457"></a>Your Lordships will recall that after the floods in 2007, power was disrupted and bottled water had to be shipped into areas because installations were damaged. In this House, a Question was asked about how many similar installations there are in the country in danger of flooding. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, answered that there were hundreds. Unfortunately, my amendment on flooding in the Housing Bill was not accepted by the Government. In Committee, the Minister used PPS25 in her defence. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="08110633000716"></a>&#147;The point about PPS25 is that it gives us, for the first time, a hierarchy of risk, which we identify in terms of where we can build with modification. How do we assess the nature of the risk and what do we have to do ... you cannot not build on flood areas in this country; you must assess the risk. That is where the Environment Agency comes in. PPS25 gives us a much more accurate tool than we have ever had before&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/6/08; col. GC40.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000663"></a>When I pressed my amendment on Report, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, responded for the Government by saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="08110633000717"></a>&#147;The proper place for considerations such as these is within the planning regime. We will have the opportunity to debate this when the Planning Bill comes to your Lordships&#146; House later this month&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 7/7/08; col. 566.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000664"></a>So here we are.</p>

<a name="81106-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08110633000459"></a>I agree with the Minister when she says that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="08110633000718"></a>&#147;You cannot not build on flood areas in this country&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/6/08; col. GC40.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000665"></a>Of course she is right, but where this happens, mitigating action should be undertaken to ensure that development is flood resilient and resistant where necessary. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said that there were hundreds of existing installations up and down the country that are in danger from flooding. We must not repeat past mistakes when considering future infrastructure installations. My amendment provides that when the IPC is considering an application, it must assess the flood risk so that any mistakes made in the past are not repeated.</p>

<a name="81106-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08110633000460"></a>There are two types of flood risk: heavy rain or rivers bursting their banks and, as my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith said in Committee, flooding due to rising sea levels. He went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="08110633000719"></a>&#147;The thought of a nuclear power station being inundated in half a century&#146;s time ... A large load of radioactive material being lapped by the sea, would not be tolerable&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/10/08; col. 97.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000666"></a>Of course he is quite right. As an example my noble friend highlighted Dungeness which is located on the end of a long spit of very low-lying sand, all of which is susceptible to rising sea levels. Would we or should we build the next generation of nuclear power stations on a similar site? Perhaps not, if a flood risk assessment was made.</p>

<a name="81106-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08110633000461"></a>I am absolutely certain that the noble Baroness in responding to the amendment will fall back on PPS25 for her defence. First, can she guarantee that the IPC will as a matter of course be required to comply with PPS25 for all applications that come before it? Secondly, is PPS25 robust enough? I am sure that the Minister will argue that it is, but others are not so sure. In his review of flooding, Sir Michael Pitt concluded that there is a need to strengthen and reinforce the provision of PPS25 and the building regulations to ensure that flood resistance and resilience measures are fully built into all new developments where necessary. Sir John Harman, as chairman of the Environment Agency, said in response to the Pitt review that urgent review and consolidation of flood risk management legislation will, however, be needed if your recommendations are to be turned into action. Consideration by Government of a new Water Bill is, in our view, vital to rationalise outdated legislation and to give full effect to your recommendations.</p>

<a name="81106-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08110633000462"></a>I do not pretend to be an expert on flooding, but here we have two experts who say that the current legislation, and in particular PPS25, is not up to the job. The likelihood of the Government strengthening PPS25 or introducing a water Bill in the near future is remote, hence the need to have a requirement in the Bill to assess the flood risk of identified locations. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08110633000464"></a>My noble friend is right: the Government will run for cover, will not want to be helpful to us and will say that PPS25 is the answer. It is not the answer. It is not

<a name="81106-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="08110633000465"></a>The Government development in east London, where many houses were built on the flood plain when Mr Prescott was in charge&#151;it was one of his not so good moves&#151;is one example of where the Government have not a grip of what this policy is all about. I hope the Minister will reflect that this is a serious matter for major infrastructure. PPS25 is inadequate and something ought to be on the face of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="08110633000466"></a><a name="81106-0013.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="81106-0013.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08110633001391"></a>Baroness Ford:</b> My Lords, I do not recognise the caricature of PPS25 in the way it has been described today. In my experience, not only is PPS25 robust but on at least two occasions it led to an organisation of which I was in charge to pull back from a planning application. Contrary to what was attributed to Sir John Harman, the statutory process of consulting the Environment Agency also provides an important flooding safeguard. Flooding is an enormously important issue, as the noble Earl said, but it is unfair to characterise government action&#151;PPS25, in particular&#151;and the role of the Environment Agency in quite the way that we have heard today.</p>

<a name="08110633000467"></a><a name="81106-0013.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="81106-0013.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08110633001392"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for that remark; she put the position more powerfully than I could. I have tried to be as helpful as I can throughout the course of the Bill. I shall continue to try to be helpful, including trying to explain to the noble Earl opposite, who makes a powerful and important case, why he can be reassured by not only PPS25 but other matters as well. I am glad to have another opportunity to reassure the House that the risk of flooding will be addressed when NPSs are being drawn up.</p>

<a name="81106-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="08110633000468"></a>The August before last, I spent a considerable amount of time touring the country. My department deals with flood resilience and I spent a great deal of time looking into the damp and wet basements of people who had been flooded in South Yorkshire, Sheffield and Oxfordshire. We understand the human tragedy when people get flooded and the risks that are posed to some of our infrastructure. Therefore, when I say that the NPSs have to take into account the risk of flooding as part of national policy, I am very serious about it.</p>

<a name="81106-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08110633000469"></a>On the issue of PPS25, yes, of course the IPC will have to comply with it, as it will have to comply with all aspects of government policy. Sir Michael Pitt agreed with the Government and the Environment Agency that the policy in PPS25 is right and that it should be rigorously applied by local planning authorities. We intend to examine whether there any barriers to delivery which may be hindering local authorities from implementing PPS25. We are working closely with planning authorities, the Environment Agency and other stakeholders to make sure that that policy is in place on the ground. We issued a revised practice guide in June this year; set up regional workshops to deliver the message; we have made it compulsory to consult the Environment Agency on planning applications in flood risk areas; and we have issued a flooding

<a name="81106-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08110633000470"></a>The NPS has to integrate, reflect and abide by relevant government policy at the time, including having regard to the policy and tests set out in PPS25 on the risk of flooding. It has to be applied where it is relevant.</p>

<a name="81106-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08110633000471"></a>What is key to what the NPS is able to do and say in areas where there might be issues such as flooding is the appraisal of sustainability. That will assess the various impacts of policy at a strategic level, and that includes flood risk. Where flooding is identified as a key risk, the appraisal will address the issue in detail. Some infrastructure will not be at risk of flooding, such as offshore wind farms&#151;a very helpful example provided by the Box. Clearly it would not be right in all cases to require detailed assessment simply for the sake of it. However, consideration will be given to the risk of flooding for each NPS. It will be taken into account as part of the appraisal process and addressed as appropriate in the NPS.</p>

<a name="81106-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08110633000472"></a>Once we start identifying bits of policy here and there, we are open to what my noble friend Lord Hunt referred to as the list principle, refracting policy through individual policies. That is not what the NPS is about: it is about integration. Under Clause 5(6), Ministers,</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000771"></a>&#147;must give reasons for the policy set out in the statement&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000667"></a>It can also be expected that an explanation of these factors at this point will in some instances include flooding.</p>

<a name="81106-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08110633000473"></a>Finally, the NPSs will be subject to public consultation and parliamentary scrutiny, both of which are very alive to the issue of flooding. Those factors will make doubly sure that NPSs take full and proper account of all these matters, including the risk of flooding, before they are designated.</p>

<a name="81106-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08110633000474"></a>I hope that that reassures the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, who has been a champion of this issue since we began proceedings on the Bill. I understand why he is doing it and hope that he will be reassured.</p>

I would use the list-principle argument that she used against me on the previous amendment to ask whether the subsections restrict the Secretary of State. When there is a change of government and a new Secretary of State, there is bound to be a change in some of the national policy statements out of pure politics. If we go back to 1997, the new Labour Government would have changed the national policy statements on roads and nuclear power. When a new Secretary of State takes over for an incoming Government, he will review the national policy statement. There might have been a manifesto pledge to build more roads or whatever the infrastructure might be. I am concerned that new subsections (1B) and (1C) are a little limiting in that respect. I would therefore be grateful if the Minister paid particular attention to that. She will not have been surprised to hear what I have said, because I raised much the same point in Committee.</p>

It would amend Clause 11, which lists points reflected in the Government&#146;s amendments. We have seen the list before. My amendment would change Clause 11(2) to require the Secretary of State to suspend operation if he thought that there had been a significant change in circumstances, that the change had not been anticipated and that, if it had been, policy would have been materially different. This should not be discretionary. One would expect that the Secretary of State must and should suspend the operation. I compare this clause with Clause 6, which is a &#147;must&#148; clause. It says:</p>

I hope that noble Lords will allow me to express my puzzlement as to why Clause 13 should not apply to Scotland.</p>

<a name="81106-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08110633000498"></a>I accept that it is the Government&#146;s intent that the Bill should have no practical effect in Scotland, because we recognise that the actual process of granting planning permission is a devolved function. But the Bill is fairly clear about which clauses apply to Scotland and which do not. Clauses 1 to 12 appear to apply to Scotland and, as such, whether as an unintended consequence or otherwise, and at some future date as well, at least a national policy statement might consider the Scottish dimension. Given that, it is possible that the Scottish Executive or some other Scottish entity might want to appeal to a court at some future point. Certainly, given the phrasing of the Bill, that could be on proposals for an electric line above ground, under Clause 16(1)(d), or a gas pipeline, as envisaged at Clause 20(2), in which the point at which the construction reaches the Scottish border will have a clear implication for how the engineering works will continue when they are within Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="08110633000499"></a>On the question of cross-border services, will the Minister clarify for me how things stand for railways? In answering my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour in Committee on 8 October, she said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000772"></a>&#147;the arrangements for Scotland are within the devolution settlement&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 8/10/08; col. 273.]</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000669"></a>I spent some time following the progress of the Scotland Act, and noble Lords will be aware that under Section E2 of Schedule 5 the provision and regulation of services was in the first instance reserved to Westminster. Later, on 13 June 2002, I and other noble Lords took part in the consideration of what became Statutory Instrument 2002/1629. It amended Schedule 5 to allow railways in Scotland to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. In our discussion of the meaning of that statutory instrument, the Minister said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="08110633000727"></a>&#147;The order amends Section E2 of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act. It transfers to the Scottish Parliament legislative competence over powers for the promotion and construction of railways in Scotland ... In future, permissions for railway projects that are wholly within Scotland will be granted at Holyrood and only cross-border developments will continue to be dealt with at Westminster&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/6/02; cols. 449-450.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="81106-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="08110633000500"></a>It appears to me that there is a role for this Parliament in considering cross-border railway developments, although the noble Baroness may not want to include that in the Bill at this point of time. However, given that Clauses 1 to 12 have Scottish implications, someone might at some future date try to incorporate the issue into legislation. Perhaps the Minister could throw some light on the Government&#146;s attitude to this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="08110633000502"></a>It is right to say that the Bill has tangential effects on Scotland. In effect, however, it extends to England and Wales and not beyond, except for particular instances

I am not entirely sure what amendment we are speaking to, but the noble Duke raised the issue of Clause 13. I believe that, were there to be an issue in that context, it would be open to an interested person in Scotland to raise proceedings in the courts in England and Wales to challenge the national policy statement. However, the circumstances in which that might happen seem pretty remote and unusual, simply because national policy statements will not extend to Scotland. Of course, Scotland has its own national policy framework&#151;the spatial plan&#151;which is in some ways identical to the national policy statements but in other ways very different. I do not know whether that helps to resolve some of the issues that the noble Duke has raised, but I thought that I should give my understanding of the position, which I hope is shared by the Front Bench.</p>

We talk about expertise in the House of Lords and, my word, it comes in handy sometimes.</p>

<a name="81106-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08110633000504"></a>I will come to the points about Scotland, but let me first speak generally about the amendments. This area of reviewing national policy statements was the subject of great debate in Committee, when it became clear to us that noble Lords wanted more clarity about the criteria that the Secretary of State should take into account when deciding when to review the statements. In Committee, the noble Lords, Lord Dixon-Smith and Lord Jenkin, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, urged that the Secretary of State should review national policy statements at frequent intervals.</p>

<a name="81106-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="08110633000505"></a>I think that there is general agreement that it is essential that the decisions of the IPC should be taken on the basis of policies that remain valid and not on the basis of NPSs that are, to use a word used in Committee, &#147;stale&#148;. To do otherwise would be to undermine the credibility of the process. However, I have some problems with the amendments tabled by the noble Lord. As he kindly said, my amendments address the substance of his concern. Clearly, what we did not want was non-stop review of NPSs and the instability that that would cause. It is worth thinking back to the contribution in Committee of the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, who is not in his place at the moment. He said that we should be attempting,</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000773"></a>&#147;to find a form of words that commits the Government of the day to a serious policy and to making every effort to get everybody to agree with it, but which admits to the possibility that, in exceptional circumstances and after careful consideration, you might have to change it&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/10/08; col. 629.]</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000506"></a>That is absolutely right. The aim of national policy statements must be to set out a policy that meets the national need for infrastructure into the medium-term to long-term future. There is a benefit to having some continuity in such policy statements, while at the same time keeping flexibility to react when circumstances change. A review of the policy should be triggered by unforeseen changes, not simply by the passage of time. Some things will hold good. As we debated in Committee, there are different stages of change and some areas of policy are likely to change more dramatically and frequently than others. That is why the test of when an  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_410"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 410</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>NPS needs to be reviewed is nothing to do with the age of the document, but with whether the assumptions underlying that policy remain true and whether it is therefore still fit for purpose. You cannot fit an arbitrary time and date around that.</p>

<a name="81106-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="08110633000507"></a>It is also right that the Secretary of State, as the responsible Minister, should carry that responsibility into judging whether circumstances have or have not changed since the national policy statement was published. We agree with noble Lords that there should be more clarity at this point in the Bill about the criteria which the Secretary of State should take into account when deciding when to review national policy statements. That is simply what we have sought to do through the amendments.</p>

<a name="81106-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="08110633000508"></a>Amendment No. 28 makes that clear. The Secretary of State must consider whether there has been a significant change in any circumstances on which the policy is based since the policy was last reviewed; whether these circumstances were already anticipated in the previous review; and whether, if the change had been anticipated, any of the policy in the statement would have been materially different. To answer the argument in the amendment of noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, the Secretary of State should certainly frequently consider whether these criteria are met, but it is only when the criteria are met that the Secretary of State should review the content of the policy itself. As I explained in Committee, the criteria are the same as those set out in Clause 11, which are the right ones to determine when a national policy statement should be reviewed.</p>

<a name="81106-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="08110633000509"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 28, 29, 38, 39 and 41 seek to clarify that when the Secretary of State wishes to conduct a review of the national policy statement, it could be a complete or a partial review. Amendments Nos. 47 to 51 and 111 to 117 make consequential changes throughout the rest of the Bill, providing an added measure of flexibility so that the Secretary of State can take a proportionate approach to reviewing NPSs. They also make it easier for the Secretary of State to respond quickly if necessary to changing circumstances and to review a national policy statement. If appropriate, the Secretary of State will only need to consider whether circumstances have changed significantly in respect of the part which is to be reviewed; that is obviously much more flexible and sensible. To take a hypothetical example, if further scientific data change our assumptions about the rate of flooding or coastal erosion, the Secretary of State might want to review parts of the relevant national policy statements but not all of them or parts that are unaffected by the change.</p>

<a name="81106-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="08110633000510"></a>Amendments Nos. 111 to 117 are consequential, although they affect individual applications in Part 7. We have also addressed criticism that it was unclear which criteria would be applied to decide whether a review was justified.</p>

<a name="81106-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="08110633000511"></a>I hope that I have reassured noble Lords that we are committed to ensuring that national policy statements must be based on an accurate understanding of present and future circumstances and whether the assumptions underlying that policy remain true. If those circumstances change, we want to ensure that the policy can be reviewed too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="08110633000512"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, asked me whether new subsections (1B) and (1C) in Amendment No. 28 limit what we intend to do. I was not entirely certain which (1B) and (1C) he was talking about, because he will notice that there are two of each in this clause. However, new subsection (1B) relates to the review of a whole national policy statement and new subsection (1C) relates to a review of part of the national policy statement. The two issues are dealt with separately to avoid an extremely long and complicated provision. If the noble Earl was asking about the broader disposition of the clause, it does not limit what can be interpreted as &#147;changing circumstances&#148;. It is a broad definition that allows the Secretary of State to operate with discretion, allowing for flexibility, judgment and changing evidence. We could not anticipate a limit as it is not within our scope or that of the Bill.</p>

<a name="81106-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="08110633000513"></a>The noble Earl has raised a serious political point, because incoming Governments have different values and different priorities. However, as I tried to make clear when we discussed this previously, demography does not change and neither does the need for power and energy. Our demands on water supplies and waste resources do not change. We will need predictable amounts of resource for the homes we must build. An incoming Government wanting to change the disposition of policy will have a national policy statement grounded in evidence. If they believe that a different political decision must be made, they are free to do so and that is a change of circumstance. Clearly, however, we cannot allow for that in the language of the Bill. All we can do is to try to anticipate situations where circumstances have changed. Therefore, the Secretary of State must be free to make a judgment on that basis and to review the NPS.</p>

<a name="81106-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="08110633000514"></a>I cannot improve on my noble and learned friend&#146;s intervention relating to Scotland. I was slightly surprised suddenly to find myself confronted with detailed questions about cross-border issues. The noble Duke said that the Bill reflects the devolution settlement. I shall come back to him after I have read what he said about cross-border issues in relation to previous legislation with which he has been involved. However, I can say something about Clause 13 and judicial review. The special provisions in Clause 13 apply only to England and Wales. I understand that Scots law does not admit time limits on JR, but this means that NPSs can still be challenged in Scotland using normal judicial review rules. I hope that makes sense. I have it on advice, but when I read what he said I shall see whether we can clarify anything in writing.</p>

If there is to be a review in whole or in part, as described in the amendment, one may have to suspend the operation of an NPS. I wholly agree that that should be discretionary and not obligatory. If there is no suspension, clearly the existing NPS continues in force and the planning commission has to continue to make its decisions on the basis of the NPS as it is. However, if it is decided to suspend its operation, does that mean there is then a complete vacuum for the IPC and all applicants until one has gone through the entire procedure after the review to approve the revised NPS? Does the noble Baroness have any idea how long that process might take?</p>

I almost forgot to address Amendment No. 40. I have some sympathy with the noble Baroness&#146;s arguments. It would clearly be inappropriate to have applications decided on the basis of a policy that is no longer valid. It is our intention that where the Secretary of State believes that circumstances have changed such that it is no longer appropriate for decisions to be made in accordance with the NPS, she will suspend it. However, we do not think it is necessary to suspend the NPS in every case where a review is being conducted, not least because, as I said, there is flexibility now about whether you review part or whole of the NPS. It would not invalidate the whole statement if one was looking, for example, only at scientific data about the risk of coastal erosion. One would have to make a judgment about the extent to which the whole NPS would be affected.</p>

The amendment would have an unfortunate consequence, because changing the word from &#147;may&#148; to &#147;must&#148; would remove the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to judge what the appropriate response might be to a change in circumstances. The whole burden of the clarification and review is to ensure that everyone understands that it is the Secretary of State&#146;s judgment that counts and that there is the necessary flexibility to anticipate and interpret what is happening.</p>

<a name="81106-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08110633000520"></a>If we move to the word &#147;must&#148; it is likely that the question of whether circumstances had changed would move from being something on which the Secretary of State can make a judgment to being a question of fact which would ultimately have to be judged by a court. Inevitably, that would lead to an increased risk of legal challenges. I hope that with that assurance the noble Baroness will feel able not to move her amendment. I can give her another assurance: we certainly intend that the Secretary of State would suspend the NPS if there were any risk of unsafe decisions being made on applications on that basis.</p>

<a name="81106-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="08110633000531"></a>In Committee, my noble friend Lord Judd tabled amendments which sought to add national park authorities to the list of local authorities specified in the Bill as statutory consultees at the various relevant stages. The amendments received considerable support, particularly as national park authorities have local planning authority status. We have given this matter careful thought, and we have been persuaded by the powerful arguments made by my noble friend and others.</p>

<a name="81106-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="08110633000532"></a>Amendments Nos. 31, 32, 73, 74, 98 and 99 would therefore add national park authorities and the Broads Authority to the list of local authorities for the purposes of Clauses 8, 43 and 100. Let me outline briefly in more detail what that will mean. The Bill provides a central role for local authorities at all three stages of the new regime. First, relevant local authorities will be statutory consultees on publicity requirements where the national policy statement identifies specific locations for development.</p>

<a name="81106-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="08110633000533"></a>Secondly, the relevant local authority will be a statutory consultee at the project development stage

Promoters will also need to consult the local authority when drawing up their plans to consult the local community about a proposed application, and local authorities will be able to make representations to the IPC if they believe that pre-application consultation has not been adequate, to which the IPC must have regard.</p>

<a name="81106-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="08110633000534"></a>Thirdly, relevant local authorities will be statutory consultees at the examination stage. They will have an important role in ensuring that the IPC takes proper account of relevant local and regional factors and considerations. In particular, they will be invited to prepare a local impact report, which the IPC will have to have regard to in its decisions.</p>

<a name="81106-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="08110633000535"></a>We have listened to the arguments made about national park authorities, and we agree that it is sensible to expand the list of local authorities specified in the Bill to include them. We believe that this would strengthen the Bill, and I hope that noble Lords will be able to support the amendments.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81106-0015.htm"/>


<a name="81106-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="08110633000536"></a>Let me also address Amendments Nos. 33, 75, 100 and 155, tabled by my noble friend Lord Berkeley. I believe that my noble and learned friend Lord Boyd will speak on his behalf. The amendments seek to add integrated transport authorities to the same three lists of local authorities that I mentioned earlier. I am aware that the Local Transport Bill, which recently completed Third Reading in another place, will establish new integrated transport authorities. Amendment No. 155 will expand the existing duty on local transport authorities to develop transport policies which must cover all aspects of transport, rather than the currently more limited requirement relating only to transport facilities and services. However, aside from the fact that we cannot amend the Planning Bill to refer to provisions of another Bill which has not yet been enacted, it would not be right to accept my noble friend&#146;s amendments.</p>

<a name="81106-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="08110633000537"></a>As I have already said, the Bill recognises the important role of local authorities, and local planning authorities in particular, in understanding the nature and circumstances of the communities that they represent and, therefore, in advising the Secretary of State and promoters on how to consult them effectively. Local planning authorities will have expert knowledge of planning issues in the areas for which they are responsible. It is because of this that those authorities are prescribed as statutory consultees in the Bill.</p>

<a name="81106-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="08110633000538"></a>A wide range of other bodies will be engaged at the three key stages, which we will specify in secondary legislation. We expect that this will, where relevant, specify major statutory bodies, including those with local authority status, such as parish councils, fire and rescue authorities, police authorities, and so on. Like those bodies, the role of integrated transport authorities, once they are established, will be a matter for secondary legislation. It would not be appropriate to include the list in the Bill, because it would be unwieldy and would quickly become outdated and inaccurate.</p>

<a name="81106-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="08110633000539"></a>I hope that I have adequately addressed the issues and, therefore, I urge my noble friend not to press Amendments Nos. 100 and 155. I beg to move.</p>

It is good that it is before us and I warmly welcome it. I should put on record my appreciation to all those in other parts of the House, and on this side, who spoke positively and warmly in support of what I sought to achieve. We should also put on record our appreciation of all those outside the House who made strong representations to the Minister.</p>

<a name="81106-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="08110633000541"></a>This is a good moment to take note of the fact that my noble friend Lady Andrews is an outstanding example of a Minister who listens. The way in which she facilitated meetings between me, the noble Lord, Lord Chorley, her officials and herself was very helpful and reassuring. Therefore, I have no qualifications whatever in saying thank you and in recommending the amendment to the House.</p>

<a name="81106-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="08110633000542"></a>Perhaps I may add a postscript. As I said in Committee, a courageous and tough battle was fought by those who established and won the case for the national parks in the post-war years. They are a treasure and a special asset for the whole nation. There should not be any doubt at any time that in everything that the Government are doing they must uphold what those who fought so courageously achieved. We must not allow the parks to drift into the position of being afterthoughts in governmental and administrative matters.</p>

<a name="81106-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="08110633000543"></a>We must also avoid a situation by which, through incremental steps, the national parks slip from being a special asset and become genteel suburban areas or theme parks. That is not what they are about. While they are, of course, places where people work and local communities matter, the government amendment puts a tremendous responsibility on the national park authorities to give constant, imaginative and visionary leadership on this matter and at no time must they leave anyone in doubt that they see themselves as the Praetorian guard of what the parks are there to achieve.</p>

<a name="81106-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="08110633000544"></a>I thank my noble friend for the amendment and I hope that no one will have any doubts about supporting it.</p>

<a name="81106-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="08110633000546"></a>These matters have been dealt with by my noble friend. The Integrated Transport Authorities are a product of the Local Transport Bill, which is currently going through Parliament and renames the Passenger Transport Authorities as ITAs. It is a step-change in the powers of sub-regional transport authorities. The ITAs, among other things, will have a duty to develop local transport policies and there will no longer be a joint duty with district councils. It will have greater powers over buses, an ability to bring forward road-charging schemes and general well-being powers.</p>

<a name="81106-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="08110633000547"></a>Including ITAs in the list would, in my submission, have been fully consistent with the reasons given in Committee by the Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, for the special treatment of local authorities. Like local authorities, they have unique knowledge and expertise in relation to consultation and in relation  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_416"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 416</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the nature and circumstances of the communities that they represent. They would be well qualified to advise the Secretary of State and would have a strategic overview of the area in question.</p>

<a name="81106-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="08110633000548"></a>However, I am happy that the Government listened to these arguments before I even spoke and that they have given an undertaking that they will be considered for secondary legislation.

<a name="81106-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="08110633000557"></a>We are talking about a preferable form of procedure for dealing with the approval of national policy statements. Our Amendment No. 34 adds to Clause 9(2),</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000774"></a>&#147;for the approval ... of both Houses&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000670"></a>so that the Bill would read:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a><a name="08110633000736"></a>&#147;This section sets out the parliamentary requirements referred to in sections 5(4) and 6(4) ... The Secretary of State must lay the proposal before Parliament for the approval ... of both Houses&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08110633000671"></a>That is quite clear and easy to understand. Amendment No. 35, if accepted, would deal with the consequential change and would remove subsections (4) to (7) of Clause 9. That is fairly simple. I acknowledge that the Government&#146;s amendment would remove the rather unfortunate use in subsection (4)(b) of the words &#147;House of Commons&#148; and would insert in their place &#147;either House of Parliament&#148;, but it would leave the approval process in a rather less clearly defined manner for Parliament. Our amendment requires both Houses of Parliament to give approval. The Bill as amended by the Government would read:</p>

<p><a name="08110633000673"></a>This is a matter of degree. I think our wording is simpler, clearer and easier to understand. I know that the noble Baroness will argue that that is not the case. For the life of me, I do not really see, if either House of Parliament can make a resolution with regard to the proposal or a committee of either House makes recommendations with regard to the proposal, why that is approval. I accept that subsection (5) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a><a name="08110633000740"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State must lay before Parliament a statement setting out the Secretary of State&#146;s response to the resolution or recommendations&#148;.</p>

We are back on the issue which we have debated on so many occasions, the integrity of the decision-making process. That is vital to the success and, more importantly, credibility of the Bill. I submit that our amendment, which is shorter and simpler, would leave the Bill in a much easier position for ordinary members of the public to understand. What is more, if ordinary members of the public understand that both Houses of Parliament have approved the national policy statement, they will find it easier to accept that policy statement, as Parliament has given its seal of approval in a positive fashion, and they will be much less likely to wish to challenge it.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said only a moment ago, the role of national policy statements is key. If we get this clause right, the Bill will work and the IPC will have the authority to act resolutely and speedily. If we get it wrong, then delays through judicial inquiries and other challenges will ensue as surely as night follows day. In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said that no one can argue with&#151;there is no argument against&#151;the authority of Parliament. I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith.

I do not think that should be the case. As we have all said many times before, national policy statements are new animals. They will be the essence of the new system.

The Minister has tabled Amendment No. 36, which rediscovers the committees of your Lordships' House and permits a committee of this House to make recommendations to which the Secretary of State must reply. This amendment is very welcome. However, it does not go as far as the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, which requires approval of national policy statements by affirmative resolution of both Houses. Having being so many years in this House, I have become an even more enthusiastic parliamentarian, and I would wish to see an affirmative resolution as the basis for the parliamentary approval of these national policy statements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="08110633000569"></a>The answer to the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, is simple. Of course, the will of the elected House must prevail, and that has frequently happened. It happens in cases where a statutory instrument requires affirmative votes in both Houses. If one House turns it down, it fails, but it is, of course, brought back, at which point the House, if it is the upper House, yields to the lower House. We have the advantage of the admirable report by the noble Lord, Lord Cunningham of Felling, who spelt out, in the context of the reform of Parliament, that the supremacy of the elected House is not in question. It would not be in question here. What we are talking about is&#151;</p>

If my memory is correct, we had a similar problem with the Gambling Act, where a statutory instrument that defined the areas in which the casinos would be located had gone through the Commons. It came here and, contrary to usual practice, this House voted it down, and it was lost from the Government&#146;s programme.</p>

Well, who was right? If the Government had been confident of their policy about casinos, of course they would have brought the order back, but the original policy is in tatters and the idea of a giant casino has disappeared from view. If I may say so, the noble Lord has not chosen a very good example.</p>

That is not a phrase that I would ever have used. I served for 23 years in the other place and have now just about topped up 23 years here, so I have seen both sides clearly. Parliament has authority and the legitimacy of a parliamentary vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="08110633000573"></a>At the risk of being tedious, I repeat what I said on a previous occasion. When I was Secretary of State for the Environment, I faced a challenge from local authorities, led by the extreme left&#151;some by the Militant Tendency. No doubt noble Lords will remember those occasions. Those authorities were challenging the Government; they were challenging the authority of the Secretary of State; they were demanding that I withdraw the rate support grants, remove the capping on rates and a number of other things. At the end of a long meeting attended by 35 of them, led by Mr Blunkett, I said, &#147;I can&#146;t do those things. They have been approved by Parliament. Are you challenging Parliament?&#148;. Of course, the whole thing faded away. They realised that Parliament had decided; it had cast its votes in support of the rate support grant settlement; it had approved legislation on rate capping and that was that.</p>

Last time, the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, said that there was a tendency at the other end of the building to conflate Parliament with the House of Commons, but of course we are part of Parliament as well, so we should certainly have that power. Then the thing is approved. What happens then? If one looks at the chart produced by the CBI, we finish up with judicial review, because it will then be a decision by the Secretary of State. If a decision is taken by Parliament&#151;provided that the procedures have been properly gone through and there is no conflict with European law, and so on, and it has been properly voted on&#151;it is inconceivable that any one would take to judicial review a national policy statement.</p>

<a name="81106-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="08110633000575"></a>One has to remember that the growth of judicial review in the past 20 years has been enormous. I have here the figures provided by Professor Anthony King in his book on the British constitution. Under the heading, &#147;The Judges Come Out&#148;, he cited the figures. He says that,</p>
<ul><a name="08110633000775"></a>&#147;the number of applications for judicial review has soared in recent decades. In 1981 a total of 356 non-criminal applications for judicial review were made; in 2005 the total of such applications was 5,131&#148;.</ul><a name="time_29"></a>

<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="08110633000576"></a>This country should not be ruled by the judges. The judges have a distinct role in ensuring that the law is upheld, but if Parliament makes law, it should not be challenged by the judges. If the Secretary of State takes decisions, they are and frequently have been challenged in the courts. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, will no doubt have been warned of the danger of a challenge by environmental groups on nuclear policy. These decisions were taken not by Parliament but by Ministers, and what happened? The courts held that the process had been flawed, and Ministers had to start all over again. This is what I am frightened of if we leave the national policy statements as ministerial statements without the full sanction of a parliamentary vote.</p>

However, as a number of noble Lords have said&#151;it was said this morning by the noble Lord, Lord Williamson of Horton, and in a previous debate by the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull&#151;if one wants to looks for democratic legitimacy, one should look to the national policy statements and not to the commission.</p>

When I was briefed as a civil servant on how to avoid judicial review, which we were extensively briefed on because of the high numbers that he quotes, we were told very clearly that it was nothing to do with the authority of who took the decision; it was entirely about the process. He talks in a throwaway manner about the proper procedures being gone through, but that is the essence of the judicial review as we, the victims of it, were taught to recognise it, so I am not at all convinced that it is the authority of the organisation taking the decision that matters.</p>

We have our own role, which has been repeatedly described, but the House of Commons is where the law is made and the final decisions are taken, with our help, support and advice. It is quite different from a decision taken by a Secretary of State. If the noble Baroness cannot understand the question of the authority of a vote in Parliament, we will have to differ. A vote in Parliament carries authority. I have already said that I do not accept that it is moral authority; it is legal authority. Parliament is where it all happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="08110633000580"></a>I totally support the national policy statement, which is an admirable new institution and a splendid innovation in the planning process. As I made clear this morning, I was certainly prepared to recognise the planning commission and its role. However, the danger is that the whole thing will collapse in a series of judicial reviews as the ultimate way in which those who wish to challenge the policy will go. If the statements are sanctioned by a vote in Parliament, my guess is that it will be exceedingly difficult for anyone to challenge that in the courts.</p>

I understand the noble Lord to say that if there was a flaw in the procedure, that could not be challenged in court if it had been approved by the House of Commons. I do not understand that.

Perhaps I should have taken more time to prepare my remarks, but yesterday I was dealing with the Energy Bill and one does not have time to do everything. The point is that a court would challenge even an Act of Parliament if it turned out to be, for instance, contrary to European law. That is why we have a statement at the beginning of every Bill stating that it is compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights. Similarly, there have been cases, but they were special cases. The courts will not seek to challenge a decision of Parliament which was enshrined in a vote of both Houses. Judges would be exceedingly slow to do that, whereas they have shown themselves to be readily&#151;I have quoted the figures&#151;willing to challenge decisions by Ministers. If this is left as a ministerial decision rather than a parliamentary vote, my guess is that it will run into difficulty with the courts in a way that it would not if it had been approved by affirmative resolution in both Houses.</p>

I hope that this is not interpreted as too much crawling to the Minister, but I have been impressed by the Government&#146;s thoughtfulness in this area. Their proposed procedure has been extended considerably from the original proposals. It is about scrutiny. Good scrutiny&#151;I do not like the word but it is an iterative process, a dialogue is created&#151;requires a response to comments from the original proposer. In other words, it requires feedback. It is quite a complicated and long procedure. The Government have provided for both Houses of Parliament, if both Houses should wish, to take a thoughtful, detailed, forensic approach to what will be complex and, in some cases, controversial proposals.</p>

<a name="81106-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="08110633000584"></a>My concern about taking out most of that, which is in the second of the noble Lord&#146;s amendments, and putting the national policy statements almost immediately to a parliamentary vote would polarise and politicise something which needs a much more careful approach. We all know that the Government would whip their people, as would the Opposition, and the Opposition would not be likely to be able to dig in and sort out the detail and the various points of principle in a way that I hope parliamentary committees are able to do; I hope too that that is not hope against experience. The noble Lord, Lord Cameron, referred to the need for Parliament to question and challenge the Executive. I agree with him absolutely, and the approach proposed by the Government in fact provides more opportunities for such question and challenge. The affirmative resolution procedure is precisely the way to ensure that the Executive get their way, possibly quite rapidly, unless there is a narrow majority or a lot of rebels. The Government&#146;s model gives an opportunity&#151;I use the word carefully because I hope that it will be taken up&#151;for reflecting Parliament&#146;s views and for adjustments to be made, and is therefore a very important opportunity.</p>

I appreciate the passions that this issue arouses and I am well aware, through my experience in a different sphere of government over the past eight years, that scrutiny may not always be as good as its advocates wish. We have to make it as good as its advocates wish. I say sorry to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, but we are with the Government on this.</p>

If this House wants to ensure that a detail of policy about energy, transport or infrastructure is embodied in legislation, it should ensure that the relevant amendment is made to legislation. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said&#151;I agree with every word she said&#151;the job of this House is to scrutinise. The Government do not and cannot develop and implement policies with no regard to the views of parliamentarians, and the Bill as set out provides very carefully for extensive consultation with both Houses. The noble Baroness pointed out that this has come at the end of a lengthy period of consultation. Authority, moral or otherwise, comes from the careful process of consultation, genuine listening and weighing up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="08110633000588"></a>In the end, however, the electorate expect the Government to pursue policies, and it is Governments who are held to account by the electorate. Examples were given at the previous stage and I will not go into too much detail now because of time, but the idea that both Houses are well suited to develop, approve and pass policies is, I think, a very dangerous one indeed. I have given before the example of the completely different situation we saw in the United States when the financial package was up before both Houses on Capitol Hill&#151;the Congress and the Senate&#151;and the pork-barrel wheeling and dealing that went on in order to get legislation through. Many of the people involved were not concerned about issues of substance but only about what they could get for their constituencies.</p>

Lobby and interest groups will approach people they believe they can exert pressure on and, instead of carefully balanced judgment and careful reflection of consultation, there will be the arm-twisting of MPs, depending on their majorities, and MPs will demand their pound of flesh for their support. It would be worse if a general election resulted in a finely balanced House of Commons. The power that would go to small groups which gave support to the Government would have no connection with the merits of the policy statement, but they would use it as leverage to get the support of the Government of the day. I hope very much that we are not tempted to go down those lines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="08110633000590"></a>The proposal that this House should have the power to vote down policies would politicise it in a deeply regrettable way.

If we went down those lines it would call into question the willingness of Governments of the day to accede to that kind of balance in this Chamber because they would not like to see their measures voted down by an unelected House. It would be very dangerous indeed. I hope that, on careful reflection, the opposition spokesman will not push the amendment to a vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="08110633000592"></a>In Committee, I undertook to think further about the points raised by noble Lords because I was deeply impressed by the quality of the argument, and I have tabled Amendment No. 36 in response. I do not want to reiterate the thinking behind it except to say that we have put in place a genuinely novel form of parliamentary scrutiny. It is the product of hard work and integrity between the Minister and the chairs of the Select Committees in the other place. We now have a stronger role for Parliament in scrutinising draft national policy statements.</p>

<a name="81106-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="08110633000593"></a>Most recently, this has been set out in a report of the Liaison Committee. The process shows the House of Commons at its best and doing its job of scrutinising policy. Because of the time, I shall not read through how it will happen but, when the committee has finished its work, parliamentary scrutiny will continue for four to six weeks beyond the close of public consultation to enable the committee to take any additional account that might be necessary of the significant issues raised during that consultation. Ministers have undertaken to ensure that briefing and information on those issues is made available to the committees to enable them to do this. Then Ministers will consider what change is needed to the draft NPSs in the light of the views of the committees and in respect of any resolution of either House and public consultation. A statement will then be laid before Parliament setting out the Government&#146;s response. The draft proposals will be revised, as appropriate, before the laying of the final version of the NPS.</p>

<a name="81106-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="08110633000594"></a>This is a novel and robust scrutiny process for the NPSs. It will ensure that a committee is able to scrutinise proposed policy in detail, to call witnesses as necessary and to take account of consultation responses. It will ensure that where, on the basis of this consideration, the committee thinks that there are issues which Parliament as a whole needs to consider, it can recommend that there should be a debate in both Houses on the draft NPS. It will ensure that Ministers have to explain to Parliament how they have addressed any recommendations of the committee and resolutions of either House. Parliament will have spoken, and Ministers will have listened. I believe that in doing so, they will indeed have demonstrated what has been discussed across this House as the nature of parliamentary authority. They will also have demonstrated the power of scrutiny.</p>

<a name="81106-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="08110633000595"></a>I have gone into that background because I want to make the contrast between parliamentary scrutiny and parliamentary approval, which is what the debate has turned on. Parliamentary approval of policy is an altogether different proposition, and noble Lords on all sides have demonstrated that brilliantly in the past half hour. I cannot accept Amendments Nos. 34 and 35. They require parliamentary approval of national policy statements and I believe that that is seriously inappropriate.</p>

<a name="81106-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="08110633000596"></a>National policy statements are documents that set out government policy. They are not secondary legislation; they are not primary legislation; they do not seek to change the law. They are similar in nature to White Papers and planning policy statements. Just as the Government do not seek parliamentary approval before they set out their policy&#151;</p>

This is a perverse proposition as it would undermine one of our key aims for the Bill, which is to ensure and make clear ministerial accountability for policy. While we have created a new dimension for parliamentary scrutiny, to give Parliament the final responsibility for determining the policy is to move in the other direction completely. Secondly, to take a wider view&#151;a view that my noble friends have powerfully argued&#151;it would also represent a significant and destabilising shift in the historic and fundamental relationship between the Executive and the legislature. It alters the balance; it undermines the clear and understood separation of roles that have been established over many years. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, not only for her speech but for her support.</p>

<a name="81106-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="08110633000600"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, referred to Parliament as the place where law is made. Indeed, as I said, the problem is that national policy statements are not primary or secondary legislation. Other noble Lords have pointed to a paradox: we have created a very thorough process for parliamentary scrutiny of extremely complex and technical issues. The right place for that is the Select Committees, as the noble Baroness said. Where the committees recommend that both Houses will have had a debate, the outcome will also have to be taken into account by government.</p>

<a name="81106-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="08110633000601"></a>What is it that a binding vote will do other than introduce a real uncertainty that, despite scrutiny and public consultation, the policy might still be overturned on a vote of both Houses? My noble friend Lord Woolmer was extremely eloquent on this point. Uncertainty is the enemy of everything we are trying to achieve, with the support of so many noble Lords.</p>

<a name="81106-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="08110633000602"></a>Noble Lords argued in Committee that there may be a precedent for parliamentary approval in similar circumstances, such as guidance from the Lord Chancellor to the Judicial Appointments Commission under the Constitutional Reform Act. We have no parallels with the NPSs; these are wholly new policy statements.</p>

<a name="81106-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="08110633000603"></a>If we took the step proposed by the amendments, it would be extremely unclear where we would end up. Indeed, I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, made that perfectly clear. We do not want to begin walking a path that leads to calls for votes on the next White Paper on health or education. I say that in all seriousness to noble Lords opposite, given their ambitions for government.</p>

<a name="81106-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="08110633000604"></a>The noble Lord opposite also demolished his own argument. Noble Lords do not need reminding that if both Houses were to have a binding vote on whether to accept an NPS, practical difficulties would occur if  


<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_426"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column 426</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they took opposing views. It is difficult to see how such a situation could be resolved, given that we would not be voting on primary or delegated legislation. It would be unprecedented and unbounded territory. There is already division on the Conservative Benches about how it would work out. The noble Lord has said that the unelected House might have the right to overturn the elected House in this respect, which is extremely dangerous territory.</p>

<a name="81106-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="08110633000605"></a>This question was considered and debated at length on Report in the other place. An amendment to make NPSs subject to parliamentary approval was defeated by a clear majority of 54 votes. While the role of Select Committees and enhanced scrutiny was warmly welcomed, amendments for a binding parliamentary vote were soundly defeated. The elected House has already rejected the idea of a binding vote. It is surely wrong for this House to overturn that. This House has many responsibilities, but they do not include telling the other House how to conduct its business.</p>

<a name="81106-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="08110633000606"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s Amendment No. 35 would remove subsections (4) to (7) of Clause 9. The procedures for parliamentary scrutiny so carefully worked out in another place would thereby come to nothing. I repeat that it is simply not appropriate for this House to dictate to the other House how to conduct its business.</p>

<a name="81106-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="08110633000607"></a>For all these reasons, it would not be right to accept Amendments Nos. 34 and 35. They would bring chaos and uncertainty to the system, and undermine some of the fundamental principles of the workings of government.</p>

<a name="81106-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="08110633000608"></a>We have a better way, which we propose in our amendment and which more properly enables this House to make its unique and greatest contribution. Noble Lords have spoken about the importance of a committee of this House being able to examine the draft NPSs in detail, particularly in light of the expertise that exists here. That case has been persuasively and eloquently put, and I believe in it passionately.</p>

<a name="81106-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="08110633000609"></a>I have therefore tabled government Amendment No. 36, which would amend Clause 9(4)(b) so that the Secretary of State would be required to lay before Parliament a statement setting out her response to a committee of either House. That would give this House a strong and clear role in the parliamentary scrutiny process. It would give a committee of this House a role similar to that of committees in the other place. Without prejudice to any decisions that Parliament or the authorities of this House might make about the exact arrangements, it would mean, in essence, that an NPS could be examined by committees in each House.</p>

<a name="81106-0016.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="08110633000610"></a>I believe that this meets what many noble Lords were after. It improves and strengthens parliamentary scrutiny of draft NPSs. It recognises the unique contribution and strengths of this House. It will mean that our expertise will be applied in a way that fits with the traditional role of this House&#151;we are, after all, a scrutinising Chamber. It will mean also that it will be applied in a way that fits the nature of what will be complex, technical documents, ensuring that we make a contribution to those documents and policies in the most effective way. I hope that noble Lords will agree with me.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_head0"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="08110647000002"></a>Banking: Iceland</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08110647000010"></a><a name="81106-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="81106-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08110647000051"></a>The Financial Services Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Myners):</b> My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Alistair Darling) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08110647000011"></a>On 8 October 2008, I announced to Parliament that the Government would ensure that no depositor in Icesave, the internet product made available by the UK branch of the Icelandic bank, Landsbanki, would lose any money as a result of the closure of Icesave. I have today laid a Treasury Minute to explain several contingent liabilities into which the Government have entered in order to give effect to part of this commitment.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08110647000012"></a>The Government are also making an advance of approximately &#163;800 million to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) in order to enable the FSCS to pay out that part of a depositor's rights arising from deposits of over the FSCS depositor compensation limit of &#163;50,000. The Bank of England is initially providing loan facilities to enable the FSCS to pay out that part of a depositor's rights arising from deposits of under the FSCS depositor compensation limit. The Treasury will refinance these facilities.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08110647000013"></a>Authority for this advance and for refinancing is sought in the winter supplementary estimate, which will be presented to the House later this month. Statutory authority for the expenditure will be provided on a retrospective basis by the Banking Bill.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_head1"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="08110647000003"></a>Companies Act 2006</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="08110647000014"></a><a name="81106-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="81106-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="08110647000052"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Baroness Vadera):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ian Pearson, has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08110647000015"></a>As my predecessor announced by Written Statement on 13 December 2007, the Companies Act 2006 is being commenced in tranches between Royal Assent on 8 November 2006 and 1 October 2009. I have today laid before Parliament the eighth commencement order, which commences the final provisions with effect from 1 October 2009. There are two minor sets of provisions in the Act that we are not proposing to commence. When a suitable opportunity arises, the Government will propose to Parliament the repeal of these provisions.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08110647000016"></a>The first set is Sections 327(2)(c) and 330(6)(c). Sections 324 to 331 deal with the use of proxies, whereby shareholders who do not attend company meetings can delegate their vote to someone who will attend. This can be a vote on a show of hands, or on a poll, where the number of shares of each person voting is taken into account. The 2006 Act restated the rules on proxies contained in the Companies Act 1985 and its Northern Ireland equivalent, the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986, with a number of changes, including making it easier for a member to appoint more than one proxy.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS24"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column WS24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08110647000017"></a>Companies&#146; articles generally provide a deadline by which documents appointing proxies need to be received before a meeting. Section 327 prevents this deadline being set at more than 48 hours before the meeting. If a poll is called for at a meeting and if it is to be taken more than 48 hours later, then Clause 327(2)(b) provides that the deadline for appointing proxies will be not more than 24 hours before the poll. The intention behind Clause 327(2)(c) was to provide that where a poll is taken within 48 hours of its being called at a meeting, the deadline would be 48 hours before the meeting, as for proxy voting at the meeting. As drafted, however, Clause 327(c) would have the unintended effect that the deadline would be the time at which the poll was called for. That is why the subsection has not been commenced so far, and why the Government believe that it should not be commenced, and that Clause 330(6)(c), which makes similar provision for withdrawing authority from a proxy, should not be commenced.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08110647000018"></a>The second set of provisions not being commenced is Section 1175 so far as it relates to Northern Ireland and the associated Part 2 of Schedule 9. Part 16 of the Act replaces the rules on audit requirements from the Companies Act 1985 with a number of changes, including that there are no longer special rules for the audit of companies that are charities. This is because in future special rules for charities, whether companies or not, are to be included in charities legislation. As it seemed likely that charity law in England and Wales would be amended to replace these rules before the commencement of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006, Schedule 9 included provisions to amend the Companies Act 1985 to remove the special rules for audit of charitable companies. In the event, the Charities Act 2006 (Charitable Companies Audit and Group Accounts Provisions) Order 2008 (SI 2008/527) came into force on 1 April 2008, and so Part 1 of Schedule 9 was commenced  on that date by the Sixth Companies Act 2006 Commencement Order. Part 1 of the Schedule covers England and Wales, and also Scotland where its charities legislation was also ready to take over.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08110647000019"></a>Similar provisions to amend the Companies  (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 were included in Part 2 of Schedule 9 to the Companies Act 2006, but at  the time Part 16 was commenced there were no  provisions in Northern Ireland charity law to apply audit requirements to smaller charitable companies. The sixth commencement order therefore saved the existing rules on the audit of smaller charitable companies in the 1986 order. And there will never be any need to commence Section 1175 in relation to Northern Ireland, or Part 2 of Schedule 9.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>

As this scheme has now been successfully embedded, delivering &#163;65 million of savings to date by ensuring that those who can afford to pay for their defence costs

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08110647000021"></a>Proposals setting out the design of the Crown Court means-testing scheme are today being published for consultation by the Ministry of Justice and the Legal Services Commission. It is accompanied by a separate, but associated consultation paper from the Ministry of Justice setting out the potential options for reforming payments from central funds to acquitted defendants. The annual budget for central funds is set at &#163;45 million but has consistently exceeded this amount in recent years. Given the inter-relationship between central funds payments and means testing, we believe that now is the right time to look more closely at this area.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08110647000022"></a>These consultation exercises are targeted at all groups and individuals who work within the criminal justice system, as well as all those who may otherwise have an interest in this subject.

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08110647000026"></a>Earlier this year, Parliament debated and approved structural change orders to create from 1 April 2009 nine new unitary councils&#151;Bedford Borough Council, Cheshire East Council, Cheshire West and Chester Council, Central Bedfordshire Council, Cornwall Council, County Durham Council, Northumberland Council, Shropshire Council and Wiltshire Council. Working closely with those responsible locally for implementing these new unitary councils, we are completing the legislative framework needed to support the transition to these new councils.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08110647000027"></a>Accordingly, I have today laid before the House the Local Government (Structural Changes) (Transitional Arrangements) (No.2) Regulations 2008, made under Part 1 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS26"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column WS26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08110647000028"></a>This represents a significant milestone in the completion of the necessary legislative framework. These regulations make transitional provisions in relation to the following matters:</p>
continuity and responsibility for functions;electoral matters;statutory plans, reviews, schemes, statements and strategies;membership of certain licensing and planning committees;functions relating to town and country planning;functions relating to education;miscellaneous transitional provisions; andconsequential amendment of the Local Government (Changes for England) Regulations 1994.
<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08110647000029"></a>I am confident that these regulations represent the most practical and pragmatic way forward for both predecessor councils and their successor new unitaries to implement the new arrangements and achieve a seamless transition protecting the delivery of local services.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08110647000030"></a>No one underestimates the scale of the task those leading the changes in these areas face over the coming months. But we in central government will continue to play our part in supporting the transition, completing the legal framework, and helping those in the front line to set-up and run successfully the new unitary councils from April.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08110647000032"></a>As honourable Members are aware, the administrative resource costs of the Pensions Regulator (tPR), the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), the Pensions Advisory Service (TPAS) and the Pensions Ombudsman (PO) are funded by grant-in-aid which is then recovered through levies raised on pension schemes. The rates for these levies are set in regulations.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08110647000033"></a>PPF administration levy&#151;the administration costs of the PPF are initially met from the DWP administration vote. Section 117 of the Pensions Act 2004 provides that the Secretary of State may impose a levy on eligible pension schemes, for the purpose of meeting his expenditure in establishing the PPF and repaying grant-in-aid in respect of PPF administration costs. The levy is invoiced and collected by tPR on behalf of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08110647000034"></a>The general levy&#151;the administration costs of tPR, TPAS and the PO, are initially met from the DWP administration vote. Section 175 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 (as amended in the Pensions Act 2004) allows for an annual general levy on occupational and personal pension schemes to recover this expenditure. The levy is also invoiced and collected by tPR on behalf of the Secretary of State.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS27"></a><b>6 Nov 2008 : Column WS27</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="08110647000035"></a>This year, the Government are pleased to announce that we will freeze the rates for both the general levy and PPF administration levy at their 2008-09 levels. These levels are sufficient to recover the grant-in-aid paid to each of the organisations.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08110647000036"></a>This maintains the Government&#146;s intention, outlined to the House last year, to provide levy cost stability for pension schemes. In holding rates stable, the Government seek to avoid additional cost pressures on pension schemes at the current time. This is also in line with the consultation launched in September 2008 by the board of the PPF to hold the pension protection levy quantum stable (indexed in line with wage inflation).</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08110647000037"></a>The general levy rates since 2005 were set on the assumption that TPAS&#146; running costs were included in the amount to be raised by the levy and since DWP took over funding responsibility from the regulatory authority it paid TPAS &#163;8.5 million grant-in-aid for the period 1 April 2005 to 30 June 2008. The Government&#146;s intention is that this grant-in-aid should be met by pension schemes through the general levy, reflecting longstanding practice in relation to TPAS funding. TPAS provides good value dispute resolution and information provision services that are beneficial to both pension schemes and their members. It is therefore right that its costs should be met by pension schemes.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08110647000038"></a>A consequential amendment to Section 174 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 should have been made to enable DWP to recover the grant-in-aid payments from 1 April 2005. Because the need for this amendment was overlooked, the levy-raising power in Section 175 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 does not apply to payments made to TPAS unless they are made by the Pensions Regulator.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08110647000039"></a>To regularise the funding position so that there is a statutory basis for recovering grant-in-aid payments through the general levy, arrangements were made for the Pensions Regulator to pay grant-in-aid to TPAS from 1 July 2008.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08110647000040"></a>Earlier consultations on amendments to the regulations setting the levy rates have stated that the general levy should cover TPAS&#146;s funding. Taking this into account, the Government have decided that it would be inappropriate to refund the &#163;8.5 million of grant-in-aid paid to TPAS for the period 1 April 2005 to 30 June 2008 and recovered through the general levy.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08110647000041"></a>The Government consider that holding the general and PPF administrative levy rates at 2008-09 levels presents positive news for pension schemes. The stability it offers will be welcomed by levy payers, pension scheme trustees, members and sponsoring employers.</p>

Notwithstanding that, the Home Office has had concerns about the SIA&#146;s organisational capabilities. Drawing on the model of government departmental capability reviews, in agreement with the chair of the SIA, an independent delivery review has recently been conducted looking at the leadership and management of the organisation.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08110647000044"></a>The SIA board are currently considering how to respond fully to the recommendations of the review and I have asked that they report to me with a detailed action plan within the next two weeks.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="08110647000045"></a>With the delivery review under way, we have become aware of some failings in the SIA&#146;s compliance with Home Office requirements for security clearance for SIA employees. Home Office guidance issued to the SIA stipulates that no person should be employed, in a permanent or temporary capacity, without appropriate confirmed security clearance. All permanent SIA staff have confirmed security clearance. It became clear, however, that some agency workers had not received appropriate security clearance before commencing employment with the SIA. The SIA currently has 38 agency workers. As soon as the Home Office became aware of the issue, it asked the SIA to take immediate action. All those without confirmed security clearance were removed from SIA premises and had all access to SIA systems withdrawn. Security checks are now being conducted and as of 9 am this morning, 32 had confirmed clearance and the remaining six were pending.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08110647000046"></a>The SIA has a commercial delivery partner, LDL&#151;a subsidiary of British Telecom (BT). LDL is responsible, through BT, for ensuring security clearance of its staff. The Home Office&#146;s Departmental Security Unit is satisfied that LDL recruitment and clearance procedures are robust.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="08110647000047"></a>There are significant safeguards in place within the SIA to ensure that decisions to award licences are taken appropriately and not open to abuse. No single individual can decide to award a licence. Two individuals must be involved in each decision&#151;one from the SIA, who takes the ultimate decision to award a licence and one from the LDL. These individuals are based in separate sites in different cities. Managers sample decisions taken every day to ensure that SIA procedures are followed and an external audit of decisions is also undertaken.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="08110647000048"></a>Nevertheless, I have asked the SIA to review urgently a targeted sample of decisions taken by any individual for whom the SIA did not have confirmed security clearance, whether or not that individual is still working for the SIA.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="08110647000049"></a>The Home Office&#146;s Departmental Security Unit has advised that the SIA&#146;s security checking procedures are now fully compliant with Home Office standards.</p>

<a name="81106-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="08110647000050"></a>The Home Office will work closely with the chair and board of the SIA as they respond to the delivery review recommendations to ensure that similar problems do not arise in the future. Plans are being made for an interim chief executive to be appointed once discussions between the current chief executive and the SIA board about his imminent departure are concluded.</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_4"></a>Further to the Written Answer by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Justice, Bridget Prentice, on 23 October (<I>Official Report</I>, House of Commons, 562W), how English courts, when considering a consent order embodying the terms of an agreement reached by the parties to a family dispute in a Sharia court, ensure that it complies with English legal tenets, in particular that women party to such consent orders have freely given their consent.

<a name="08110651000040"></a><a name="81106w0001.htm_spmin4"></a><b><a name="81106w0001.htm_spmin5"></a><a name="08110651000115"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> There are two principal types of issue in which consent orders are presented in family cases: (i) orders about residence of and contact with children, and (ii) financial orders following dissolution of a marriage or civil partnership. In each case, the court has an obligation to scrutinise the proposed order to confirm that it complies with the relevant legal principles.</p>

<a name="81106w0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_13"></a><a name="08110651000041"></a>In the case of orders for residence or contact, the court must examine the proposed order in accordance with Section 1 of the Children Act 1989, under which the child's welfare is the paramount consideration. Consent orders for residence and contact are normally made at a hearing at which the parties are present; the practice direction issued by the president in May 2008 provides that such orders should not be made in the absence of the parties unless the court is satisfied that there is no risk of harm to the child.</p>

<a name="81106w0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_14"></a><a name="08110651000042"></a>In the case of financial orders, the court must apply the relevant provisions of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 or the Civil Partnership Act 2004 (as appropriate); the parties to a proposed consent order are required to provide details of their financial circumstances and other relevant information to enable the court to consider whether the order satisfies the criteria laid down by statute.</p>

<a name="81106w0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_15"></a><a name="08110651000043"></a>There is no visible evidence available to a court that an application for a consent order has been made following negotiations and agreement made by the parties at a Sharia council. Therefore these applications are treated in the same way as any other application within family proceedings.</p>

<a name="81106w0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_16"></a><a name="08110651000044"></a>There are many forms of alternative dispute resolution available to assist parties to reach an agreement in family cases, but whichever method is used by the parties, the principles applied by the court are the same. The court cannot simply &#147;rubber-stamp&#148; an agreement in a family case, whatever the process by which the agreement has been reached, and courts can and do ask for further information where there is any doubt about the propriety of a proposed order. Any order made by consent and submitted to the court, whether the product of an agreement by a Sharia council or not, might be made by coercion and it is the function of the court to question any order which appears unfair.</p>

<a name="81106w0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_17"></a><a name="08110651000045"></a>An order which on its face involved an undue advantage to one party or set out arrangements for contact which excluded care or contact with one parent would be the sort of order which alerts a court to potential coercion and the need to ask for further information and, if appropriate, to refuse to make the order requested.</p>

<a name="81106w0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_18"></a><a name="08110651000046"></a>The statutory basis for any enforcement in the courts of any agreement facilitated by a Sharia council is the Arbitration Act 1996, established by the previous Government. There are no plans to change this.</p>

Since defence outputs are not priced, measures of inflation in defence necessarily reflect changes in the prices of inputs of goods  and services bought by the Ministry of Defence.  These inputs include labour services, construction and maintenance works, bespoke defence equipment (with long-term contracts usually incorporating specific variation of price clauses) and commodity purchases (such as fuels and food). Work is under way to produce a new aggregate measure of defence input inflation.</p>

Should the company succeed in achieving this target, it would, combined with the 30 per cent efficiency savings made during control period 3, have made efficiency savings of some 50 per cent over a 10-year period. The determination provides incentives for Network Rail to work with train operators and others to outperform this target.</p>
