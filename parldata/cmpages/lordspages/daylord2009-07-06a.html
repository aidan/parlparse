The treaty was debated in detail in Parliament over 25 days and both Houses voted strongly in favour at every stage. Both Houses rejected, by clear majorities, amendments proposing to decide by referendum. The UK considers and decides on the British national interest through our Parliament, as Governments of all political complexions acknowledge and as Parliament has done with every previous EU amending treaty.</p>

Does he accept that, since Parliament debated this matter, in the recent European elections the majority of UK MEPs were elected on manifestos opposed to the Lisbon treaty? Given that and the concern for democratic renewal, is there not a case for saying that those in favour of the Lisbon treaty would now be well served by calling for a referendum in order to put beyond doubt its legitimacy and democratic mandate?</p>

We are aware that the independent monitoring board does not consider the current facilities to be adequate. Since its report was written, we have opened Cayley House, which provides better facilities, including showers.

Clearly, those times were not as good as they should have been. In one case, collection took something like 12 and a half hours; now the average is one and a half hours, and we are improving that so that detainees can be moved on to other facilities.

<a name="0907064000043"></a><b><a name="90706-0001.htm_spmin5"></a><a name="0907064000346"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Malloch-Brown):</b> My Lords, we have not capped the UK&#146;s payments to the UN for assessed payments, since these are legal obligations, but as part of the 2007 CSR settlement for conflict funding from 2008 to 2011 the call on the Treasury reserve for peacekeeping is currently set at &#163;374 million annually. Therefore, when assessed UN peacekeeping costs rise, the overall UN conflict budget has less funding available for discretionary conflict prevention activity. To help mitigate this, this year the FCO, DfID and the MoD provided an additional &#163;71 million for discretionary conflict activity.</p>

<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="0907064000044"></a><b><a name="90706-0001.htm_spnew39"></a><a name="0907064000347"></a>Lord Hannay of Chiswick:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply and for confirming that we are indeed standing by our international legal obligations. Does his Answer not lead him to regret or reconsider the decision to put assessed peacekeeping contributions into the same pot as discretionary spending, with the result that, if the UN&#151;as, alas, all too often happens&#151;does more in-year, or the British exchange rate moves in the wrong direction, the squeeze will be exclusively on discretionary spending? Is this not a case for reconsidering this, and reverting to a situation where the peacekeeping assessment, if it overspent in-year, was met under a formula known&#151;after my noble friend Lord Armstrong&#151;as the Armstrong formula, meaning that it came out of the contingency reserve, and the discretionary spending was ring-fenced?</p>

There is no doubt that when we engage in multilateral peacekeeping, which is often more cost-effective than a direct bilateral operation of our own, we are engaged in meeting a national security goal, as my noble friend&#146;s report again confirmed just last week. Therefore, on the face of it, it appears anomalous that multilateral activities are subject to this cost control in a way that bilateral ones are not. However, the Treasury understandably feels very strongly that to control public spending it is important to set targets in an area like this and hold the department&#151;in this case, the FCO&#151;accountable for that.</p>

Particularly for those departments such as the FCO that have very small budgets, our multilateral legal obligations can end up squeezing out other departmental needs if the exchange rate moves against us or if there are particular needs in peacekeeping.</p>

We have gone into the budgets of the FCO, DfID and the MoD to make up the shortfall created by just the squeeze he describes. Yet even with that, we have seen discretionary spending having to fall. It has been an expensive year for peacekeeping and a bad year for currencies. I hope that the Government will keep the noble Lord&#146;s point under review.</p>

Do these sorts of consideration enter into the Government&#146;s thoughts when they look at the costs; namely, that a timely intervention might save finance and enormous human suffering in the longer term?</p>

Otherwise, we would have a terrible inversion of the priorities we must have when moving on peacekeeping operations. The best comparison to Rwanda today is Somalia, where at the moment we believe there is not a case for an immediate UN peacekeeping operation. However, were that moment to arrive, it would have an entirely damaging and deleterious effect on an already overstretched peacekeeping budget.</p>

As the noble Lord indicated, when the currency goes down and the pound is weak, things become very much more difficult. However, when and if the happy time comes when funds become more available for international contributions, will he bear in mind the need not only to meet our UN obligations but to push more funds in the direction of the Commonwealth, which is grievously short of funds, and yet is carrying out a range of operations across the globe which help maintain peace and promote and protect this country&#146;s interests as well?</p>

We look forward to receiving his report into events. We condone any excessive use of force and urge the full protection of indigenous people&#146;s rights. We are very concerned by reports that people are still missing.</p>

Can the Minister say whether this is going ahead? What is the Government&#146;s policy on the issue underlying the disturbance, which is that the agreements between Andean states and the European Union appear to give carte blanche to multinational companies developing oil and mineral resources in the Andean region at the expense of the indigenous inhabitants?</p>

This has been a long-standing sore in the political life of the country, and the disturbance is just the latest tragic expression of that. On the noble Lord&#146;s first point on the report of the special rapporteur, I am afraid that he is ahead of me, as it has not yet been received. While the rapporteur, Mr James Anaya, made some comments while he was there and encouraged the creation of an independent commission, as the noble Lord said, we must wait until we get the official report before we know exactly what the Government of Peru should do to implement it.</p>

Will the Minister ensure that in our connections with the Peruvian Government we encourage them in their stance to ensure the rights&#151;particularly the property rights&#151;of these indigenous people, and that they continue to be involved fairly in a way that gives them respect?</p>

It was indeed a free-trade agreement&#151;not the one with Europe&#151;which prompted this dispute that led to the loss of 33 lives. It came precisely because the Government exercised powers to overrule existing legislation on landholdings and other related issues. The overruling has been reversed, which shows the need to deal with this issue with great delicacy, not just on behalf of the Government of Peru, but for outsiders like ourselves.</p>

The indigenous people have resisted massive logging in the Amazon and have done their best to protect the biological resources in that huge forest, often for very exciting new cures for diseases. Has not that issue become bigger than the question of one small tribe in Peru, and is it not one that the Government should address?</p>

The rights of indigenous people throughout the Amazon and the Andes is an increasingly important political issue in the region in terms of its development, and in terms of the need to include those people in the political dispensation of those countries and support them in their need to assert control and sustainable usage over the natural resources that are the basis of their livelihoods.</p>

<p><i><a name="0907064000464"></a>Debate on whether Clause 18 should stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="0907064000076"></a><b><a name="90706-0002.htm_spnew26"></a><a name="0907064000380"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> Clauses 18 and 19 will create an offence of soliciting&#151;that is, by potential clients of street prostitutes in England, Wales and Northern Ireland respectively. We fully recognise the negative impact that kerb-crawling can have in some areas, and the concerns that local residents might understandably have about it, but we do not support the creation of these offences. We feel the criminalisation of kerb-crawlers will do nothing to deter those with little respect for the law and is likely to lead to an increase in violence against sex workers. Like other prohibitory measures, it is likely to push street prostitution into more isolated areas.</p>

<a name="90706-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="0907064000077"></a>We have talked about the need to make prostitutes safer and we feel that these provisions will make them less safe. We also emphasise that the measure against brothels in this Bill, which we will discuss shortly, will make prostitutes more likely to engage in street sex work. There are likely to be more street workers as a result of the Bill so these provisions are particularly crucial to get right. We are therefore suggesting that Clause 18 should not stand part of the Bill. We think that decriminalisation should be accompanied by the powers to enforce appropriate zoning so that street prostitution and kerb-crawling could take place only in designated areas. That is a very difficult issue which we need to debate. I know that some brave local authorities have already grappled with it.</p>

<a name="90706-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="0907064000078"></a>We could be guided by the example from Scotland of the Scottish Prostitutes Education Project. When we asked what the effect of the kerb-crawling legislation in Edinburgh had been, we were told that women are working in isolation more, which is more dangerous for them, and that there are not as many clients around, but that the ones who are there are the more difficult and dangerous ones. The women felt that an alternative approach would be to get rid of the offence of loitering and replace it with an offence of breach of the peace&#151;causing fear or alarm, for example. They were certain that the legislation had had a negative impact on the women they work with, but they did not feel the number of women on the streets had decreased significantly. We were told that there is more competition among the women and, crucially, they are often out for longer. Naturally, they need to make the same amount of money. In our debates about rehabilitation we have talked about why they need to make that money&#151;whether they have a drug habit or they lack the education to get better jobs and so on. The fact is that the women who do that need the money and will keep on doing it. The critical thing is to make them safer.</p>

<a name="90706-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="0907064000079"></a>Traditionally, there has not been a huge amount of pimping on the streets of Edinburgh, and that has not changed, but the project feels that the streets are much  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_452"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 452</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more deserted than when the legislation first came in. It also feels that legalising brothels will not get women off the streets, because two totally different groups of women are involved. But doing what the Government are proposing in the Bill is likely to close down more brothels and will push more women onto the streets.</p>

<a name="90706-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="0907064000080"></a>How many prosecutions have there been? Thirty men were charged in Edinburgh over the course of the year since the legislation was introduced. There have been only six complaints from residents in the year. Is the legislation enforceable there? There are no jury trials in Scotland; there are sheriff's reviews only. One woman was given an ASBO on no more evidence than that she was seen getting out of a car driven by a man. She was banned from entering the area, including access to the Scottish Prostitutes Education Project advice centre. Another woman, in front of a different sheriff for shouting in an area, was given an ASBO preventing her from shouting in the area, which was much more specific. I make the point that this is a particularly difficult area of the law in which to impose quite brutal criminal charges on women when they are not even entitled to a jury trial.</p>

<a name="90706-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="0907064000081"></a>Clients are unlikely to get a jail sentence. Even in Sweden, from which the Government have taken their example, no one has been jailed. People have just been fined. We feel that the clauses are moving in entirely the wrong direction. We need to protect women better, encouraging them to go to advice centres and remaining visible where they are not in danger. If the Government say that much of the motivation for the clauses came from the Ipswich murders, they are moving in the wrong direction.</p>

We agree that the effect of the Bill is very likely to be to take women on to the streets from reasonably safe places, as the provisions that we shall debate later emphasise.

Clause 18 would remove the criterion of persistence from the offences of kerb crawling and soliciting as currently defined in Sections 1 and 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 1985? The criterion of persistence serves a valuable purpose. That is not because there is any right to solicit for the purposes of prostitution; it is because the criterion of persistence helps to ensure that there is no room for misunderstanding or doubt about the defendant&#146;s intentions. After all, this is an area of human conduct where there is ample room for ambiguity and a real danger of miscarriages of justice. I would welcome the Minister's explanation of why, in the light of that, it is thought appropriate to remove the criterion of persistence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="0907064000085"></a>The Minister will know that the United Kingdom Network of Sex Work Projects, which represents 63 projects offering front-line services to sex workers,   


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_453"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 453</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>gave evidence to the Public Bill Committee. It seemed to me that it would be worth having that on the record. The UK network said of Clause 18:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="0907064000264"></a>&#147;Research evidence and reports of projects working with street sex workers demonstrate that rigorous enforcement of legislation against both soliciting and kerb-crawling results in street sex workers operating in more isolated, unfamiliar and unsafe areas to avoid police surveillance, and less time to assess or negotiate with clients&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0907064000259"></a>It went on to say that these measures mean that sex workers have to work longer hours to get their money, which brings them into more conflict with the residents of the area, and exposes them to more risks in health and personal safety. It pushes them toward dispersing; they are therefore more isolated and unable to call on others for help. It also pushes them out of the orbit of organisations that go around trying to encourage them to seek help. Altogether, it makes the life of the street sex worker much more dangerous. I very much support what the noble Baroness said.</p>

<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="0907064000086"></a><b><a name="90706-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0907064000384"></a>Lord Brett:</b> I appreciate the contributions from noble Lords to this debate on whether Clause 18 shall stand part of the Bill. Clause 18 replaces the two offences of kerb-crawling and soliciting found in the Sexual Offences Act 1985. Kerb-crawling is therefore already a criminal offence and, as the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, pointed out, we are removing the requirement for persistence rather than creating a totally new offence. Unlike the existing offence, the new one will allow the police to prosecute an offender on the first occasion that they are found to be kerb-crawling or soliciting, without the need to prove persistent behaviour or, in the case of kerb-crawling, that the behaviour is likely to cause annoyance to the person solicited or to others in the neighbourhood.</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="0907064000087"></a>Responses to <I>Paying the Price</I>, the Government&#146;s consultation paper on prostitution published in 2004, highlighted that kerb-crawling was a considerable source of nuisance to many communities. Issues of concern ranged from unwanted propositioning of local residents, including young people, to congestion caused by slow-moving traffic. Building on what was learnt from that consultation, the prostitution strategy acknowledged the impact of street prostitution and made enforcement against kerb-crawling a key priority. In addition, based on responses to the consultation, the strategy emphasised the need to tackle demand in order to achieve an overall reduction in street prostitution. Subsequently, the Government&#146;s <I>Tackling </I><I>t</I><I>he Demand</I><I></I>review recommended that, as part of the wider package of measures to target those who pay for sex, kerb-crawling or soliciting for prostitutes should be made punishable on the first occasion when it occurs.</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="0907064000088"></a>I respect the view of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, on decriminalising prostitution. That does not, of course, conform to the views of the UK Government or with what we are seeking to achieve in this clause or, indeed, in the Bill. We have looked at the question of managed areas, which is an option. The fact is that there is no real evidence that formally managed areas can deliver what we want; to improve the safety of those involved in prostitution and the safety of communities. We believe that we should challenge the existence of street  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_454"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 454</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>prostitution, not imply through the development of managed areas that it is acceptable or that its existence should be tolerated.</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="0907064000089"></a>The question was also raised of the definition of a public place. Whether a place is public is a question of fact and degree; cases have defined it as a place where the public go, whether or not they have a right to go there. There may also be a public place even where there is a right to exclude particular members of the public. We believe, therefore, that this clause moves in the direction of the Government&#146;s general intent in looking at the prostitution and curbing demand. On that basis, we believe that it is a message which we want to carry forward. Therefore we believe that the power to prosecute kerb-crawlers and those who solicit on the street or in a public place without the need to prove persistence will make the offence easier to prosecute and send a strong message of deterrence to offenders, who are of course the kerb-crawlers.</p>

He just happened to ask a prostitute. What would happen in those circumstances if it was the very first time that that had happened?</p>

<a name="0907064000091"></a><b><a name="90706-0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0907064000386"></a>Lord Brett:</b> I thank the noble Baroness for that question. The answer is that it would be for the police to seek to prosecute and to bring the issue before the courts. It would be evidential and it would be for the courts&#151;in this case, the magistrates&#146; court&#151;to decide. We are not talking about on-the-spot fines or the individual being unable to challenge the decision to prosecute.</p>

<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="0907064000092"></a><b><a name="90706-0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0907064000387"></a>Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> Is it right that someone stopping to ask a very innocent question should go in front of our courts at all?</p>

<a name="0907064000093"></a><b><a name="90706-0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0907064000388"></a>Lord Brett:</b> The noble Baroness presumes that a constable would decide of their own volition that this was not an innocent question. We are talking about an offence and removing the persistence element. We are not suggesting that innocent people will be prosecuted for an offence; we are suggesting that the person who is being charged is soliciting. The person in the case which the noble Baroness mentioned is not soliciting and is therefore not committing an offence. Therefore, I cannot see why, in those circumstances, the noble Baroness should be so concerned that the individual will be subject to prosecution.</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="0907064000094"></a>As I was saying before the noble Baroness intervened, removing the need to prove persistence will make the offence easier to prosecute and will send a strong message of deterrence to offenders&#151;that is, kerb-crawlers&#151;thereby contributing to a reduction in demand for street prostitution. I therefore recommend that Clause 18 and Clause 19, which simply replicates Clause 18 so that these charges will apply in Northern Ireland, stand part of the Bill.</p>

To my simple mind, there are occasions when a constable or other police officer knows that a person is making a soliciting comment because he can be seen and overheard and is judged because he can be seen and heard, not just seen without being heard. It is not a question of someone making a presumed judgment from a distance, so I see no reason why, if a prosecution was brought, someone would not be judged and found, fairly, to be innocent or guilty by a magistrates&#146; court.</p>

To follow on from the interesting point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, what happens when every client starts their conversation with, &#147;Can you tell me the way to X?&#148;? That will make it very difficult. It will be like a code, but on the other hand how can you possibly prosecute?</p>

That is the key; if they are asking an innocent question, they are not soliciting and there is no basis for a prosecution. We also have to take account of the feelings of people whose lives are interrupted by people kerb-crawling down streets in their locality and propositioning young people, wives, sisters, mothers and others who live in that community. We have to take a more balanced approach.</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0907064000099"></a>There is no reason to think that there will be prosecutions where there is no persistence. The prosecutor will have to prove each case of kerb-crawling. Unless we have a total lack of faith in our magistrates&#146; courts, that should be a sufficient defence. We have to strike a balance between the safety of sex workers, who for whatever reason indulge in street prostitution, and the people who live in the locality. The proposal in the clause takes a correct view of that balance.</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0907064000103"></a>&#147;On 31 May 2005, the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry appointed Guy Newey QC and Gervase MacGregor, forensic accountant at BDO Stoy Hayward, to examine the issues raised by the Financial Reporting Review Panel and the events leading up to the appointment of administrators on 8 April 2005.</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0907064000104"></a>After the collapse of MG Rover, a number of factors concerning the affairs of the company, including issues raised by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, which examined the published accounts of the Rover Group, resulted in the Secretary of State deciding to appoint Companies Act inspectors to carry out a thorough investigation.</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0907064000105"></a>The inspectors were appointed under Section 432 of the Companies Act and had wide powers to require documents and the attendance of witnesses, including directors, officers and agents of the company. They investigated the affairs of MGRG, its parent company, Phoenix Venture Holdings, and MGR Capital Ltd between the purchase of MGRG from BMW in May 2000 and the date of it entering administration. The inspectors are independent of the department.</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0907064000106"></a>The inspectors carried out a thorough review and delivered their report to the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills on 11 June 2009. The Secretary of State has studied the report in full and has taken legal advice on the next steps. After considering the report in its entirety, the Secretary of State has asked the Serious Fraud Office to review the report and consider whether there are any grounds for a criminal investigation. Following legal advice, this report will not now be published at this time, in order to ensure that any criminal investigation or prosecution that the SFO may decide to take is not prejudiced. Publication now could also prejudice the possibility of a fair trial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0907064000107"></a>The discretion of the Secretary of State to publish a Companies Act report where inspectors are appointed under Section 432 is only to publish the whole report. The legislation does not provide for the report to be published in part&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0907064000110"></a>Further delays to any understanding of what actually happened in the lead-up to Rover's collapse, although not surprising, remain deeply disappointing, especially for the 6,500 former workers who must now wait a further indeterminate period before they can receive any of the modest sums of compensation due to them.</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0907064000111"></a>The Government have played a questionable role in MG Rover and its collapse. There is ongoing uncertainty as to the grounds of accepting the original &#163;10 bid, for example. There was also the scandal of the Government paying out a &#163;6.5 million bridging loan weeks before the last general election, despite written warnings that it would not save the company.</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0907064000112"></a>In 1998, the Secretary of State, who is now the First Secretary of State, stated that he considered Rover capable of,</p>
<ul><a name="0907064000274"></a>&#147;a commercially successful, viable, profitable future&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 21/10/98; col. 1284.]</ul>
<p><a name="0907064000260"></a>Seven years later under a Labour Government it went into administration. The lessons to be learnt from that disastrous record are even more important today; once again the question has arisen of government aid to a struggling motor industry. Without proper understanding of these failings the last time around, how can the noble Lord expect us to have any faith in their competence today?</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0907064000113"></a>Further questions have arisen over the inquiry that was meant to shed some light on the whole sorry incident. Not only has it taken four years and nearly &#163;16 million for the inquiry to finish, complete with embarrassing reports of more than &#163;100,000 being spent on accommodation and &#163;30,000 on food and drink, but the end result has been promptly hidden away.</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0907064000114"></a>Now, more than a month after the report should have been published, we learn that there will be further delay. One cannot help but notice that once again a general election is on the horizon, and once again the Government&#146;s failure to manage the economy and support British industry is a topic of intense interest to the general public. Of course, if there is evidence of criminal activity, the police must get involved. But, unless the Minister is implying that government involvement also warrants a police investigation, burying those parts of the report looks less like an attempt to avoid commenting on an ongoing investigation and  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_458"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 458</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more like yet another ploy to avoid public disclosure of the incompetence of the Government until after a general election.</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0907064000115"></a>It has apparently taken the Minister&#146;s department a month to read the report and to identify possible grounds for a criminal prosecution. How long does he expect it to take the SFO to decide whether to investigate? If it decides to prosecute, will the Government use that as an excuse to delay the release of any part of the report until a final judgment is reached? What will happen to the compensation payments in that case? If there is a criminal case to answer, the Government should look carefully at the report and publish those parts that do not relate to that case. As he finished, the Minister said that the legislation does not provide for the report to be published in part. Although the Government do not have a duty to publish the whole, they most certainly have the power to publish in part.</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0907064000116"></a>There are many questions to be answered that do not relate to criminal activity, but are extremely pertinent to an assessment of the Government&#146;s competence. In 2005, when launching the inquiry, the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Alan Johnson,<I></I>said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="0907064000265"></a>&#147;People want to know what happened&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0907064000261"></a>They still want to know what happened&#151;now more than ever&#151;but once again, the Government are trying their hardest to make sure that they do not find out.</p>

It is clearly much more sensible to have a Statement on this important issue, rather than having to deal with it in the noble Lord&#146;s Private Notice Question. We are grateful for that.</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0907064000118"></a>The noble Lord touched on the substance of his Private Notice Question. What action will the Government be taking to help ex-employees of MG Rover who may be entitled to payments from the trust fund set up to help ex-employees in the event of the firm&#146;s collapse? Payments have been pending publication of the report. This is an important issue for ex-employees. Will the Minister explain the Government&#146;s view on this?</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0907064000119"></a>I follow a number of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley. Could the Minister answer the questions rather than just accept the general criticism coming from the Conservative Benches? Why has it taken four years for the Government to conclude that the investigation into the collapse of Rover merits a reference to the SFO? It is almost beyond belief that in the past four years there were no discussions between the ministry, Ministers and the people doing the inquiry which would have indicated at an early stage an issue that ought to be referred to the SFO.</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0907064000120"></a>That leads to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley; there is a suspicion of what is going on here. It is in the Government&#146;s interest for the report to have been delayed for four years and for it then to be kicked into the long grass politically by a reference to the SFO. Unless we can deal with the matter quickly, this will inevitably result in the facts not being known until after the general election. Why  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_459"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 459</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>does the Minister believe it has taken four years? Can he confirm the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, that the investigation has so far cost &#163;16 million? Is that press report true? If it is not &#163;16 million, what does the Minister believe it has so far cost?</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0907064000121"></a>In the context of a suspicion that this is government attempting to delay the whole issue until after the general election because of potential criticism of government action, why have the Government chosen to refer this to the SFO when they had the original report prepared by Pricewaterhouse Coopers, the administrators of Rover, concluding that there was no improper conduct? What weight are the Government now putting on the report by PWC? Why do two separate firms of consultants appear to have reached diametrically opposed conclusions on the need to refer to the SFO?</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0907064000122"></a>Finally, touching on a point that has already been made, when matters affect the individual rights of people who could be under potential criminal prosecution, there is clearly a necessity for some material not to get into the public arena. As an aside, I might say that I am significantly sceptical that we will not read about this in the pages of the <I>Telegraph</I> over the next few weeks, but that is not a matter for the Government. Are the Government prepared to meet the understandable concerns of the public, opposition parties and maybe even members of the Minister&#146;s own party to ensure that as much is published as conceivably can be of the evidence and conclusions of this report? To what extent can it be made public without jeopardising the interests of those who may be subject to prosecution?</p>

<a name="0907064000123"></a><b><a name="90706-0003.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="0907064000398"></a>Lord Davies of Abersoch:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord has raised a range of issues. It is intended that when the report is published it will be made available online and free of charge. It is important to state that this was an arm&#146;s-length, independent and thorough investigation and review of a complex and detailed issue. This was not just one company because there were about 33 subsidiaries and related companies. Some &#163;1.3 billion of creditor money was owed and around 6,000 jobs were directly involved, with a further 12,500 indirectly. Not that many independent reviews of this nature have been done. Apart from Lonrho and Guinness, I think that since 1992, seven inspections have been carried out under Section 432 of the Companies Act 1985. They do not have cost and time limits as such, and given the credibility of the people involved in producing this report, it was up to them to continue a dialogue with the government department, which they did. The cost as of 31 May 2009 was &#163;15.9 million. The Serious Fraud Office now has four years&#146; worth of interviews, witness statements and the report in its totality to evaluate. It has a body of evidence to consider, one hopes, very quickly.</p>

<a name="90706-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0907064000124"></a>I would also say that this is not a cover-up, but a thorough and independent investigation into what was a very difficult corporate collapse. Given the complexity and the timescale, it is important that we do not prejudice any possible action or next steps by the Serious Fraud Office, so in any statements we make we have to be careful that we do not create problems as regards any further investigations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0907064000125"></a>I want to make one other comment, which is that given the sensitive nature of the issue, there has been continuous dialogue. While I accept that it has taken a long time, it is important that an investigation of this type is independent, thorough and done properly. That is exactly what has happened in this case.</p>

Is it not right that a delay is inevitable whenever company inquiries are considered? It is unusual for a delay of three to four years to take place, but not inevitable. Am I not right in thinking that every company inquiry is subject to some delay, perhaps of two or three years? Is it not also considered acceptable for the Government to take some time to consider the report, and that a period of one month should be acceptable? My final question is this: does the Minister agree that it is wholly undesirable to publish this sort of report in part? Is it not inevitable that the Government will be accused of partiality?</p>

We only received this report on 11 June and, given the complexity and seriousness of this issue, the Government&#146;s response has been very speedy.

I hope that the Minister recognises how strong feelings are in the West Midlands. The collapse of the company meant the virtual end of the British-owned motor industry. I understand the point that the Minister makes on the effect that this could have on prosecution, but is there any reason why we should not know the official advice to Ministers in this matter, and on the manner and way they chose to rescue this company? In other words, was it a ministerial decision taken in line with departmental advice, or a decision taken in spite of that advice?</p>

The automotive industry remains the key industry for the UK. Whether that involves advance engineering or the automotive industry in general, the collapse and problems around MG Rover were not the end of the industry in the UK&#151;far from it. We remain a huge producer of car engines, and it is a very important industry for us.</p>

<a name="0907064000132"></a><b><a name="90706-0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0907064000403"></a>Lord Brett:</b> My Lords, with the leave of the House I shall now repeat a Statement made in the other place. The Statement is as follows.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0907064000133"></a>&#147;I wish to make a Statement about the White Paper on International Development published today. We stand at a critical juncture for international development. While millions have been lifted out of poverty over the past decade, thanks to sustained economic growth, reforming Governments, debt relief and increases in aid, much of the progress that we have seen is now imperilled. The global recession, the climate-change crisis, and the ongoing conflict and fragility in many countries threaten to turn back the development gains made since the turn of the century.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0907064000134"></a>The White Paper sets out how this Government will pursue the fight against global poverty, and places new emphasis on four key areas: supporting growth; tackling climate change; tackling conflict and fragility and improving the international system. I will say more about each of these areas in turn, but I will first set out the context for the White Paper.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0907064000135"></a>The past decade has seen real achievements in the fight against poverty. Aid increases and debt cancellation have helped to get 40 million more children into school. The number of people with access to AIDS treatment has increased from 100,000 to more than 3 million. The proportion of the world&#146;s population living in poverty has fallen from a third to a quarter. Yet it is clear&#151;with 9 million children dying each year, 70 million denied the opportunity to go to school, and a billion people around the world without enough food&#151;that the world remains far from meeting the millennium development goals.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0907064000136"></a>The global recession now threatens to trap as many as 90 million people in poverty, which would push back progress by as much as three years towards the first millennium development goal to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. The likely impact of the economic crisis is a stark reminder that the gains made in moving towards the MDGs can be fragile. Those gains are also threatened by the advance of climate change. If temperatures continue to rise at current levels, an extra 600 million people will be affected by malnutrition by the end of the century. Those gains are threatened by the effects of conflict and poor governance. Each year, at least 740,000 people are killed as a result of armed violence, with many more injured or disabled.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0907064000137"></a>Unless all three of these global challenges&#151;the recession, climate change and conflict&#151;are tackled, the MDGs will be pushed far out of reach. Now is not the time to turn away from the mission to tackle global poverty. We are keeping the promises that we made to dedicate 0.7 per cent of national income to development assistance by 2013. By next year our assistance will be equivalent to 0.56 per cent of national income, which is in line with the European Union&#146;s collective commitment, and by next year, we will have nearly trebled our bilateral and multilateral aid to Africa since 2004.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_462"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 462</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90706-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0907064000138"></a>Half our global bilateral aid will be invested in public services, helping to get 8 million children into school across Africa and delivering not only our promised 20 million malaria bed nets by next year but an additional 30 million bed nets by 2013. We will work with others to help developing countries provide free healthcare to their citizens and we will press the international community for more support to save 6 million mothers and babies by 2015. We will continue to tackle sickness, hunger and illiteracy across the developing world. We will also support developing countries to pursue economic growth, to protect their citizens from the impact of climate change, to help resolve conflicts and to build capable, accountable and responsive states.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0907064000139"></a>Let me take each of those in turn. Growth is the exit route out of poverty and aid dependence. Fifty years ago, income rates in east Asia were equivalent to those in Africa; today, income rates in east Asia are five times higher. In the midst of this recession we will help to protect 50 million poor people, in more than 20 countries, from the worst effects of the downturn. We will press for the rapid delivery of the commitments made by the G20 at the London summit to provide further financial assistance to the poorest countries.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0907064000140"></a>We will work towards concluding a Doha deal that would boost the global economy by over $150 billion a year. We will help developing countries to build more fair and sustainable economic growth, double our agricultural research funding and provide investment for infrastructure and reforms that will help African countries to trade with each other and with the world. The Fairtrade label now certifies more than &#163;1 billion worth of goods, helping over 7 million producers and their families. We will continue to support this success story and, indeed, quadruple our support for Fairtrade and ethical trading.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0907064000141"></a>We will advance our work with law enforcement agencies to clamp down on bribery and corruption, which have a parasitic effect on any economy. DfID support to the Metropolitan Police has already led to the recovery of &#163;20 million and the freezing of &#163;131 million-worth of assets. We will now triple our investment in these efforts, supporting the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the Crown Prosecution Service and helping the Met to pursue investigations across more countries.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0907064000142"></a>If the scale of the economic crisis and its impact on the developing world is now clear, climate change presents, if anything, an even greater long-term threat to the prospects of alleviating poverty in the developing world. Two weeks ago my right honourable friend the Prime Minister and my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change launched the UK&#146;s Copenhagen manifesto, setting out our proposals for an ambitious climate deal. This White Paper will ensure that new and additional finance will be made available over and above our aid commitments to reach 0.7 per cent of gross national income. We will also increase our investment in helping developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change but set a limit of up to 10 per cent of official development assistance.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0907064000143"></a>We will also give countries practical support to help them adapt, including by supporting the Hadley Centre to model the effects of climate change in developing countries. We will also encourage low carbon development by investing in clean technology and forests.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0907064000144"></a>Alongside the climate and financial crises, the third great threat to continued progress in reducing global poverty is the continuing level of conflict and state fragility. One-third of the poorest people in the world live in countries affected by conflict or in fragile countries. Half of all children&#146;s deaths before the age of five occur in such places. If we are to make further progress towards meeting the millennium development goals we must work differently in these countries and directly address the causes of war and weak government.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0907064000145"></a>Half of all our new bilateral aid will go to fragile and conflict-affected countries. We will place security and justice alongside basic services, tripling spending on these areas and addressing violence against women as a priority. We will create jobs benefiting 7.5 million people in five fragile countries by 2013. In all fragile countries we will develop joint strategies with the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence, and internationally we will press for the UN, the World Bank and the European Union to provide rapid assistance in the aftermath of conflict.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0907064000146"></a>With regard to international institutions, it is increasingly clear that global challenges demand global solutions, and that if we want to make real progress in solving the economic crisis, the climate crisis and the persistence of ongoing conflict, we will need to work more through the international system. But if international institutions are to live up to these new responsibilities, they must become more accountable, more responsive to current challenges and more representative of all their constituents.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0907064000147"></a>This White Paper sets out our strategy for improving the effectiveness of international institutions in tackling global poverty in the years ahead. We will invest a higher proportion of our new aid resources through the international system in return for securing key reforms.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0907064000148"></a>Our funding for the UN will be subject to performance and increasingly channelled in ways that encourage UN agencies to deliver as one. We will push for the creation of a single powerful UN agency for women by merging the structures that exist, and we will at least double our core funding for work on gender equality in the United Nations.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0907064000149"></a>In Europe, we will press for the EU to create a single development commissioner to reprioritise resources on fragile countries in Asia and the Middle East and make poverty reduction a primary aim of all EU external policies, such as climate and security.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0907064000150"></a>We will press for improved governance and performance of the World Bank, the IMF and regional development banks so that they do more to support poor countries during the downturn. To meet growing humanitarian demands, we will lobby internationally for a stronger humanitarian system and humanitarian access, including through increasing the UN&#146;s Central Emergency Response Fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0907064000151"></a>We will transform our impact and ensure value for money. We will maintain our own rigorous focus on the effectiveness of DfID as an organisation in delivering on its mission. In this time of economic adversity, we will work harder than ever to ensure that every pound of UK aid contributes towards direct and tangible results. We will prioritise our efforts, and work in fewer countries. We will deliver an additional &#163;155 million of efficiency savings by next year by making value-for-money improvements in our research budget and in other areas.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0907064000152"></a>As well as meeting our commitments on aid effectiveness made in the Paris declaration and in the Accra agenda for action, we will further improve the transparency of the projects that we fund through a new searchable database on our website. We will set aside at least 5 per cent of budget support funds to help developing-country Governments in turn to improve accountability to their citizens.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0907064000153"></a>We will establish deeper and broader partnerships with civil society organisations and the private sector, doubling our central support to civil society to &#163;300 million a year and launching a new innovation fund to help community groups and individuals in the UK to support small but innovative projects overseas.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0907064000154"></a>Finally, as the IDC noted in its recent report, signs that the downturn is beginning to undermine previously strong UK support for aid are a cause for concern. This White Paper sets out our plans to do more to show the UK public how government assistance is helping to fight poverty, including through the use of a new UKAid logo, to increase the visibility of our work.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0907064000155"></a>The mission of the Department for International Development, as clearly set out in this White Paper, will remain reducing poverty and supporting sustainable development. A world where too many continue to lack not only the basics of life but the opportunity to fulfil their aspirations diminishes us all. For this Government, and for many people across the United Kingdom, this is a profoundly moral cause&#151;but in the 21st century, development is not merely a moral cause; it is also a common cause.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0907064000156"></a>It has become increasingly apparent at the start of this century that we are ever more interdependent. The evidence of this is all around us, from the internet to the financial crisis, from the label that says &#147;made in China&#148; to the swine flu pandemic that began in Mexico. Our common prosperity demands and depends on shared sustainable growth. Our common security depends on the emergence of effective and peaceful states around the world. Our common climate requires us to take steps now to safeguard the planet for our children.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0907064000157"></a>None of this will be easy, but it is in all of our interests that we grasp the opportunity to bring about real and lasting change. More than ever before, our future prospects are linked to those of the poorest people in the world, and the Government remain committed to building a safer, more secure and more sustainable world for all. I commend this Statement to the House&#148;.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0907064000158"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>

<a name="0907064000159"></a><b><a name="90706-0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0907064000404"></a>Baroness Rawlings:</b> My Lords, we are all deeply grateful to the Minister for repeating that full and helpful Statement, made in another place by the Secretary of State. There is much in this White Paper which we welcome, not least since it adopts a number of themes and specific ideas which we on this side of the House have been championing for more than four years. In this time of economic crisis, which particularly affects the world&#146;s poor, it is a time not to withdraw our support but to redouble our international development efforts. Poverty breeds extremism, incubates disease and drives migration and conflict. So tackling poverty and deprivation is not just a moral duty, it is also in our own very best national interest.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0907064000160"></a>It is a matter of relief for many of our fellow citizens that it is no longer a Labour or Conservative agenda, but a British agenda, which commands widespread support. The Government are clearly listening to the Conservative arguments on international development, particularly on the need to improve our performance in fragile states.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0907064000161"></a>One of our recurring concerns is the intense difficulty of operating effectively in conflict-affected environments. Security costs are often astronomical. The capacity of the Governments we are working with is frequently, by definition, very low or non-existent. Insecurity makes monitoring and evaluation difficult. The risk of corruption is high; local politics are often opaque and complex, and there is a real risk of aid exacerbating tensions. As the recent highly critical evaluation of DfID&#146;s performance in Afghanistan has shown, we need a dramatic improvement in the effectiveness of our aid in war zones. We pay tribute to DfID&#146;s brave staff, who put themselves in harm&#146;s way in places of conflict. What estimate have Her Majesty's Government made of the increased security costs to this department of working more in fragile states, many of them showcases of despair?</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0907064000162"></a>The Minister will be well aware of the National Audit Office report which found that only half of DfID&#146;s projects in the most insecure countries achieve their aims and almost a quarter suffer from fraud or financial problems. Does he accept that if we are to get value for money from our spending in these countries, we need radically to improve the quality of our aid effort and demonstrate this through independent assessment and validation so that lessons can be learnt?</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0907064000163"></a>The Minister is rightly keen to raise the profile and visibility of British aid, but he will be aware that in this age of austerity, spending on rebranding will be carefully scrutinised. How much does he estimate the rebranding exercise will cost? What value for money inquiries and cost-benefit analysis did he undertake before announcing this policy? Does he recognise the risk that UKAid could be confused with USAID? The similarity of the two names could pander to the critics who claim that our foreign policy is already too influenced by Washington. Does he agree that the most effective way to raise awareness of public support for British aid is to focus on the outcomes and achievements it generates, rather than the inputs so beloved of this Government? Security is all-important, but can the Minister tell the House whether money for these new projects is being diverted from the health and education budget?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0907064000164"></a>The White Paper has been launched during the dying days of this Labour Government. The country and Britain&#146;s international development effort need a new sense of direction. There are some good points and sensible suggestions in the White Paper, not least because many of them came from this side of the House. I hope that we will have the opportunity to debate them further over the coming months. The prize for a more effective British international development effort is clear: a better life for millions of people and a safer world for Britain.</p>

Therefore, it involved a delay in my reaching the Chamber. I also thank the noble Lord for repeating the Statement and welcome DfID&#146;s new White Paper. Clearly, a lot of work has gone into it, and I have been well aware of that over the last few months.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0907064000166"></a>We welcome the Government&#146;s stated commitment to fighting for global justice. The recession must not see the bottom billion increase even further, though we see quite a lot of evidence of that already happening. This must, of course, be countered as far as possible at the upcoming G8. I ask for the Minister&#146;s comments on what is proposed for the G8. I welcome the commitment to fighting climate change; it is extremely important to recognise that climate change poses a great danger to us all, but to the poorest first. The fragile states that are made more fragile are a risk to us in Britain, either through terror or migration, as is made plain in the White Paper and the Statement. Again, I welcome the paper&#146;s stated emphasis on women and trust that this will convert into reality. DfID has a strong reputation in this regard, but it has not always translated into a change on the ground in terms of programmes.</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0907064000167"></a>What would be the impact of continued cuts in staff at DfID at the same time as increasing its budget? What does this mean? We have seen a loss of expertise. I have also raised the question of what DfID is doing as regards women. We see sometimes that those programmes are under threat. Where will the efficiency savings that the Minister mentioned fall? He mentioned pulling back from countries; how many countries do the Government intend to pull back from and which countries&#151;or in which areas&#151;might these be? Do we know that working closely with the FCO and the MoD, which is stressed in the paper, is not a way of shifting resources to those other departments, especially in relation to Afghanistan?</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0907064000168"></a>In February&#151;and this was announced as we went into the February half-term Recess&#151;a DfID statement showed a shift of &#163;20 million from DfID to the MoD. When I asked about this in a series of Written Questions, I was told that such exchanges between the FCO, the MoD and DfID often occurred, so I tabled further Questions about what the pattern had been in the past. I was struck by the fact that there were no transfers in the other direction. Although I was told that this was the case, I could not see a pattern of money shifting to DfID from the MoD and the FCO on such a scale, but  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_467"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 467</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it was going in the other direction. We all know about the commitment in Afghanistan and the pressure on all departments. We all hear that DfID is one department that will not be under such pressure, so is that a way of shifting money from a department that is not under pressure to ones that are clearly under pressure? I wonder whether the Minister would comment on that. Is it a problem, too, of DfID being unable to deal, because of cuts of 25 per cent in its staff, with an increased budget, though I am of course pleased that its budget has been increased in the way that it has? Now we hear that 10 per cent will go to DECC. Obviously it is very good that the departments are working with each other, but is this a case of DECC being underfunded and DfID&#146;s budget being raided?</p>

<a name="90706-0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0907064000169"></a>There is a strong emphasis in the paper on supporting fragile states. I would like to know a little more about how these are to be defined. Are they largely in or post-conflict? There are obviously other fragile states&#151;ones, as we see at the moment, with economies that are reliant on a single primary commodity and which will be particularly hit by the economic downturn. Other countries are particularly fragile because of climate change. I would like to know a little more about how fragile states are defined, especially given my concern about the potential shift of money into Afghanistan via the MoD. Is Afghanistan sucking out an awful lot of the money from DfID?</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0907064000170"></a>This paper is about what the UK is doing. It talks of international co-operation through the EU, UN, IMF and so on, but there is the wider field. What we are doing in Africa may be significant but it is not half as significant as what China is doing in Africa, for better or for worse. Given the vital impact of some of these emergent economies on some of the poorest developing countries, I would very much like to know where the United Kingdom stands in relation to that. As the paper makes clear, and I am sure most people would agree, countries will pull their people out of poverty through the growth of their economies. Therefore, what is happening within those economies and within the Doha round is vital. I share the concern of the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, about the potential shift of funding from education, which has always been seen as extremely important in ensuring that developing countries pull out of poverty. The Africa Commission report of 2005 emphasised higher education as extremely important for developing countries in terms of their future global trade prospects.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0907064000171"></a>The paper talks about a shift from bilateral aid towards multilateral aid and mentions half of all our new bilateral aid in that regard. I would like to know how much is involved in that shift. The paper also says that a higher proportion of our new aid will be put into the international system. Is this to be paid for by reducing bilateral aid? We also note the rebranding that was covered this weekend by the <I>Independent</I>. The noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, mentioned this. Again, I would like to know the cost of this. Around the world you see the rebranding of aid into UKAid. It looks nice with the crest and what have you, but around the world you see flags on aid projects. There is concern about too much emphasis being laid on which country gives the aid, whether it is the right aid for the recipient country and whether that country is paying  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_468"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 468</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>too much attention to what donors want as opposed to what it should be doing in the best interests of its people. I am a little concerned about that and I would certainly like to know about the cost of that rebranding. I welcome the commitment to the figure of 0.7 per cent by 2013, but what will be the stages over the years to bring it up to that level?</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0907064000172"></a>I hope that the Minister will comment on one or two other stories that emerged at the weekend. There is pressure in the Conservative Party to cut back on its development plans. Can he comment on the rumoured consideration of aid vouchers and private schools? Would these fit into the White Paper as laid out? In the downturn and in uncertain political times, the UK commitment to development is indeed morally right and in our best interests, as the Minister says. I hope that there is cross-party support, not lip service, in this vital area.</p>

However, they posed pertinent questions. The noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, said that some elements of the paper resemble proposals from her party. I welcome the continued endorsement of the figure of 0.7 per cent as a policy not only of the United Kingdom Government but of the opposition. When I worked in the United Nations, it was very beneficial to have countries with a political consensus in this regard as it gave confidence to international institutions and recipient countries that aid would not disappear with a change of government. There were 2,500 contributions, of which I am sure more than one mentioned the requirement to look at evaluation and other areas. We are not churlish and we are grateful for all the contributions which have produced a White Paper that is better than otherwise might have been the case.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0907064000174"></a>A number of points were made; I always find it easier to deal with the last one first, but I shall try to resist that. DfID operates in 150 countries; it has 64 overseas offices with 2,600 staff. It is true that we are cutting back; we have closed a number of offices in the past few years. We are looking in the next two or three years at other areas. It is a question of concentrating where we think that we can make the greatest impact.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0907064000175"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, made an important point that it is risky and expensive to work in fragile states. By the way, we see 46 states as being fragile&#151;but not all for the same reasons. Some are fragile because of poor governance in the past few years&#151;one can think of Zimbabwe in those terms. Some are fragile because of instability. Some are fragile because of the very real dangers as regards climate change&#151;one had only to read the comments of the Prime Minister of Mauritius at the weekend to know that. Some are fragile because of other matters that could be put right with greater co-ordination&#151;they do not consult sufficiently within their societies. Some are not even democracies. Basically, we think that it is better, although it is expensive and harder, to work in fragile states. Ignoring them would be far riskier, certainly harm the achievements of the MDGs and create the

Our common security clearly depends on there being effective and peaceful states around the world.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0907064000176"></a>The question of evaluation was raised. This is an important issue to which we give considerable attention. It is not true to say that we are lax in that area. We are stepping up evaluation of our work, identifying the results of our efforts and learning the lessons of what does and does not work. That is important for both accountability and making the most of future spending. A major DfID evaluation policy has been launched, which sets out new standards of quality and independence. DfID will support at least 40 evaluations of its country work, policies and success over the next four years. This is in addition to regular internal reviews and independent audits. We will respond to and address concerns raised by independent evaluators to ensure that aid continues to be used and is as effective as possible.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0907064000177"></a>I was asked how we will reach the 0.7 per cent spending commitment. We will increase spending to 0.56 per cent in 2010&#151;I believe that that is the right figure. In 2008-09, DfID was directly responsible for &#163;5.8 billion of UK public expenditure; almost all of this was classed as ODA. That figure has reached &#163;6.3 billion, representing 0.43 per cent, and will increase to &#163;6.8 billion in 2009-10 and &#163;7.8 billion in 2011. Efficiency savings, which were mentioned, were identified as &#163;155 million in the 2009 Budget. That means that we can meet just over &#163;1 billion of additional expenditure and achieve the &#163;155 million of efficiency savings, because of the increasing envelope occasioned by our moving towards the agreed target for 2013. The total spending figure for 2010-11 will be &#163;9.1 billion.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0907064000178"></a>Noble Lords will recall that we started from a premise of spending only 0.36 per cent. Within our new and enhanced aid budget, we have already targeted certain parts of the world. Our aid to Africa is set to double from &#163;1.3 billion in 2004 to &#163;3 billion in 2010. Over half the UK budget&#151;58 per cent in 2007-08&#151;goes to developing countries, either directly or through an international body. The point has been made about the proportion that we are spending bilaterally and internationally; international funding is very efficient, but one has to make sure that the organisations delivering it&#151;the UN agencies and the UN itself&#151;are as efficient as they can be. After 14 years as a policy-maker and a member of staff of one of those agencies, I confess that there are efficiencies to be made. There is a tendency, not invented here, for agencies to pursue their independence. They have to justify it by being different. We want them to work much more as a single force. We particularly encourage countrywide forces under a single person who can, in the event of an emergency or indeed in general, bring together a team that meets the needs of the country. There is movement in that direction within the United Nations and within agencies&#151;although the movement is greater in some than others. We believe that our pressure should continue. What we are prepared to invest in those agencies should be determined by their willingness to take on reform and to deliver more efficiently&#151;something with which all noble Lords will agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0907064000179"></a>I have first-hand experience of the question of the cost of developing UK aid. This month my daughter is in South Africa, doing voluntary work. Last summer she did voluntary work in Thailand. She is 19. On more than one occasion, she said to me, both when I was in my previous job and when I was in your Lordships&#146; House and taking an interest in this subject, &#147;What is it that you do?&#148;. I talked about bilateral and multilateral aid. She said, &#147;Dad, where do you spend the money? What is our money being spent on? What is it achieving?&#148;. Those simple questions are the ones that you get asked. There is an advantage to being able to put a UKAid label on. I take the point about USAID. I take the point also that we may have circumstances in which we do not want to put &#147;UKAid&#148; on a piece of humanitarian relief, perhaps to protect the people who are seeking help.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0907064000180"></a>We are also spending a considerable sum of money improving our support for fair trade and ethical trading. My nearest town is Brampton in Cumbria. The political complexion of Brampton will bring far greater comfort to noble Lords opposite than it does to me. Having said that, the sign as you enter the town says &#147;Brampton&#151;A Fair Trade Town&#148;. Within the British community&#151;this is not the property of any single party or group&#151;no less than two-thirds of people see a requirement for us to do things to support the poor in our own interests. That is very encouraging.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0907064000181"></a>The cost of rebranding has been &#163;97,480&#151;I do not know the figure for pence. That is very competitive when compared to the &#163;400,000 BBC Three logo and the &#163;400,000 London 2012 logo. Now we must discuss it with partner organisations so that it is not used solely as an advertisement for UK plc, but sensitively in a way that confers the greatest advantage without providing any downsides.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0907064000182"></a>It is estimated that the money that we spend brings 3 million people out of poverty every year. That is why we are particularly keen to ensure that we get value for money. We seek to ensure that the increase in funding is matched by an increase in efficiency. This brings me to the subject of working across government departments. The noble Baroness, Lady Northover, expressed the fear that money might be moved out of DfID funding into other forms of spending such as defence. It is not intended that that should be the case. It is intended that DfID funding will go to one purpose only: reducing poverty. However, we need greater co-ordination between the FCO and the Ministry of Defence, particularly as we are introducing the question of justice and security.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0907064000183"></a>People in poor countries want to sleep peacefully at night, and to sleep on a full stomach. We have a long way to go before we can provide the full stomachs, but we can do a lot to provide security. Training police is something that the UK does particularly well. That is taking place already in a number of countries, including Nigeria and several other African countries. The task that we have set ourselves is ambitious, and I urge all Members to read the White Paper in detail. It sets out a continuum from where we started.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0907064000184"></a>I have one final point. It is not for me to comment on what might be in any publication by another party, but we have applied voucher schemes where they are appropriate. There is evidence that using them in, for

We are far more concerned about their use in education and health. The truth is that if there is not a state system able to sustain the spend, there is a danger that vouchers will just become another currency. What is not achieved by the vouchers is an improvement in education or health. I hope I have covered the points made by both the noble Baronesses. I would be more than happy to supply any information if, having read the White Paper in the detail that I have had the opportunity to do over the weekend, there are other queries that they would like to raise.</p>

I endorse all that my noble friend Lady Rawlings said. I particularly welcome in this White Paper the new emphasis on greater support to fragile states, civic society organisations and non-governmental organisations. That is not explicit but I think it is intended in what I have been able to read so far. Would the noble Lord tell us whether there will be increased capacity-building for local economic development? The advocacy of expanding business partnerships at a local level can make a huge difference and is actually easier to do than some of the big schemes that often do not succeed. Also, does he intend there to be greater capacity-building for the delivery of those aspects of the millennium development goals which are way behind their target dates? This is not the time to press him on UN efficiency but that is something to which we really must return, with the many different UN organisations sometimes being counterproductive, as he knows from his own experience. Finally, can he give us an assurance that the Government will provide proper time for a full debate in the coming months? This is a worthy document and, although we may have some questions, we need to build on it and make UK aid even better.</p>

<a name="0907064000186"></a><b><a name="90706-0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0907064000408"></a>Lord Brett:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for her comments, particularly as they come from a distinguished speaker who has spent many years fighting to ensure that aid is both achieving its objectives and spent efficiently. What we are seeking to do in increasing the funding to the smallest civil society organisations is to encourage some of the smaller NGOs to come forward, subject to evaluation, to sponsor smaller projects&#151;projects which, at national level, may appear too small in cost or too great in administration, but which the private sector and the NGO community can do particularly well. The noble Baroness is absolutely right that capacity-building for entrepreneurship and a whole series of other areas would command support. She is also right that we need to pay particular attention to those millennium development goals which are falling behind. It is wise to take this White Paper now because in a year&#146;s time we will be seeking to look at those millennium development goals and review how we get to them beyond 2015, unfortunately, if current progress is maintained.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0907064000187"></a>That brings me to the noble Baroness&#146;s final point. I certainly endorse the value of having a full debate on this issue in your Lordships&#146; House, in part because of  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_472"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 472</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the expertise noble Lords bring. I note that we do not have with us today one or two of our colleagues on the Cross Benches&#151;the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, to name but one&#151;who have shown considerable interest and support. This is a question for the usual channels and not in my gift, but I hope we will have an early opportunity to debate this, because it is a valuable document and is worthy of considerable consideration.</p>

<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="0907064000188"></a><b><a name="90706-0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0907064000409"></a>Baroness Tonge:</b> My Lords, what has happened to the annual report of the Department for International Development, which last year came out in May? We have not yet seen it this year. I remind the Minister that, despite the proposed change of name to UKAid, the Department for International Development is highly regarded and revered throughout the world&#151;certainly in all the countries I have been to. It would be very sad to see DfID disappear.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0907064000189"></a>I am sure that the Minister knows that 30 million women suffer each year from childbirth: they die, suffer permanent disability, or suffer poor physical and mental health. Women&#151;healthy women&#151;are essential for a decent society and for the prevention of conflict. Can the Minister assure us that money will not be transferred from the reproductive health budget, which is so necessary to achieve the second target of millennium development goal 5, to which DfID was pledged last year? Can he assure us that that money will not be touched and that the Government realise that the prevention of conflict depends on healthy women able to play their part in society?</p>

<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="0907064000190"></a><b><a name="90706-0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0907064000410"></a>Lord Brett:</b> My Lords, I bring the noble Baroness good news on two certain points and one on which I give her an assurance but will follow up in writing if any explanation is required. First, I assure her that we are not changing the name of the Department for International Development. We are seeking a name that will be recognisable to show those both inside this country and in the countries that we seek to help that something is provided from the UK, not for the boast of putting a flag on it. I must say as an aside that I think that the United Kingdom system of partnerships over a period with member states and of agreements is infinitely superior to the project and flag-based approach of some other nations, which shall remain nameless. The second piece of good news that I bring her is that the annual report of DfID will be published before the Summer Recess, which, on this occasion, does not make a promise too far that we cannot expect to deliver.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0907064000191"></a>On the third point, I assure the noble Baroness on the basis that I see no proposals to transfer monies in that area, as she suggested, but I will check. If it is not in the small print, I will find out and write to her.</p>

<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="0907064000192"></a><b><a name="90706-0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0907064000411"></a>Lord Hurd of Westwell:</b> My Lords, first, I join in thanking the Minister for his Statement, and for the thoughtful way in which he is answering the points made. Like my noble friends, I am struck by the emphasis that the White Paper evidently places on fragile states&#151;it is not a new emphasis, but it may be a little more emphatic. That comes as some reassurance to those of us who have been worried by what has in  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_473"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 473</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>some cases been a divorce between the British aid programme and British foreign policy, perhaps arising from a rather too absolute interpretation in some quarters of the wording of the 2000 Act and the concept of poverty reduction, which the Minister restated.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0907064000193"></a>I ask two specific questions in that context. The Minister mentioned joint strategies between DfID, the FCO, and the Ministry of Defence. &#147;Strategies&#148; is a greatly overused word. Is it more just the occasional meeting of officials in Whitehall? I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, on her research about the transfer of budgets. I look at that in a rather more welcoming way than she did. The Minister will know that, from time to time, there have been ideas of unifying the British overseas effort in budgetary terms. We started thinking about that a long time ago. Lately, there has been a publication to which several noble Lords put their name suggesting that. If the transfers of budgets discussed today are a movement in that direction, so that in Afghanistan, for example, the money goes to those who can carry out the effort most effectively, that is very welcome. Can the Minister say anything more about that?</p>

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="0907064000194"></a><b><a name="90706-0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0907064000412"></a>Lord Brett:</b> My Lords, on joint strategies between departments, there are two arenas in which those are essential. One is in areas where we are seeking to provide beyond just traditional humanitarian aid, where we are looking at justice and security. The other is in strategically considering the new players, the big players who are providing international and national assistance. One thinks immediately of China; if China and the UK are large contributors to alleviating poverty in Africa, it therefore makes every sense for those two nations to have a strategic approach ensuring that they maximise the achievements in reducing poverty, but that they do so in a way that is non-competitive and not necessarily duplicating.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0907064000195"></a>On the precise point of working across Government, by June 2010 we will have joint strategies between DfID, the MoD and the FCO in all fragile countries where the UK has significant development programmes. That could include Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Uganda and Zimbabwe. Joint strategies across UK departments already exist, but not necessarily in fragile countries. This will help us to co-ordinate diplomatic, military and development efforts. It does not mean that political or security objectives will determine DfID funding allocations. The strategy will be agreed within the framework of departmental mandates and capacities; for DfID, the priority remains poverty reduction.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="0907064000196"></a>I take it that the noble Lord, who was a distinguished Foreign Secretary, has knowledge of these issues that is rather greater than mine. Clearly, in almost any circumstances co-ordination can be improved, and I hope that what we are seeking on this occasion will help to bring better policies than in the past, with greater co-ordination in all those fragile states where we seek to help.</p>

<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="0907064000197"></a><b><a name="90706-0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0907064000413"></a>Lord Hannay of Chiswick:</b> My Lords, perhaps the Minister might forgive me for having missed the first minutes of his Statement. Like the noble Baroness,  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_474"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 474</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lady Northover, I was late in getting here. I thank him for the Statement, which is a step in the right direction; certainly, the recognition that fragile states damage the scope for development, and therefore that before you can achieve sustainable development you have to stabilise the situation, must be right.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0907064000198"></a>Here, however, I go along the same road where the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, has just gone; will this Statement take some of the strain off the discretionary spending on conflict prevention and resolution, which the House was discussing at Question Time this afternoon, by ensuring that some projects in fragile states will be able to move ahead with proper funding even if they do not meet the precise developmental criteria laid down some time ago? If not, I frankly do not understand where the improvement comes from. Perhaps the Minister could clarify that point.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="0907064000199"></a>Secondly, I thank the Minister for his emphasis on what is called &#147;One UN&#148;&#151;that is to say, unifying the UN offices in developing countries. When the Secretary-General launched that idea some years ago, it was extremely disappointing that there was so much resistance from developing countries. I hope that was not entirely associated with the number of Ministers, friends and cousins&#151;Ministers of those countries, I hasten to add&#151;who were employed in different UN offices within those countries. The result, however, was that only a rather limited number of pilot projects were started. Does he have any information about how that programme is going, what the future prospects are, what the UN&#146;s priorities are for extending the One UN programme, and what the British Government, as a major donor, are doing to ensure that that excellent initiative does not run into the sands?</p>

I recognise from personal experience some of his points about the attempt to expand the resident co-ordinator post in a country; some agencies, because they were not in every country, felt threatened that they would therefore be excluded. Others claimed that the resident co-ordinators who were there were not necessarily trained to carry out the role that was sought for them, as the leader of a UN team in a country. The UK Government have been anxious to allay that, partly by providing assistance to ensure that people are trained and that we get the right quality people in that very important role. That will continue, and the Government will continue their efforts to persuade others in the UN system not necessarily to understand the principle, which seems to be fairly accepted, but to move with greater speed from principle to practice.</p>

<a name="90706-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="0907064000201"></a>The answer to the first point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, to be brutally honest, is probably in my brief, but rather than give an off-the-cuff answer I will write to him in greater detail, if I may.</p>

It has probably been an exercise in shadow-boxing since then to get out of DfID a serious amount of engagement with the business community. Will he say more about what those business partnerships will look like specifically in the future? There was a summit at the UN last September, but it has often been the businesses chasing DfID for engagement, not DfID wanting to engage with businesses, which have often taken separate paths and looked to DfID for leadership.</p>

The noble Lord, in a perhaps roundabout and oblique way, declared an interest. I would rather take his question on board, because I do not have a direct answer to it. I have heard criticism abroad in the past about the British Government not being prepared to do anything but talk Government to Government. We think that that has been resolved to a great extent in respect of civil society, trade unions and, I hope, business. However, I happily take the point on board and, if the noble Lord will drop me a note or have a word with me afterwards, I will investigate the matter.</p>

As my noble friend Lord Hurd and others have said&#151;indeed, as the Minister has said&#151;the biggest cause of poverty and degradation in the world in the past few years has been conflict and war. The Minister has said everything that one would wish to hear about co-ordination between the Department for International Development, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence. I hope he understands that he will have the support of those on all sides of the House if that aspiration is translated into action.</p>

<p><a name="st_116"></a>

It is the Government&#146;s view that all the policies&#151;not aspirations&#151;that are set out in the White Paper are serious and are intended to be put into effect. The Government must persuade all those who need to be persuaded, and must be determined to persuade those who appear not to be prepared to carry this through.</p>

<a name="90706-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="0907064000206"></a>It remains the fact that we have a national interest as well as an international responsibility. That is why we say that this is a moral cause but also a common one. Let us take climate change. The Maldives are worried about disappearing for ever. Even in 2007, the summer floods cost the not-so-badly-affected United Kingdom &#163;3 billion, so we have a vested interest, whether that is in climate change or in fragile states. Eight out of 10 refugees who seek to come to this country in whatever form come from failing or fragile states. Again, we have a declared self-interest, but that interest is also moral.</p>

<a name="90706-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="0907064000207"></a>We are therefore pressing for progress on education, health, basic services and the alleviation of hunger and, lately, for an understanding of the food crisis of 2008 in the developing world. There is a need to double food production in the next 20 years, which means using centres of excellence in this country to

<a name="90706-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="0907064000208"></a>It is a gigantic task. I hope that the warm welcome in principle and, in most cases, in general, for the White Paper means that the views of this House about what we should do as a nation are supported by our colleagues not only in the United Kingdom, but in the United Nations.</p>

What is the standing of this document in terms of the entirety of DfID? It seems that there is a lot in here and much of this is mainline work of DfID, and I applaud that. I do not see any reference to the dependent overseas territories: St Helena, Montserrat, or Pitcairn Island. It is the first call of DfID to consider the requirements of those very small places. I do not see any reference to this in this book; so is that to be somewhere else?</p>

I guessed that this flight&#151;or rather, it cannot be a flight; it must be a boat journey&#151;would lead to St Helena. I can give an assurance that overseas dependent territories continue to have first call. I had the whole of Sunday to read the White Paper, and they are mentioned in there. The question of an airport on St Helena remains under review, I hope to be concluded by the end of the year. That is what my brief actually says&#151;I anticipated that one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="0907064000212"></a>I want to come back to the point made earlier, because I did not do justice to the question of the role of business and of growth. Growth is the key. Growth is the exit route and the role of the private sector is crucial to that. We are talking about supporting people through social assistance measures, but also putting &#163;1 billion into support of growth and trade, working for a global trade deal, supporting sound tax systems and having an international growth centre to transform long-term growth. This, I think, is an area where we can guarantee that we cannot do it alone. In fact, the message from the White Paper is that this is not for Governments alone; it is for business, Governments and all of us.</p>

<a name="0907064000213"></a><b><a name="90706-0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0907064000422"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> With Amendment 71, we are looking at the issue of the decriminalisation of associated workers in brothels. This is another step on our road to try to decriminalise as much of this as possible. In introducing these amendments, I commend the Minister for his versatility and energy. He had a lot more consensus, I think, on the Statement just now than he will find from any of us with this Bill. Nevertheless, I shall press on with the amendments in the hope that he will agree with us on some things.</p>

<a name="90706-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="0907064000214"></a>Our first amendment is to decriminalise the associated workers. They are extremely important. The women who work as receptionists or maids are essentially there to keep the sex workers safe, to raise the alarm if something very untoward happens and even to provide company in extremely dull times when there are no customers. None of those should be criminal acts and their presence when they might come across violent clients is essential. Of all the things I saw when we were invited to visit some of the premises in Soho, one of the most shocking was the safe room where women go when they are threatened with violence. There is a steel door and several bolts. It is not used frequently but frequently enough. Something so real as that was, for me, a salutary illustration that these women often face violence. It can appear when they are at their most defenceless.</p>

<a name="90706-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="0907064000215"></a>Amendment 72 concerns the definition of a brothel. I originally tabled this amendment to suggest that the premises should not be regarded as a brothel where there are no more than two prostitutes. The Minister will have noticed that I changed this late last week to four because I reread the Royal College of Nursing&#146;s submission on this subject. With all the experience of nurses as health workers, they felt that four was the right number, so I decided to go for their recommendation.</p>

<a name="90706-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="0907064000216"></a>The Minister has heard me talk before about New Zealand so he will not be surprised to hear me say that, in New Zealand, the law makes a distinction between a small, collectively run brothel of up to four people working together and larger brothels which must be licensed. Reports from New Zealand say that the new legislation has increased the safety and security of women by enabling them to work in this way. By contrast, there is no evidence that it has made life more difficult for those hoping to license the larger brothels, that it leads to more disorder or anything of that kind.</p>

<a name="90706-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="0907064000217"></a>We are simply asking in the proposed new clause for recognition of the reality that, as long as women work in the sex trade, they should be kept as safe as possible. We aim to give the Government a chance to honour their commitment made on 17 January 2006. Fiona Mactaggart, then Minister of State at the Home Office, launched the Government&#146;s <I>C</I><I>o</I><I>ordinated Pr</I><I>ostitution </I><I>S</I><I>trategy</I>.

It said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="0907064000272"></a>&#147;The Government will make proposals for an amendment to the definition of a brothel so that two (or three) individuals may work together&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0907064000218"></a>With this amendment I invite the Minister to go back to the commitment made at that time. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90706-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="0907064000220"></a>Amendment 71 raises an important point about those people working in incidental jobs in premises which are closed down. There is nothing to be gained by criminalising those who have done nothing wrong but work at a business that is later proved to be a front for an illegal brothel.</p>

<a name="90706-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="0907064000221"></a>Amendment 72 rightly raises the concern that this new power will, if used inappropriately, drive prostitutes out of relatively safe brothels and on to the streets. We have all heard the statistics of violence and abuse against prostitutes. It would be entirely wrong to force prostitutes out of their private premises in order to expose them to more of these attacks. As the noble Baroness highlights, even the Home Office accepts that the current definition of brothel goes against common sense. Why have the Government continued with this harmful definition?</p>

Amendment 71 seeks to amend the offence of keeping a brothel used for prostitution by exempting those who do not own the brothel, but are employed there not directly in the provision of sexual services. We do not believe this would be appropriate. However, the amendment could prevent the prosecution of someone who knowingly takes an active part in the running of a brothel. Existing case law already excludes people involved in purely menial and routine duties such as cleaning the stairs or answering the door. We consider it appropriate that someone can be prosecuted for managing or taking part in the running of a business where they have some control over it, even if they are not the owner. The classic example might be a man who has control and ownership of a brothel and employs his brother or friend to manage it. We are therefore not inclined to amend case law in this area by means of legislation.</p>

<a name="90706-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="0907064000223"></a>Amendment 72 also seeks to amend the law in relation to brothels by amending the definition of a brothel to ensure that where one or two prostitutes&#151;the amendment provides for up to four&#151;work together at a premises, whether with or without a maid, the premises will not be considered to be a brothel as long as the prostitutes retain control of their earnings from that prostitution. This definition could apply to a number of offences in the Sexual Offences Act 1956 such as the offence of keeping a brothel. The question of the term &#147;brothel&#148; is defined by case law as a house,</p>
<ul><a name="0907064000275"></a>&#147;resorted to or used by more than one woman for the purposes of fornication&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="0907064000262"></a>This covers two or more prostitutes working together at a premises even if only one of the prostitutes uses the premises at any given time.</p>

<a name="90706-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="0907064000224"></a>The noble Baroness referred to opinions expressed by a previous Minister, and it is true that our <I>Coordinated Prostitution Strategy</I>, published in 2006, sets out a commitment to amend the definition of a brothel so as to allow two or three individuals to work together. This remains part of the prostitution strategy, and during the passage of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill last year, we made a commitment to consult before any change to the definition was made. Following the publication of the strategy, we received considerable feedback about the negative impact such a move might have on the ability of enforcement agencies to identify and deal with prostitution involving trafficked victims, the under-18s or those who have been exploited, as well as concerns from communities about the impact on local neighbourhoods. Furthermore, the recommendations arising from the Government&#146;s review, <I>Tackling The Demand For Prostitution</I>, published in November 2008, make it clear that the priority of the Government should be to focus on measures that address demand. The Government fully accept the findings of that review, and Part 2 of this Bill includes measures to implement some of its specific recommendations. These measures, combined with the non-legislative recommendations made in the review, form the immediate priorities of the Government.</p>

<a name="90706-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="0907064000225"></a>While we still accept that there are arguments in favour of allowing two women to work together in one premises, I am concerned that there could be problems with such a move. Instead, the Government intend to focus their efforts on tackling demand and reducing exploitation. On that basis, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

However, I do not think that the case he has made against Amendment 72 stands up at all. This is a thin Chamber at the moment and obviously there is no question of the noble Baroness deciding to divide the Committee, but the case she and the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, have made for Amendment 72 is very strong.

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="0907064000229"></a>The Minister&#146;s only real argument in resisting Amendment 72 was considerable feedback from the enforcement authorities, but that is only one side of the equation. They are not concerned with health, and calling them enforcement authorities suggests that they are not concerned as much with women&#146;s safety in this instance either. I hope that between now and Report&#151;it is getting ever further away because we have a Statement or even two every day and are making slow progress&#151;the Government will have plenty of time to rethink.

Amendment 73 would ensure that at least if a closure order is offered, it is done fairly by consulting those who should be consulted. Amendment 75 refers to the authorising officer having regard to the views of those consulted, and Amendment 78 is concerned with other measures that could be taken but the police decide for their own reasons that it would be much easier to issue a closure order than to undertake the other more onerous and difficult measures. I invite the Minister to put on record where closure orders should lie in the system of priorities.</p>

<a name="90706-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="0907064000231"></a>We believe that they should be a last resort, particularly when bearing in mind that such premises may be people&#146;s homes and children may be adversely affected. The closure order should be undertaken seriously. The Minister in another place talked about it being necessary to disrupt criminal activity and exploitation. Obviously there must be a level of evidence that serious criminal activity, such as violent pornography or class A drug-taking, is happening on the premises, but the Bill does not say that closure orders should be made only as a last resort, which is worrying.</p>

<a name="90706-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="0907064000232"></a>That brings me to my last point, on proportionality. We should aim to ensure that only proportional action is taken. For example, a closure order was issued this year in Soho against premises, and it was thrown out of court. It was not found to stand up at all, and there was no good reason for issuing it. Had that gone  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_481"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 481</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>through, the effect on the lives of the women would have been devastating, so obviously the courts came to a very sensible judgment. They looked at the evidence and decided that it would not stand up. We do not want to be drafting a Bill that would make that situation likely to fall the other way, so that people who have committed no serious crime but who have some hearsay evidence against them would face disruption to their lives and those of their dependants that would result from a closure order. I beg to move.</p>

They would add an important requirement to ensure that the police operate with the safety of those working within the brothels in mind. As previous debates have highlighted, it is often unclear where the line of exploitation is to be drawn. As the noble Baroness emphasised, it is imperative that when considering a closure order the police should talk to and listen to those in whose interests they are meant to be acting.</p>

The problem with these clauses brings us once again to the realities of work in the sex industry. While I am sure we all welcome the aim of combating trafficking and child exploitation, these provisions, once again, have unintended consequences. We know beyond any shadow of a doubt that sex workers are safer inside than outside&#151;the research suggests 10 times safer&#151;and so measures that drive sex workers out of their premises and onto the street are not desirable.</p>

<a name="90706-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="0907064000235"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, mentioned the closure order that was taken out in Soho at the time we were visiting for meetings with the people who work there. Although in that case the order was not brought into effect, it is important to note that the women who lived there had prompt access to lawyers, who took action immediately. This is unlikely to be the case with many people in that situation. It is very important that the orders are used only for their avowed purpose of dealing with trafficking and exploitation.</p>

<a name="90706-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="0907064000236"></a>It is worth putting on record the comments of the Joint Committee on Human Rights that these provisions carry a real risk of violations of the right to family life and respect for the home under Article 8 of the ECHR, and the protection of property under Article 1 of Protocol 1 where the premises are privately owned. The Joint Committee on Human Rights corresponded with Ministers about safeguards on these provisions but was not satisfied with the assurances. The replies led the JCHR to say that when designing policy,</p>
<ul><a name="0907064000276"></a>&#147;the state is required, as part of the proportionality exercise, to take the least restrictive measures to achieve its aim&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0907064000263"></a>This would mean that closure orders should be made only as a last resort when other methods have been tried and failed.</p>

<a name="90706-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="0907064000237"></a>The JCHR also notes that there is no specific requirement in the Bill for the authorising officer or the court to consider whether an order would make someone homeless and, if so, if they could find alternative accommodation. That, too, leads the JCHR to feel that these measures need amendment. I very much support the noble Baroness.</p>

We seem to have a single grouping now that previously was two groupings. I shall try to respond to all the amendments because, as the noble Baroness said, there is a certain logic in moving them en bloc.</p>

<a name="90706-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="0907064000240"></a>Amendments 73 and 75 are the first of a number of amendments that relate to Schedule 2, which sets up the process for imposing the closure of premises to stop activities relating to certain pornography-related and prostitution-related offences from taking place. Indeed, as the noble Baroness has pointed out, Amendments 73, 75, 78, 80 and 82 have been recommended by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which has commented on the need for appropriate safeguards in these provisions to prevent the inappropriate use of closure orders. We take seriously the points raised by the committee, and I assure the noble Baroness that we share her aim of ensuring that these orders are targeted only at premises where serious criminal activity involving prostitution or child pornography has taken place.</p>

<a name="90706-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="0907064000241"></a>We understand the reasons underlying the committee&#146;s concerns but we do not believe that its particular concerns relating to the closure orders are justified. While I also appreciate the points that the noble Baronesses have raised on this issue, I assure them that the amendments are unnecessary. We believe that the provisions already contain sufficient safeguards against the inappropriate use of closure orders.</p>

<a name="90706-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="0907064000242"></a>It is important to reiterate why these new powers are so important. Currently, if the police suspect that premises are being used for activities related to prostitution or child pornography offences, the police may enter the premises and arrest those who are committing the offences. However, unless the premises are associated with the use of class A drugs, persistent disorder or nuisance, the police are powerless to prevent the premises from reopening once they have left. The provisions are intended to address that issue.</p>

<a name="90706-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="0907064000243"></a>Amendments 73 and 75 would oblige the police to ensure that consultation has taken place with and that they have regard to the views of people identified as having an interest in the premises before they issue a closure notice. There is already a requirement for the authorising officer to be satisfied that reasonable steps have been taken to identify such people. While clearly well intentioned, these amendments could prevent such orders from working effectively. The point of a closure notice procedure is to ensure that premises can be shut  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_483"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 483</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>quickly without tipping off those responsible for the prostitution-related or pornography-related offences that the notice is about to be served. Closure notices may well be used following covert surveillance on particular premises. It would therefore be inappropriate to go in beforehand and try to consult interested parties, albeit that some of those people may be victims rather than the perpetrators of the offence. Aside from disrupting the covert operations and the potential to obtain evidence to convict those who have committed the offences, it could also allow those involved time to organise themselves and take action to make it more difficult for the police to enforce closure notices.</p>

<a name="90706-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="0907064000244"></a>I emphasise that within 48 hours of a closure notice being served, a magistrate&#146;s court must hold a hearing to decide whether a closure order should be made. Any person who resides at the property or who has control of or responsibility for it or any other person with an interest in it may make representations to the court at the hearing. The court may also adjourn the hearing to allow such representations to be made. Such people also have the right to appeal against the making of a closure order and can apply for it to be discharged at any time. In addition, the schedule allows for compensation to be paid to those who incur financial loss as the result of a closure order or notice in appropriate circumstances.</p>

<a name="90706-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="0907064000245"></a>A point was made about the offence in Soho, but that offence seems to prove the point. There was a closure order, it went to a court, the court did not accept the argument and the case was dismissed. That is what courts are supposed to be doing. I do not see that there is any need to be fearful; rather, it is reassuring.</p>

<a name="90706-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="0907064000246"></a>Amendment 78 seeks to ensure that closure orders can be imposed only in circumstances where no other measure will prevent activity relating to the relevant child pornography or prostitution offences taking place. The fact that the order needs to be necessary should be sufficient safeguard to ensure that they are not used where other reasonably practicable steps could be taken by the police to prevent the use of premises or activities relating to specified prostitution or child pornography offences. There may be other measures that could be taken to prevent the use of the premises for such activities, but these may be within the power of the owner or the occupier rather than the police. Equally, measures that the police could take may not be reasonably practicable. For example, putting a police officer on the door of premises 24 hours a day may deter criminal activity but would clearly be very costly and could prevent the police dealing with other priorities in the area. However, we will make it clear in the guidance that police should consider what other steps they could take to prevent the premises being used before issuing a closure notice.</p>

<a name="90706-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="0907064000247"></a>The purpose of Amendment 80 is to ensure that before authorising a closure order, a court must consider the effect that making such an order would have on the human rights of any person who owns or resides at the premises, or anyone likely to be affected by the order. We do not feel that that is necessary or appropriate. The police have to take reasonable steps to establish the identity of who resides in the premises, has control of or is responsible for the premises or has an interest  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_484"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 484</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the premises. It is difficult to see how this would not involve them giving consideration to who could be affected by the order. A closure notice would have to be served on these people, who would have the opportunity to make representations to the court as to why the order should not be made. While we understand the desire to see safeguards in the Bill, it does not appear that this amendment provides a more structured approach to the requirement already imposed on the police and the courts as a public authority under Section 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998 to act in a way which is compatible with convention rights. Therefore, I hope that I can persuade the noble Baroness not to pursue that amendment.</p>

<a name="90706-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="0907064000248"></a>Amendment 82 would omit the proposed new Section 136Q of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. This section gives the Secretary of State order-making powers to extend the power to issue a closure notice to persons other than police officers. That has not been referred to, so although it was mentioned in what I might call the supergrouping, it may be something to which the noble Baroness wishes to return and perhaps I should not proceed.</p>

As I have said, the power in proposed new Section 136Q gives the Secretary of State order-making powers to extend the power to issue closure notices to people other than police officers. Although we have no current intention of extending these powers beyond the police, it will be necessary to review the situation on the basis of operational experience once the orders have been implemented. If the Secretary of State should decide to exercise the power provided by new Section 136Q, Parliament will, of course, have the opportunity to scrutinise the order exercising the powers; as such, the order will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Therefore, I hope, although I do not expect, that the noble Baroness will be reassured that any attempt to widen these powers will receive sufficient parliamentary scrutiny and will be content not to press her amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="0907064000251"></a>Finally, the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, spoke about off-street prostitution and about providing a safer environment. In the Government&#146;s view, it is not necessarily a safer environment. Operation Pentameter, a national police operation targeted at trafficking for sexual exploitation, identified 167 adult victims located in different types of premises. This has highlighted the nature of the conditions in which some people are involved in off-street prostitution. In terms of safety, the difference between off-street prostitution and street prostitution can be exaggerated.</p>

I have offered to try to provide some information. There are parallels to an extension of the powers, which would be subject to an affirmative resolution. For example, local authorities already have the power to issue closure notices in relation to premises associated with persistent disorder or nuisance. Although we have no intention yet of so doing because circumstances do not suggest that it is necessary, we ask for this power so that the necessary view, based on operational experience, can be taken once the orders have been implemented.</p>

The Government will get a strong message from the joint opposition to these clauses. The Minister made a comment about the relative safety of women working on or off the street. There have been about 60 murders of sex workers over the past 10 years. Of those 60, can the Minister tell the Committee how many were murdered while working on the street, and how many were murdered while working in brothels? As the Minister knows, I was not immensely happy with the replies to many of my points but I am afraid it went from bad to worse. The idea that we would want something of the nature that he suggested before this House by affirmative resolution is, given the breadth of problems that it might produce, something that we will be likely to resist very strongly.

I do not have the statistics on the number of murders, but I suspect that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, may have them, since she collects them with an avid interest.

I do not have the figures for the division; it was not a trick question. Perhaps the Minister will find the figures easier to get than I would. I certainly would not want to suggest with any of our amendments that we underestimate the destructive, terrible and appalling nature of trafficking. Obviously, where that is the real reason for a closure order, it might be a substantial reason for issuing it. However, we still have doubts regarding the way the measure is drafted and the assessment of its impact on the lives of the people involved. A woman who is suspected of having committed one of the specified offences and whose premises are closed cannot even enter them to pick up her spectacles. The premises are closed there and then. She cannot collect her belongings and is excluded, as are any of her relations, dependants or people with whom she works. The English Collective of Prostitutes has called it a very violent psychological experience. The women who underwent such an experience recently in Soho had to withstand mutterings from hostile neighbours in addition to undergoing violent psychological trauma. This issue needs to be handled correctly. I hope that we can discuss it before Report. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

These provisions are very similar to those relating to closure orders for anti-social behaviour and drug offences. It is particularly important that they are proportionate. I share the concerns raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in relation to the previous group of amendments that the Bill&#146;s wording is pretty wide. For example, new Section 136B(8) states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09070618000180"></a>&#147;it does not matter whether the officer believes that the offence or offences in question have been committed or that they will be committed&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070618000132"></a>That is extraordinary wording to have in a Bill in relation to an offence. All the officer has to have is &#147;reasonable grounds&#148;. I would like the Minister to tell us what constitutes reasonable grounds. If it does not matter whether the officer believes that the offence has been committed or will be committed, what would constitute those grounds?</p>

I, too, invite the Minister to agree that, as drafted, the Bill gives great power to police to close brothels on nothing but speculation and rumour. We agree with the noble Baroness that brothels should not be closed without good reason, with all the associated danger for prostitutes working there, which was highlighted in the debates on previous clauses.</p>

<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="09070618000004"></a><b><a name="90706-0007.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="09070618000192"></a>Lord Brett:</b> Amendments 74 and 79 relate to the issuing of a closure notice by a constable or a closure order by a court. As has been said, they would remove new Sections 136B(8) and (10), which Schedule 2 inserts into the Sexual Offences Act 2003. These subsections are intended to ensure that premises can be closed where the offences have not yet been committed as well as where offences have been committed.</p>

<a name="90706-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09070618000005"></a>The conditions for issuing a closure notice or making a closure order focus on whether activities related to the relevant prostitution or pornography offence have taken place on the premises rather than whether all the elements of the offence have yet been committed by a particular person. This means, for example, that where premises are being used for controlling prostitutes for gain, it is enough that the officer reasonably believes that sexual services are being provided at the particular premises. It is not necessary for the police officer to have reasonable grounds to believe that all the elements of the offence of controlling a prostitute for gain have yet been committed, so for example, they will not have to believe or prove that the controllers have yet received a gain from their activities. We believe, therefore, that these subsections are necessary to clarify the meaning of the conditions governing the issuing of a closure notice or the making of a closure order.</p>

<a name="90706-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09070618000006"></a>We share with the noble Baroness, and no doubt many of your Lordships, the aim of ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect individuals from their premises being closed arbitrarily. However, given the important issues that these orders aim to tackle, we also need to ensure that the police have the necessary powers to respond rapidly when they have reasonable grounds for believing that it is necessary to close premises to avoid future offences occurring. On that basis, I would ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment. I think that I have defined &#147;reasonable&#148; as it is seen in the Government&#146;s eyes.</p>

However, none of us is talking about those people. We are talking entirely about people who voluntarily and willingly exercise this trade. We may not particularly like it, but that is not our job; our job is to ensure that legislation does not target people unnecessarily.</p>

<a name="90706-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09070618000009"></a>This is a probing amendment. New Section 136C(1) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="09070618000141"></a>&#147;A closure notice must&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="09070618000142"></a>(a) state that no-one other than a person who regularly resides on, or owns, the premises may enter or remain on them&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070618000134"></a>I am not sure how anybody is going to identify whether somebody is regularly on the premises. We need to establish what inquiries will be made to find out whether somebody is on the premises continuously, every night or whether they use the premises occasionally but are still part and parcel of what is going on there. How will those inquiries be made? The Minister said earlier that inquiries would be made to ascertain who the people were, whether they were connected with criminal activity and whether such activity was taking place.</p>

<a name="90706-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09070618000010"></a>As I say, new Section 136C(1) says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="09070618000143"></a>&#147;A closure notice must&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="09070618000144"></a>(a) state that no-one other than a person who regularly resides on, or owns, the premises may enter or remain on them&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070618000011"></a>Therefore, under this provision some people may be entitled to stay on the premises. To whom would that apply? Would people not engaged in illegal activity be allowed to go back; for example, prostitutes who are voluntarily there and are not acting illegally? Would they be able to return or would everyone be pushed out and made homeless? Will other agencies be able to help people in that situation? However, new Section 136D(2) states absolutely categorically:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="09070618000145"></a>&#147;A closure order is an order that the premises in respect of which the order is made are closed to all persons&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070618000135"></a>It cannot be both; either some people are allowed to remain for legitimate purposes or nobody is allowed to remain. It is not unfair to ask which this will be. I would certainly feel more comfortable with all this about the closure order if I felt that illegal activity, which we are all against, was being closed down.</p>

<a name="90706-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09070618000012"></a>All of this, as we have said, is about the voluntary aspect of this, and people being thrown out of their business or work premises, or whatever, for at least three months, and having to go to court as a result, because they are doing something illegal&#151;which they may not be. We need to be clear about getting this definition right; that we are all talking about the same people, and we are not talking about those who are engaged in illegal activity. No one here would support any of that, but we would like to know what happens to those who are perfectly legitimately doing what they are doing, which no legislation stops them from doing, and how they will be supported by other agencies while their premises are closed. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09070618000016"></a>However, Amendment 76 would remove the word &#147;regularly&#148; from new Section 136C which deals with the content and service of a closure notice. A closure notice is issued by the police before an order can be applied for from the court. Under the current provisions, this must state that only those who regularly reside on or own the premises may remain on them.</p>

<a name="90706-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09070618000017"></a>The amendment would have the effect of allowing people who reside on the premises to visit the premises on an occasional basis. We believe that this widening is not appropriate. It could lead to people who had been using the place for prostitution staying overnight&#151;perhaps on a visit from another city&#151;claiming that that they could stay because they had visited the place before. That is not our purpose. The amendment would also make the closure notice more difficult to police because of difficulties in establishing who could be said to reside at the premises, however infrequently.</p>

<a name="90706-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09070618000018"></a>We believe that in circumstances where a closure notice has been issued&#151;namely where a police officer has reasonable grounds for believing that the premises are associated with certain serious criminal offences&#151;it is reasonable to expect people for whom the premises are not a sole or main residence to refrain from entering the premises. For these reasons, we resist the amendment.</p>

<a name="90706-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09070618000019"></a>I shall seek to deal with the precise point made by the noble Baroness. When a closure notice is made, those who regularly reside on the premises can remain there. In other words, in the period between the notice and the court&#146;s decision, the owners or people who regularly reside there can stay. However, if the court makes a full closure order, no one is then allowed to remain. The court will of course consider representations from those affected. As I have said, people are free to go back to the court within the three-month period.</p>

<a name="90706-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09070618000020"></a>Closure orders are more likely to be used when police have covertly surveilled the premises and, therefore, may well have knowledge of those living on the premises as a result of that surveillance and other inquiries made during the investigation. We do not believe that the amendment is necessary; it would widen the aspects, and there is a distinction between the two parts of the legislation&#151;between notice being given and court appearance, when there is a closure order. If that is not absolutely correct or clear, I will seek to write to the noble Baroness in greater detail.</p>

One may simply be to ask whether it knows of the premises, and whether it is bothered about it or has had concerns. Another reason might be that it is perfectly possible that people will be evicted or be out of the premises for two or three months&#151;people may be on drugs and will need care. Who else will be involved? You cannot just tip people out; if you are going to make a closure order, you are going prosecute because you are concerned about the nature of the activities that have taken place, which are likely to have been illegal&#151;that, as I understand it, is the reason for the closure order&#151;but you may also find that there are people there who are not acting illegally. What other agencies will provide support to the police? I am certain that a court would want to know the answers to these questions.</p>

For example, what would happen if, as regards the third condition, reasonable steps had not been taken to establish the identity of any persons residing on the premises? You might be closing the premises although you had the wrong person. I should like to probe the Minister on why only two out of the three conditions apply, although the Bill specifies that three conditions need to be met. Why is it reasonable to revert to only two of them? We have specified in Amendment 81 that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="09070618000147"></a>&#147;The third condition is that the court is satisfied that the authorising officer has satisfied himself of the identity of the ... parties&#148;.</p>

The closure notice must then be served on those people who have been identified. If the police have failed to serve the closure notice on those who appear to have an interest in the property or they fail to take reasonable steps to identify such people, the notice will not have been validly served and the court would be expected to refuse to entertain the application for a closure order on those grounds. In this respect, the provisions are the same as those found in Schedule 20 to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 for premises associated with persistent disorder or nuisance.</p>

This is a particular concern of the Standing Committee on Youth Justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09070618000041"></a>It is accepted entirely that closing, temporarily or permanently, premises used for trafficking or for the sexual exploitation of children is required by the Council of Europe conventions on trafficking, and has a role to play in safeguarding children who would otherwise be victims of exploitation. However, children need special protection under the Government&#146;s view about safeguarding children, and our international human rights obligations. The amendment suggests that the Government may wish to ensure that, before any children are made homeless by the closure provisions, an assessment is made by the local authority involving a number of agencies to ensure that the arrangements made will leave the children in a better position than they were in before. It would be helpful if the Minister would give the Committee an indication of whether that is what the Government intend&#151;and, if so, where it will be made clear. I beg to move.</p>

Its effect would be that a closure order could not be made in relation to premises where a child is resident unless a multi-agency assessment of that child&#146;s needs has taken place. We recognise that it is important that these orders are not used inappropriately, and that the impact of any closure order on those living at the premises is considered carefully, particularly when those people are children. However, we believe that there are already sufficient safeguards within these provisions and other relevant legislation to ensure that the needs of children are considered fully.</p>

In some cases, the child will be a victim of the offence. In such circumstances, it is clearly imperative to take all necessary steps to prevent

We are assuming, with the Minister&#146;s reply, that the premises are pretty small, but they could be enormous and multifloored with only one door. The children may be living far away from the offences and have no part in them at all, but by virtue of the closure order&#151;I seem to remember when the Minister was replying to a much earlier amendment he said it might be a matter of great urgency and the closure order would have to be issued then and there&#151;the children would become homeless and so would their parents. The likelihood is that they would be taken into care, which is pretty traumatic. Obviously, if the child is the victim in this situation, that is one thing, but if this is just somewhere the child lives and they are not involved in any of the activity, surely that is a completely different case.</p>

The police will be raiding premises such as this only either on the basis of covert surveillance or because they have identified the people resident within it. It would make every sense for the police, recognising their responsibilities under the Children Act, to ensure that they made contact with the children&#146;s department of the local authority to discuss with it the likely outcome in terms of homelessness for the people concerned. While the noble Baroness raises a point, the reality is likely to be somewhat different. I think removing the child without any unnecessary delay would be sensible. I do not see too many brothels being likely to provide crches and facilities that segregate children, as the people who run those kinds of organisations do not tend to have that degree of scruple.</p>

Before we start on Clause 26, I would like to proffer an alternative to what is being proposed in this legislation. I tabled Amendment 82A to probe exactly what the Government are seeking to do through Clause 26 and to explore whether their concerns with the current legislation cannot be met through the Licensing Act 2003.</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09070618000051"></a>As I understand it, the motivation for Clause 26 and the associated schedule is to address the understandable concern that local authorities and licensing authorities do not have the means available to refuse licence applications or modifications that allow adult entertainment. Quite rightly, the Government are seeking to give local residents a powerful voice in raising concerns about the establishment of lap-dancing clubs on their doorstep, and we continue to support that. We believe that residents have a strong role in this. There are many reasons to be concerned about lap-dancing clubs, and I have great sympathy with the organisations which have worked so hard to highlight examples of exploitation within that industry and sought to protect the women working in it. It is also clear that many people have understandable moral qualms about the sort of behaviour that such clubs are reputed to encourage and are worried about behaviour spilling out beyond their four walls.</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09070618000052"></a>As my amendment indicates, I do not believe that we need to use a 25 year-old piece of legislation to achieve a reduction in this. By my reading, the Licensing Act&#146;s objectives are more than adequate to deal with the concerns. If they are not, there is already the precedent of the mandatory conditions for certain licences within it to fill the gaps. My proposed new subsection (4) quotes liberally from guidance to the Licensing Act issued by the Government. It makes clear that the licensing objectives of preventing public nuisance or protecting children from harm are directly relevant to the concerns that have been raised. If there is evidence that having a lap-dancing club near a school or college leads to harassment of the pupils or students, why is that not already taken into account under the protection of children from physical, moral and psychological harm? If a new lap-dancing club would cause an unwelcome change in the tone of a residential area, why is the licensing authority not taking account of the reduction in the living amenity of interested parties in the vicinity?</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_497"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 497</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90706-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09070618000053"></a>Local residents may find themselves unable to raise their concerns about a licence application. This appears to be the case from the debates in another place. I strongly encourage the Minister to bring forward amendments to the Licensing Act to address this. Nothing in that Act was intended to exclude residents&#146; or local organisations&#146; voices, so it is clear there is a wider problem. I would be very glad to work with the Minister to improve this part of the Bill, although there might be some concerns about scope and departmental responsibility because this would straddle out of our area.</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09070618000054"></a>Another useful part of the Government&#146;s guidance was the detailed chapter on cumulative impact, which I have incorporated into my proposed new subsection (3). Licensing authorities are already allowed to establish a special policy around an area where they feel the number of licences being applied for is giving rise to an unwelcome cumulative impact. This is obviously relevant in areas where there is a growth of clubs or bars. There is no reason why it should not be applicable to lap-dancing clubs, too. The development of an area into a quasi red-light district, if that is what is being expected, is obviously one the licensing authority should have the power to control. This is a problem the Government are trying to address through the use of quotas for the licensing of lap dancing. We will come to the quotas in more detail later. In the mean time, does the Minister not accept that the cumulative impact guidance already given to licensing authorities gives them the power to refuse applications when they contribute to a negative cumulative impact?</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09070618000055"></a>We turn to the code of conduct. So far the parts of my proposed new clause that I have discussed are merely explanations and clarifications of the existing law. Licensing authorities are already actively encouraged by the Government to interpret the provisions this way. Proposed new subsection (5) in my amendment describes the one area where I feel that the Licensing Act may be deficient in protecting against inappropriate adult entertainment&#151;or adult entertainment in general, because it may not be inappropriate. In speaking to outside groups on the matter, it became clear that although some premises licences specifically cover adult entertainment and include a number of safeguards and restrictions, others did not mention it at all, and it became permissible almost by accident. That is clearly not desirable, so I have inserted a new mandatory condition following the precedent of the licences that permit alcohol to be sold or films to be shown. A mandatory condition would ensure that adult entertainment is properly regulated with a binding code of conduct. In that way, the valid concerns about the exploitation of workers and the behaviour of customers and performers can be met through those representations.</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09070618000056"></a>Much of subsection (3) of my proposed new section, for example, is taken directly from the Local Government Act 1982. The criteria seem entirely appropriate in that regard and would be a useful addition to the Licensing Act. It allows for local premises such as schools or charities to be taken into account, as well as controlling the outward appearance of the club, thus adding to existing legislation on indecency and obscenity.</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09070618000057"></a>There are a great many advantages to using the Licensing Act, rather than proceeding to introduce a lot more cumbersome legislation. The following groups of amendments that we have proposed go into much more detail about our concern with the provisions as drafted, so this is an alternative to the rest. My amendment is an attempt to find a consistent, clear and easily understandable way forward to address valid concerns. I declare my interest as a member of a local authority, although I am not on the licensing committee so I would not be involved. I will be interested to hear from the Minister why this approach was not considered or preferred before the Bill was proposed. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09070618000058"></a><b><a name="90706-0009.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09070618000230"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> The amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, offers a far more appropriate solution to what is undoubtedly a problem that the Government are right to address.</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09070618000059"></a>I like several things about the amendment. The local authority is absolutely the right place to have such debate and discussion. Licensing committee members are trained and updated regularly on everything that they need to consider. They are well able to weigh the sort of balances that they will have to in such cases. It is undoubtedly difficult to do so for a community where the spectrum of what are called lap-dancing clubs is so wide, from reputable premises that are very well run and causing no aggravation to neighbours&#151;and probably contributing to the life of the community and employment opportunities&#151;to the most seedy, exploitative establishment that it is possible to imagine, including everything in between. It is impossible to legislate for that entire spectrum, but we can empower local authorities to make those decisions.</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09070618000060"></a>I know that there has been criticism of that approach from some quarters, saying that we would end up with a postcode lottery, instead of taking a more centralised approach. All parties have talked about localism and empowering local communities, and that is exactly what we should aim to do here. What might go down okay in&#151;it is hard to pick a town without causing offence, so I will take the town about which the leader of my party leader in this House speaks a lot, so I will rightly get into trouble if I get it wrong&#151;Blackpool might not go down well in a small rural town in Suffolk, for example. The licensing authority should be the place to have those debates, so that it can lay down the conditions it considers appropriate. There may be one or two small drafting differences between us, but, on the whole, I support the amendment.</p>

We must not forget that lap dancing is a relatively new development that has become increasingly popular. Without wanting to spoil the fun of people who enjoy that sort of thing, there are obviously sides of it that are less than desirable. One has seen examples of that in the press. I will certainly be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the proposal. Normally, this would fall under local licensing authorities, so I await with interest what I shall hear from him.</p>

The answer is that we considered using the Licensing Act 2003, but local authorities told us that they wanted the 1982 Act to be used. I shall seek to explain why and answer the points that the Baroness raised.</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09070618000063"></a>Although the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment is aimed at dealing with issues specifically arising from the provision of adult entertainment, I fear that it would have a wider impact on all applications considered under the Licensing Act 2003. First, the amendment attempts to state in the Bill how three of the four licensing objectives should be interpreted, using definitions from the statutory guidance issued to licensing authorities under Section 182 of the 2003 Act. As the definitions used in the amendment are already contained in the statutory guidance, the Government do not believe that their inclusion in the Act would add substantially to the powers available to local authorities or change how the licensing objectives are currently interpreted. It has been the experience of numerous local authorities that the powers available under the 2003 Act have not been sufficient to control lap-dancing clubs opening against the interests of local communities. Therefore, more extensive amendments are required.</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09070618000064"></a>Secondly, the amendment would provide local authorities with power to publish a special policy creating a rebuttal presumption and applications would be refused if they were likely to add to the cumulative impact on one or more of the licensing objections in a certain area and the applicant could not demonstrate in his operating schedule that there had been no such impact. Although I understand the intention behind the provision, again, I do not believe that it would add to the existing powers available to local authorities. One of the difficulties with the current regime is that local people and responsible authorities may have concerns about lap-dancing clubs that are not covered by the four licensing objectives.</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09070618000065"></a>Thirdly, the amendment introduces a requirement for any premises authorising adult entertainment to contain a condition requiring the premises to have a code of conduct approved by the licensing authority. Again, the Government have some sympathy with the concept of a code of conduct for lap-dancing clubs, but we need to be sure that such a code can be enforced. Under the 1982 Act, the local authority can impose standard conditions on sex-encounter venue licences. The standard conditions should cover those measures that are expected to be included in the code of conduct. It would be a criminal offence to contravene those conditions without reasonable excuse.</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09070618000066"></a>On the other hand, it is unclear what the sanctions could be for a breach of the code of conduct as proposed by the noble Baroness. The licensing authority would not be able to review the licence on the basis of the code of conduct having been breached, unless the conditions in the code were relevant to one or more of the licensing objectives. The code proposed under the amendment would also fail to deal with the issue of whether the premises should be granted a licence in the first place. The facts to which the licensing authority should have regard when approving the code  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_500"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 500</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of conduct tend towards that issue, rather than to how the premises should operate as a sex-encounter venue once licensed.</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09070618000067"></a>The impetus behind the reforms proposed in the Bill is a recognition that the existing regulatory framework provided by the 2003 Act has been unable to address the particular concerns that the presence of lap-dancing clubs raises for many local communities. Under the 2003 Act, objections made by local people on which local authorities can act must be based on the four licensing objections. Those, as we know, are the prevention of crime and disorder, public safety, the prevention of public nuisance and the protection of children from harm. The experience of many local communities in recent years has been that widespread objections based on the impact that a lap-dancing club might have on an area&#146;s character or the inappropriateness of such clubs being located in certain largely residential areas have been disregarded, not because the concerns are invalid but because the 2003 Act does not recognise objections on those grounds.</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09070618000068"></a>Situations have therefore arisen where lap-dancing clubs have been opened in the face of widespread local opposition. Clause 26 seeks to address that situation, whereas Amendment 82A would, indeed, retain the status quo. Given that the Licensing Act 2003 aimed to create an integrated framework for the licensing of entertainment venues, I can understand the appeal of attempting to address the issue of lap-dancing clubs within the scope of the legislation. However the Government believe that, as with licensed gambling, certain venues require additional controls specific to the form of entertainment that they provide.</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09070618000069"></a>For lap-dancing clubs and similar venues, we firmly believe that the necessary controls are best provided by Schedule 3 to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982, and local authorities are certainly supportive of that approach. While I therefore certainly understand the intention behind the amendment, I hope that I have explained why the Government are not able to accept it and that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw it.</p>

I am not entirely surprised by his rejection of the amendment, because I suspect that some thought has probably been given to that. As we go through the other amendments, however, we may very well come back to the fact that this legislation would have been, and is, perfectly adequate if amended to include lap dancing. One real advantage in this, as was pointed out by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, is that it makes it very local; it means that something which affects local people, as the licensing of any premises does, can be dealt with against a local background. That is very important, while the number of premises&#151;which we shall, again, be coming to&#151;should also be in the hands of the local authority.</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09070618000071"></a>We would quite readily accept that a number&#151;and probably the great majority&#151;of these premises are extremely well run. They do not cause a problem, and there are actually few complaints about them from anywhere. The people who know about that are, again, local and able to comment or not as the situation arises. For today&#146;s purposes, I shall not pursue this but

The amendments in this group proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, would appear to be based on exactly the same concerns. I would much prefer to see &#147;adult entertainment venue&#148; in place of &#147;sex encounter venue&#148;.</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09070618000073"></a>My concerns about &#147;sex encounter venue&#148; are precisely those that the Minister claimed were behind Clause 15 &#151;the stigma that a name can give. The Minister has, quite rightly, argued that the phrase &#147;common prostitute&#148; bears with it a stigma that is often inaccurate and unfair. It will almost always lead to prejudice in future life; for example, in job interviews. That is, of course, true, so it is astonishing to see that the Government are happy to label a large number of dancers who have never participated in prostitution as &#147;sex encounter workers&#148;. How does the Minister expect a lap dancer ever to break into a more socially respectable line of dancing with that on her CV?</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09070618000074"></a>Not only is the Government&#146;s choice of title prejudicial to the women involved, it could be downright dangerous. The Government appear to be instilling an expectation among the customers that they are, in fact, entering a lap-dancing club to engage in a sex encounter. Since many of those clubs have a strict no-touching rule, the Government appear to be raising the most perverse expectations among lap-dancing clientele, which could result in considerable disaffection.</p>

<a name="90706-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09070618000075"></a>I am sure that the Minister would not deliberately suggest that lap dancers should be stigmatised as sex workers or, even worse, should be expected to participate in sex acts or encounters. I therefore recommend to him the alternatives proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, as a far more appropriate title for these sorts of venues. So many of the provisions in the Bill have the laudable intention of enhancing the dignity of women, but I suggest that Clause 26(2) could well achieve precisely the opposite effect. I beg to move.</p>

He made his points very well. We received strong representations, for example, from Equity, which feels that its members working in that field are being completely misrepresented if they are portrayed as working in the sex industry; they actually work in the entertainment industry. In any case, we are probably starting from the wrong place with the first name of lap dancing which is, I think, an American term implying something to do with sitting on laps. In the world of entertainment in this country there is a strict &#147;no touching&#148; rule anyway, so we might have to step back even further and address the whole way that we talk about this business, because we need to draw clear lines of definition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09070618000078"></a>Nor does this provision do any service to our overseas visitors who come over here and might be interested in going to an adult entertainment venue, quite possibly with their wives or girlfriends, but would absolutely not dream of going to a sex encounter venue. When they are told that something is classified as that, how on earth are they supposed to know that it is a perfectly respectable burlesque venue? On the other hand, if they are looking for a sex encounter and turn up at the perfectly respectable burlesque venue, they will be mightily disappointed. Calling it such an inappropriate name does no service to those who work in it; neither does it to the customers who have every right to expect it to be accurately labelled for what it is. That should start in the legislation, so I hope that the Government will think about renaming those venues.</p>

Everybody knows what adult means and I should have thought that it would be very much better to stick to that and to encourage the side of things that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, pointed out, is part of how we have interpreted the whole of that scene, given the no-touching requirements that are part of the lap dancing culture.

The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, suggested that we are using the wrong term by using the term &#147;lap dancing&#148; at all. In that case, what is the Lap Dancing Association doing about it, given that it has chosen to call itself the Lap Dancing Association&#151;an association that represents the owners of these establishments? I suggest that lap dancing, which covers pole dancing and other similar activities, is not an inappropriate name in itself.</p>

<a name="90706-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09070618000081"></a>As the noble Baroness says, the amendments in the group seek something of the same end. Amendment 83 reflects concerns about the term &#147;sex encounter venue&#148;.  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_503"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 503</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>If it were accepted, sex encounter venues would not fall under the definition of a sex establishment under the 1982 Act. There is, however, no requirement in the clause for a lap dancing establishment to call itself a sex encounter venue. If it chose to advertise itself as such when it did not provide that, trade descriptions legislation might be a better way of dealing with that. In truth, this is how they are described in licensing terms, not how they are described in public relations or advertising terms.</p>

<a name="90706-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09070618000082"></a>The point has been made that the word &#147;encounter&#148; could give the impression that lap dancing clubs and similar venues offer sex for sale and by implication stigmatise those who work at such venues. We take this concern seriously. We are aware of our responsibility to those who are employed in the industry not to represent unfairly them and the work that they do. However, we believe that the term &#147;sex encounter&#148; accurately reflects the nature of the entertainment that is provided. We do not accept that the impression is given, or that it will be reasonably assumed, that sex is for sale, particularly as we do not require the term &#147;sex encounter&#148; to be used publicly by the establishment that is so licensed.</p>

<a name="90706-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09070618000083"></a>We also think that &#147;adult entertainment&#148; would be an inappropriate name as it is not clear, despite what the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, says, that it could apply only to venues that provide entertainment with a sexual content. Other forms of entertainment, such as horror films, have been called adult entertainment, without any obvious sexual content at all.</p>

<a name="90706-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09070618000084"></a>We are looking at what Clause 26 attempts to target. The definition of &#147;relevant entertainment&#148; is clearly that, to qualify as a sex encounter venue, the entertainment must be,</p>
<ul><a name="09070618000085"></a>&#147;any live performance; or ... any live display of nudity; which is of such a nature that ... it must reasonably be assumed to be provided solely or principally for the purpose of sexually stimulating any member of the audience&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070618000137"></a>Where that definition does not apply, such venues will not be classed as sex encounter venues. The definition does not suggest that these are premises where sex is being sold, as criminal law rather than licensing law steps in to deal with those establishments.</p>

<a name="90706-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09070618000086"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, made the plea that we should not use the term &#147;sex encounter&#148;. He is much senior to me both in experience and wisdom, and can probably recall the term being brought into effect in 1986 by a Government who are familiar to Members on the Benches opposite. It has been used to define venues such as peep shows in London since 1986. Again, these are not places where sex is for sale, but they are described in legislation as sex encounter venues.</p>

<a name="90706-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09070618000087"></a>I therefore think that I have explained clearly why the Government believe that the existing name is appropriate for the purpose of regulating lap dancing clubs, and I hope that the noble Lords will not press their amendments.</p>

If you are told that you are going to a sex encounter place, it is pretty obvious that you expect to encounter sex and have some kind of relationship if you so want it. It is a most disagreeable title, and very misleading. I think the Minister said that if you go to a sex encounter place you could be sexually stimulated, but you can be sexually stimulated without ever having a sexual encounter. The term is most misleading and I hope that he will think about it again.</p>

The Lap Dancing Association is very concerned about the reputation of its dancers.

This will affect their future employment throughout their careers. I shall look again very carefully at the Minister&#146;s reply, but in the mean time I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The definition in subsection (2)(a) of new Section 2A has several rather surprising characteristics, and I would welcome further explanation of the wording. In particular, the &#147;or&#148; at the end of subsection (2)(a) suggests that a fully clothed dancer could be considered to be sexually stimulating. This seems ridiculous. I do not particularly wish to get into the question of what is sexually stimulating or not, but a significant degree of nudity should surely be part of it. The Bill later defines nudity in an extremely strict sense. Will the Minister say why it was decided to draft the provisions in this way? Would it not be more sensible to have a looser definition of nudity and to rule out any dancing where the performer is fully clothed? I beg to move.</p>

It was called &#147;La Clique&#148; and showed on Shaftesbury Avenue. It was, in effect, a series of circus acts. One scene involved a lady taking off all her clothes. It was mostly singing and circus acts, and it should fall nowhere near the definition of the Bill. Everyone who went to see it certainly went along to be entertained, but I would be incredibly doubtful as to whether anyone went along with the idea of being sexually stimulated. Nevertheless, there was stripping and nudity. I do not think that you could call it pole dancing; it was more like rope dancing because it involved trapeze acts and so on. It would be appalling if that sort of show, which was very well known and understood, fell anywhere near the sort of definition that is described here.</p>

<a name="90706-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09070618000094"></a>The Government always get into a bit of a problem here. The noble Lord, Lord West, did well to stay out of our debates in a previous Committee when we had to discuss sexual stimulation and pornography. I wish that I could stay out of it at the moment. The Government never do well when they get into the question of what is sexually stimulating. The noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, raised a very good point&#151;it is so subjective, it is not a good idea to legislate for it. As far as we can, we should keep the wording of the Bill as objective as possible.</p>

<p><a name="st_198"></a>
<a name="09070618000095"></a><b><a name="90706-0010.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09070618000246"></a>Lord Brett:</b> I think that the distinction is not the one made by the noble Viscount&#151;between a fully-clothed dancer and a naked dancer&#151;but I start by assuring the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, that a theatrical performance, such as a play, or a show which is not centrally designed to provide a kind of sex encounter experience as such, but has nudity, dancing and so forth within it, is not meant to be covered, nor is it covered, by the provisions we are discussing today. The purpose of this would be to demonstrate, for example, that the Shaftesbury Avenue show that the noble Baroness referred to was not designed and put on specifically for the purpose of sexual stimulation. The nudity, or whatever, was part of a more general theatrical endeavour which was not for the purpose of sexual stimulation and therefore would fall outwith these provisions.</p>

<a name="90706-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09070618000096"></a>The amendment would mean that, in order for entertainment to be considered &#147;relevant entertainment&#148;, it would have to be a live performance and a live display of nudity. The present wording of Clause 20 provides that it can be either a live performance or a live display of nudity. The amendment, as has been explained, seeks to ensure that it can be considered as such only if the entertainment is provided by an entertainer who is nude. That represents a significant narrowing of the current definition and would allow lap-dance operators to avoid the tight controls provided by Clause 26 simply by ensuring that performers were partially clothed in such a way that they would not come within the definition of nudity&#151;lap dancers in socks spring to mind. This is different from fully-clothed dancers, although fully-clothed dancers could, in themselves, be sexually stimulating. I take the point of the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, that in that sense, there is an element of the stimulation which has to be in the mind of the person observing the performance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09070618000097"></a>Of course, many lap dancers are clothed to some degree&#151;maybe not extensively, but it would be nonsense to suggest that nudity would be sexually stimulating and therefore disbarred and someone scantily clad performing the same kind of activity&#151;pole dancing or lap dancing&#151;would not. We therefore think that the amendment as proposed would create a significant loophole and prevent the reforms we are proposing from properly addressing the concerns of the local communities. The existing definition of &#147;relevant entertainment&#148; recognises that the prevailing factor which should dictate whether premises are sex encounter venues should be the nature of the entertainment provided and not solely whether the performers are nude. It is the performance, not the nudity, which determines whether it is a sex encounter venue. It would be strange to many people if we concluded that a lap-dancing club offering nude entertainment was a lap-dancing venue but the same club offering entertainment of the same nature, but with very scantily clad performers, was not.</p>

<a name="90706-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09070618000098"></a>We are confident that the existing definition of &#147;relevant entertainment&#148; is correct and will target those forms of entertainment that are of concern to local communities. I trust that I have been able to persuade the noble Baroness and the noble Viscount that the definition goes wider than just whether or not performers are nude and goes to the essential nature of the entertainment being provided, that being the key. I hope, therefore, that the noble Viscount will find it possible to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I do not want to return the Committee to an earlier part of the Bill but that is what makes Amendment 82A, tabled by the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, and referring as it does to conditions of employment for performers, particularly attractive.</p>

The purpose of including these words in the definition is to account for the fact that, first and foremost, the purpose of sex encounter venues is financial gain. Therefore it is necessary to ignore this aspect of the business when assessing whether the entertainment provided is solely or principally for the purpose of sexually stimulating any member of the audience. Whether it is financial gain to the performer or, more likely, financial gain to the performer and the club owner, there is a requirement to ignore that in order to make a fair assessment of whether the entertainment provided is solely or principally for the purpose of sexually stimulating any member of the audience.</p>

<a name="90706-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09070618000103"></a>The effect of this amendment would be that, irrespective of the nature of the entertainment provided, premises would not be considered a sex encounter venue as long as the operator could prove that the purpose of the entertainment was solely or principally for gain. Obviously, this would be easily demonstrated, because they are running sex clubs only for gain, and therefore, these provisions would be left ineffective by the inability to cover such venues&#151;hence the need to leave aside the question of gain. The effect of this amendment would be to provide a loophole for sex encounter venues to avoid the need for a sex encounter licence. I expect that this was a probing amendment&#151;at least, I hope that it was&#151;and I hope that I have shown why the inclusion of the provision to ignore financial gain is correct and the undoubted unintended consequences if this phrase was removed.

Amendment 86C probes the inclusion of verbal performance. We seem to be taking the concept of a lap-dancing club to the very extreme where there needs not to be any dancing at all. Indeed, the subsection as a whole would suggest that a person could be paid to stand, dressed from neck to ankle, absolutely still on a stage and, if she sings a racy song, that could count as a sex encounter. It would seem to strike at a lot of the tradition of music hall. Why have the Government decided to include verbal means in this definition? I beg to move.</p>

I thought that we were moving on to the Windmill Theatre, which I think was a forerunner of this kind of entertainment. It required the ladies only to stand still and I do not think that clothes were involved. The noble Viscount raises an interesting point, to which I hope that I am able to respond. The words are important because they make clear that the means used to sexually stimulate the audience can be by word or by other conduct, which could include physical touching or very provocative dancing. This clarification is also included in the existing definition of sex encounter establishments as found in the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09070628000002"></a>The Government are confident that the definition introduced in Clause 26 will target those forms of entertainment, such as lap dancing, that are the concern of many communities. The definition will exclude entertainment which is primarily artistic or educational by stating that the &#147;relevant entertainment&#148; must be,</p>

<p><a name="09070628000139"></a>Hence, the Shaftesbury Avenue show referred to would not be covered by these licences. Artistic performances, such as plays, will not be captured by these provisions even if they contain occasional nudity.

One might have some equipment with which to poke a person&#151;perhaps to wake them up&#151;who is not too stimulated by the lap dancing. I am not sure: I have never entertained myself in a lap-dancing establishment. Certainly, aural stimulation with the use of songs, jokes or whatever at the same time as a provocative performance could fall within this area and that would be covered.

My noble friend Lady Hanham touched on this point earlier and I would like to probe the Minister a little further on the reasons behind these provisions, and to raise some concerns about the enormous impact they will have on a significant number of clubs.</p>

<a name="90706-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09070628000009"></a>The group of amendments after this raises various aspects of the new regulations that will be particularly burdensome. There is a significant danger that clubs that have been operating under the existing licensing regime will struggle to survive the transition to the new regime. Is that the Government's intention? Bleeding a business dry through expensive and complicated regulation seems a very convoluted way of reducing the number of lap-dancing venues in the country. If that is not the Government's intention, why have they not inserted a grandfathering safeguard to soften the blow on existing businesses? My amendment would completely exempt existing businesses from the new provisions, but many alternatives could be considered; for example, a staggered timeframe or a presumption that they will at least get their first year's licence. I beg to move.</p>

The amendment would mean that where a venue has been granted a premises licence or a club certificate to authorise relevant entertainment to take place, provided that there are expressed conditions regulating the lap dancing or other similar entertainment being provided as part of the relevant entertainment, it would not be considered to be a sex encounter venue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09070628000011"></a>In effect, the majority of lap-dancing clubs&#151;both those with existing licences and those that may be granted licences under the Licensing Act in the future&#151;would continue to be regulated under the Licensing Act and would avoid the tighter controls provided by Clause 26. Such an amendment would render these reforms largely ineffectual and prevent local people having a greater say over the number and location of lap-dancing clubs in their area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09070628000012"></a>As I stated in response to Amendment 82A, the Government are taking action on the issue of lap-dancing clubs because the controls provided by the Licensing Act have, in the experience of many local authorities, proved insufficient and have not allowed them to address the concerns that such venues pose for many local communities. Therefore, it is the Government&#146;s intention that all venues offering relevant entertainment are regulated under Schedule 3 to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 to allow local communities to have a greater say about all such venues in their area.</p>

<a name="90706-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09070628000013"></a>Obviously, we are aware that existing lap-dancing clubs will need to be migrated to the new regime and will need time to apply for a new licence. The transitional arrangements dealing with these issues will be set out in secondary legislation. The Government will publish detailed proposals to that end, and will consult with the industry and other stakeholders on those proposals in due course. I have explained why the Government are not able to accept this amendment and, when we deal with subsequent amendments, I think that we can prove that the fear of bleeding businesses dry is unfounded.</p>

If the legislation comes in as it is and there is no long transitional period or carrying forward of the licences that are already granted under the licensing regime, businesses will be concerned that they will be put out of business. A local authority may suddenly decide that it will not continue to have the same number of lap-dancing premises. For example, there may be eight venues in a local authority which says that its number will be reduced to four. What will happen?</p>

<a name="90706-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09070628000017"></a>We have had lots of discussion about the retrospective nature of other legislation and its impact on businesses that are operating at the moment.

One could argue the case either way. I am interested to hear your Lordships&#146; views.</p>

<a name="90706-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09070628000021"></a>Venues which irregularly hold lap-dancing events could be said to be those most likely to present problems. They will have much less adequate security, they might have invested much less in health and safety and they might present more problems in their neighbourhood. Then again, I would not want to think that a village hall which is laying on a fundraising event and might only do so once a year&#151;or once&#151;is going to be caught in any way by this legislation. This amendment is to examine the pros and cons of having the exemption as drafted by the Government. Did they weigh up the issues such as those I have mentioned about village halls against the fact that, if we are talking about occasional use, they fall outside of the regulation? I beg to move.</p>

We agree with many of her concerns about the operation of this exemption. Although I would not want to extend this extremely burdensome regulation unnecessarily, it appears the Government are imposing the strictest conditions on some clubs while allowing others to continue to operate completely free from restrictions.</p>

<a name="90706-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09070628000023"></a>The exemption as drafted is extremely detailed: no more than 11 occasions; none lasting more than 24 hours; and never more than once a month. The detail is understandable since the Government will obviously want to rule out the travelling circus-type show that was discussed in another place, but the prescription also means that the sort of event that this exemption was intended to apply to risks not being exempted at all.</p>

I would welcome the Minister&#146;s correction if I am wrong on this point. That being so, how is a landlord to prevent a stripper coming into the club more than once a month? He risks serious penalties for something he is likely not to know about at all. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s answers to these points and those made by the noble Baroness.</p>

The purpose here is to recognise that not all premises that provide relevant entertainments should be classed as sexual encounter venues. He is absolutely right that we do not believe that such premises as, for instance, a pub which hosts a one-off birthday party at which a stripagram has been booked should be regulated in the same manner as lap-dancing clubs that offer entertainment on a nightly basis.</p>

<a name="90706-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09070628000026"></a>I am not sure I recognise the ability of someone to perform in that manner more than once a month without a landlord or the landlord&#146;s manager knowing about it. In that sense, the responsibility rests with the pub management or rugby club management&#151;or the village hall committee. Most villages I know would be up in arms at the thought of village halls being used for those purposes. Maybe I live in a gentler part of the country in the north.</p>

<a name="90706-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09070628000027"></a>Premises that hold such infrequent events will continue to be regulated under the Licensing Act 2003 and will not require a sex establishment licence. This provision is important to ensure the reforms are dedicated to lap-dancing clubs for gain and venues providing similar entertainment on a regular basis. We were made aware during the debate in the other place that there was a fear that we could have &#147;lap dancers on tour&#148;, who would move from venue to venue, keeping strictly within the 11 performances by moving around a large number of establishments, pubs and clubs in a short period. We doubt that is the case, but we would be worried if using temporary event notices to hold lap-dancing events in venues operated in such a manner. Therefore, we are making provision that that is not an unintended consequence. There is not sufficient evidence to suggest these concerns will materialise but we will have a limited order-making power to allow the Secretary of State to tighten the exemption or remove it altogether should it be clear that it has been exploited in that way. This has the right balance between stopping events, whether fundraising or other, of a nature that do not constitute regular performance of lap dancing and stopping events from those business organisations that do. I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

It seems to be a fair burden on businesses to have to renew their licences each year, and it is also quite an administrative burden on a local authority with a lot of clubs. We do not want this to become in any way an exercise in rubber-stamping just to get through the volume of business. Amendment 91 would exclude licences granted in respect of sex encounter venues from the provisions that such licences should be renewed on an annual basis. As I say, the amendment is probing in nature to discover whether a biannual renewal period would be more reasonable.

In some cases, a great deal of money is charged for these licences each time an application is made. There is also the possibility of an arbitrary refusal, and we have not yet come to the point of discussing what a refusal would be based on and why a local authority might not accept the renewal of a licence, which would take into account the number of clubs in a particular area. The possibility of an annual renewal period will be a great shock to many premises, and I know that the Lap Dancing Association is extremely concerned about this.

<a name="09070628000037"></a><b><a name="90706-0011.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="09070628000199"></a>Lord Brett:</b> As the noble Baroness indicated, the concerns of the lap-dancing industry have been made clear to the Government. It fears that the annual renewal process will be overly burdensome and, indeed, may in some instances be used by local authorities to remove licences without cause. The Government do not believe that this will be the case. The regime has been in force for over two decades for a number of venues such as sex shops and sex cinemas, and while it is true that the conversion costs may be less for those businesses, there do not seem to have been any problems. We see no reason to believe that local authorities will refuse to grant or renew a licence to a responsible operator that only a year previously had been issued a licence unless it has good reason for so doing.</p>

<a name="90706-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09070628000038"></a>It is therefore the Government&#146;s view that these amendments would significantly weaken the impact of the reforms being introduced in Clause 26, which will reclassify lap-dancing clubs as sex establishments, recognising that they offer entertainment which is fundamentally different from other entertainment venues such as nightclubs and pubs. Such venues often raise particular concerns for local communities. For this reason, we believe that the ongoing scrutiny created by the need for a lap-dancing club to renew its licence on at least an annual basis is justified. The renewal process will provide local people with the opportunity to make further objections, if such objections exist, thereby empowering people to ensure that local authorities can be responsive to their views. I hope that this explains clearly why the Government have proposed these provisions and do not feel able to accept the amendment, and I trust that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw it.</p>

I am trying to balance in my mind whether we are dealing with a moral issue here or one of practical concern. By and large, as I understand it, all these clubs are pretty well regulated. There may be those that are not, but if that is the case, we ought to know what objections are being made. All the entertainment takes place inside the building and the codes of conduct certainly make it clear that nothing should happen outside. I am told that everyone agrees that very few complaints are lodged because such venues cause trouble externally. I am concerned that we have spent an awfully long time talking about these establishments today and are now considering an overly burdensome regulation, and I wonder if we are doing this because it is a moral issue rather than on the basis of resolving a practical difficulty.</p>

<a name="90706-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09070628000040"></a>I know people will say that they do not want a lap-dancing venue in their area, and that is fine, but for those that are already there, presumably someone is going to have to demonstrate that they have caused trouble. Will the Minister confirm that?</p>

<a name="90706-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09070628000042"></a>The licence may not be renewed for a range of reasons set out in paragraph 12(3) of Schedule 3 to the 1982 Act and include, for example, that the applicant is considered unsuitable. I understand the concern of the Lap Dancing Association in relation to the members it represents, but there are upwards of 300 establishments and considerable concern has been expressed about the inability of local residents to have the local authority take notice of their objections. That is not say that the views of residents will override those of the local authority because it has wider responsibilities which, as the noble Baroness knows better than I, it takes very seriously. So I would not have thought that the proposal we are putting forward for an annual inspection need be too onerous, too expensive, or likely to bleed any business dry.</p>

<a name="09070628000043"></a><b><a name="90706-0011.htm_spnew20"></a><a name="09070628000202"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> The trouble is that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, is absolutely right that this onerous renewal&#151;the Minister did not disabuse me of the idea that it is onerous&#151;is more about a moral crusade than a practical approach to the problem. The first time the club applies for a licence, the issue of the locality, which we shall discuss shortly, and whether it was near a school, and so on, would be very important. As those issues would have been dealt with already, annual renewal sounds too often. The Minister is ignoring some of the evidence given to the DCMS Committee of the other place by Chief Inspector Studd of ACPO who was talking about the low risk of these venues from a public order perspective. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a><a name="09070628000150"></a>&#147;There is no evidence that they&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09070628000140"></a>lap-dancing clubs&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09070628000158"></a>&#147;cause any crime and disorder. Very rarely. They tend to be fairly well run. They tend to have a fairly high staff ratio to customers. The people who tend to go there tend to be a bit older so they do not drink excessively and cause the crime and disorder problems outside&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90706-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09070628000044"></a>Of all the things that local authorities have to license, on that evidence given by a representative of ACPO, these sound to be pretty mild. It is quite surprising that the Government want to put that level of burden on local authorities and on the clubs themselves. I suspect that we shall come back to this on Report, but in the mean time I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It is very important to define locality, but the Bill leaves it very loose. Does it mean that views should be taken from the neighbouring authority if the neighbours are affected? What if the club intends to open in one place and just down the road but over the border, there is a school? I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09070628000046"></a><b><a name="90706-0012.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09070628000205"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> My Amendment 94 is grouped with this. I want to probe the transition from the current regime to one in which these provisions will apply. I am concerned about the idea of quotas in the lap-dancing industry. The quota could be set below the existing number of venues in an area. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, raised the point about what is an area when it straddles a boundary? Do local authorities have to come to an agreement on that? Given that some dissatisfaction with the licence has to be found on grounds other than the number of them, it is extremely likely that some local authorities will actively seek to chop away at the number of venues using the quota as a guillotine. It is important to know how these quotas will work particularly, as I have already touched on, in relation to establishments that are already there and may be in excess of a quota advised by a local authority, or two local authorities, in the context of this debate. Perhaps we can dig a little further on what the quota system and its implications are likely to be.</p>

<p><a name="st_240"></a>
<a name="09070628000047"></a><b><a name="90706-0012.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09070628000206"></a>Lord Brett:</b> Under the proposed new regime, local authorities can refuse to grant a licence to a lap-dancing club on the ground that it would be inappropriate, having regard to the character of the relevant locality, or on the basis that a number of such venues in the locality is equal or exceeds the number that the local authority considers appropriate. Amendment 93 would define locality as within the local authority area where the premises are situated. That could prevent a local authority considering the locality that surrounds the premises but which happens to fall in another local authority area when deciding whether it is appropriate to have a sex encounter venue located in a particular site. The amendment could also prevent local authorities drawing distinctions within their own areas when judging whether it is appropriate to have a sex establishment in the location.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09070628000048"></a>If premises happened to be situated on the boundaries of two local authority areas, we consider it appropriate that the local authority handling the application can consider the whole locality, even if it straddles two local authority areas. It would seem odd, for example, if a locality adjacent to such premises were in a residential area or contained a school, but because it fell under the jurisdiction of another local authority, the one handling the application could not take some matters into account when deciding whether to grant a licence. It is a common-sense approach.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09070628000049"></a>Given the diversity of many local authority areas, ranging from busy high streets to residential areas, the Government believe that local authorities should set the different limits on the number of sex establishments appropriate to the different localities. For example, a local authority may decide that a particular locality in  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_518"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 518</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a city centre is an appropriate location for a limited number of lap-dancing clubs, while a suburban, residential area is not suitable for any sex establishments at all. The amendment would remove that flexibility.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09070628000050"></a>Amendment 94, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, would omit paragraph 12(4), which states that the local authority can set the number of sex establishments that it considers appropriate for a particular locality at nil. The Government believe that paragraph 12(4) is useful as it makes clear to all parties that local authorities are fully within their rights to determine that certain areas are entirely inappropriate for the location of sex establishments. In other words, being able to set the limit at nil allows local authorities to prevent sex establishments opening up in areas that are deemed wholly unsuitable, having regard to the nature and character of the locality.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09070628000051"></a>For example, a local authority may decide that it is inappropriate to have any sex establishment in an area that is overwhelmingly residential, or where schools or religious buildings are located. To ensure that local authorities can respond to the concerns of local communities, the Government believe that they must retain their flexibility to manage sex establishments that the amendments would remove. I hope that I have been able to persuade the noble Baroness that the amendment would have odd, perhaps unintended consequences and would decrease valuable flexibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09070628000052"></a>On the question of the number of establishments that will be in a local authority area, it will be a matter for the local authority.</p>

The reality is that lap-dancing clubs already exist. They are licensed to some extent, and the local authority knows they are there. It goes back to the question on which we touched before that if the local authority suddenly decides that it will agree to eight or three establishments, and one is an area where they will now be prohibited, what will happen to that business? Will it have to cease operating or can we ensure within the legislation that there is a proper way of it carrying on until a certain number is reached? That cannot happen if the local authority says that there are to be no lap-dancing clubs in its area at all.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09070628000054"></a>We have to accept that these businesses exist; we cannot pretend that they do not. I suppose that we can say it in legislation, but should we say it: that some premises will have to be put out of business because of the number at issue? Whether I agree with the type of business or not is irrelevant. It is extremely important to be fair and just. Is it fair to leave it open to doubt whether a business has to go out of business because it is deemed to be over and above the local authority numbers?</p>

On the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, about how local authorities are going to prioritise, the last thing we want to do with this legislation is to allow unsatisfactory licensed clubs to up their game a bit, become more satisfactory and get the quota, while better places do not. I can see the Minister is becoming frustrated by this argument. I shall simply ask him when he expects the results of the consultation: is there any chance that by the time we get to Report, probably sometime in October, we might have the results?</p>

If there is any information I shall seek to make it available before that stage. My frustration is not with the noble Baroness and the comments she makes but with what seems to be missing from the discussion. This is predicated on giving local people and local authorities more control over what is desirable in their areas. The consequences of avoiding a licensing provision&#151;we do not have one&#151;will be that the number of lap-dancing clubs, good or otherwise, will become a local authority issue and the transitional arrangements will have to address the migration from the old regime to the new one. I cannot add any more than that.</p>

It is a trial run at the Constitutional Reform Bill of my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke, which is to be found in the Printed Paper Office. That Bill is not having its Second Reading now because there is no time for it to complete all its stages in this Session of Parliament.

Of course they are right. That may be why only 60 per cent of electors now bother to vote in general elections. Under our first past the post system, the Government of the day are elected by about 40 per cent of those who do vote, or 24 per cent of the electorate. That 24 per cent has to vote for the Government&#146;s manifesto, containing about 150 commitments, many of which the voter may not agree with, en bloc.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09070628000067"></a>Anyone who doubts the extent of our national decline should perhaps read the brief document entitled <I>Better Government</I>, published in January 2007 by the TaxPayers&#146; Alliance. Apart from the statistics I have already quoted on education, the study shows the UK as providing the worst healthcare among the top 18 developed nations and as having the third highest crime rate. It also contains a penetrating analysis of how Sir Humphrey has now completely taken over from Jim Hacker and how our Ministers have become incapable of delivering the services the people need at anything like a reasonable cost. I shall put a copy in the Library and recommend it as essential reading.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09070628000068"></a>That is some of the background to my noble friend&#146;s Bill. As to its detail, its most radical proposal is that binding national and local referenda should be introduced in this country, based largely on the model which has been working successfully in Switzerland for many years. To me, this is the only way in which the people can be reconnected with their democracy because it would get round behind the Westminster hen coop and force their will on those who are supposed to represent them.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09070628000069"></a>I am of course aware that there will be a certain amount of harrumphing about Members of Parliament taking decisions on behalf of the ignorant people, but I suggest that the harrumphers are centuries out of date. Of course that theory was valid in the 18th and 19th centuries when most people could not read, but now they can, and modern technology brings them instantly up to date with events unfolding all over the planet. I submit, for instance, that if the system of referenda envisaged by the Bill had been in force at the time, we would not have gone to war with Iraq, nor would the present Government be allowed to drag on in office, and so on.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09070628000070"></a>There is also evidence that the proposed system is very much wanted by the people. There is an excellent new organisation called the Campaign for Democracy, to be found at campaignfordemocracy.org.uk, which is finding 50 per cent support on the doorstep in the marginal constituencies for the introduction of binding national referenda. I understand that that is a very high figure.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09070628000071"></a>Perhaps the Bill&#146;s next most radical proposal is that the House of Commons should be reduced in size to some 250 Members and left in charge only of national matters. Those matters are defined in the Bill as the national treasury; defence; foreign affairs; border control; criminal law; agriculture, fisheries and food; national energy and transport policy; the national education curriculum and teaching qualifications; and our medical and nursing qualifications.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09070628000072"></a>MPs would be limited to a salary of &#163;30,000 per annum, with &#163;170,000 for their offices and a transparent system for all their expenses. So most MPs would have to do a proper job as well and live in the real world, as do Swiss MPs. The Commons would not need to sit for more than 100 days in a year unless in emergency.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09070628000073"></a>All other areas of our national life would pass under the control of local government with local tax-raising powers. Both the Commons and local government would sit for staggered, fixed periods of five years. The Bill leaves the method of election open. No doubt that can be decided when we come to Committee, but personally I have always been in favour of some form of proportional representation, perhaps different ones for national local elections.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09070628000074"></a>The Bill would require a Royal Commission containing a majority of MPs within two years on the usefulness of our 1,000-odd quangos and other public bodies, including the regional and national Assemblies and Parliaments. I am aware that the Conservative leadership has today promised a &#147;bonfire of the quangos&#148;, but I recall Mr Major setting Tarzan&#151;in the shape of Mr Michael Heseltine, as he then was&#151;the task of cutting through the jungle of red tape. That jungle has grown apace, of course, until it now ensnares nearly every aspect of our lives. I fear that today&#146;s Tory plans will prove just as ineffective.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09070628000075"></a>The Bill would also require the consolidation of all existing legislation dealing with the same area of law, a long-overdue reform. If we could have thought of a way of preventing any new law being introduced without the repeal of, say, half a dozen others, we would have included it in the Bill, but we could not.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09070628000076"></a>Our political class does not seem to realise that the people are entirely fed up with the endless interfering, restrictive stream of legislation from Brussels and Westminster. The Bill would do much to end it and even reverse it. It would introduce five-year sunset clauses for all new legislation and a 10-year sunset clause for the Bill itself.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09070628000077"></a>Finally, the Bill considers the reform, even the abolition, of your Lordships&#146; House. The above system will take some time to bed down, so the Bill envisages a national referendum on the future of your Lordships&#146; House within seven years of the Bill&#146;s passing. The Commons would have to consult with local authorities and this House and put four options to the people, including abolition and no change to the existing arrangements.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09070628000078"></a>We submit that it is logical to leave reform of your Lordships&#146; House to the end, even if it is the softest target for our present political leadership. First, we must retrieve our democracy from Brussels, then we must sort out the House of Commons, local government and our myriad quangos. Only when we have done

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09070628000079"></a>I am aware that my remarks may not meet with universal approval in your Lordships&#146; House, but nevertheless I trust that they provide food for debate here and in the country at large.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09070628000081"></a>I also congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, on bringing the Bill before the House and on having the opportunity to discuss it. His Constitutional Reform Bill is an interesting document. I agree with many of its provisions, particularly the repeal of the European Communities Act 1972. The House will recall that Second Reading was given to a repeal Bill some years ago, but unfortunately it was not proceeded with and brought to a conclusion.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09070628000082"></a>I also believe in more use of referendums, nationally and locally, to give people more say in lawmaking and real participation in Government. I am enthusiastic about proposals to give more power to local authorities to do things not specifically reserved to Parliament. As a former leader of a county borough council, I know that independent, powerful, well financed local government is the real road to the people&#146;s democracy. That is where decisions are made and where people know what they want. They should be given more decision-making.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09070628000083"></a>I agree that there should be fewer parliamentary seats, although I do not go all the way with the noble Lords, Lord Willoughby de Broke and Lord Pearson, in wishing to reduce the number to 250. That is perhaps taking things a bit too far, and I would have thought under the present circumstances that 450 would be a more appropriate number.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09070628000084"></a>The reason I agree to some reduction of the numbers in the Commons is that they have lost so much of their power to Scotland, to Wales and, shortly, to Northern Ireland. Most of all, about 70 per cent of legislation now comes from Brussels. It is being made in a most undemocratic way, so we really do not need the present number of MPs in the Commons&#151;649, I think it is. The job could be done very well with fewer, and I think the number of seats should be 450.</p>

<a name="90706-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09070628000085"></a>Then there is the consideration of Lords reform in the Bill after eight years. The best reform that could be made is probably just to leave things exactly as they are. As the House is constituted at present, it gives the House of Commons absolute sovereignty. This House is effectively an advisory body because, by the use of the Parliament Act, the Commons have sovereignty. Frankly, if they want to retain that sovereignty, they should leave things well alone. Any constitutional reform should take place only after long and mature consideration, wide consultation, intelligent debate and, above all, a people&#146;s referendum. The people&#146;s referendum in altering constitutional matters is very important. Parliament should not be allowed to hand over its sovereignty and lawmaking powers to anyone outside Westminster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09070628000086"></a>What worries me is that we have already had a bellyful of constitutional reform over the past 12 years. In practically every Session, we have had constitutional reform. Most of the hereditaries have been banished from the House of Lords. The Lord Chancellor&#146;s powers have been very much reduced. He has been removed from the House of Lords and sent along to the House of Commons, of all places. The Law Lords have been banished to a place across the way. It is ridiculous now to talk about the High Court of Parliament. We are no longer the High Court of Parliament; the Supreme Court sits outside this place and that is, in my view, an absolute disgrace. There has been a decline of Cabinet government and the House of Commons has been sidelined and muted.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para1"></a>

I shall focus on the Government&#146;s proposals for constitutional change. They may be somewhat less radical than those proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, but they may, arguably, stand a greater chance of getting enacted.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09070628000089"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said, we have seen several major constitutional changes since 1997. As I have argued before, they have not derived from a clear view of the type of constitution that the Government wish to achieve. Rather, they have been brought forward as freestanding measures, with little obvious thought given to the relationship between them. However, taking them as freestanding measures, it should at least be the subject of thorough planning within government.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09070628000090"></a>In its fourth report of the 2001-02 Session, the Constitution Committee of your Lordships' House published a report entitled <I>Changing the Constitution: the Process of Constitutional Change.</I> In evidence to the committee, the then Lord Chancellor, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, explained in detail how Bills of constitutional significance were subject to a rigorous process of discussion within government, especially through the medium of a Cabinet committee. He produced a clear diagram detailing the process. He told the committee the number of times the relevant Cabinet committees had met. A great deal of preparation clearly took place before the legislation on devolution, for example, was brought before Parliament.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09070628000091"></a>How, then, does this relate to proposals now being pursued for constitutional change? Last year the Government published a draft constitutional renewal Bill. The draft Bill was subject to pre-legislative scrutiny. A Joint Committee was appointed&#151;I served on it&#151;and it undertook a fairly exhaustive examination of the measure, publishing its report in July of last year. There are various criticisms that can be levelled at the Bill and the process to which it is subject. The Bill is not a constitutional renewal Bill&#151;it is, in essence, a constitutional renewal (miscellaneous provisions) Bill. The Joint Committee was not given the time recommended for pre-legislative scrutiny. The Government have yet to respond to the Joint Committee&#146;s report. None the  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_525"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 525</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>less, the draft Bill appeared to be the product of some considered reflection within government. The Justice Secretary, Jack Straw, touched on some of the deliberations in his evidence to the Joint Committee. As a result of pre-legislative scrutiny, there is a substantial report on which the Government can draw before bringing the Bill before Parliament. The Government have been giving thought to introducing one or more additional parts to the Bill. Those additions appear to draw upon material that has been embodied in Bills previously brought before the House and discussed.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09070628000092"></a>In short, the Government appear to be in a position to introduce their constitutional renewal Bill. They have said that they plan to do so before the Summer Recess. They have been saying that for some time. The Summer Recess gets ever nearer. However, they have introduced the Parliamentary Standards Bill. This has not been published in draft. It has not been subject to the structured process of deliberation within government that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, explained was the expected process for dealing with such Bills. Rather, it has been rushed within government&#151;reflected in the poor drafting&#151;and rushed through the other place in three days.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09070628000093"></a>When a Bill of constitutional significance is brought forward without having been through the process that the Government have stipulated, there should be an expectation of thorough parliamentary scrutiny. If that is to be departed from and the Bill given an expedited passage, not only must a case be made for that but the case has to be compelling.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09070628000094"></a>We seem to be in a perverse situation. A Bill of constitutional significance which has been subject to consideration within government and subject to pre-legislative scrutiny, containing provisions, as on the Civil Service, that all parties would like to see on the statute book, has not yet been brought forward. Yet a Bill which has been produced in haste and which was friendless among Back-Benchers when debated in the other place, is being rushed through, a Bill that would seem premature given that the report of the Kelly committee is expected in the autumn.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09070628000095"></a>We shall return to the arguments on the Parliamentary Standards Bill on Wednesday. My main concern this evening is the opportunity cost&#151;that is, the introduction of the constitutional renewal Bill. I have three questions for the Minister. First, does the process adumbrated by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, remain the one to which constitutional Bills should be subject? Secondly, when may we expect the Government&#146;s constitutional renewal Bill to be introduced? Lastly, what was the process that determined the relative priorities of the two Bills? Answers to these questions will, I believe, be helpful in clarifying the Government&#146;s approach to legislation effecting constitutional change. As it stands, that approach is far from clear.</p>

<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_526"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 526</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>human rights legislation, withdrawal from the EU and new policies on referenda. It is nothing if not imaginative. It would be quite difficult to do justice to those six subjects in six minutes, so I shall concentrate on just two issues that are raised by the Bill on which, to put it gently, I urge caution. They are both issues about which there has been a fair amount of debate in other contexts. I refer to the proposals for fixed-term Parliaments of five years and for reducing the number of MPs to 250, as the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, mentioned. I am putting it gently when I advise the House to be cautious in its approach to those two proposals.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09070628000097"></a>I can see attractions in the fixed-term Parliament&#151;one is the predictability of political life. We would know that there would be a general election in 2010 and every five years thereafter. We would know that there would be one in 2110, 2210, 2310, and so on; despite floods, famine, war, global warming, the elections would be held at fixed intervals. That is the attraction, to make life predictable; it has some problems.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09070628000098"></a>The other attraction, which is harder for me to acknowledge, is that it is said to remove power from the Prime Minister. It is argued that it is very unfair that a Prime Minister can determine when the election will take place, despite the fact that over the years, Prime Ministers of all parties have frequently got that date wrong. It is not quite the golden advantage that it is sometimes characterised as being.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09070628000099"></a>I object to fixed-term Parliaments because I think they would make Parliament&#151;the House of Commons itself&#151;weaker. It certainly makes it a less dramatic place. I offer in evidence the most dramatic debate since the war. It took place 30 years ago this year and resulted in the loss by one vote of a vote of confidence of the then Labour Government and a general election. I put it to this House that if it had been known that whatever the outcome of that vote, there could not possibly be a general election, it would have diminished the drama and significance of the occasion. I think that is bad for Parliament; it weakens Parliament, because the knowledge that Parliament can cause a general election is one of its great strengths and why it is taken so seriously. My other objection to fixed-term Parliaments is that I dread the thought of the American-style electoral cycle, where you know a year in advance precisely when a general election will take place. There is a year&#146;s electioneering involving&#151;it goes without saying&#151;colossal sums of money. It does not appeal to me one iota.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09070628000100"></a>I come now to the question of fewer MPs. I think even the proposer of the Bill would think that it goes too far in saying that the number of MPs should be reduced to 250. What worries me about this is not so much the reduction in MPs, but the increase in the size of constituencies. It would mean something like 250,000 constituents per MP. All I can say to that, to anyone who has been an MP&#151;or who has not, but knows the political system well enough&#151;is, &#147;Just try representing that group of people&#148;. I had the good fortune to be an MP twice, both times with very large constituencies of around 90,000 people. The idea that they should have been trebled fills me with deep concern, to put it mildly. Although it is superficially attractive, since MPs&#151;as we know&#151;are no more popular than journalists  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_527"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 527</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or estate agents, simply reducing the number certainly does not reduce the cost. If you had a constituency of 250,000 people, you would need a lot more help and assistance, such as secretarial support, to get anywhere near representing them. It would also alter the whole character of the relationship, which is a deeply precious one. That is one reason why I am not keen on proportional representation.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09070628000101"></a>The relationship between an MP in the United Kingdom and their constituents is, in most cases, a very close one. The constituencies are small enough to enable that to happen. It may be popular globally to say, &#147;Let&#146;s reduce the number of MPs&#148;, but not in individual areas. If you told some counties of Britain that they would have only one MP after this reform, I am not sure that there would be quite such support for the proposal. It goes without saying that constituencies would be colossal geographical areas, which is another big disadvantage.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09070628000102"></a>Those are the two parts of this legislation that I would suggest treating with extreme caution. As I have said, the Bill is imaginative and well worth debating. However, one part&#151;fixed-term Parliaments&#151;would, in my view, weaken Parliament. The other&#151; reducing the number of MPs&#151;would reduce the strength of the relationship that exists at the moment between Members of Parliament and their constituencies.</p>

In the time allowed I will touch briefly on only three points. Since both the noble Lords, Lord Grocott and Lord Stoddart, have been rather exercised about the number of MPs, perhaps I could make one or two points on that. Yes, of course, constituencies would be larger; I do not necessarily accept that that is a bad thing. My Bill will, as the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, wished, give far more power to local authorities. At the moment, I think it is fair to say that some MPs do a lot of work that might normally be done by local&#151;whether district or county&#151;councillors. They take on quite a lot of local work, which could better be done by their much more local representatives. As for making Parliament weaker, my feeling&#151;which I hope is not unfair&#151;is that Parliament is weak enough as it is. The other provisions in the Bill will strengthen it. Of course, this is a sighting shot. These proposals could be discussed later in Committee and amended if that was the wish of the House.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09070628000104"></a>On fixed-term Parliaments, I take the point about the dramatic impact of a vote of no confidence, but it does not happen very often. Certainly, it is outweighed by the advantages that the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, was kind enough to enumerate; namely, certainty and the inability of a Prime Minister to call elections, even if they get the timing wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09070628000105"></a>Turning to the Bill itself, the principle of Clause 1 &#151;withdrawal from the European Union&#151;is a sine qua non because otherwise all or most of the provisions would be unachievable, so that is where we start from. Whether we agree with the exact numbers or not, it seems to be common ground that we have too many legislators, who are certainly passing too many Bills.  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_528"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 528</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Why do we need 640 Members of Parliament and 750 Members of your Lordships&#146; House? There is too much legislation and yet not enough time to debate it. In the last 10 years we have passed nearly 500 Acts of Parliament: six on immigration, eight on terrorism, a dozen on education and 25 on criminal justice. In the same period Parliament has passed nearly 40,000 statutory instruments. That does not even include the thousands of statutory instruments which have direct application, coming straight from Brussels into UK law, not even seen or voted on by Parliament. We do not have the right to do that. This endless avalanche of legislation really has overwhelmed Parliament. It has made proper scrutiny and debate virtually meaningless. A telling statistic is that a statutory instrument was last overturned 30 years ago, in 1979. It really is time that Parliament passed fewer laws.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09070628000106"></a>It is not just the expenses scandal which has so outraged people and, I am afraid, brought Parliament and its denizens into contempt; it is the sense of powerlessness that is important here. Surely it is time for a transfer of power away from the centre to people. I remind noble Lords that 1 million people marched in London against the Iraq war, and half a million people marched against the proposal to criminalise hunting. Were those voices listened to? No, they were not, so people naturally feel powerless. People care about politics but if they feel that they do not have a voice, they will not vote and that is what has happened. In the local elections, European elections and general elections there has been a successive and increasing loss of interest. That must be unhealthy.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09070628000107"></a>The solution, as my Bill makes clear, to a working democracy in practice, is referendums, such as are held in Switzerland&#151;arguably the most democratic country in the world&#151;where referendums work very well at both national and local level. Their great advantage is that they give people a say in what is happening. They give people a real feeling that they have had a proper input into the laws that affect their lives. My Bill makes provision for referendums to be held at national and local level, as in Switzerland, initiated either by the Government or the required qualifying number of voters, who sign a petition for a referendum to be held.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09070628000108"></a>Many of us in this House will have heard the patronising arguments against referendums, advanced by some of your Europhile Lordships during our debates on the Lisbon treaty; that is, people are too ignorant or too irresponsible to be granted the power that is given by a referendum. I do not accept that for a single moment; that is an argument against democracy itself. We should really have none of it. Sir Francis Bacon said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a><a name="09070628000154"></a>&#147;A country is less free if it is all in the hands of the state&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070628000109"></a>That is surely right. Power to the people: that is what my Bill is about.</p>

I feel that I should allow other speakers to  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_529"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 529</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>deal, as they already have, with that. However, it is important to deal with one illusion&#151;or, perhaps, delusion&#151;that has been referred to by speakers, and that is the idea that such a huge percentage of legislation that affects our fellow citizens originates in the EU. It simply is not true. The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, referred to the figure of 84 per cent. That relates to the German situation at federal level. It does not refer to all the regional laws that are developed in that country. It is rather ironic to have a UKIP Peer using propaganda from Berlin as if it were somehow sacrosanct to explain the situation in Britain. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, referred to a figure of more than 70 per cent. That is not true either. I think that refers to a speech made by Mr Hans Pttering, in which he referred to the fact that 75 per cent of the legislation within the EU system went through the EU Parliament. He did not refer to an individual country at all.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09070628000111"></a>Reference has been made to the extent to which regulation in this country originates in the EU. In a very interesting document published in May this year, entitled <I>The EU and British Regulatory Systems</I>, the British Chamber of Commerce pointed out:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a><a name="09070628000155"></a>&#147;In terms of the number of regulations, the EU this year accounted for only 20%. The reduction from the previous EU level of about 30% is the primary reason for the overall decline in 2007/8&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070628000142"></a>Therefore, I am afraid that some of the rationale for the Bill that has been put forward to the House, and in speeches this evening, does not stand up to scrutiny. In any case it surely is not the number of legislative proposals that is important, but their significance. There is an important issue&#151;this has been referred to briefly this evening&#151;regarding the extent to which British Governments of both colours have tended to gold-plate in Whitehall and Westminster what has come from the EU.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09070628000112"></a>In the other place I held responsibility for shadowing the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, as it then was, in the 1992 Parliament. I can tell your Lordships that a vast amount of addition was extended to the regulations that came through MAFF during that period. Yes, they originated in Brussels but by the time they reached the poor benighted farming community, or those seeking to sell or process home-grown food, they were quite unrecognisable from what had originated from the EU. If one compares&#151;as I did during that period&#151;the way in which abattoirs were treated in Germany, France, Scandinavia or this country, it was totally different, not because of anything that came out of Brussels or Strasbourg but because of Whitehall imposing much more stringent restrictions on small throughput slaughterhouses in this country. Other countries, notably the Scandinavian countries but also Germany, are meticulous in implementing EU directives, but take the opportunity to vary them and to use derogation. There is substantial variation all through the EU. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, that we are woefully overcentralised in Whitehall and Westminster. However, you cannot blame the EU for what we do in Whitehall and Westminster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09070628000113"></a>Proposals are already before your Lordships&#146; House that fall within the title of this debate. Two of my noble friends have Bills already in Committee before

We look forward with avid interest to see what the Government will produce on that score. The Prime Minister&#146;s statement just a week or so ago implied that legislation would come before your Lordships' House. We look forward to that with interest. Then there is my own Constitutional Renewal Bill, which is still mark one because, as the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, said, the Government have not come forward with their proposals. On Wednesday we shall have the Second Reading of the Parliamentary Standards Bill. I entirely endorse the concerns expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, in that regard.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09070628000114"></a>The serious issue here is that we are packing into a few days before the Summer Recess extraordinarily important proposals for the British constitution. I cannot think that it is appropriate to do so, or of any time over the six or so years of my interest in politics when so much has been crammed into the last few days before the Summer Recess. I understand&#151;I do not know whether this is a well-founded rumour&#151;that the Government are considering re-establishing September sittings to deal with this problem. I do not know whether the Minister can confirm that. When I worked with Mr Robin Cook when he was Leader of the other place and I was his shadow, I recall that we produced what we thought was a very sensible bargain; namely, that Members with families should have half-term recesses in the spring and autumn in return for the two Houses of Parliament coming back in September. I think that would be a very sensible way to deal with this matter. It would be a parliamentary scandal if we are kept up all night on Monday 20 July for ridiculous ping-pong, ill-considered amendments and a revision of amendments to deal with this Bill. It would do nothing to reconnect people with their Parliament or give them more confidence and assurance that Parliament is dealing appropriately with the great issues of today. I hope that we will be reassured that that will not happen.</p>

I remind him, as I think the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, has done, that the subject of this Question for Short Debate is,</p>

No doubt when the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby, comes before the House, the usual channels&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, will know how the usual channels operate&#151;will find a means by which we can debate it at appropriate length and do justice to it. At this stage, I do not know how we will do that. I have been through the Bill and seen the fairly major things it tries to achieve. It is drafted in fairly simple terms. Clause 1 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a><a name="09070628000156"></a>&#147;The European Communities Act 1972 ... is repealed&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070628000117"></a>Fair enough. We then move to Clause 2, which repeals the Human Rights Act. I do not wish to put questions to the Government, but I have to ask the noble Lord who introduced this Bill: do we, when we repeal the Human Rights Act, pass over the judgments on these matters from British courts to the European Court of Human Rights?</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09070628000118"></a>The Bill moves on to &#147;International treaties&#148;, &#147;Military action&#148;, the &#147;Number of Parliamentary constituencies&#148; and so on. It deals with local government and referendums&#151;or referenda, as many prefer to describe them. Interestingly, while I appreciate that such people are good Latinists, the drafters of the Bill have used the word &#147;referendums&#148;.</p>

<a name="90706-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09070628000119"></a>Having made it clear that I do not think that it is appropriate that we should debate that Bill at this stage&#151;no doubt, we can debate it later&#151;I conclude with just one question. It is not one that the Government can answer, but the promoters of the Bill&#151;and it is an interesting question. The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, when introducing the Bill, mentioned that there would be a sunset clause in it and that it would expire after 10 years, beginning on the day it was passed. We on this side have always been very much in favour of sunset clauses; there is a lot to be said for them.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09070628000120"></a>As this Bill progresses through the House after Second Reading, I am sure that the usual channels will give it its appropriate &#147;godspeed&#148;, it will progress through this House and, in however many days in the next Session, progress through another place. It will then become an Act. We will then discover that Clause 1 has come into effect and the European Communities Act 1972 has been repealed. I should like to ask the promoters of this Bill: what happens 10 years later when the sunset clause comes into effect? Do we then have to go back to Europe and say, &#147;We are terribly sorry, but we have got it all wrong&#151;we are back in&#148;, or does Europe have a say in what happens?</p>

He asks whether the Government will take forward the legislative proposals for constitutional reform presently before the House of Lords. In this House, we are spoilt. We have both the Constitutional Reform Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, which we are discussing tonight, and the Constitutional Renewal Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09070628000124"></a>Last week in the other place, as the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, reminded us, Members debated the Government&#146;s Parliamentary Standards Bill. It very much deals with democratic renewal, which goes hand in hand with constitutional reform. As we were reminded, that Bill is before this House and we will have the opportunity to debate it in detail over the next few weeks.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09070628000125"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, asked me some questions. I do not have the answer to his question on the statement to the committee made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, some years ago. All I would say is that I worked closely with the noble and learned Lord and was a junior Minister under him for a while. In my opinion, the noble and learned Lord hardly ever did anything wrong. I have to leave the matter on that note. The noble Lord will not be surprised to hear me say that the Government still intend to introduce before the Summer Recess a Bill based on the draft constitutional renewal Bill; so he may not have to wait much longer. I accept that he has been very patient.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09070628000126"></a>As for the priorities regarding the two Bills, I should say that it seemed to be agreed between the parties in another place&#151;whatever else was not agreed&#151;that it was important to introduce legislation quickly to begin to rebuild trust in politics and politicians. It seemed to be agreed that one of the priorities was to create an independent parliamentary standards authority and a commissioner for parliamentary investigations. We will have time later this week to debate these matters further. I cannot resist admiring the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, for saying that the Bill was being rushed, because I have been reminded that it was his own party leader, Mr Clegg, who wanted to rewrite the whole British constitution in 100 days. That seems a quick way of doing things&#151;in a recess, too.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09070628000127"></a>The answer to the question asked in the debate is that the Government intend to take forward legislative proposals for constitutional reform presently before the House&#151;but not those set out in the Constitutional Reform Bill. The best that can be said for it is that it is indeed an ambitious Bill.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09070628000128"></a>We take seriously the issue of constitutional reform. We have undertaken a considerable programme of work in this regard under the Prime Minister. For example, we have published the draft legislative programme; created the Youth Citizenship Commission; sponsored the review of citizenship of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith; undertaken a consultation on flag-flying; undertaken a consultation on weekend voting; undertaken a review of electoral systems; issued a White Paper on House of Lords reform; made changes to the arrangements for appointing bishops  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_533"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 533</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and granting honours, removing the Prime Minister from the process; and changed the rules on the pre-release of statistics.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09070628000129"></a>These are only the latest in a long line of reforms stretching back to 1997, which include such significant reforms as devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; modernising your Lordships&#146; House; introducing the Freedom of Information and Human Rights Acts; reforming the role of the Lord Chancellor; and creating the UK Supreme Court. The Prime Minister has further demonstrated his commitment to constitutional reform with the creation of the Democratic Renewal Council, which meets weekly to consider constitutional matters; and by his swift action to bring forward legislation in response to public concerns over MPs&#146; expenses.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09070628000130"></a>We see two areas where proposals in the Bills of the noble Lords, Lord Willoughby de Broke and Lord Tyler, have common ground with the Government&#146;s proposals. First, the Government&#146;s draft Constitutional Renewal Bill contains proposals for the ratification of treaties that would give a statutory basis for the parliamentary scrutiny of treaties prior to their ratification by the state. Secondly, the Government propose to introduce a draft resolution for debate in the other place that will set out in detail the processes that Parliament should follow in order to approve any commitment of Armed Forces to armed conflict. However, the noble Lord will not be surprised to hear that the Government take a different view from him on the Human Rights Act.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09070628000131"></a>I am sure that the noble Lord will not mind me reminding him that those who inspired and drafted the European Convention on Human Rights, to which the Human Rights Act gives further effect, were British lawyers in the early 1950s&#151;senior Conservatives, in fact. The Government are proud to have introduced the Human Rights Act. We are clear that any attempt to reverse the incorporation of the European Convention would prevent our judges from applying the convention in a way that is specific to the UK. It would also stop us contributing to the development of the interpretation of the European Convention in the international arena.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09070628000132"></a>Repealing the Act would not mean automatically going back to the situation before 1998, when all cases had to be heard in Strasbourg. It would be legally possible to repeal the Human Rights Act and replicate selected provisions in a new Bill. We published a consultation paper in March, setting out proposals for a Bill of rights and responsibilities. This will build on the Human Rights Act, not replace or dilute it. We on these Benches have no intention of resiling from the protections afforded by the European Convention, or from the way in which they are given effect in the UK by the Human Rights Act.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09070628000133"></a>We are also taking forward measures in respect of the working of Parliament. I will not go through them in detail. There have been calls to reduce the number of MPs. The Government agree that we need to keep under review the size of the Commons but we also agree with what my noble friend Lord Grocott said on the matter. It has already been reduced in size since 1997, and it is important to remember that, since 1950, the average number of electors that individual MPs  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_534"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 534</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>represent has increased by more than 25 per cent. We agree with my noble friend that it is important to maintain the link between people and Parliament.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09070628000134"></a>There has been much debate on reforms to your Lordships&#146; House. The Government are committed to reforming this House into a substantially or wholly elected second Chamber, and have been working with other parties to that end. We published a White Paper last July that was informed by cross-party talks. Since then, there has been almost a year of wider debate and discussion of the proposals contained in it. In developing more detailed plans for reform, the Government have listened to and reflected on the debate and discussion. This fully considered and comprehensive approach to the issue is one way in which we are attempting to promote and restore trust in politics and our political institutions. We intend to publish proposals for the final stages of Lords reform by the Summer Recess, including a summary of the responses to the White Paper. Our intention is that draft legislation should be introduced and fully in place shortly after the next general election, if it cannot be put through before then.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09070628000135"></a>A great deal of what the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, is concerned with is what is defined as &#147;local matters&#148;. We are proud of our achievements in devolving power. We believe that devolution has delivered real benefits to people across the UK, providing the right balance between responsibility, accountability and representation. And we think devolution in England has been significantly advanced by the introduction of local area agreements between local authorities and their partners and central government. Within England the Government believe a regional approach is necessary to analyse and address the causes of economic disparity, to ensure planning and investment decisions are properly integrated, and to co-ordinate issues which sometimes extend beyond the boundaries of even the largest local authority.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09070628000136"></a>We do not believe in a one-size-fits-all approach. We respect the outcome of the November 2004 north-east referendum. Therefore, we have no further plans for directly elected regional bodies. Instead, in November 2008 the Government&#146;s response to the review of sub-national economic development and regeneration set out the Government&#146;s intention. The Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill announced last December will bring some of the changes into effect.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09070628000137"></a>The Prime Minister has appointed nine dedicated regional Ministers, helping strengthen the authority and viability of government offices as facilitators of partnership working in the regions and localities. In November 2008 the other place agreed to establish eight regional Select Committees, each with nine members, and eight Grand Committees. Those Select Committees have now begun their work.

Whether they are standard or specific, we believe that they should appear in the licence so that not only the licensee but members of the public know exactly what are the constraints of the licence. Further, as it is necessary to display the licence, members of the public should be quite clear and should not be presumed to have any specialist knowledge of what an authority has decided in principle. The Bill as drafted leaves the possibility for a licence to be too vague. I beg to move.</p>

Although I can understand the intention behind the amendment, the Government are not aware of any issues arising from the existing wording that has been used for sex shops, sex cinemas or sex encounter establishments in London since 1982.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09070629000003"></a>As I understand it, where local authorities do not place conditions in the licence, they will in many cases make reference to them in the licence and provide applicants with a copy. We also expect all local authorities to publish standard conditions on the internet. In any event, any person can request a copy of the standard conditions from the local authority, and the local authority must provide a copy of the same on payment of a reasonable fee. However, if the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, is aware of any evidence to show that there is a problem with the current arrangements, we would be happy to consider her amendment further.</p>

Instead, licensing fees should cover only the administrative costs of the licensing application to the licensing authority. As Clause 26 stands, local authorities would be able to set the annual cost of the sex encounter venue licence at any rate that they deemed reasonable.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09070629000006"></a>To put that into context, charges for the equivalent sex encounter establishment licence, which provides the blueprint, vary between &#163;300 and &#163;30,000 annually, depending on which local authority you happen to find yourself in. Clearly, the parameters of what is reasonable are very wide. The cost of the licence will be additional to the club's premises licence, which is required for the sale of alcohol. It would at least be useful to hear from the Minister how he imagines that the rate for the licence will be set.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09070629000007"></a>Having said all that, we also believe it to be reasonable that there is freedom for local authorities to have sufficient latitude to reflect their needs in their fees. The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 states only that an applicant for a licence shall pay a reasonable fee determined by the appropriate authority, so I would be interested to hear the Government&#146;s thinking on the fees matter. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09070629000008"></a><b><a name="90706-0014.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09070629000140"></a>Lord Brett:</b> I am delighted to agree with the noble Baroness, as the Government also take the view that the application fee for licensing should not be a profit-making operation or be raising revenue. We do not go as far as the amendment, which says that there should only be an administrative fee. We understand why the noble Baroness has raised the issue and are aware that the matter of fees for sex establishment licences causes some concern among lap-dancing operators.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09070629000009"></a>However, the Government do not believe that this amendment is necessary to protect applicants from undue charges. While &#147;reasonable fees&#148; are not defined in the 1982 Act, direction on how local government should calculate charges is provided elsewhere, in the form of the HM Treasury guidance on fees. That guide makes it clear that fees should reflect the cost of providing the service and should not be used to generate a profit; that is, I believe, the chief concern of the lap-dancing industry.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09070629000010"></a>We are aware that sex establishment licences can vary depending on the local authority area. That, however, reflects the fact that costs can vary from area

In those circumstances, the local authority has the flexibility to set fees to accept those variations. Further guidance will be provided by the services directive, Article 13(2) of which states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09070629000127"></a>&#147;charges which the applicants may incur from their application shall be reasonable and proportionate to the cost of the authorisation procedures in question and shall not exceed the cost of the procedures&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070629000113"></a>The Government believe that the services directive and the guidance issued by HM Treasury will provide sufficient protection against undue or excessive local authority charges for lap-dancing operators. Obviously, where licence holders have genuine concerns regarding the level of fees charged by local authorities, they will be able to challenge the fee structure by way of a judicial review. I hope that information will help the noble Baroness to consider withdrawing her amendment.</p>

I support the amendment; the lack of appeal against the refusal of a licence on those two grounds is worrying, especially in the case of a refused renewal. Again, we have touched on this as we have gone through; the failure to renew a licence will mean the abrupt closure of a business, with the accompanying loss of jobs and revenue. To make that decision without the possibility of an appeal would be deeply unfair, and the possibility of such a step happening in the case of the arbitrary quotas highlights our concerns with that aspect of the provisions.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09070629000014"></a>Will there be any objective assessment of the evidence on which the quota is set, or will the authority be able to pluck a number out of thin air or even amend it at will to close down a licence application without having to come up with a good reason?</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09070629000015"></a>The power to shut down discussion on the ground of the character of the locality also has the potential to be abused, so surely it would be more productive to see whether the concerns about the layout of the venue could be addressed before rejecting an application. The Minister, in response to a previous amendment,

Those are the areas that we need to consider. There seems to be no mechanism in the legislation by which to appeal against a decision to close a venue because of a quota.

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09070629000017"></a>Schedule 3 rules out the possibility of an appeal to a magistrates&#146; court where a licence is refused on the grounds that the number of sex establishments in the locality is already equal to or exceeds the number that the local authority considers appropriate, or that the grant or renewal would be inappropriate given the character of the locality. This does not leave the applicant without redress. Instead, such decisions can be challenged in a judicial review.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09070629000018"></a>Parliament obviously took the view that this was the appropriate approach when it passed the 1982 Act. Schedule 3 to that Act is designed specifically to regulate sex establishments. Due to the particular entertainment that such venues provide, the Act recognises the need to equip local authorities with sufficient powers to manage the impact that sex establishments have on local communities. The Act gives local authorities the power to impose limits on the number of sex establishments in a locality or to refuse to grant a licence if they believe this to be necessary to protect the character of the locality.</p>

<a name="90706-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09070629000019"></a>In making these decisions, the local authority is required to use its discretion and judge what are and are not suitable locations for sex establishments. Given the nature of the judgments which the local authority will be required to make when deciding an application, we consider judicial review to be the appropriate mechanism by which to challenge these decisions because of the margin of appreciation that the court will accord to local authorities when deciding whether the decision ought to be upheld, as opposed simply to substituting its view for that of the local authority.</p>

The link between the two is clear, and we would welcome effective measures to combat the sort of behaviour that blights communities. However, this is not an effective measure. Of all the clauses in the Bill, this one illustrates most clearly what is wrong not only with the Government&#146;s policies to prevent crime and tackle criminal behaviour but with their chosen methods of implementation. The Government have had to admit that there is a problem. Neither the number of people who are receiving fines for this offence or the crime statistics indicating the level of alcohol-related violent crime are falling. Instead, they are increasing.</p>

They hope that the possibility of being on the receiving end of a really significant fine will make an impression where the &#163;500 limit does not. This sort of thinking shows just how much government policy-makers are living in fantasyland. Do they imagine that people get drunk and violent after careful consideration of what fine might be imposed? Do they imagine that anyone out drinking in the streets early on a Saturday morning knows or cares what the maximum penalty for this offence is?</p>

The number of people who have received a fine above &#163;200 for this offence is in single figures. So who are the Government trying to send this clear and strong message to? The literature would suggest that they are trying to reach the people on whom the fine will be levied, but in the debates in another place, the Under-Secretary of State admitted that it was, in fact, to send a message to the police and the CPS. It comes as some surprise to this side of the Committee that the only method of communication the Home Office had with these departments was through primary legislation.</p>

Those workshops have barely had time to take effect, in the training they have given people, for example. There have been other tools that the Government have come up with. They have their youth alcohol action plan, for example, which is a mixture of education, enforcement and action with industry and, again, that is a commendable idea.</p>

<a name="90706-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09070629000029"></a>So at one level, the Government understand that this is a matter of education and working across a very broad spectrum of people, from the industry itself to community leaders and the police, and that it is not just a question of fines. In fact, those on whom the fines are likely to be levied are unlikely to be able to pay them at this level, which will then lead to further criminal proceedings. That is not a particularly desirable outcome when it ends up with those people in prison, costing the taxpayer an absolute arm and a leg, without the problem really being solved. I hope that, during discussions on this part of the Bill, we can come to a better understanding of what the solution should be.</p>

As I understand it, the sections in the 2001 Act that have implemented the fines in the designated areas have not been in for all that long. There has probably been very little opportunity for anyone to find out whether the designated areas are working and whether the fines are adequate. It probably is also worth remembering that in the court system fines are appropriate to a person&#146;s income. Quite a lot of people who indulge in binge drinking will not have a very high income, so it will not make the slightest difference whether they are fined a maximum of &#163;500 or &#163;2,500. It will still be at a level which is appropriate to what they are deemed to be able to afford. Perhaps the Minister will give us a view of his thinking so that perhaps before he finishes we may come back to this if necessary.</p>

An offence is committed when a person fails to comply with police instructions to do that. I said that a person might not necessarily be very drunk and a couple of speakers have talked about that already. He is liable to a penalty notice disorder, a PND, and, on summary conviction, to a maximum fine of, at the moment, &#163;500. Increasing the maximum fine for this offence will bring it in line with the maximum penalty for a similar offence of failing to comply with directions to leave. So this fine will not be out on its own.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09070629000035"></a>Since 2001, local authorities have implemented 712 designated public place orders, DPPOs, throughout England and Wales. This clearly shows that local authorities support this power and believe that it will tackle the disorder and nuisance associated with alcohol

In areas where a DPPO is in effect, local authorities must put up signs to show the public that they are in a DPPO and to show the maximum penalty. In a sense, the fact that the DPPO signs are there answers the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern. You could argue that if a person is very drunk, he or she will not be able to read, but this is aimed at people at all stages of intoxication. Those who might be tempted to ignore a police officer&#146;s instructions to stop drinking or surrender alcohol may reconsider their actions if they think they will be prosecuted for a fine of up to &#163;2,500.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09070629000036"></a>So far the maximum of &#163;500 has not been used; it has been percentages of that. Putting it up to &#163;2,500 shows all those involved, and those imposing the penalties, how seriously we take this. A percentage of the &#163;2,500 could be way over the &#163;500. Even if the fines do not reach the maximum, the clause will send a clear message to deter the type of alcohol-related disorder and nuisance that we see in these areas.</p>

<a name="90706-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09070629000037"></a>The noble Baroness asked what happens if they are absolutely screaming drunk. I am afraid that when people get to that stage nothing makes a difference. There are a lot of stages before that where these things can have some impact. In Committee in the other place concerns were raised that this clause will not have the intended effect when people are told what to do. I can tell that that concern is shared here as well. I hope I am covering some of the points that make me think it will.</p>

<a name="90706-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09070629000038"></a>Statistics from the Ministry of Justice show an increasing number of PNDs issued for breach of this offence, with a twofold increase in the past two years. Some 485 individuals received a PND for this offence in 2004, 712 in 2005, 1,061 in 2006 and 1,544 in 2007. The increasing number of PNDs issued for breach of this offence strongly suggests that although DPPOs have proved useful for their intended purpose, more can be done to increase their deterrence effect. We consider that increasing the consequences of breaching a DPPO will deter more people from refusing to comply with police instructions to stop drinking or to surrender alcohol in these areas. This will also incentivise more local authorises to use DPPOs as an effective solution to their area&#146;s alcohol-related disorder and nuisance.</p>

We are dealing with them across the board, talking through with them their full range of available tools and powers. Increasing this maximum penalty was one they discussed. As has been said by other speakers, this is not the only thing. There are a whole range of things one has got to use.</p>

We all know about the damage alcohol can cause to young people, not only to their health but to almost every aspect of their lives. Shops that deliberately or recklessly sell to minors should be pursued. However, why have the Government suddenly decided that the number of strikes is a problem. The current system has been in place for less than two years, and what hard evidence is there that it is failing?</p>

<a name="90706-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09070629000047"></a>In the debates in another place, the Government indicated that the police would welcome the opportunity to escalate the penalties more rapidly where they believe premises were wilfully relaxing their checks until they had received two warnings. Does the Minister have any statistics on the number of penalties and fines that have been issued to these premises for failing a test purchase? We have had a partial response to that already. Presumably there must be evidence of lots of &#163;80 penalty notices on bar staff and &#163;10,000 fines on licensees for the first two offences that the Government are failing to act as a sufficient deterrent. I look forward to hearing the figures.</p>

<a name="90706-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09070629000048"></a>The Government also claimed in another place that they were working with licensees to tackle underage drinking together, yet in this clause they seem to have disregarded their concerns entirely. Large retailers are worried that their high numbers of sales mean that they will rapidly hit the two-strike barrier even when taking all possible care, while small retailers are worried about the difficulty of training their staff to recognise the multitude of IDs that they are expected to vet, and all retailers are struggling to keep up with the ever-changing legislation and regulation they have to operate under. I have yet to hear or see any compelling evidence that this change will make any difference to the problem at hand. I hope that the Minister will be able to do better than his colleagues in another place in explaining just why we need this clause.</p>

I apologise for not being able to speak at the Second Reading of this Bill, but I declare an interest as the owner of a particularly fine pub called the Redesdale Arms in Northumberland on the A68 just south of the Scottish border which serves particularly fine wine and beer and, of course, food. If anybody happens to be on the A68, it is a good road to take. Perhaps that is more of an interest than I should have expressed. I should also say that I am chairman of Best Bar None, which is funded by the Home Office, and is an organisation that deals with award schemes for best practice in pubs and nightclubs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09070629000050"></a>It is in that regard that I am interested in supporting this clause because although a large number of pubs deal firmly with the issue of underage drinking, a number of venues have a problem with it.

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09070629000052"></a>Of course, most premises would not go out of their way to sell alcohol to those who are under 18 but the under-18s will try extremely hard to buy alcohol. I remember that I was never refused a drink from the age of 15 onwards. I went to many pubs and would have caused landlords a lot of problems. Obviously, with the pass scheme it is easier for publicans and licensees to deal with this. But it is unfair on the organisations which, by the time they receive warning notices, have implemented procedures to retrain their staff, and which will then receive a second penalty before they have introduced all the measures. They will be shut down and there is an enormous amount of time, effort and cost to the pubs, especially in this economic crisis, to sort it out. The present system of three strikes has not really been questioned, and it is strange that this should turn up in the legislation.</p>

I will have a go. It is clear from the targeted enforcement campaigns that we ran that a number of retailers still sell to under-18s, which has to stop. It is not all just errors. In the summer of 2007 the Home Office ran its Tackling Underage Sales Of Alcohol Campaign&#151;TUSAC&#151;which targeted more than 2,500 premises nationally to ascertain the extent of underage sales and how frequently they were made over a three-month period.</p>

<a name="90706-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="09070629000055"></a>The premises targeted as part of this campaign had already been identified as problem premises, and the results showed that 40 per cent of the premises targeted failed on at least one occasion, 8 per cent failed twice and 1 per cent failed three times. Despite being told when it started that they were being targeted for underage sales, 8 per cent still failed twice in that three-month period.</p>

<a name="90706-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09070629000056"></a>The Government are committed to targeting a minority of businesses that sell alcohol illegally. Even though those premises were targeted on the basis of local intelligence, we felt that the failure rates were unacceptable. If young people know that certain shops will sell them alcohol, they will take advantage, and it is possible that when under the influence of alcohol, as we all know, these young people will be involved in anti-social behaviour, possibly crime and they can cause themselves harm.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="09070629000059"></a>Some in the alcohol industry will argue that it is too early to introduce changes to this offence. The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, did exactly that, given that the original offence came into effect only in April 2007. I disagree with that. The original offence was introduced before TUSAC, which clearly shows that despite repeated warnings some premises continued to sell alcohol to children. Some representatives of the industry have also said that reducing the number of underage sales in a three-month period from three to two is much too harsh, and that the new clause is disproportionate. We all accept that human error will occur and that people will make mistakes when determining whether someone is over 18, but the defence to this offence is that the person selling alcohol has taken reasonable steps to determine whether the person was under 18. That means that they simply ask for some form of proof of age. I agree that it would be disproportionate to penalise businesses for a genuine mistake by a single member of staff&#151;that is why changing this offence as we propose still allows for a level of human error&#151;but the change makes clear that those selling alcohol should ask for proof of age any time there is doubt and, where this does not happen and these sales take place more than once, it is right that the business should be held to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="09070629000060"></a>A vast number of premises now run Challenge 21 or Challenge 25-type schemes and this clause cannot be considered disproportionate. Simply put, if you are not selling alcohol illegally, the clause will have no impact. But it will send a strong message that it is not acceptable to sell alcohol to children and that those who do will be punished. Earlier this year in Blackpool, an outlet of a major supermarket chain was found guilty of this offence. It was fined only &#163;6,000 but, since then&#151;I think because of social conscience more than the &#163;6,000 fine, although that was important&#151;it has introduced a Challenge 25 scheme across the whole country. I am pleased that many in the alcohol industry are taking steps to ensure that their staff do not sell alcohol illegally. The Challenge 21 or Challenge 25 schemes initiated by the industry are becoming widely understood by the general public. The hologram of the proof of age standards scheme, PASS, is also fast becoming an easily recognised feature of many student and other ID cards. The new clause, coupled with the excellent work the industry is doing, will send a clear message to those selling and those attempting to buy alcohol illegally that it will not be tolerated.</p>

No prosecutions were brought in 2007 and court proceedings data for 2008 are not available until later this year. I have covered the other one and so I am afraid I cannot add any more. I shall get back to noble Lords with the details of that. On that basis, I hope the noble Viscount will withdraw his objection to Clause 28 standing part of the Bill.</p>

Amendment 104 probes why there is no defence of reasonable excuse inserted to replace such a safeguard. Essentially, these are probing amendments to establish why the Government are changing this power in such a way as to remove all necessity of bad behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="09070629000065"></a>The Government&#146;s amendments in this clause would make it possible for a policeman to confiscate a sealed bottle of alcohol from a young person even if there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that he was going to drink it and he had a perfectly good excuse as to why he was carrying it. This would be ludicrous. While maintaining, as ever, my full support for effective measures to address underage drinking, I fail to see how a young person carrying a bottle of wine home for his parents is in any way a suitable target for the police. Even worse, by then refusing to hand over that bottle of wine, he becomes subject to criminal sanctions&#151;and for what?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="09070629000066"></a>Although I understand the desire to allow for the confiscation of alcohol from someone who is transporting it to be drunk by another young person&#151;a situation which the current legislation does not cover&#151;there surely must be a defence of reasonable excuse inserted in order to replace the absent subsection.

It seems unreasonable that there is no such provision in the Bill. You can imagine a situation where a young person is carrying a sealed bottle of alcohol as part of the weekly shop, which perhaps they deliver to their grandmother&#151;in that case, it might be a bottle of Guinness, which I think is often associated with grandmothers. In a less frivolous way, let us suppose that one of the child&#146;s parents was an alcoholic and the alcohol was sent by their sister, say, or their brother or whoever to the person and the child was carrying it. That is not a desirable situation but

<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="09070629000068"></a>In replying to a Question for Written Answer from my noble friend Lord Avebury on 30 June, the Government mentioned that they were revising the drug and alcohol guidance for schools. Apparently they intend to make drug and alcohol education statutory as part of personal, social and health education. That sort of provision in the Bill, if it needs legislative time to be made statutory, would be a far better use of time in tackling some of these issues than the clause that we are debating at the moment.</p>

The Minister has said on two previous clauses that the purpose is to send messages. I ask him to reflect on the message that is sent to young people when they are stopped although they have a reasonable excuse. They feel that what is happening is extremely unfair and that they have been picked on, and they begin to see the police as people who pick on young people rather than upholders of the law and people whom they should respect. When we are talking so much about sending messages, we should remember that messages go in a number of different directions. In this case, without these amendments the provision could send a message about the unfairness of the forces of law and order, which is not a good message for young people to get.</p>

This seems perfectly reasonable but I assure noble Lords that it is unnecessary. The Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997 already requires the police to consider when it is appropriate for them to seize alcohol from a young person. Section 1(3) of the 1997 Act sets out that a person commits an offence only if they fail &#147;without reasonable excuse&#148; to comply with a requirement imposed on them. In practice, that means that an officer has to consider the circumstances and decide whether it is appropriate to confiscate the alcohol from the young person in question. Naturally, that will include whether or not they have a reasonable excuse.</p>

<a name="90706-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="09070629000071"></a>In answer to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, about young people being picked on, one has to know the context in which this happens. Some of our areas and inner cities are a bit like wild lands, I am afraid. It happens in little towns out in the country as well; I know this from Dorset, where I used to have a cottage. You get groups of youngsters behaving in an appalling way, and they are well aware that they are doing so. It is not as if some person walking quietly along the street is going to get picked up for this. We have to get this into context.</p>

<a name="90706-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09070629000072"></a>Before confiscating the alcohol, a constable is required under Section 1(4) to inform the young person that it is an offence to fail to comply with his request &#147;without reasonable excuse&#148;. In practice, the constable cannot simply put the question of a reasonable excuse to one side as a matter that arises only if there is a prosecution for non-compliance; he will be using his judgment on

This is different from the situation in Clause 30, which makes it an offence to be in possession of alcohol in a public place on three occasions in 12 months. Under that clause, the offence is for possessing alcohol, but the clause contains a safeguard for children with a reasonable excuse for holding alcohol. A young person who is holding alcohol during a family picnic in a park, for example, is exempt from this power as he or she has a reasonable excuse for doing so and would not be penalised.</p>

<a name="90706-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09070629000073"></a>On Amendment 106, a young person who is drunk on the street clearly poses harm to themselves and potentially to others. The Government are very clear that unsupervised drinking by young people under 18 in public places is unacceptable. It exposes them to alcohol-related risks and has clear links to crime and anti-social behaviour. All of us in this House understand that. It was a central message in the youth alcohol action plan published last June. Therefore, we want to make it easier for the police to confiscate alcohol from under-18s found in possession of alcohol in public. We believe that doing so will have a very positive impact on removing or minimising alcohol-related anti-social behaviour and crime and disorder.</p>

<a name="90706-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09070629000074"></a>The police have told us that the requirement in the Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997 to prove an intent to consume makes it difficult for officers to take sealed containers of alcohol away from young people who are increasingly aware of this requirement&#151;let&#146;s face it, these youngsters can be very cute&#151;and are using it to get round these powers. All it takes is for the young person to argue that the alcohol is not theirs because it is still sealed or they are holding it for someone else, and they cannot be touched. The provisions in Clause 29(4) respond to the very real concerns of the police we have been in dialogue with that they should have the powers they need to take alcohol away for under-18s in a public place, and we agree with them.</p>

<a name="90706-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="09070629000075"></a>If the amendment were accepted, the constable would continue to need to prove that the young person intended to consume all of the alcohol in their possession before that alcohol could be confiscated. It would mean that the police were not able to tackle effectively young people drinking alcohol in public. That, in turn, is almost certainly likely to have an impact on the anti-social behaviour that occurs in the communities and areas I have described. As a result, I am sure that noble Lords will agree that where the police have identified that existing legislation is not working as intended, we should be responsive to these concerns. As I said on the other two amendments, this is part of a total package of measures, all aiming at addressing these concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="09070629000076"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked about education in schools. We are looking at how we can do more in dealing with schools; DCSF is looking at that in the context of communities. We will make sure that the noble Baroness&#146;s views are reflected in this strategy. There are all sorts of strands, all of which have to be pulled together. I hope that I have covered noble Lords&#146; concerns and I invite the noble Viscount to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The effect of this amendment is to leave out the part of the Bill that amends the Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997 and would give police the power to remove children under 16 from an area to their place of residence or a place of safety if they are simply in possession of alcohol. They will be able forcibly to remove a child, regardless of whether any offence is being committed, or it is necessary to do so for the person&#146;s safety or well-being, or for public order. We are not talking about the situations that the noble Lord was referring to when he responded to the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, a few moments ago. The Committee should bear in mind that a single possession of alcohol is not an offence under Clause 30. This new power is unnecessary and disproportionate. The police already have the power, under Section 30 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, to remove children under 16 to their homes between 9 pm and 6 am if they are in a specified area and the power to remove children for their own safety in an emergency under Section 46 of the Children Act 1989. Those provisions have been debated at great length in your Lordships&#146; House and I have certainly taken part in those debates myself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="09070629000081"></a>We have been contacted by Liberty, which is particularly concerned that these proposed new powers could be open to abuse; that children will feel further alienated, as the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, said; and that they are unnecessary in the light of existing laws to tackle problems of anti-social or criminal behaviour. I agree with Liberty on that score. There is already plenty of legislation to deal with children who are misbehaving. If a child under 16 in possession of alcohol commits a breach of the peace, such as by threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, it may constitute a breach of Sections 4, 4A and 5 of the Public Order Act 1986. A police power to move children on when they have not committed any offence or disturbance is discriminatory, ageist and counterproductive. As children&#146;s spokesperson from these Benches, I think it is an outrageous idea.</p>

<a name="90706-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="09070629000082"></a>I am not suggesting that we do not have a problem with children and alcohol. We do. According to an Answer to a Parliamentary Question by my honourable friend Norman Lamb in another place, last year there were 181 admissions to A&amp;E of children under 12 for alcohol-related issues; more than 4,000 admissions of 12 to 15 year-olds; and nearly 8,000 admissions of 16 and 17 year-olds. The admissions of 12 to 15 year-olds have gone up by 12 per cent since 2002, and by 66 per cent for 16 and 17 year-olds. We on these Benches agree that this is an epidemic, but we need visionary responses as well as responses that have been proved to be effective. Many local authorities have schemes to address the problem and I outlined some of those at Second Reading. The Government too have some excellent initiatives, such as the alcohol arrest referral programme, which is currently being tested in six local authority areas and was referred to a few minutes ago by the noble Lord, Lord West, in the debate on Clause 27.</p>

<a name="90706-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="09070629000083"></a>Under the scheme, those aged 10 to 17 who have been arrested while under the influence of alcohol or drugs&#151;so we are not talking here about possession&#151;will be interviewed and assessed by a specially trained youth worker who will get to the bottom of the problem and work with the child and his family to agree treatment, education or whatever else is appropriate. I congratulate the Government on initiatives of this sort and urge them to spend their money on more of this sort of thing rather than wasting the police&#146;s budget on moving on children who have not done anything. The authorities should target those who are behaving anti-socially or damaging themselves and their health. They should do it through proven therapeutic means, rather than dragging them unnecessarily into the criminal justice system. The danger of taking children home when they have not broken the law is of destroying any relationship they might have had with the police and alienating them from society by labelling them as troublemakers. I beg to move.</p>

There is no indication that the carrying of alcohol under this clause indicates that the young person is unsafe or about to cause disruption, so what is the purpose behind taking them home? The Government making it a criminal offence to refuse to give the police their home address could lead to a worrying escalation of a very minor situation.</p>

Young people drinking in public is a growing problem. A survey of 11 to 15 year-olds&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, mentioned some statistics&#151;showed that the proportion of that age group who drink outside has gone from 21 per cent in 1999 to 31 per cent in 2006. That proportion increases to more than 50 per cent among those who drink more than seven units of alcohol a week, which is an alarming growth. These children place themselves and others at risk of alcohol-related harm. Clause 29 is designed to help address this problem. This discretionary power will allow the police officer to take children under 16 to their home or to a safe place. Guidance will make it absolutely clear the children should be taken home only if they are in possession of alcohol and pose a risk to themselves or others. I do not want to give a raft of examples but I can certainly imagine a 12 year-old carrying a slab of beer accompanied by his older mates who would fall into that category. However, I shall not give lots of hypothetical examples as it would be dangerous so to do.</p>

<a name="90706-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="09070629000086"></a>As I say, it seems to me all too easy to imagine circumstances where someone under 16 who has alcohol confiscated could be at risk if the police officer then simply abandons him. Accordingly, it seems only sensible for the police to have a discretionary power backed by appropriate guidance to take that person home or to a place of safety. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, says that sufficient measures are in place. The police removal powers under the Anti-social Behaviour Act are applicable only&#151;I think that she touched on this&#151;to children whose behaviour is found to be intimidating, alarming or distressing between 9 pm and 6 am in designated locations. That is why we believe the removal power under Clause 29 is necessary as it would apply to persons under 16 deemed by an officer to be susceptible to alcohol-related harm and would permit the welfare of the child to be considered at all times and in all locations. We believe that is beneficial. I hope that with that answer I will have resolved noble Lords&#146; concerns. I request that the amendment is withdrawn.</p>

That may be evident in other legislation but not in the Bill before us. Where is the place of safety? Is it a police station, a school or the local social services department? What are the ramifications of this? If the child incriminates himself or herself by saying too much or not saying enough, and they are taken to social services, you can see all sorts of problems arising, possibly from care proceedings because the parents are not around. It is quite easy to put this into writing; it is quite difficult to see the end result. The Government need to consider the end result before we blithely pass this through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="09070629000091"></a>Confiscation is not the best way to deal with young people who drink outdoors. We on these Benches are concerned that such an approach could antagonise young people and result in conflict between them and the police. It is very easy to get young people&#146;s backs up when they feel that they have been dealt with unfairly. The Government should bear in mind that a 15 year-old may be taking the alcohol home where he or she can legally drink it. There is no link to consuming the alcohol in public. The Government are criminalising behaviour in which the young person is simply preparing to do something perfectly legal&#151;that is, to drink the alcohol at home.</p>

A similar power in Section 30 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 to remove persons under 16 to their place of residence can be exercised only when certain conditions are met&#151;that is to say, only between the hours of 9 pm and 6 am; where the relevant officer, who is a police officer above the rank of superintendent, has grounds to believe that any members of the public have been intimidated by the presence or behaviour of groups in the locality; and where anti-social behaviour is already a significant and persistent problem. There are no such safeguards against abuse of the powers in this Bill.</p>

<a name="90706-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="09070629000093"></a>We believe that children and young people who are drinking in public places should not, without also having behaved in some other criminal or anti-social

Dragging them into the criminal justice system and giving them a criminal record will have damaging effects on their future prospects for employment and will be of little deterrent against what is common teenage behaviour. In relation to younger children in particular, public drinking suggests a lack of proper parental supervision and carries evident risks to their health. A welfare-oriented approach should, therefore, be used, including parental support and working directly with the family.</p>

<a name="90706-0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="09070629000094"></a>As I said at Second Reading, criminalising possession of alcohol may also lead to children seeking out isolated locations in which to drink, where they may be at risk, particularly at night. There are all sorts of nasty people out there. We also have a problem with the proposition in Clause 29 that those people from whom the alcohol is confiscated should have to give their names and addresses to the police, and that this is then likely to be used as evidence against them in proceedings under Clause 30 to establish a persistent pattern of possession. Children from whom alcohol is confiscated are, therefore, required under Clause 29 to incriminate themselves. They will not be warned of this by the police, nor will they be legally advised, nor will they have an appropriate adult with them&#151;as would happen in situations that occur in a police station.</p>

<a name="90706-0017.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="09070629000095"></a>Further, you can imagine what a child might do when confronted with a police officer asking for their name and address. There is every chance that they will give a false name and address, and they may implicate another innocent young person who will then find it hard to dispute his identity as the person from whom the alcohol is confiscated. A miscarriage of justice is waiting to happen.</p>

<a name="90706-0017.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="09070629000096"></a>In response to the Government&#146;s youth crime action plan, the Standing Committee for Youth Justice cautiously welcomed Operation Staysafe, under which the police use existing child protection legislation to remove children and young people from the street late at night to a place of safety; but the committee expressed concern that that was being used under the banner of controlling anti-social behaviour and should not result in children being swept off the streets. I share that concern. Children should be removed to a place of safety only if they themselves are at risk of harm, as defined by the Children Act 1989. Even then, the interpretation of the words &#147;at risk&#148; and &#147;place of safety&#148; need careful consideration. Let us not further criminalise children, many of whom are only copying behaviour learned from their parents. They need help and guidance, not criminalisation.</p>

Removing the requirement to prove that the person under 18 &#147;intended&#148; to consume the sealed containers of alcohol in their possession will make it easier for the police&#151;we have had a lot of dialogue with the police&#151;to confiscate all alcohol from those under 18 years of age in public places. We are talking about situations where, for example, 12 or 14 youngsters are at a bus stop. Some of them are very drunk, some are not very drunk and some are just watching what is going on. Some are  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_555"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 555</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>holding drink and some are not. The proposed change should have a positive impact on removing or minimising alcohol-related crime and disorder. Too often, the police hear excuses such as, &#147;It is not mine, I was just holding it for someone else&#148;; or, &#147;I was not going to drink it&#148;. This makes it extremely hard for them to take action against young people in possession of alcohol in public. That is why they believe that this change is necessary, and I agree with them.</p>

<a name="90706-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="09070629000098"></a>I am sure that, in some circumstances, an individual under 18 will have a reasonable excuse for refusing to comply with police instructions to surrender their alcohol: for example, if the young person is with a parent and is helping to carry their shopping. I mentioned the example of going out for a picnic. We agree that alcohol should not be confiscated in such instances, and we expect the police to exercise discretion. However, these situations are very different from the ones that the police are telling us about: for example, groups of young people, some over 18, some under, at a bus stop or in a park, all drinking. It cannot be the norm for young people to be allowed to wander around in groups with alcohol in their possession. I hope that noble Lords agree with me.</p>

<a name="90706-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="09070629000099"></a>The requirement in Clause 29 for a police officer to request the name and address of the person under 18 is linked to the new offence in Clause 30 of persistent possession of alcohol in a public place. Under that clause, it is an offence for a person under 18 to have alcohol confiscated from them three times in any 12-month period. As such, it is necessary for police to know if the individual has had alcohol confiscated before. Taking down the individual&#146;s name and address will allow this to happen. It is interesting to think back to my grandfather, who was a beat bobby in Brixton. He knew all the scallywags, knew where they lived and knew all their families. We are in a different world now. He would probably have clipped them round the ear&#151;which nowadays would get him arrested&#151;and taken them back to their house, where their parents might have smacked them, which would get them arrested now, too. Some forces already take down the details of those from whom they confiscate alcohol. This good practice should be consistent across all forces.</p>

<a name="90706-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="09070629000100"></a>There are concerns that, when someone provides their name and address, they will be incriminating themselves under proposed Clause 30, which creates the offence of persistently possessing alcohol in a public place. However, this is not the case. Under the proposed changes to provisions in the Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act, it will be an offence for a young person whose alcohol has been confiscated to refuse to provide their name and address when required to do so. The child does not incriminate himself by giving his name and address and complying with the law. The personal information provided by the young person under the provisions of the clause may be used to prove the offence of persistent possession, but it is the fact that the person is caught in possession of alcohol three times that triggers the offence, not the fact that they have given their name to the police.</p>

<a name="90706-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="09070629000101"></a>Finally, the clause makes provision for the police, should they deem it necessary, to return persons under 16 to their home or a place of safety. The safety and  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_556"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column 556</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>welfare of young people is a key concern of the Government&#151;as it is of all noble Lords&#151;and I assure noble Lords that we take the issue very seriously. We do not consider that it will be necessary in all cases to return a person under 16 to their home or a place of safety. That is why the clause does not say &#147;must&#148;, but &#147;may&#148; take the person to their residence or a place of safety. Not all children whose alcohol has been confiscated will be at risk of harm if they are not returned to a place of safety. Whether they are will depend on how the police assess the situation, and we have to assume that they can do this. The provisions of the clause allow police to use their discretion, so that a decision that considers the vulnerability of the person under 16 can be taken in the light of circumstances. I know the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, feels this is putting too much on the police but I think that we should expect it of the police and that they are capable of making these judgments.</p>

<a name="90706-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="09070629000102"></a>The police already have some powers to remove persons under 16 to a place of safety under the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003&#151;I have covered this already&#151;for example, if is a question of alarm or distress and if they behave in that sort of way between 9 pm and 6 am. Under the Children Act 1989 the police also have emergency powers to remove a young person at risk of significant harm&#151;</p>

Why do the Government feel that in the case of anti-social behaviour a more senior officer should do this, whereas in the case of alcohol, a constable can deal with it? What is the difference?</p>

I declare an interest as a family court magistrate. Under the Children Act, the police would have the right under a police protection order to take a child into protective custody, but a whole lot of ramifications flow on from that. I asked the Minister previously if he could say what the implications were of taking a child to a place of safety. You cannot just take them and leave them somewhere. There has either then got to be contact with their parents in order that they can come and collect them, or, potentially, you have to go down the route of the Children Act and you are in the whole different world that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, was referring to. Before the next stage, we need to follow this story through as to what this place of safety means and what follows from it in terms of the Children Act. Then you are involved in all sorts of areas, such as taking the children into police protection and having to seek emergency protection orders. There is a big road to go down. One would hope it would be simple and that when the parents

But they may not; they may not be around and there may be all sorts of reasons. So I do not think we can leave it like this.</p>

<a name="09070629000106"></a><b><a name="90706-0017.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09070629000182"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> I take that point. It is a good point and we need to look at that. We would expect the bulk of the people to be returned home, as I said earlier. But if some are returned somewhere else, the point made by the noble Baroness is absolutely valid.</p>

<a name="90706-0017.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="09070629000107"></a>As far as the Children Act goes, it is a much more considered and ponderous way of doing things, which is probably why we had this higher level in there. What we are trying to do is immediate and on the ground, which is why we are looking at constables to do it, which I think is right. But this is a valid point and we will get back on that specific issue.</p>

<a name="90706-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="09070629000108"></a>These powers are not designed to deal with the return of young persons who are at risk of alcohol-related harm or who pose a risk to themselves or others because of their alcoholic intoxication. We think that by possessing these things, they could go down that route, which is why we made separate provisions under this clause.</p>

<a name="90706-0017.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="09070629000109"></a>In summary, I believe these measures will empower the police to confiscate all alcohol found in a young person&#146;s possession, thereby reducing the volume of alcohol consumed in public places and all the associated anti-social behaviour and crime. It is quite shocking, as I said earlier, how incidences of this are rising. I am sure all of us have seen what goes on in some of these places. I certainly have and it is pretty unpleasant and we need to do something about it. This will require the police to take a record of who has had alcohol confiscated and ensure that, where appropriate, a person under 16 caught with alcohol is taken home or looked after. I

It is part of the composite of all the things we are doing to try and tackle this problem.</p>

His hope that confiscation of alcohol from young people will reduce the amount of alcohol consumed is a hope that will not be realised.</p>

<a name="90706-0017.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="09070629000111"></a>I understand what the Minister says about the link between the link between this clause and Clause 30, where police have to take the name and address of the child because they need to establish the pattern for which there is an offence in Clause 30, but I am very concerned about the fact that the child on the street will not understand the implications of giving their name and address to a police officer. They will get no advice about it. Again, the Minister is expecting the police to make the sort of judgments and assessments of whether the child's welfare will be compromised that children&#146;s services workers are trained for years to make. I will be very surprised if police officers would go through anything like the amount of training that specially trained youth workers will to make such assessments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="09070629000112"></a>Perhaps the Minister has understood from this debate that we are still unhappy about the clause, so he may find us returning to it, but, for the moment, I shall not be pursuing my opposition to the clause.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000003"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="0907063000157"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (Lord Young of Norwood Green):</b> This Government want to do all they can to help hard-working people who have been affected by the current recession. Although levels of redundancies have not reached those seen in the recession of the early 1980s and 1990s, the devastation caused to communities by that experience, when whole industries were wiped out, are still fresh in the nation&#146;s memory.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000004"></a>Recently, we have had the sad news that 2,000 people in the steel industry in the UK are going to lose their jobs. Each redundancy is the story of a career cut short, not out of choice but because of economic circumstances. For those individuals and their families, redundancy comes as a massive shock. When it happens, government have to be there for people. They have to help them through that situation and into another job. So it is right that, at this time, we do all we can to improve the situation for hard-working men and women.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000005"></a>We have made considerable progress in this area during the past 10 years. When we first came into office, the weekly limit had increased by only &#163;5 a week over the previous six years, yet the annual uprating formula that we introduced back in 1999 has meant that the weekly limit has almost tracked average earnings for the past 10 years and increased by 6 to 7 per cent for the past three years&#151;well above average earnings  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC156"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column GC156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in that period. That is a far better record than any Government have had from the inception of the redundancy scheme back in 1965.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000006"></a>In addition to this financial support, we have introduced measures to help business and avoid the need for redundancies, but that is not all. We believe that you cannot simply stand aside and watch from the sidelines when people are losing their jobs. You have to step in and say, &#147;We can help you to get a second chance&#148;. That is why we have made it easier for people to get access to training to help them get back into work as quickly as possible. That is what we will be doing in the case of those steel workers. Those are just some of the things that we have already done to make a difference but we know that we have to do more.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000007"></a>The evidence might show that many people find work quickly after being made redundant, but that period between jobs can be tough&#151;especially for those with families or loved ones to support. So, in the April Budget, we committed ourselves to raising the limit for statutory redundancy pay by &#163;30. This order implements that commitment by providing for a one-off uprating to the statutory redundancy limit using a power contained in the Work and Families Act 2006. It increases the limit from &#163;350 to &#163;380 on 1 October 2009 instead of waiting until the next annual uprating round in February 2010, thereby giving immediate help to employees.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000008"></a>For the benefit of those noble Lords not fully acquainted with the intricacies of redundancy pay, I shall give a brief explanation of how this benefit is calculated. There are two elements to the calculation. First, you work out the number of weeks&#146; service that are payable to the person made redundant. That figure depends on their age and length of service. Up to the last 20 years&#146; service can be counted. Once you have worked out the number of weeks&#146; service that are payable, you multiply that figure by the weekly limit or actual pay, whichever is the lesser. Secondly, the capping mechanism is introduced. The limit is currently capped at &#163;350. In other words, anyone earning that amount or more will have their number of weeks&#146; service multiplied by &#163;350. So today&#146;s proposals put an extra &#163;30 a week into the redundancy calculation and, therefore, directly into the pocket of those most in need during this time of economic woe.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000009"></a>Besides the immediate help that an increase in redundancy pay will provide, the order has a number of associated benefits. First, it does not simply apply to the redundancy calculation alone, because other payments are linked to the weekly redundancy limit, including unfair dismissal awards and payments made to employees where their employer has become insolvent. Our order retains the link with these payments, effectively increasing their limit, too. This assistance is worth around an additional &#163;15 million of support per year, provided directly from the Exchequer to redundant employees.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000010"></a>Secondly, our order addresses the problem of deflation. As things stand under the annual uprating formula, if deflation continues until the autumn, the limit could fall by &#163;10 per week in February 2010 due to it being linked to the retail prices index. I am sure that noble   


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC157"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column GC157</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lords appreciate that in the current economic climate a fall would hit those already suffering the most. Our order rectifies this problem by suspending the annual uprating round for the redundancy limit in spring 2010, ensuring the limit will not fall.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000011"></a>So there are a number of clear benefits to the order. However, I am sure that noble Lords will also want to know the costs associated with this measure. We have calculated that the Exchequer would have to pay out from &#163;15 million to &#163;29 million per year, while the cost to business is estimated at between &#163;51 million to &#163;77 million per year. We accept that these are significant costs, but it is absolutely right to provide additional help to employees who are made redundant while keeping the additional costs on employers and the Exchequer to an acceptable level.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000012"></a>Of course, the order is not a panacea. No Government can ever say that they can stop a recession having an impact in terms of people losing their jobs or companies experiencing its effects. In the long term, the best way of avoiding redundancies in the future is to ensure that businesses are strong and able to take advantage of the opportunities offered by new technology and from increasing competition abroad. But future plans do not influence what happens today. Today, we must ensure that adequate provisions are in place during this time of unprecedented economic turmoil and that those made redundant are properly and fairly compensated for their service. For those reasons, I commend the order to the House.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000013"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0907063000158"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing the order. We on these Benches are acutely aware of the effect that redundancy can have on people, and we have great sympathy with anyone made redundant. This order increases the weekly limit for a second time in six months; it has gone up since 1 January this year by over 15 per cent. It also removes the annual reassessment of the weekly cap, due in 2010, as the Minister said, when a fall is forecast in the RPI. So we think that there is a real risk that employers will in future have to make more redundancies than they would otherwise have had to in order to make the savings that they need to avoid being pushed into insolvency. That seems to us to be of questionable wisdom on the part of the Government. Furthermore, the Government have created an additional real and unnecessary problem for the many employers who offer enhanced redundancy schemes, which are based on a multiple of statutory redundancy pay. So what are the Government, who have created the problem for them, planning to do to assist them? With this order, the Government, in their anxiety to please their paymasters, are doing something that they may later regret.</p>

The two fundamental points that the Minister made are absolutely germane in the current situation. First, it is extremely important that with the uprating there should be an acceleration of the payments being made to those worst hit by what is happening in the economy. That acceleration is welcome. Secondly, the statement being made that the Government will ensure that an uprating, which might, in a deflationary world,

For those two reasons, we welcome the order.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000015"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0907063000160"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> We believe that we have a good case for increasing the limit to help employees made redundant, particularly during the current recession. It is absolutely right for the Government to take action to prevent the collapse of the banks and to support business through the recession. It is right for us to help ordinary people as well as those people in difficult times. We have carefully considered the impact on employers, and the estimate is that the &#163;30 increase would cost them an additional &#163;51 million to &#163;77 million per year. We accept that those are substantial additional costs, but stand by our view that we have struck the balance about right. There were calls to increase by an even larger amount, but we believe that we have got the balance right. We feel that we have had an excellent record over the past decade and that we now stand in the middle ground between those calling for no increase at all and those calling for a very substantial increase. We do not believe that the &#163;30 increase is too onerous a burden for business. It is right to point out that businesses are vulnerable in what is a difficult economic climate. However, we weighed up the small increase against the needs of employees, who have shown loyalty to a company and deserve to have that loyalty recognised. We believe that the order strikes the right balance for both employer and employee.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000016"></a>It is unfortunate that the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, used the derogatory phrase paymasters, as we are acting in the interests of fairness, not meeting any vested interests. We have also ensured that we are doing our best to help businesses in a number of different ways, whether it is the &#163;270 million of guaranteed loans that have been offered to 2,855 businesses under the enterprise guarantee scheme, or the 135,000 businesses that we have helped to retain more than &#163;2.4 billion of working capital by deferring tax payments. We have done our best to stimulate the automotive sector via the vehicle scrappage scheme, which has resulted in 50,000 orders since going live on 18 May.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000017"></a>I think that I have covered all the comments made. I welcome the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, which are absolutely germane to the current situation.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000018"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="0907063000162"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (Lord Young of Norwood Green):</b> The Cariforum EPA will bring together 14&#151;soon, we hope, 15&#151;Caribbean nations with the European Union to promote development-friendly trade. It means that the Caribbean countries will receive duty-free, quota-free access to EU markets. Without it, some countries have faced tariffs on up to 25 per cent of their exports, including on critical industries such as bananas.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000019"></a>The EPA allows the Caribbean countries to remove their own tariffs gradually, over 25 years, and contains safeguards so that they can protect infant industries and prevent import surges. It also&#151;at the Caribbean&#146;s request&#151;includes provisions on services. Services are a key opportunity for growth in the Caribbean, particularly in tourism, leisure and the creative industries. No nation can achieve prosperity by closing its borders to trade. In the World Bank&#146;s <I>Global Monitoring Report 2008</I>, it was calculated that removing all trade tariffs can reduce the headcount poverty index by 5 to 6.5 percentage points over a 10-year period.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000020"></a>I would like to quote the honourable Bruce Golding, the Prime Minister of Jamaica, who a month ago spoke publicly in support of the EPA. He said that the Caribbean&#146;s hopes for growth are inextricably tied to trade and to its ability to penetrate and maintain markets where the demand is exponentially greater than Caribbean countries will ever be able to create themselves. What he said is equally true of the UK. The benefits from duty-free, quota-free access and from improved rules of origin are where the EPA will most quickly bring benefits.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000021"></a>The Dominican Republic is already moving to exploit previously enhanced market access for cocoa, bananas and textiles. However, in the longer term, the biggest benefits will come from the regional integration that will flow from all countries in a region signing.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000022"></a>This financial year, the Department for International Development has invested &#163;5 million into a new trust fund known as CARTFUND to increase growth and deepen economic integration. To secure these benefits for the Caribbean we need to ratify the EPA. By agreeing to the order today, the Committee will be allowing us to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000023"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0907063000163"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing the order. It is welcome news that 14 Caribbean nations and, we hope in due course, a 15th, will have duty-free access to EU markets. I have a few comments and questions for the Minister. First, does he have an anticipated date on which he expects Haiti to sign to make it a total of 15 countries? Perhaps he can expand on why he is confident that Haiti will indeed sign. Does the treaty come into effect whether or not Haiti signs?</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000024"></a>Secondly, there was a debate in the other place on Monday about why no impact assessment had been produced. The Minister there admitted that none had been produced, but said that the Government have worked with Caribbean countries and with their partners in the Commission to ensure that they assess the impact of provisions concerning the organisation of EPAs. I shall not ask the Minister to set out the results of that now, but it would be helpful to noble Lords if  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC160"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column GC160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>he were to write to those taking part in this debate explaining in detail that assessment of the impact of the order.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000025"></a>Thirdly, Christian Aid has written to the Merits Committee, as the Minister will well know, saying that it believes that the likely results of the EPAs will be negative for the developing countries involved. Although the Caribbean nations have signed the EPA, it believes it should be renegotiated to reflect the development needs of the Caribbean. Could the Minister address the issues raised in its letter?</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000026"></a>Lastly, there are a number of questions about the EPA and the WTO. While the Cotonou agreement, which preceded this agreement, was deemed non-WTO compatible, this agreement is said to be compatible. Can the Minister say what brought about the reconciliation? The need for small, under-resourced Caribbean nations to engage in the time-consuming negotiation process while dealing with the WTO process has made life extremely difficult for some of them, especially in terms of physical negotiating capacity. Does he have a response to the suggestion that bilateral agreements of this kind are an unwelcome distraction from a further Doha round?</p>

<p><a name="0907063000027"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0907063000164"></a>Lord Dykes:</b> I thank the Minister for proposing this order and welcome it from these Benches. I join in the questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, and hope for answers on the three points that he made. This is the end of a lengthy and somewhat painful process of negotiation, for the reality is always that moving from high protectionism to free trade is normally much easier for advanced countries than for less developed countries, particularly countries with very small Administrations, as has already been mentioned. It has taken quite a long time. We remember the very bitter criticisms of the President of Guyana last year, and there were objections from other countries as well. There were considerable discussions about the speed of opening of the Caribbean markets and other matters. None the less, these Benches welcome the agreement.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000028"></a>The EU Commission was very upbeat when the agreement was concluded, emphasising that the order was opening up complete front access to EU markets for Caribbean exports. In return, penetration into those Caribbean countries by exports from the EU would be over a long period to allow them time to adjust. The EPA allows Caribbean markets to protect sensitive sectors and local jobs where necessary. The service sector is also included, and the Minister might like to say something briefly about that because the EPA does not relate just to physical trade. The co-operation and innovation programmes are bound to be important for developing countries. Helping Caribbean countries meet exacting EU and international standards for foreign trade merchandise is a key part of this agreement, and perhaps the Minister will refer to that. Can he let us know the latest position on these matters with Cuba? I repeat the welcome of these Benches for this order.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000029"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0907063000165"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> We are fairly confident that Haiti will sign, because we believe that it has a vested interest in doing so. The order will come into effect if Haiti does not sign; but if it does not, we would need to amend the order as a result.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC161"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column GC161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000030"></a>In relation to an impact assessment, a Caribbean study published this year found that the EPA would boost productivity and cause the economy and standard of living to rise by a few percentage points. It concluded that the ultimate effect on the domestic economy would be tiny and that the loss of tariff revenue would be compensated for by a small increase in indirect taxes.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000031"></a>On Christian Aid&#146;s view that there would be negative impact, and with regard to the WTO, we cannot go back to that. The existing agreement was not compatible, whereas this agreement is, and we believe that it is a fair deal. As I said in my opening contribution, it allows the Caribbean countries to remove their own tariffs gradually over 25 years and contains safeguards so that they can protect infant industries, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, and prevent import surges. Also, at the Caribbean's request, it includes provisions on services. Services are seen as a key opportunity for growth in the Caribbean, particularly in tourism, leisure and the creative industries. The agreement establishes a free-trade area by substantially liberalising all trade. We liberalise 100 per cent and the Caribbean liberalises 80 per cent, so we think that that is a reasonable balance.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000032"></a>We funded the Caribbean regional negotiating machinery to help negotiations&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, or the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, raised that point. However, we definitely gave assistance to help negotiations. The fact that 14 Caribbean countries signed is an indication of their support for the agreement. Cuba is not involved at all. The EU is also giving more than &#8364;150 million in aid to the Caribbean and we will provide something like 15 per cent of that.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000033"></a>I do not think that I have covered bilateral agreements and distraction from Doha. The instantaneous answer provided by my team is that we are still committed to Doha. That is just for the interim, so to speak.</p>

First, they increase the hourly rates of the national minimum wage and the maximum amount for accommodation that is  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC162"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column GC162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>allowed to count towards pay for national minimum wage purposes. Secondly, they stop tips, service charges, gratuities and cover services paid to a worker through the employer&#146;s payroll from being used to make up pay for national minimum wage purposes. Thirdly, they rectify an anomaly by ensuring that the Erasmus and Comenius programmes under the European Union&#146;s lifelong learning umbrella are exempted from the national minimum wage.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000035"></a>First, I shall deal with the increases in the national minimum wage rates and the accommodation offset that are contained in Regulations 2, 4 and 6. As noble Lords will be aware, we are currently celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the national minimum wage. Despite the controversy when it was introduced, and a few dire predictions, it has become an accepted and vital feature of the British employment landscape. It continues to provide a floor below which wages cannot fall and therefore gives a certain level of protection for all vulnerable individuals.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000036"></a>To ensure that national minimum wage rates properly take account of economic circumstances, they are reviewed annually by the Low Pay Commission, an independent body made up of employers, trade unions and academics. The aim of the commission is to have a minimum wage that helps as many low-paid workers as possible without any significant adverse impact on inflation or employment.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000037"></a>This year, in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the 1930s, the commission has been doubly concerned to make sure that it gets its recommendations right. The Government therefore considered it right that the commission should be allowed to delay its report for several months. The delay gave the commission time to access additional data, including a further inflation report from the Bank of England, jobs figures for December 2008, gross domestic product data for the fourth quarter of 2008 and average earnings information up to January 2009. In addition, the commission was able to conduct further analysis of the current recession and seek more views from stakeholders.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000038"></a>The commission&#146;s recommendations were published in May. It suggested that the adult rate, for workers aged 22 years and over, should increase by a modest 1.2 per cent. It also recommended that the other rates&#151;that is, the rates for 18 to 21 year-olds, for 16 to 17 year-olds and the maximum amount for accommodation that is allowed to count towards pay for national minimum wage purposes&#151;should also increase between 1.1 per cent and 1.3 per cent. We agree with the commission&#146;s recommendations. They strike the right balance and ensure that low-paid workers are treated fairly. We estimate that nearly 1 million people stand to benefit from these increases.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90706-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000039"></a>The second change that the regulations will make, on the treatment of tips, also has at its heart issues of fairness. Since the national minimum wage came into being in 1999, it has been legal for an employer to use tips, service charges, gratuities and cover charges to count towards payment of the minimum wage where they are paid to a worker through the employer&#146;s payroll. We have reviewed this position and have come to the conclusion that it is not right. The time is now right to ensure equity for all workers and create a level  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC163"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column GC163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>playing field in wages among employers, so that tips can no longer be used towards payment of the national minimum wage. This change will also benefit consumers, because when people leave a tip, in a restaurant or elsewhere, they expect it to go to the staff. Consumers have a right to know what actually happens to the tips that they leave in good faith. Regulation 5 therefore makes it clear that service charges, tips, gratuities or cover charges paid through the employer&#146;s payroll will not count towards payment of the national minimum wage.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000040"></a>The third change that the regulations make is about ensuring consistent application of national minimum wage rules. It concerns the European Union&#146;s lifelong learning initiative, which supports member states&#146; policies on employability, lifelong learning and social exclusion, and gives students the chance to gain work experience in other countries.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000041"></a>Work placements under one of the programmes under the lifelong learning umbrella, a scheme called Leonardo da Vinci, were specifically exempted from the national minimum wage in 2007. However, work placements carried out in the same way under two other programmes, Comenius and Erasmus, are not subject to the same exemption. Regulation 3 will ensure that work placements under both the Comenius and Erasmus programmes are exempt from the national minimum wage. We estimate that around 1,700 students a year are undertaking work placements under those programmes.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000042"></a>We should not stand by and let vulnerable or low-paid workers suffer particularly during this recession. At the same time, we have a duty to make sure that our regulations do not push struggling businesses over the edge. The measures contained in these regulations strike the right balance. For these reasons, I commend this instrument to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000043"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0907063000168"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing the regulations, which, at least in respect of the annual uprating, we debate each year. Before dealing with the annual uprating, I should say that we on these Benches welcome the fact that, in the hospitality industry, no deduction for tips will be made for purposes of assessing whether the minimum wage has been met. The old practice seemed to us to be unfair.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000044"></a>On the annual uprating, is the Minister aware of reports that people are being asked in the Government&#146;s own jobcentres if they will accept wages below the national minimum wage? If such reports are true, do they not make a bit of a nonsense of the process, and are the Government taking any action on this?</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000045"></a>Lastly, I would be interested to know what the Government would do if the Low Pay Commission&#151;which has, after all, said that pressures on average earnings are on the downside and that forecast earnings in the fourth quarters of both 2009 and 2010 could prove optimistic&#151;was in future to recommend a reduction in the minimum wage?</p>

<p><a name="0907063000046"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0907063000169"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> As the Minister will be aware, we on these Benches supported the introduction of the minimum wage and have been consistently supportive of the Government&#146;s decisions in the 10 years since the minimum wage was introduced.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC164"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column GC164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000047"></a>Two issues were discussed at length when these regulations were considered in another place. The first, obviously, is tipping. We certainly support both what the Government have done and what the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, has indicated. Tipping vis- -vis the minimum wage is not quite as straightforward an issue as it might seem on the surface because it has long been the practice in restaurants either to pool tips or to ensure that people who are not actually serving the meal receive a share of tips. People often say, &#147;When we gave a tip in the restaurant we assumed that it would go to the waiter&#148;, and they sometimes ask the waiter whether he will receive the tip for the service. However, there are often perfectly legitimate reasons why the individual waiter or waitress has not received 100 per cent of the tip, because the chef and the maitre d&#146; will receive a share, as will those who do the washing up. That is a perfectly legitimate practice. The regulations need to ensure that that practice is not discontinued as a result of the minimum wage deduction. But I am sure that it will not be, because properly run restaurants have been doing it for years while paying their staff properly.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000048"></a>The second issue which caused some debate in another place is the position that the Tory Party will take on the minimum wage should it get into government. The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, may well indicate that that decision is slightly above his pay grade, or indeed his minimum wage grade; however, we on these Benches have watched with interest the change in the position that the Tory party has taken on this. It opposed the original Bill then, some years later, shifted its position when it was apparent that the minimum wage did not have the devastating effect on employers that the Tory Party had feared it might.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000049"></a>We on these Benches have always indicated that we support the minimum wage. That is particularly so when the Government have been taking into account the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission. It should not simply be a matter of a Minister saying, &#147;We&#146;ll put it up by x&#148;. Were that to be the case, particularly bearing in mind the relationship between this Government and the trade union movement, there would always be a suspicion that objectivity was being lost. I know that the Minister himself cannot answer that, and the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, has finished speaking in any event, but it would be interesting to know whether, were they to get into government, the Tories would support the continuation of the minimum wage, and whether they support the continuation of the Low Pay Commission.</p>

As I said earlier, the Low Pay Commission has the balance right on annual uprating. On people being asked in jobcentres whether they will accept less than the minimum wage, we would be appalled if that were the case. We are not aware of it. If the noble Lord has details, we will certainly check the situation and write to him to clear that up, so that there is no dubiety.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000051"></a>It would certainly not be appropriate to speculate about what might be the reaction to the Low Pay Commission&#146;s recommendations in a hypothetical

I welcome the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, and his point that the Liberal Democrats have always supported the introduction of the minimum wage; history has shown that.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000052"></a>On pooling, we are taking forward proposals on transparency and providing clear information for consumers about tips. We are working with businesses in the tipping sector, as well as consumer and worker groups, to develop best-practice guidance for business and clearer information for consumers. We have no intention of getting involved in the process of the tipping business. As the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, reminded us, pooling has been going for a long time. As long as it is not included in any calculations for minimum wage, determining the way forward is best left to individual businesses. However, clarifying the situation is certainly a good idea&#151;such as for tipping by credit card, which is not always the best way to do so.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000053"></a>On the Opposition&#146;s view of the minimum wage, I can only say that the dire predictions did not come about. They did not come about because we had a representative Low Pay Commission, excellently chaired by Sir George Bain, which took getting the right balance into account when the minimum wage was introduced. All my information was that if we got that right, it would have a positive effect. It did, and something like 2 million people benefited as a result. I think that I have answered all the questions.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000054"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0907063000172"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (Lord Young of Norwood Green):</b> I have pleasure in introducing the ACAS code of practice on time off for trade union duties and activities. Before this code can come into force, it needs the approval of both Houses. It provides practical advice and guidance on the operation of statutory rights to time off for trade union representatives and other union members.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000055"></a>The code covers entitlements for a range of trade union representatives including shop stewards, union learning reps and those union representatives who are consulted on a one-off basis when large-scale redundancies  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC166"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column GC166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or business transfers take place. However, the entitlements apply where the trade union is recognised for collective bargaining purposes.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000056"></a>Much of the code has remained unchanged since it was first put in place 30 years ago, in April 1978. Since then, the world of work has changed significantly. New technology is widely available and has transformed the way we communicate. Working patterns are much more diverse, and the role of union representatives has progressed. During this period, the code has been revised as appropriate to keep up with changes to the law. However, there is now a good case for a more thorough revision.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000057"></a>In 2007, a large-scale review of the facilities and facility time of workplace representatives strongly supported the case for the revision of the ACAS code. As a consequence, my right honourable friend the Minister for Employment Relations wrote to the chair of ACAS asking his council to consider redrafting the code. ACAS is independent from the Government, and members of its council are drawn from leading figures in the employment relations field. The views of the council always carry great respect and draw on a range of sources.</p>
<h5><a name="0907063000131"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000058"></a>I would like to take this opportunity to thank ACAS and its council for their work in preparing the revised code for us to consider. ACAS released an initial draft of the code for consultation in December 2008 and responses from that have shaped the draft of the code we have today.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000059"></a>I now turn to the substance of the code. Within this draft, ACAS has made some significant changes to its guidance. However, the legal framework that the code refers to has remained much the same. Therefore, I will focus on the areas in which the code has been developed.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000060"></a>As I have already stated, this revision updates the guidance in relation to changes in the modern workplace. It provides more guidance than before on the confidential and sensitive nature of communications involving union representatives. That will help employers in reassuring their staff that their communications with union representatives are not being monitored, while ensuring workplace security. Trade union representatives often have tasks that are demanding, complex and require great knowledge of employment law and the way the workplace functions. The provision of training has developed greatly in recent times with the widespread use of e-learning tools. That, too, is reflected in the guidance.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000061"></a>There is considerably more guidance on union representatives being given access to facilities at the workplace. By facilities, I mean the provision of workplace services such as office equipment, meeting rooms and stationery. These facilities will assist in communication and research in line with union representatives&#146; duties. It provides more information on the provision of cover for employees who take time off to perform trade union duties and activities. That is important at a time when there are increasing pressures in the workplace. Line managers are key to the smooth running and organisation of time off for representatives. It is for that reason the position of line managers is explored in more detail in this revision of the code.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC167"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column GC167</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000062"></a>The chairman of ACAS has produced a revised code that offers balanced, sensible and practical advice on time off for trade union duties and activities. It will be positive for both employers and unions in successfully interpreting and applying the law in their industrial relations. I strongly commend the code to the Committee for approval.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000063"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0907063000173"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing the draft code of practice. As we debate it, we should bear in mind that it comes at a time of increasingly strained relations between some trade unions and employers. ACAS has a duty to provide practical guidance on the time off to be permitted by employers to trade union officials and members. It therefore produces this code of practice, which must be approved by Parliament.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000064"></a>While the general purpose of the code of practice is to aid and improve the effectiveness of relationships between employers and trade unions and offer guidance for employers, employees and trade unions, all of which is sensible, I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister a couple of questions. First, anyone who has read the newspapers knows that we face an economic crisis greater than anything in living memory. Honda workers have been on extended leave, many thousands of workers have been made redundant and the weekend press tells us, among other things, that BT is offering staff long holidays in return for a substantial wage reduction&#151;yet here we are discussing leave for union representatives paid for by employers so that they can undertake union activities as if nothing has happened. Although I acknowledge the purpose of the code and our need to debate it, do the Government not understand that to the layman this sounds like fiddling while Rome burns?</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000065"></a>My other question is more specific. In February, workers went on strike when Total employed an exclusively Italian and Portuguese workforce&#151;not British workers but nevertheless all EU workers&#151;to construct an extension at its Lindsey oil refinery. Sympathy strikes, which are currently illegal, sprang up quickly, and by 4 February, 22 other sites had been affected with an estimated 6,000 workers walking out. The dispute was settled in the end when Total offered 100 new jobs to be advertised by local contractors. I am not proposing a debate on whether Total or the union was in the right, but had a deal not been reached, which would have resulted in the Government being faced with a spate of illegal sympathy strikes, what would they have done? Perhaps I should ask what they will do when that happens.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000066"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0907063000174"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> We support these regulations. The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, raises issues that I thought had long been resolved. It has long been accepted that engaging in trade union activities is an appropriate use of an employee&#146;s time. That is perfectly legitimate, and it is appropriate for an employer to allow an employee to have the time off for that. That principle is long established, and it certainly would not be fit to re-open it.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000067"></a>I make one point on the documentation in front of us. The Minister tried to indicate the significant changes from the previous code, but in future, when we have a   


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC168"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column GC168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>detailed code of practice, it might be helpful if the Explanatory Memorandum indicated exactly what material changes the Minister and his department think are being made. Otherwise, those of us reading it can find it quite difficult to follow the implications. Basically, I support the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000068"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0907063000175"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, talks about the impact at a time of increasingly strained industrial relations. In the current economic crisis, it is interesting to see some of the deals that are being negotiated as collective bargaining agreements. They are difficult deals&#151;significant time off work on reduced pay, holidays and so on&#151;and yet unions involved in collective bargaining have negotiated those deals. ACAS is trying to ensure that the situation is clarified in relation to time off. I do not take the view, to use a colourful metaphor, that we are fiddling while Rome burns. I think we are making a positive contribution to the development of employee relations. If employers use it in that way, they will gain as much as employees in a collective bargaining situation.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000069"></a>On revising the code in the current economic climate, we are not imposing any additional regulation or burden on business. The revised code will help business as it is made more relevant to modern workplace conditions. Allowing workers to have more time off will certainly not damage business because the revised code does not change the statutory entitlement for time off for trade union duties. Instead, the code assists business by providing more guidance on how it can manage the process of time off to enable union representatives to perform their functions both as employees and as representatives efficiently. Where that works well, as I quoted in situations like Honda or BT, there is a win-win scenario. I welcome the support from the noble Lord, Lord Razzall. He made a valid point about the material differences, which we need to take into account for the future.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000070"></a>On the Government&#146;s approach to the Total dispute, I believe that the Gibson review is looking at the question of productivity and so on in those sorts of industries. I would not want to speculate on the future. The Government&#146;s role has been to try to ensure that the appropriate organisations&#151;ACAS and so on&#151;have been involved to ensure that we end these disputes as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000071"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0002.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="0907063000177"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (Lord Young of Norwood Green):</b> The draft statutory instruments that we are to debate this afternoon are an important part of our implementation of the Companies Act 2006. The Act reformed and clarified company law in many areas and brought company legislation together in one place. The Act makes it easier to set up businesses, gives investors greater information and confidence, and promotes shareholder engagement and effective dialogue between business and investors. The Act has been implemented in stages, and these statutory instruments relate to provisions which are due to come into force in October 2009. This staged approach gave companies time to prepare, allowed us to implement changes in parallel with EU requirements and allowed Companies House to update its systems to support the new measures.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000072"></a>The Companies (Share Capital and Acquisition by Company of its Own Shares) Regulations 2009 are the first of these regulations to be debated. These regulations amend three aspects of the Companies Act 2006 and they will be commenced on 1 October 2009. The first is to reduce from 21 to 14 days the minimum period of notice that a company can give its shareholders when it makes a rights issue. This change is being introduced in response to concerns that the time taken to raise capital by selling new shares could expose companies to market abuse and volatility. Fourteen days is the shortest minimum period allowed by the second company law directive.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000073"></a>The second of the three changes is a minor change in the rights of creditors of a company when the company reduces its capital by applying to the court. The regulations will change the Companies Act 2006 so that it is explicit that a creditor who wants to object to the reduction will have to demonstrate that the reduction would create a real likelihood of his or her not being paid. This simply brings the 2006 Act into line with a corresponding change already made to the Companies Act 1985 last year.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000074"></a>The third aspect of company law addressed by these regulations is the rules on the purchase by a company of its own shares, where there are two changes. The regulations will remove the current 10 per cent cap on a company holding its own shares, and they will extend the maximum period for which authorisation can be given for the company to purchase its own shares from 18 months to five years. Until 2003, when a company purchased its own shares, it had to cancel them. In 2003, the law was amended to allow a company to hold its own shares in treasury up to a maximum of 10 per cent of its share capital, in line with the maximum permitted by the second company law directive. That directive has now been amended to remove that limit, and these regulations would remove the limit from UK law, increasing the flexibility for companies to hold their own shares. The only significant dissent from these proposals when we last consulted was to this removal of the 10 per cent cap. One respondent argued that there was no evidence that any company needed this extra flexibility, and that there might be some risk of abuse. Other respondents supported the relaxation.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC170"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column GC170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000075"></a>We considered the objection carefully. Shareholders have a number of other protections in this area; their approval is needed for any purchase of own shares, and they have pre-emption rights when treasury shares are resold. Taking these into account, we decided that it made sense to give companies more flexibility by removing the arbitrary 10 per cent limit. No concerns were raised in respect of the other change in relation to purchase of own shares&#151;the extension of the period for which authorisation can be given.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000076"></a>In conclusion, I should make it clear that the amendments made by these draft regulations are minor adjustments to the rules on capital and shares but, at the margin, they will provide companies with some additional flexibility to manage their capital, without removing any necessary protection for creditors or shareholders. I beg to move.</p>
<h5><a name="0907063000133"></a>5 pm</h5>

<p><a name="0907063000077"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="0907063000178"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing the regulations, which seem to contain rather a jumble of consequential changes in the law with regard to company shares and their creditors. I defer to the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, who is the only noble Lord present who was fully involved in debates on the Bill and who may be able to shed some more light on this. However, I shall make a few observations and ask a few questions.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000078"></a>These are subjects with which I have some rather dated familiarity. I am a chartered accountant and, among other things, I practised in the insolvency area in the late 1970s and early 1980s and, subsequently, through the 1980s and 1990s I advised companies as an investment banker in, among other things, raising money in rights issues.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000079"></a>So, first, as regards the reduction in the minimum period during which a rights issue may be left open, am I right in thinking that this does not affect the maximum period for which it may be left open? I do not think that there is a maximum period. Assuming that that is correct, and although I do not particularly object to what is being done here, I think that the Government&#146;s complaint seems to have been directed primarily at the longer rights issues, such as those of HBOS and Bradford &amp; Bingley. I cannot quite see how this move will improve things, and I suspect that this whole area is a bit more complicated than the Government think it is, but I very much look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about it and indeed to seeing what difference it makes in practice.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000080"></a>My next comment concerns the moves as regards the rights of creditors to object to a reduction in a company&#146;s share capital. Am I right in deducing that it limits creditors&#146; rights&#151;that is, compared with what those rights are now? I understand that this is being done under an EU directive but I have to ask whether the Government really think it wise in the current conditions. Also, when exactly are, for example, France and Germany adopting this directive, or have they done so already?</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000081"></a>As regards the length of time for which a company may maintain an extant right to buy in its own shares, I do not particularly object to increasing the period to five years. As regards removing the cap on the proportion  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC171"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column GC171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of its share capital that a company may hold in treasury, I think I am right in saying that the position that we are moving to is the one that has operated in the US for many years. However, I wonder whether the Government have fully thought through the extent to which this risks increasing the opportunities for a company to manipulate its share price. Perhaps the Minister can say what the Government&#146;s thought process has been on this. I hope that he can reassure me.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000082"></a>Lastly, I should also be grateful to hear&#151;perhaps in writing afterwards if that is easier&#151;what the position is as regards the period and the percentage in the other major EU countries.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000083"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0907063000179"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> I support these regulations. They are an important continuation of what is required under the Companies Act, with the Government having learnt from what has happened since the introduction of that Act. Having made a slight criticism of the Explanatory Memorandum during debate on the previous statutory instrument, perhaps I may say that I thought that this Explanatory Memorandum was extremely clear and very helpful, putting the pros and cons in a very effective way.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000084"></a>The first change to the Companies Act is aimed at reducing the period of notice for pre-emption rights issues by at least seven days, thereby enabling rights issue processes to be much shorter. One of the benefits not put in the Explanatory Memorandum is the significant cost-saving that will arise to the company. When rights issues are underwritten and sub-underwritten, where the underwriter has to make a commitment for the capital to be available for a period, the longer the period of the rights issue, the larger the fee the underwriter charges. Therefore, in the current climate, anything that facilitates a reduction in those fees, which in turn will facilitate more companies being able to afford a rights issue through the market, has to be commended.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000085"></a>I have no comment on the second element of the Act to be changed. We clearly need to come into line with the relevant European directive.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000086"></a>On the third issue, the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, made a very good point, which is whether this increases the opportunity for market manipulation and abuse in relation to a company&#146;s own shares. I think that the answer that the Minister will probably give is set out on page 23 of the Explanatory Memorandum, which explains that significant other provisions are available to prosecuting authorities, or indeed the City, in the event of suggested manipulation. I think that is the answer. If a company is to have the ability to buy its own shares, it seems a little strange that it should be restricted to 10 per cent and that it can have the resolution for only 18 months. If we are going to accept the principle, we might as well go the whole hog, which these regulations do, and rely on other provisions to give the necessary protection against manipulation or abuse.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000087"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0907063000180"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> To answer the questions put by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, creditors will not be affected by the removal of the limit on treasury shares.

Shareholders&#146; agreement will still be needed to authorise the purchase of owned shares, and if and when treasury shares are resold, the shareholders will have a pre-emptive right to purchase shares pro rata to their existing holdings.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000088"></a>With regard to manipulation, as the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, implied, companies are still required to comply with the insider dealing regime under the Criminal Justice Act, the market abuse regime under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and requirements under the listing rules. We believe that these will be more than sufficient to deter any sensible company from attempting to use treasury shares in this way.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000089"></a>The reduction does not affect the maximum period of notice for rights issues. The notice period is just one part of the rights issue process; for example, the company has to prepare and issue a prospectus. There was broad consensus that at the margin the reduction in the minimum notice period would be helpful.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000090"></a>I shall write to the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, on whether France and Germany have yet implemented the directive.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000091"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, asked whether this is the appropriate time to introduce change. These changes are all deregulatory in nature, and there is no reason why introducing them now should cause problems for companies or their members. The majority of companies will not be affected immediately and may never be affected. They will apply only to companies that choose to do one of three things: raise capital through a rights issue, reduce their capital by application to court; or purchase and hold their own shares. None of these things is something that any company does every day, or even every year, so most companies will feel no immediate effect of these changes. However, any company that does one of these things may find that it has more flexibility after these changes are made.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000092"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, was right when he said that shortening the rights issue period will make underwriting cheaper. Other things being equal, shorter exposure to changes in the market should reduce risk and should, in general, reduce underwriting costs.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000093"></a>I am grateful to noble Lords on all sides for their contribution to this debate and hope that they will agree that this instrument will provide flexibility for companies when managing their capital.</p>

<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC173"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column GC173</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="0907063000094"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0907063000182"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (Lord Young of Norwood Green):</b><b></b>We are today debating the draft Community Interest Company (Amendment) Regulations. The community interest company form was created by the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004 and the Community Interest Company Regulations 2005. In passing that legislation, we were creating a new type of company tailored for social enterprises that wanted to use the familiar company form but with the assurance that assets would primarily be used for the benefit of the community.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000095"></a>That legislation came into force in July 2005 and, since then, over 3,000 social entrepreneurs or social enterprises have chosen to register as community interest companies. The original legislation also created the office of the regulator of community interest companies as an independent officeholder with responsibility to oversee the sector and maintain public confidence in this new company form.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000096"></a>Before introducing the community interest company, we consulted widely on both the principle of this new form and how it should work in practice. One of the principles was that the community interest company would offer more flexibility and choice to the social enterprise sector. It was intended to complement the existing and well established forms, such as charities or industrial and provident societies, which are also commonly used in the sector.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000097"></a>Although the community interest company has not been in existence long, there have been a number of related legislative changes over that time. We have also learnt from the experience of the companies and their advisers, as well as the regulator, how some aspects of the regulations work in practice. The draft amendment regulations will therefore update the regulatory framework for community interest companies to take account of these developments.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000098"></a>As I have said, the original intention was that the community interest company would sit alongside other legal forms in the sector, and we consider that enterprises should have the option to move between the various legal forms available where this is appropriate. So, the 2004 Act permitted community interest companies to convert to become English or Welsh charities or vice versa. The original legislation also anticipated that we would use regulations to permit conversions both from Scottish charities and to the community benefit form of industrial and provident society, once provisions relating to those two forms were in place. The office of the Scottish charity regulator has since been established and a statutory asset lock is now available to community benefit societies. With those provisions now in place, the draft regulations now permit Scottish charities to convert to community interest companies and permit community interest companies to convert to the asset-locked form of community benefit society.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000099"></a>The draft amendment regulations make a number of other changes in the light of experience or to seek to improve the original drafting. These include, for example, clarification of the community interest test to provide more certainty to the regulator in her decision-making. There are also a number of amendments  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC174"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column GC174</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the provisions which a community interest company is required to include in its articles. The effect of these changes is essentially to allow the companies themselves to determine their approach on certain matters, such as the appointment and removal of directors and casting votes, rather than requiring them by statute to follow a prescribed course.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000100"></a>Finally, the draft regulations implement consequential amendments to the regulations arising from the Companies Act 2006. In particular, the 2006 Act introduces changes to the information contained within a company&#146;s memorandum and articles which need to be reflected in the regulations governing community interest companies. In summary, therefore, the draft regulations aim to update the community interest regulations for the benefit of existing and prospective community interest companies. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000101"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0907063000183"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I thank the Minister for explaining the regulations, which I do not believe are particularly controversial. However, perhaps I could ask a few questions. As set out in the Explanatory Memorandum, according to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0907063000124"></a>&#147;To minimise the impact ... on firms employing up to 20 people, the approach taken is to maintain a light touch regulatory framework for CICs&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000122"></a>Can the Minister kindly explain how the office of the regulator of community interest companies achieves that? Is it, for instance, subject to regulatory budgets and sunset clauses? How does it interact with the Better Regulation Executive?</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000102"></a>Secondly, how many people does the office of the regulator of community interest companies employ and how much does it cost to run each year? How is its performance assessed? Lastly&#151;a relatively minor question&#151;I believe that the order will remove the right of a community interest company chairman to cast a deciding vote in a boardroom ballot. There was an apparently valid reason for the chairman having a casting vote. Can the Minister, therefore, explain what happens if the board is split equally on an issue?</p>

<p><a name="0907063000103"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0907063000184"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> I am happy to support these regulations. I have one question about paragraph 8 on page 2 of the Explanatory Memorandum, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0907063000125"></a>&#147;In two instances, where there were mixed views raising significant concerns, these provisions have been removed&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000123"></a>Is the Minister in a position to say what those provisions were?</p>

<p><a name="0907063000104"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0907063000185"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> If the board is split equally, any proposal put to the board falls, so there is no deadlock. Those are the usual rules of debate: if there is no majority and there is no casting vote, the proposal falls.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000105"></a>Some proposals were dropped in the light of the responses. I was asked what those proposals were and what the concerns about them were. One proposal was to permit the regulator to take into account the impact of a prospective community interest company&#146;s activities on the wider community and public interests. Several respondents felt that this would fundamentally alter the role of the regulator, involving her in potentially  


<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC175"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column GC175</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>contentious and subjective decisions. It was also noted that on many issues there would be differing opinions on what constituted community benefit.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000106"></a>Of the two other proposals, the first was to commit public or regulatory bodies&#151;for example, local authorities that may have set up a community interest company&#151;to make representations to the regulator for a share of any residual assets in the event of a winding up. The final one was to deal with the consistency of the regulator, requiring the regulator&#146;s consent to a transfer of assets for less than full value to an asset-locked body, but not requiring consent when the company makes a transfer for the benefit of the community. In both cases, while there was support for the aims of the proposals, practical issues were raised, which we felt needed further consideration with stakeholders.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000107"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked how many people were employed by the regulator, the answer to which is eight. The cost in the current financial year is &#163;515,000. We will write to confirm details of the regulatory framework. There may have been a question about performance, as well. I believe that I have covered all the questions and commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000109"></a>The Companies Act 2006 updates company law to ensure that it reflects modern needs. The Act, which received Royal Assent in November 2006, has been implemented in phases over the past three years and these draft orders relate to the provisions which are being commenced as part of our final implementation of the Act on 1 October 2009. An earlier consequential amendments order was made in 2008 relating to those provisions, commencing on 6 April 2008 and 1 October 2008. A number of consequential amendments have also been made in two commencement orders made under the Companies Act 2006.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC176"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column GC176</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000110"></a>The Companies Act 2006 (Consequential Amendments, Transitional Provisions and Savings) Order 2009 makes consequential changes to many different pieces of legislation, going as far back as the Newspaper Libel and Registration Act 1881. The amendments can be broken down into three broad areas. First, there are the consequential amendments to existing company law&#151;for example, the remaining parts of the Companies Act 1985 relating to company investigations. Secondly, there are the amendments to insolvency legislation, which are required because the 2006 Act removes the link between the Companies Act 1985 and the Insolvency Act 1986. Finally, this order makes consequential amendments to other primary legislation that refers to, or includes concepts from, the Companies Act 1985 or the Companies Act 1989. In many cases, we have simply updated references to provisions in the 1985 Act.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000111"></a>The taxes and national insurance order similarly amends legislation for which Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs is responsible which uses Companies Act references, definitions and concepts.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000112"></a>The uncertificated securities order makes consequential amendments to the uncertificated securities regulations 2001. These set out the legislative structure for CREST, the computerised system that transfers shares, gilts, corporate bonds and money market instruments electronically without using paper certificates. In all but two areas&#151; refusal to register a transfer of shares and information about the state of the register of members&#151;the order simply replaces old references to various definitions and provisions of the Companies Act 1985 with new ones relating to the Companies Act 2006.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000113"></a>All three orders make two types of consequential amendment. The first type relates to references to company law in other Acts which are changed to refer to the equivalent provisions and definitions in the 2006 Act. These are purely mechanical amendments. For example, a reference to &#147;the Companies Act 1985&#148; is simply changed to &#147;the Companies Act 2006&#148;.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000114"></a>The second type of amendment relates to a change in the substance of company law. For example, some of the information contained in the old-style memorandum is now contained in the articles of association. That change must be reflected in other legislation. The overall intention of all these consequential amendments is to ensure that the legislation which is amended continues to operate in an effective way and is easy for the reader to use. I commend these orders to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000115"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0907063000188"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> Yet again, I thank the Minister for his continuing dedicated work this afternoon in explaining these orders. They do not sound earth-shattering or controversial, but perhaps I have allowed myself to be worn down by the seemingly unending stream of statutory instruments that we have debated this afternoon. At least these are the last. I restrict myself to asking two questions. First, according to the Treasury, the uncertificated securities regulations are likely to undergo further significant change in the course of 2009-10. Will the Minister give any indication as to what those changes will be? Finally, will 1 October 2009 see all

If not, when will the remaining provisions become law?</p>

<p><a name="0907063000116"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="0907063000189"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> I also welcome these orders. The only point that I would make is more for the publishers of legal textbooks than for the Government. I appreciate that this is an attempt to have a user-friendly document, but one of the problems of not consolidating legislation is that practitioners have to trail through the books to trace how the regulation fits in. As the Minister will be aware&#151;certainly, his department will be&#151;I argued strongly when the original legislation came in that it should be consolidated, and eventually the Government agreed.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000117"></a>It is quite difficult to see how this could have been done in a consolidated way because we are talking about other pieces of legislation that are not necessarily only about company law. However, as legislation and regulations become more and more complicated for the practitioner to follow, I often say that it is really only for the benefit of Butterworths.</p>

<p><a name="0907063000118"></a><b><a name="90706-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0907063000190"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> To answer the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, one further change will incorporate the settlements of shares and the open-ended investment of companies into the CREST system. He asked whether these were to be the last instruments to be made as part of the implementation of the Companies Act 2006. I am sure that he will be pleased to know that we expect to lay two further draft affirmative instruments relating to sensitive company names. We also expect to make further instruments, subject to negative resolution, by early September, including the registrar company fees regulations.</p>

<a name="90706-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0907063000119"></a>On consolidation, the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, is correct that we will make further amendments. I take his point about complexity. We have to make consequential amendments because the law that they amend would no longer work properly without them. In other cases where legislation refers to provisions of the Companies Act 1985, which has been repealed, the consequential amendments will help those using the legislation&#151;that is what it says here. Without the amendments, the reader may not be aware of relevant changes to company

<a name="0907065000003"></a><b><a name="90706-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0907065000081"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Malloch-Brown):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (David Miliband) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="0907065000004"></a>In my response to the right honourable Member for Wells (David Heathcoat-Amory) during Oral Questions on 30 June 2009, I said (<I>Official Report</I> col. 159):</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0907065000080"></a>&#147;In respect of India, he will know that British aid now amounts to about &#163;240 million over this spending review period, but it is on a declining trend, and by 2011 will have stopped, not because of the Indian nuclear programme but because India is becoming a richer country. It is clear from international development legislation since 1997 that development aid should be directed according to poverty, and that is the basis on which India is pulling itself away from aid, according to its own wealth-generating potential&#148;.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0907065000005"></a>It has been brought to my attention that the information I gave in my response was incorrect. We have no plans to scale down the provision of aid to India or to stop the provision of aid by 2011. Our aid expenditure under current spending plans amounts to &#163;285 million in 2008-09, &#163;275 million in 2009-10 and &#163;280 million in 2010-11. These figures reflect India&#146;s continuing levels of poverty, with over 450 million Indians living on less than $1.25 a day, but also its own achievements in generating wealth.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0907065000007"></a>The Economic and Financial Affairs Council will be held in Brussels on 7 July 2009. The following items are on the agenda:</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="0907065000014"></a>Heads at the June European Council agreed conclusions on the financing of climate change. The presidency will outline its strategy for member states to reach agreement on a negotiating mandate at the October European Council. The UK believes that work should continue to ensure that the EU reaches agreement on the key issues suitably in advance of the Copenhagen conference in December.</p>

This will begin preparation of further meetings in London of G20 deputies on 3 and 4 September and G20 Finance Ministers and central bank governors on 4 and 5 September. The Government look forward to working with the presidency and member states to ensure that work taken forward at G20 complements work at EU level.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="0907065000018"></a>Following on from progress made at the informal ECOFIN in April, Ministers will be asked to adopt council conclusions on procyclicality. The Government agree that banks will need to build counter-cyclical buffers in good times and strongly support ongoing technical work through the Basel committee to examine the forces that contribute to pro-cyclicality in the financial system and possible mitigating options, as well as the efforts by the EU which complement work by the G20.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="0907065000026"></a>Following on from ongoing work at committee level, Ministers will exchange views on the incorporation of implicit liabilities into medium-term budgetary objectives (MTOs). As a country that is neither in the euro area nor a member of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II), the UK is not obliged to set a numerically defined MTO. Any changes to the methodology of incorporating implicit liabilities into MTOs should not change countries&#146; obligations under the stability and growth pact.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="0907065000030"></a>The decision was taken after the department studied a report produced by independent inspectors appointed by the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry after MG Rover Group went into administration on  8 April 2005 owing creditors nearly &#163;1.3 billion.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="0907065000031"></a>The inspectors were appointed under Section 432 of the Companies Act and had wide powers to require documents and the attendance of witnesses, including directors, officers and agents of the company. They investigated the affairs of MGRG, its parent company Phoenix Venture Holdings and MGR Capital Limited and 32 related companies between the purchase of MGRG from BMW in May 2000 and the date of it entering administration.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="0907065000032"></a>The inspectors delivered their report on 11 June 2009.

<a name="0907065000033"></a><b><a name="90706-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="0907065000085"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Darzi of Denham):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Andy Burnham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="0907065000034"></a>I am responding on behalf of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister to the 24th report of the NHS Pay Review Body (NHSPRB) (Cm 7646), which has been laid before Parliament. Copies of the report are available in the Vote Office. I am grateful to the chair and members of the NHSPRB for their report.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS36"></a><b>6 July 2009 : Column WS36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="0907065000035"></a>We welcome the NHSPRB&#146;s 24th report and accept most of its conclusions and actions, which we will take forward.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="0907065000036"></a>The NHSPRB made one recommendation of a short-term national recruitment and retention premium (RRP) for pharmacists working in the NHS, paid at Agenda for Change (AfC) pay bands 6 and 7.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="0907065000037"></a>After careful consideration, I have decided to reject this recommendation because:</p>
the recruitment and retention difficulties vary widely in England but are not significant in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so a national RRP, which would be applied UK-wide, is inappropriate;in England, local recruitment and retention difficulties will be best addressed by increasing supply and using local recruitment and retention premia where needed alongside other local initiatives to support the training and development of junior pharmacists; andthe additional expenditure that would be required to implement the national RRP is unreasonable at a time when resources available to the NHS and the wider economy are being tightened and efficiency savings required from the NHS increased.
<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="0907065000038"></a>I am grateful, however, that the NHSPRB has highlighted difficulties retaining junior pharmacists in the NHS in England and, to address those concerns, the following actions are being taken forward:</p>
the Modernising Pharmacy Careers Programme Board, chaired by Dr Keith Ridge, the Chief Pharmacist for England, and responsible for the development of the pharmacy workforce in England, is working with the strategic health authorities to increase the number of pre-registration pharmacy training places in the NHS from 2010;updated guidance about the use and application of local recruitment and retention premia has been given to the NHS Staff Council, which will consider it as part of its wider review of RRPs. The NHS Staff Council, made up of NHS employers and unions, is responsible for overseeing the Agenda for Change pay system;we will draw local employers&#146; attention to the recommendations and deliberations of the NHSPRB about use of remuneration to resolve local pharmacy vacancy challenges, thereby informing their decision about whether paying a local RRP is appropriate; andthe NHS will continue to make use of specific local initiatives to support the training and development of junior pharmacists&#151;for example, flexible working, protected study time and funding to support study for postgraduate diplomas.<h2 align="center"><a name="0907065000095"></a>NHS: Top-up Fees</h2>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_6"></a>
<a name="0907065000041"></a><b><a name="90706-wms0001.htm_spmin6"></a><a name="0907065000087"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government &amp; Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Ian Austin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="0907065000042"></a>I am today publishing a report by the University of Reading on the dissemination and use of the 2007 code for leasing business premises.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="0907065000043"></a>The property industry introduced the present version of this voluntary code in response to continuing government concern about the degree of flexibility in the commercial property leasing market and the lack of information and advice available to small businesses about the implications of property leasing. The new code is an excellent document, which, if implemented, would make a big difference. Besides a code of practice for landlords, the code provides step-by-step guidance for tenants taking out leases and a &#147;heads of terms&#148; document enabling them to see at a glance the commitments they would be taking on.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="0907065000044"></a>We undertook to monitor the implementation of the code. As a first step, we commissioned Reading University to study the dissemination and use of the code once it had been in place for a year.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="0907065000045"></a>This report about dissemination and use of the 2007 code paints a very disappointing picture. It suggests that small business tenants are not receiving any substantive information on the code from any source. Except for some well advised major tenants, the code is not a primary tool for the negotiation of new leases.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="0907065000046"></a>If parties do not know about the code and do not use it, it will have no impact. The property industry has asked us not to legislate in this area and we have held back to give the 2007 code a chance to work. But if the more substantive research shows that the market has not responded, legislation is bound to come back on to the agenda.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="0907065000047"></a>I call on the property industry, while there is still time, to redouble efforts to disseminate and use the code&#151;every tenant negotiating a lease should have a copy and be encouraged to use it. In particular, the professions&#151;surveyors and solicitors&#151;have a special responsibility for making it available. A professional, modern industry will surely have an interest in ensuring that its customers are fully and properly informed about the leasing choices they are making. The UK commercial property industry should be a world leader, not just in its level of sophistication but also in the farness with which it operates.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="0907065000050"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department and I are today announcing the publication for the first time of information relating to those offenders who have been released from prison on licence, subsequently recalled for whatever reason and who have not yet been returned to custody.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="0907065000051"></a>That information is published today and a copy of the information release has been placed on the Home Office and Ministry of Justice websites. It is also available in the Libraries of both Houses and in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office. It covers the period 1984 to 31 March 2009.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="0907065000053"></a>This information is being published following an audit of the work of police, probation areas and the United Kingdom Border Agency. It was carried out by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS), which has responsibility for licence revocation policy.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="0907065000054"></a>In seeking to protect the public from known offenders after their release from custody, the police and probation services deal with some of the most highly unpredictable people in our society, many of whom lead chaotic lives. We have ensured that these services have the powers that they need to manage such offenders.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="0907065000055"></a>Many offenders return to the community on licence following a period in prison and complete a successful rehabilitation. But others are prone to breaking the conditions of their licence and therefore become subject to recall to custody.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="0907065000056"></a>All offenders serving a sentence of 12 months or over are released from prison under licensed supervision to the probation service. They are all subject to a set of standard licence conditions, requiring them to report regularly to the probation service, live at an address approved by the probation service and to be of good behaviour. In many cases, they will also be subject to additional licence conditions, which are designed to help the probation service to manage the offenders effectively in the community. These licence conditions can place a wide range of restrictions or requirements on the offender&#151;for example, to undertake offending behaviour work, not to enter an exclusion zone, to abide by a curfew or to live in a specific hostel.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="0907065000057"></a>Offenders are told at the outset of their period on licence that they may be recalled to custody if they breach any of the conditions of their licence. Reasons for recall range from a deterioration in an offender&#146;s behaviour that leads the probation service to conclude that there is an increased risk of the offender committing further offences, to a failure to maintain contact with their offender manager. The probation service does not have to wait until a further offence has been committed before an offender is recalled.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="0907065000058"></a>The Government have taken a number of steps over the past 12 years to strengthen this recall system. In 1999, the use of executive recall powers was extended, a step that has proved to be both swift and effective.

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="0907065000059"></a>In the Criminal Justice Act 2003, we extended the period of the licence applied to determinate sentence prisoners serving sentences of 12 months and over, so that the licence does not expire until the end of the sentence. Previously, such licences expired at the three-quarters point of the sentence. The number of prisoners recalled was 13,467 in 2008-09.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="0907065000060"></a>This Government have also overseen a significant improvement in the probation service&#146;s enforcement of licences. In 1997, enforcement audits showed that appropriate enforcement action was being taken in only a third of cases where prisoners were serving sentences in the community. By 2008, over 95 per cent of licence breaches were being effectively enforced.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="0907065000061"></a>In April 2007, we introduced an end-to-end target for recalling offenders, covering the period from the decision to recall the offender to the offender being returned to custody. The target is for 75 per cent of offenders to be returned to custody within 74 hours, where they are subject to emergency recall, and within 144 hours, where they are subject to standard recall. Performance against these end-to-end targets has improved to 70 per cent being returned in target timescales in October 2008 to March 2009 from 60 per cent in the same period a year earlier.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="0907065000063"></a>The recall process is as follows. On behalf of the Secretary of State for Justice, NOMS considers whether to approve a recommendation for recall. The recommendation is submitted by the probation area with responsibility for supervising the offender on licence. Where a recall is approved, NOMS revokes the offender&#146;s licence on behalf of the Secretary of State and issues a revocation notice to the police. NOMS sends the revocation notice both to New Scotland Yard&#146;s Police National Computer Bureau and to the police basic command unit that covers the area in which the offender&#146;s last known address is recorded. At this point, it becomes the responsibility of the police, with input and intelligence from other agencies, to apprehend the offender and return him to custody. All agencies involved in the process give priority to recalling and apprehending those offenders who have previously been convicted of serious sexual and violent offences and who are assessed as potentially presenting a high risk of harm to the public.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="0907065000064"></a>The audit covered all offenders in England and Wales whose licences had been revoked between 1984 and 30 June 2008. It enables NOMS to determine the precise number of those who have been returned to custody and, for those who have not, the action that has been taken, and is being taken now, to apprehend them. For the future, we have decided, working with the National Statistician, regularly to publish information on offenders who have had their licence revoked.</p>

On the basis of partial data, and using assumptions where necessary, we estimate the number of licence recalls between 1984 and 1999 to be around 10,000. (Paragraph 8 above explains why there were many fewer recalls before 1999.)</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="0907065000066"></a>The audited data show that, between January 1999 and 30 June 2008, 81,757 offenders are recorded as having their licences revoked, of whom, as at 26 June 2009, 81,164 had been successfully returned to custody; the remaining 593 (or 0.7 per cent) have not yet been apprehended. A further 19 offenders who had been recalled prior to 1 January 1999 were also recorded as not having been returned to custody, thus giving an audited total of 612. The provisional data held by NOMS, which have not been reconciled with data held by police and probation, shows that in the period from 1 July 2008 to 31 March 2009 a further 10,208 offenders had their licences revoked, of whom, as of 26 June, 9,866 have been successfully apprehended and returned to custody and 342 (or 3.4 per cent) have not yet been apprehended, though experience suggests that most of these offenders will in due course be returned to prison.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="0907065000069"></a>As part of the process of completing the audit, NOMS wrote to each police force and probation area in England and Wales, enclosing a list for each area of all offenders who have been recalled and have yet to be returned to custody. They were asked to check the list for accuracy and to determine whether some offenders might be removed from the list&#151;because, for example, they had been returned to custody under a different name or had died. They were also asked to renew efforts to return to custody those who remained in the community. Following the audit, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) wrote to all police forces in England and Wales, asking them to take priority action to arrest and return to custody all those offenders on the list who had previously been convicted of sexual or violent offences, while also reviewing and renewing their efforts to apprehend the remainder. Intensive reviews of the priority cases are under way and are driving appropriate action.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="0907065000070"></a>More generally, ACPO will work with forces, and with other agencies and the Home Office, to ensure that the police continue to do all that they can to make the recall system effective. They will identify and disseminate information on what works and how to tackle the main obstacles to speedy arrests in these cases. For example, the Metropolitan Police has established a unit in each London borough dedicated to arresting wanted offenders, including those subject to recall. Other forces have instigated dedicated days of action for apprehending wanted offenders. All forces are also working with all the criminal justice agencies to integrate the management of offenders so that, when it is proposed to revoke an offender&#146;s licence, the police have the

<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a><a name="0907065000071"></a>NOMS, the probation service and the police are working closely together to share information and improve working practices. For example, NOMS and the police are working to put in place a new &#147;early warning system&#148; for recall, whereby the probation service shares intelligence with the police on the likely whereabouts of the offender at the point at which recall is requested. Better information sharing and a clear and consistent identification of these offenders will greatly assist in ensuring their timely arrest.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="0907065000072"></a>The Government are committed to improving performance further and all agencies are working to ensure that they make the optimal contribution separately and together.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a><a name="0907065000073"></a>NOMS has established a network of &#147;recall liaison officers&#148;, covering every probation area and police force to share information and improve performance. Performance data are issued and monitored monthly through local criminal justice boards (LCJBs). A best practice guide has been produced and is shortly to be issued to all LCJBs, designed to improve further multi-agency performance in respect of recall.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="0907065000074"></a>The performance for each area against the licence recall target for the periods April 2007 to March 2009 is given in the information release. The performance has been broken down by agency and by LCJB area. LCJBs monitor performance against the target. Over the past two years since the target was introduced, there has been a steady improvement in performance across all the agencies. We are committed to working with LCJBs to improve further performance.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="0907065000077"></a>This Statement gives notice of a resource commitment in advance of the authorisation by Parliament of supply provision for HM Treasury in 2009-10. There are no implications for cash spending.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="0907065000078"></a>In the 2009-10 vote on account (HC 1039) presented in November 2008, HM Treasury was voted resource provision of &#163;142 million to cover spending on continuing services until the 2009-10 main estimates are voted by Parliament in July. The amount on account excluded any provision for financial stability-related resource consumption as, at the time, this was expected to be zero.</p>

<a name="90706-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="0907065000079"></a>However, it has since been decided that a cost of capital charge should be applied to the Government&#146;s financial stability-related loans and investments. Cost of capital charge is a non-cash resource charge, accruing on a daily basis, designed to improve transparency under resource accounting and encourage the efficient use of assets. For 2009-10, the charge is forecast to be &#163;450 million, which will not be available until the provision in the Treasury&#146;s 2009-10 main estimate, presented as HC 514, is voted by Parliament in July. This means that the proportion of the &#163;450 million resources that will be consumed before the end of July (ie &#163;135 million) will take resource spending over and above the &#163;142 million authorised in the vote on account causing a resource commitment in advance  of supply.</p>

Under the new charging arrangements abattoirs will be charged a percentage of the time costs of meat hygiene official controls carried out at their premises. The change will not increase charges for businesses if official control time remains unchanged and will provide an incentive for businesses to improve standards and compliance and to use official control resources as effectively as possible.</p>

As the age over which cattle must be tested for BSE was raised in January 2009, the effect would be that only abattoirs slaughtering cattle aged over  48 months, instead of the current 30 months, would require an approved RMOP. Similar consultation exercises will be held in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

This applies irrespective of whether the person holds any passports (either Indian or that of their other nationality/citizenship)&#148;.</p>
