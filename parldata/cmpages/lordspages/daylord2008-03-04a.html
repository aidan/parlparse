The regulations state that each car must bear an easily visible plate clearly showing the rated load in kilograms. The standards assume that each passenger has a mass of 75 kg and provide tables for working out the rated load based on floor area. The concept is that the lift can just accommodate the number of people of standard size

The <I>National Diet and Nutrition Survey: adults aged 19-64 years</I>, which was published in 2004, gave the average weight of a man as 87 kg and of a woman as 69 kg. Is he aware that when I surveyed five lifts in your Lordships&#146; House this morning, I discovered that when the maximum recommended number was made up of male Peers, not one of the lifts would fit into the weight standards that the Minister has enumerated?

I have slightly different figures for average weights. According to the Department of Health, in 2006 the average male weighed 83.6 kg and the average female 69.9 kg, therefore the average for adults was 76.7 kg, which is not that far away from 75 kg, which has been around for a long while. The constraint on this is not so much the assumed average of 75 kg, but the floor area provided within a lift so that if people are heavier or stouter, it should accommodate fewer people. The standard has been around for a long time and has not yet been reviewed. It applies not only to lifts but to other machinery. The floor area is the key safeguard, but there are also provisions so that if lifts are overloaded there should be mechanisms to prevent catastrophe by halting their journeys.</p>

A few weeks ago, I took the lift just beyond the Bishops&#146; Robing Room. I pressed the button, and the voice said, in a rather intimidating way, &#147;This lift is overloaded&#148;. I was the only one in it. I had not realised that I had gained so excessively in weight. Could the noble Lord very kindly advise me what to do about it?</p>

I stress, although it is a matter for the House authorities and not the Government, that the lifts in your Lordships' House are routinely inspected and that there have been very few reports of failures. Clearly, if what the noble Lord describes is happening routinely, that should be looked into and reported to the House authorities.</p>

The Government&#146;s grant in aid is to provide it with the resources for those decisions. Arts Council England is of course concerned to reward and increase the opportunities for the innovative.

However, due to raids on the lottery, the truth is that there is a huge shortfall across the sector as a whole, which is having a knock-on effect. The Government have promised a cultural festival to run in parallel with the Olympic Games, but a report published last week reveals that diversion of funds from the lottery has jeopardised the existence of the very groups which will deliver this Cultural Olympiad.

The noble Baroness is right that a plethora of institutions will provide that across the country. We are concerned that arts funding is maintained, which is why the Government have increased their level of arts funding. The Olympic Games make a demand on the lottery of a spectacularly significant kind. However, I bring it to the House&#146;s attention the fact that the Olympic Games will cost only 19 per cent of the National Lottery&#146;s disbursements.

We are in the 21st century and the rest of the world is getting on with a massive airport-building programme. Heathrow is the hub of our southern economy and, indeed, a major part of our overall economy. If we were massively to get on with base-load CO2-free electricity, which we could do by going nuclear quickly, we would offset so much carbon that we could keep flying with great joy.</p>

Is my noble friend aware of the seriousness of the situation now? Jet Airways, a rapidly growing Indian airline set up in this country, has announced&#151;it is the first announcement of this type that I have ever heard&#151;that it is now pulling out of Britain because there is no runway space available at Heathrow. If this continues, the circumstances, particularly for the Thames valley and west London, will be catastrophic. Organisations such as the <I>Sunday Times</I> and the <I>Independent</I> that are campaigning for the closure of Heathrow need to explain where the jobs are coming from. They might also stop doing irresponsible things such as giving details of how to get on to the roof of the Houses of Parliament and how to join organisations that want to do so. This is too important for Britain and too important for the Thames valley and west London.</p>

Some 200,000 jobs are dependent on the aviation sector in the United Kingdom. It is true that Heathrow is already operating at 98.5 per cent capacity, which is higher than the levels of our European rivals in Paris, Schiphol and Frankfurt.

As we know, climate change will affect those living at the margins first and foremost. That is one of the main reasons why action is so urgent. We already see the impact on fragile countries, and it is disproportionately far greater than in the United Kingdom, which so far has been relatively well cushioned.</p>

<a name="80304-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="08030459000077"></a>Developed countries have done more to produce climate change and have a greater responsibility to tackle it, but we also know that that will be difficult; the temptation will be to try to buy credits elsewhere to meet targets. So we need to ensure that we always bear in mind the impact of our actions on developing countries and on poverty reduction. We also know that we will ultimately require reductions in emissions in developing countries, or at least that those countries will need to develop in a different way so as not to increase their carbon emissions. International negotiations will need to safeguard the right to development in this circumstance. Again, we must bear in mind the necessity to address poverty reduction.</p>

<ul><a name="08030459000231"></a>&#147;from the fields of climate science and policy, economics, business and financial management&#148;.</ul>

I declare an interest as a vice-president of Tearfund, the international relief agency. I have also travelled to other parts of the world with Christian Aid. We have to recognise that there is a huge disparity in carbon emissions across the world. In the UK, it is estimated that each person emits just under 10 tonnes of carbon per year. In Bangladesh, the figure is 0.24 tonnes and in Ethiopia it is 0.067 tonnes. Apparently, the Earth can sustain just under one tonne per person of carbon going into the atmosphere. It seems to me and many involved in the field of international development that we need a much more equitable distribution of carbon emissions. International co-operation to alleviate poverty in Africa, for example, which is highly commendable, is undermined if we do not address issues of climate change. What is the point of helping Africa with aid, trade and debt relief if, with the other hand, we change the climate and ruin its harvest through the emission of extra carbon?

When we consider buying credits from other countries, it is important that we do not do so in a way that will be cheap for big business in this country but expensive for those in other countries in terms of development. That should be set out in certain guidance. We often talk about the amount of pollution that China pumps out into the atmosphere, but we would do well to remember that most of the Chinese population lives on about $1 a day. It is easy for us to say that we should get rid of all carbon credits overseas, but perhaps we should look at the more expensive option of doing it in this country, especially if it is going to affect those in developing countries.</p>

It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08030459000206"></a>&#147;Nothing in this section is to be read as restricting the matters that the Secretary of State or the Committee on Climate Change may take into account&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08030459000198"></a>We are sympathetic to the intention behind the amendment but we do not think that advising on the level of the budget is meaningful. The Committee on Climate Change advises on the level of the budget only, not on the means of bringing it about or the policies needed. The amendment would have to be targeted on what the committee is for, which would not be meaningful.</p>

<a name="80304-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="08030459000082"></a>The Government have taken a lead on tackling poverty reduction in recent years and continue to do so. The amount of foreign aid to developing countries has been redoubled. By 2010, the Government will have trebled the aid budget in real terms since 1997. We are also on course to deliver the UN gold standard of 0.7 per cent of gross national income to be spent on overseas development assistance by 2013. Along with other issues relating to international finance agreed at Gleneagles that I could list, our commitment to dealing with international poverty reduction cannot be questioned&#151;that is not to say that it will not be questioned, as the amendment seeks to imply.</p>

<a name="80304-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08030459000083"></a>The committee can take into account issues such as scientific knowledge about climate change. It is not bound by the clause itself. Although there is a list, the clause quite clearly states that the committee is able to consider any matter that it thinks appropriate, as can the Secretary of State. Now that the shadow committee is established and we know the membership of the committee, we should leave this issue, along with others that we will be debating, to members of the committee for the time being. It is right for us to offer our advice, as everyone else will, but they have considerable expertise in analysing a wide range of impacts in relation to climate change. It would not be fair to give them a role that does not fit in with their remit&#151;the invention and implementation of policies to meet the budget targets. The effect that the noble Baroness is seeking could be held to be implied already in the Bill, should the committee wish it. People will be watching this issue. Therefore, I do not believe that we should accept the amendment and I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08030459000092"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to the other amendments in this group. The amendments are designed to strengthen the Bill by recognising the need to drive the climate change policy agenda across government departments and by placing the Prime Minister and his Government centre stage in terms of accountability to Parliament.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_986"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 986</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80304-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08030459000093"></a>The amendments are refined versions of similar ones that we tabled in Committee. They would transfer from the Secretary of State to the Prime Minister the duty to report on policies for meeting the budgets and the duty to respond to the Committee on Climate Change&#146;s reports on progress. We feel that this is of fundamental importance to the functioning of the Bill and to ensuring that climate change policy is implemented with the greatest possible focus.</p>

<a name="80304-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08030459000094"></a>As I noted in Committee, climate change is a cross-departmental issue. Given the importance and sheer breadth of the issue, it is crucial to have the Prime Minister in a central position. The duties that these amendments would place on him are twofold. First, he would be required to lay the report before Parliament setting out the proposals and policies designed to meet the carbon budget. As these policies will affect nearly every government department, it is right that their announcement should come from the only person with responsibility that cuts across the board. The brief of the Secretary of State for Defra&#151;or indeed any other Secretary of State&#151;is simply not wide enough to ensure that these policies are driven across Whitehall with force sufficient to put them in the prime position in decision-making. The Minister himself knows, through his considerable ministerial experience, just how difficult that can be. His policy on public procurement of British produce by the Government and public bodies is just one example.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80304-0003.htm"/>


<a name="80304-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08030459000095"></a>The second duty is very similar. Under the Bill's current framework, the Committee on Climate Change is required to report on the progress and effectiveness of the measures. The Government are required to present their response to the committee before both Houses of Parliament. We feel most strongly that this response should be presented by the Prime Minister because it concerns how the Government are progressing as a whole in meeting their carbon budgets. We anticipate that the proposals and plans will be drawn up by government departments in consultation with the committee. However, whether these plans have been effectively driven across departments is manifestly not in the brief of the Secretary of State for Defra; only the Prime Minister has an adequate scope of responsibility and authority stretching across government.</p>

<a name="80304-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08030459000096"></a>I turn briefly to a few of the objections raised in Committee. First, on precedence, the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, usefully pointed out that certain briefs such as defence, foreign affairs and the Home Department require the Prime Minister to sign off reports. The Minister claimed that these and other prime ministerial duties were accidents of history. However, this is certainly not the case. The Prime Minister is responsible because they affect the nation as a whole. The whole of this project needs very clear leadership to achieve the necessary goals. Combating climate change is a very necessary goal.</p>

<a name="80304-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08030459000097"></a>I do not think that any Prime Minister would claim that his mandate with regard to the country&#146;s national security is accidental but we can consider other recent legislation passed by this Government that does require the Prime Minister to lay reports before  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_987"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 987</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Parliament. For example, Clause 58 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="08030459000220"></a>&#147;The Prime Minister shall lay before each House of Parliament a copy of every annual report made by the Interception of Communications Commissioner under subsection (4), together with a statement as to whether any matter has been excluded&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08030459000199"></a>Here, as in our proposals, it is quite clear that it is not the duty of the Prime Minister to write the report or to take on the entire burden of its preparation in Downing Street; he is simply responsible for laying it before Parliament. This has a very real effect. If the Prime Minister receives the report and has responsibility for laying it before Parliament, this offers strong reassurance that the importance of the proposals to combat climate change is understood at the very highest level of government. This is the most effective way to ensure that climate change is a constant echo in Cabinet and in policy meetings across the Civil Service. It would also serve to strengthen the role of the committee. By having the Prime Minister&#146;s commitment, the stature of the committee is also increased. This would be a welcome step towards cementing the climate change committee&#146;s importance in government and in the eye of the public.</p>

<a name="80304-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08030459000098"></a>The reason we offer these refinements to our amendments stems from the idea that the reports to which our previous amendments referred were of a scientific rather than a factual nature. Thus these new amendments refer to clauses that deal with the effectiveness of proposals and policies. We feel that placing the burden of presenting the reports on to the shoulder of the Prime Minister would be the best assurance that these policies and programmes are receiving the importance they deserve; namely, the highest importance. I beg to move.</p>

As was said at the previous stage, although the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, whose name is printed on the Bill&#146;s front page in respect of the human rights convention, shares Cabinet responsibility for Defra with the Secretary of State and therefore takes a lead on this issue, there is a slight problem regarding the various areas in which other departments have a say.</p>

<a name="80304-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08030459000100"></a>According to government figures in 2005, the share of carbon dioxide emissions from energy industries was 37.4 per cent, which is the responsibility of BERR&#151;then the DTI&#151;and from road transport it was 21.6 per cent, which is the Department for Transport. From other industries it was 17.8 per cent, although a vast proportion of that was from agriculture under Defra, and residential emissions were at 14.9 per cent, under the DCLG and Defra. There are other areas, such as the MoD, which will produce quite a few carbon emissions of their own. Is it really acceptable to believe that, if there is to be a turf war between departments, the Prime Minister will accept whatever is put forward by the Secretary of State for Defra?</p>

<a name="80304-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08030459000101"></a>In the amendment, we are not asking to overturn the whole remit of collective Cabinet responsibility, but we are asking the Prime Minister to lay the report before the House of Commons, which is quite a different thing. That would give a degree of satisfaction that the  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_988"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 988</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Prime Minister was happy with each of the departments&#146; recommendations and with what they were doing to meet their own commitments, not that there are differences between the different departments. That is quite important, and I believe that it will resonate very well with the country.</p>

<a name="80304-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08030459000102"></a>I was lobbied about this by a number of different people. One person who e-mailed me was particularly apt when they asked, &#147;If the Prime Minister is not prepared to do this on climate change, what is the point of a Prime Minister?&#148;. I thought that was a rather nice rhetorical question. However, we have all clearly seen this issue going up the political spectrum quite dramatically. We have just had an amendment on how this affects other departments through the Department for International Development. To say that it is going to affect each and every one of us is an understatement. I have been to a number of recent meetings where people have tried to express what a cut of 60 per cent means. It means that you are not going to be taking flights overseas on a regular basis. You are not going to be doing a lot of the things that we now take for granted, which will be difficult. It will be up to the Prime Minister to take the lead and to express to the country why we have to take those difficult positions and the basis for them. On that basis, I very much hope that the Government accept the amendment.</p>

<a name="08030459000103"></a><b><a name="80304-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08030459000658"></a>Lord Clinton-Davis:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord who opened the debate and the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, failed to understand the inevitability of other Ministers being involved. No one can deny that this is a hugely important issue; climate change inevitably assumes that role. But it is misconceived to think that other Ministers cannot be involved. They are regularly involved. It is many years since I was a Minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, but I recall very few occasions when I could make a decision, or the Secretary of State could do so, on his own. Inevitably, other Ministers have to be involved. That being the case, there can often be fierce disputes at Cabinet level; I think that the noble Baroness would agree that inevitably disputes arise between Ministers. They often do. They are finally resolved in favour of a solution that may or may not commend itself to this House; but they are resolved.</p>

<a name="80304-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08030459000104"></a>Because of that, it is quite wrong to present a situation whereby the Prime Minister had automatically to be involved in the dispute in question. Because we have had collective responsibility in the Cabinet for many, many years, the Prime Minister inevitably&#151;although I should not use that word again&#151;has had to be involved in every issue that comes before the Cabinet. The noble Lords, Lord Teverson and Lord Redesdale, are wrong in supposing that the Prime Minister can stand back. He or she does not do that. It is wrong to imagine a situation in which the Prime Minister can abdicate responsibility. It does not happen like that.</p>

I am broadly in favour of the amendment, and not only for the reasons that have been advanced; I hear the counter-arguments that there are many situations in which responsibility is distributed among departments. Here is something that is extraordinarily important. However, given the kaleidoscopic speed at which departments are reorganised, reshuffled and reapportioned, while it may be true that we can assign primary responsibility to Defra&#151;we are looking at a Bill that deals with the next 50 years&#151;it may be that in the not-too-distant future it would be better to have one department that is all about climate change. It is more likely that responsibilities will be yet more scattered than at present. For all of the reasons that have been mentioned about the present and for those reasons about the future, I am in favour of the amendment.</p>

This is probably one of the most crucial amendments that we will look at on Report. So far, noble Lords have discussed it as if devolution did not exist. We keep doing that. We must remember that things have changed and that although we talk about cross-departmental decision-making, a number of the departments concerned have been devolved. Several of the departments which have had to agree to the measure are in Scotland, where the decisions will have to come through the First Minister, who with others will have to agree the target.</p>

<a name="80304-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08030459000107"></a>We will come to that issue in Amendment No. 233, when my noble friend the Duke of Montrose and I will make a suggestion about how such agreement might be arrived at. If the Prime Minister was the person who had to report to Parliament, many of these problems would be reduced, because he is the Prime Minister of Scotland. The remit of the Secretary of State for Defra does not run in Scotland, where there is a separate department. A confusion is being concocted in the Bill, which means that it simply will not work. The Government should listen hard to this; I do not know if this amendment is the solution, but there must be one. It seems to me that, on the face of it, if the Prime Minister was the person who put the ideas forward in the House of Commons, with the agreement of the Secretary of State for Scotland in Cabinet, Defra and so on, that would help the matter, at least in terms of presentation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08030459000108"></a>I hope that the Government will listen to this, but when I mentioned this problem in another context to the noble Lord, Lord Davies, his answer showed that the Government simply had not thought about it at all. He simply said, &#147;That&#146;s devolution for you&#148;. That is not an answer. This is a real problem and the Government should think very hard about it. I support the amendment.</p>

It is important not only from the UK&#146;s point of view but in relation to prime ministerial standing and backing of this issue. If the Prime Minister is to put all his weight behind this and discuss it in international fora, it will be far better if his name is on the vital bits of paper that go before Parliament.</p>

It is very important that we do not forget the other parts of the UK besides England. If you want to get Scotland on board on this matter, it is important to have the involvement not of the Secretary of State but of the Prime Minister.</p>

We have to look at how we can achieve a coherent government message and mandate running through the delivery of the Bill. Whether that implies writing the Prime Minister into this legislation in a rather, although not completely, novel way, I have yet to be utterly convinced. However, it is incumbent on the Government to come back to this House at some stage during the passage of the Bill to explain how, if the Prime Minister is not to be written in, we can have a coherent and mandatory cross-government position for the delivery of the Bill. If my noble friend, whom I think I saw entering the House half way through the last Question, needs an example, then the Bill and its objectives are entirely contrary to the commitment to aviation expansion, as was reflected in the answers to the House during the fourth Question. Therefore, we need some coherence here. This may not be the way to do it, although it is one way of doing it. However, I hope that the Minister will at least contemplate this matter and come back with his suggestion at a later stage.</p>

If the Prime Minister is not responsible for this task, it is not at all clear that the Secretary of State for the Environment, or whatever the department will be called at the time, necessarily should be, quite apart from the very powerful points made by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord May. It is obvious that climate change involves the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Potentially huge costs are involved in anything to do with climate change, and they concern the Secretary of State for Transport, or whatever that department will be called at the time, and various other departments as well. It is not clear that the Secretary of State at Defra is the natural leader; because of the financial implications, it could just as easily be the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Therefore, the Government should seriously consider the point about the Prime Minister, not only because he is the ultimate spokesman for the Government and ultimately responsible for their policy but because this is not an issue that falls naturally into any one department. It crosses departments to a much greater degree than almost any other issue that is likely to come before Parliament.</p>

In my view, it is easy to set targets, but when delivering them involves very painful decisions that lie right across government, the chances of making progress through an individual Minister are minimal. I have not held ministerial office but I have sat at the side of many a Minister over many years and I know the realities. You cannot deliver other than with the Prime Minister&#146;s support and some inter-departmental machinery. Therefore, I say to the House that the Bill is a dead duck in terms of delivery, as opposed to setting targets, unless there is something along the lines of the amendment or some very powerful alternative.</p>

In reference to my noble friend on the Front Bench, the relevant fact is that the Prime Minister is part of this amendment. On a technical issue, when the Minister responds will he confirm that the reason why we got rid of Ministers in departments and had Secretaries of State instead was to conduct the drafting of Bills so that Secretaries of State were totally interchangeable and any Secretary of State could exercise a Secretary of State&#146;s responsibilities? In the same way, long ago, when we had capital punishment, the request for a royal pardon had to be delivered by the legal advisers of the person who had been convicted to a Secretary of State. During the Summer Recess there was always a duty Secretary of State in London who could receive such a request, as time would be important. That was at a time when there was a Secretary of State for Air and a Secretary of State for War who did not serve in the Cabinet.</p>

It is in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said at an earlier stage that the Prime Minister did not have duties in this regard. The Act says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="08030459000221"></a>&#147;The Prime Minister shall lay before each House of Parliament a copy of every annual report made by the Interception of Communications Commissioner&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08030459000200"></a>under various subsections and so on. So the Prime Minister is not writing the report or taking the full resources of the commissioner into Downing Street to comply with that, but he is responsible for laying the report before Parliament. He has that role, so there is a precedent.</p>

In earlier debates on the Bill we spoke about our anxiety that it has not attracted the great thrust of the public behind it, a public who realise how important it is in the current situation.

I do not have the answer in front of me but when I used the phrase in Committee &#147;accident of history&#148; I was referring to the fact that the Prime Minister had a role in making certain appointments as a result of accidents of history. That was the point I was making. I did not go on to delineate the appointments, but I am reminded of that having read, like most who have just spoken, the Friends of the Earth brief. That was the context in which I was speaking.</p>

<a name="80304-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08030459000119"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brooke, is quite right in what he says. Until 2005, of course, there was still a Minister of Agriculture; there was no Secretary of State. I know that was a problem from 1997 to 1999 for certain jobs that Jack Cunningham did or could not do because of the terminology. Secretaries of State are now interchangeable and that is the reason for that drafting.</p>

<a name="80304-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08030459000120"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, said that he had not held ministerial office but that he had sat at the side of Ministers. Every time he speaks I am reminded of the phrase in Gerald Kaufman&#146;s book, <I>How to be a Minister</I>, published in 1982, when he was at the Department of Trade and Industry. Amid the Post Office issue, he would send for this character, Mr Dearing, who would arrive with all his bountiful advice which was first class. Nevertheless, I move on to the dodgy part of the debate, which is trying to answer this.</p>

<a name="80304-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08030459000121"></a>One issue that has been raised was mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. I do not think that she was complaining about the fact that the media have not covered our debates, although that has been a common theme for one or two noble Lords. It is possible to take to an extreme the sentence in the briefing that noble Lords have received. It said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="08030459000222"></a>&#147;It is a fact of life that the actions of the Prime Minister are more likely to be covered by the media than the actions of a Secretary of State. These amendments are therefore likely to lead to a better informed public and so a stronger &#145;court&#146;&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08030459000201"></a>I am a mere Minister of State. It so happens that&#151;as the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, said about names on paper&#151;mine is the only name that will ever appear on the Bill. I was surprised about this a fortnight ago, simply because I had forgotten that when the Bill arrives in the other place it will not have the list of the great and the good&#151;12 of them&#151;on the back, which would normally be headed by the Prime Minister, because the Bill will be brought in from the Lords. Therefore the period before the Bill becomes an Act is the only time my name will be there. That shows that names on paper are worth nothing.</p>

<a name="80304-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08030459000124"></a>I have obviously failed to get an issue across in Committee. Do not get me wrong; I am not knocking it. A lot of points have been raised to which there has been an inadequate response. On the point of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing&#151;and, in some ways, the point of the noble Lord, Lord Tugendhat&#151;we will probably have to look again at how the machinery of government deals with climate change legislation over, say, the next couple of decades; one cannot look as far ahead as 50 years. Because the Secretary of State is interchangeable and will come and go, the machinery of government is bound to change. Departments are bound to change, as they have done even in the past few months. There must be a degree of confidence for the public&#151;and business, because of the decisions being made&#151;that there is a system in Whitehall for dealing with this; a system other than putting &#147;Prime Minister&#148; in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80304-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08030459000125"></a>Tackling climate change will require actions by future Governments and future business. We must do that in a way which does not damage us. However, there are good reasons why it is not appropriate for the duties in the Bill to be placed on the Prime Minister. I will come to the precedents. I never claimed that there were no precedents at all. There were roles for the Prime Minister, and some mentioned here today and in the brief could be held not to be on the same scale as the Climate Change Bill and matters of national security which the Prime Minister deals with on an individual basis.</p>

<a name="80304-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08030459000126"></a>The issue of the Secretary of State is very important, because of what the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, said. The Interpretation Act 1978 makes it clear that &#147;the Secretary of State&#148; means one of Her Majesty&#146;s principal Secretaries of State. That is the advantage for legislation in terms of the machinery of government. They can all act and, therefore, it may be the Secretary of State for Defra, but it could be other Secretaries of State. The Bill, as it is now, is agreed by the Scottish Executive, the Welsh Assembly Government and the Northern Ireland Administration. So, on the argument raised with me about the devolved Administrations, they agree with the Bill as drafted. As far as I know, they have not come forward during the passage of the Bill with any argument to substantially change how this part of the Bill is drafted on the basis of discussions in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

I am sure that it is true; I am not sure whether the agreement was before the last elections in Scotland or not, but it has been agreed by the Scots Ministers. The question is how it will operate once it comes into action. How is agreement going to be got between the Scots Parliament and whichever department does this? That is nothing to do with the fact that the Bill has been agreed; we know that. My noble friend Lord Caithness put his finger on it: he said that if Scotland is to be carried with this, it is the politics of the matter. If the Scots Parliament with

It is just a source of trouble. We are talking about the process of putting the Bill into action, not the Bill itself.</p>

Since devolution, they apply across the piece where there are issues relating to the devolved Administration and the Government at Westminster. The Bill was introduced following the gracious Speech last year, and the Scottish Executive was elected, I think, in the summer of last year. As far as I know, the current Administration have agreed the Bill. I am not putting words in their mouth in that sense. One or two noble Lords have touched on the issue of collective responsibility. The Government work together. My experience in the past 11 years is that no major decision gets promulgated&#151;I sometimes think it is no minor decision&#151;unless No. 10 has agreed it. That is the way the machinery of government operates. The idea that the Prime Minister is divorced from these issues of Statements and reports to Parliament on a range of issues across government is nonsense. The fact that his name does not appear in the legislation relating to other departments and activities does not mean that he is not involved in what is going on and is not discussing things with Ministers during the decision-making process well before decisions are made. He is.</p>

We would like to have Royal Assent before the summer so that the climate change committee can get on with its work. The time this Bill spends in your Lordships&#146; House is fine as we wish to send it to the other place with as few problems in it as possible. That may be a problem&#151;I do not know&#151;but the decision is for your Lordships&#146; House, not for me or the Government. I want to assure the House that mechanisms exist in the machinery of government to ensure that people across government, including the Prime Minister, are involved in these decisions. The Cabinet takes responsibility for the Government&#146;s climate change policies and objectives. It is done at the central level and that permeates throughout government to junior Ministers and civil servants who serve the Government. A sub-committee dedicated to the environment and energy issues is chaired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Tugendhat, made the point that financial issues could come to the fore for many years of this policy initiative&#151;and the members of the committee include the Secretaries of State responsible for the environment, energy, transport,

The committee has the Prime Minister&#146;s authority to take collective decisions in this area, and if members of that committee cannot agree&#151;as noble Lords who have been in government will know well&#151;it will go to Cabinet and into the machinery at the centre of government.</p>

<a name="80304-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08030459000131"></a>I am not putting this up to knock it down, but nobody is claiming that the Prime Minister can take on meaningful duties and responsibilities on a daily basis for every policy across government. That is not the issue being raised. The point is that he delegates to Secretaries of State. Secretaries of State can come and go at the behest of the Prime Minister. That is a fundamental part of how the Government function. I fall back only slightly on the fact that No. 10 is not a large department; No. 10 has the facility to use the departments of state if it so wishes; so I will not use the argument that I used in Committee, because I was not happy about it at the time.</p>

<a name="80304-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08030459000132"></a>The precedents that have been raised are important. Some may remember that I was still in the other place at the time of the passage of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. I remember some of the debates in the other place, both in the House and in party meetings. The Prime Minister has a role in that legislation&#151;there is no doubt about that&#151;but he does not write the reports himself. There is an argument for not having the same model here. There are three important and independent bodies with national security roles that carry out supervisory functions, including writing reports. Those reports are laid before Parliament by the Prime Minister. They are those of the Interception Commissioner, the Chief Surveillance Commissioner and the Intelligence Services Commissioner. All related ministerial powers and functions are exercised personally at the Secretary of State level, as people well know, especially in this place, which is full of former Home Secretaries and Foreign Secretaries.</p>

<a name="80304-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08030459000133"></a>The reason that the reports are laid before Parliament by the Prime Minister is that he has traditionally taken an overarching responsibility for national security, the No. 1 issue for the people of this country. They look to the Government to keep them secure. That is national security in its traditional, narrowly defined sense, and the Prime Minister has a role. The term &#147;national security&#148; might be more broadly used in certain circumstances to include defence and foreign affairs, but that is not the case in legislation. That is the point: we are making legislation.</p>

<a name="80304-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08030459000134"></a>The courts have generally taken a narrow view, applying the term to fast-moving, specific situations that affect the nation as a whole. For example, banking is not viewed as an issue relating to national security; but an individual, large-scale forgery with potential to undermine confidence in banknotes could represent a threat to national security. So there are variations. Another pragmatic way in which the narrower term can be tested against the policy is whether the Security Service will be the lead organisation in dealing with it. If not, it is not generally regarded as an issue of national security.</p>

<a name="80304-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08030459000135"></a>Although we acknowledge that climate change is a serious, long-term global threat&#151;no one is arguing  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_996"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 996</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>against that; it goes right across government and will affect how we will work and live as individuals in this country; it is incredibly important&#151;it is difficult to see how it could be defined as national security in the legislative sense where the Prime Minister gets involved, as in the examples that I have given. The effects of climate change are unlikely to result in a sudden risk to the security of the entire nation. We can have severe weather events, but they have not resulted in catastrophe in that sense, and it is difficult to attribute individual events to climate change.</p>

<a name="80304-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08030459000136"></a>People have mentioned that Defra is a relatively small department compared to some of the large departments of state. The implication is that it does not make sense to have the Defra Secretary of State in the lead. It may not always be like that, but allocating responsibility for sectoral emissions to certain Whitehall departments is very complex, as those who have worked in Whitehall know. We simply do not recognise the idea that Defra is therefore responsible for only a small part of our efforts to tackle climate change. We have responsibility for a large number of policy measures for reducing emissions. For instance, the department leads policy on the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, which caps about half of the United Kingdom's emissions and will shortly include aviation emissions. Defra leads on climate change agreements; the new carbon reduction commitment for business, with lower emissions intensity; and the carbon emission reduction target for energy suppliers, which will replace the energy efficiency commitment from 2008. There is direct responsibility for Defra, but no one is arguing that one department does it all. I am piloting the Bill through the House as the Defra Minister acting on behalf of my ministerial colleagues, but I am also doing it on behalf of the Government. All the other departments are signed up to the Bill. When I have been able to respond to some of the debates that have clearly gone beyond Defra, answers have come back not only from the Treasury but from other departments as well. This is a government Bill and a government-wide view. There is no reason why the Prime Minister should be written into the legislation in the way that has been suggested, and the precedents that have been given do not hold up the case. I therefore hope that the noble Lord will not press the amendment to a vote.</p>

When he referred to the dodgy part, I think he spoke the truth about his argument. Noble Lords&#146; widespread support for the amendments during this full and useful debate shows that there is a feeling that this limited but key role should be in the hands of the Prime Minister.

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08030459000158"></a>We listened to the Minister&#146;s response to the debate in Committee. We accept that this is not an easy area and that the Bill should approach the shipping and aviation industries in different ways. Our amendments would include aviation immediately but delay the inclusion of international shipping for three years. We accept that shipping is a particularly difficult area on which to make calculations. There needs to be a thorough review&#151;we hope within an international context but, ultimately, if it comes to it, not necessarily so&#151;to ensure that we get the shipping figures right. That is why the amendments propose delaying the inclusion of shipping for three years.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1001"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1001</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80304-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08030459000159"></a>Shipping, although less important in terms of growth and size than the aviation industry, is still a major area of emissions internationally. Given that the United Kingdom is one of the world&#146;s great trading nations, we cannot leave that sector out indefinitely. However, the Bill does exactly that; there is no time limit, as we see it, for when international shipping has to be included. We hope that transport and trade will increase thanks to globalisation, but carbon emissions have to be taken into account so that the shipping sector also feels the pressure on its carbon efficiency in the way in which it operates worldwide.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80304-0005.htm"/>


<a name="80304-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08030459000160"></a>The aviation industry is much more important and cannot be ignored in terms of fast and urgent implementation of the Bill. Why is that? In the UK context, transport is the fastest-growing area of carbon emissions. If we take transport generally out of our calculations, the United Kingdom has a good record on CO2 reduction despite GDP growth. It is in transport that emissions have grown over the past few years and, within that sector, aviation has grown even more substantially. It is therefore the most challenging of sectors, which we must include from the beginning in government attention and recording in the UK net carbon account.</p>

<a name="80304-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08030459000161"></a>Although internationally aviation counts for only some 2 per cent of emissions, it is, even internationally, one of the highest-growth sectors&#151;something like 5 per cent per annum. Let me put that into context. One transatlantic flight from Heathrow to the United States means an extra 160 tonnes of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Worldwide some 130 million tonnes of fuel are used by the aviation industry per annum and each day there are some 85,000 commercial flights. I go through those statistics because this area cannot be ignored.</p>

<a name="80304-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08030459000162"></a>The Government rightly see the control and targeting of greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide in particular, as key to climate change and as something that we should lead on. Therefore, for the sake of the authority of the Bill, both internationally and within the United Kingdom, we cannot leave out the carbon emissions source that has more growth than any other. How can we have a climate change Bill that does not immediately recognise growth in emissions in its largest-growing sector? To me, that takes away the integrity of the Bill, not just in a national but in an international context.</p>

<a name="80304-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08030459000163"></a>The Minister went through international standards at some length, saying that there was not yet a method of apportioning these national emissions as international ones. It is often mentioned that the EU Emissions Trading Scheme will almost certainly, subject to agreement within Europe, come into play in 2011-12. Therefore, why should we not leave it until then? I answer strongly that the reports on climate change, such as those from the IPCC and the Stern review, all say that action is most important in the short term. The longer we leave areas to be managed, controlled or monitored, the more difficult it will be to make up that time later. That is why leaving the highest-growth sector on the back burner for another four or five years is not acceptable.</p>

I welcome also the commitments of the various American presidential candidates to move towards emission control systems. However, including aviation emissions in the Bill from day one would in no way prejudice that.</p>

<a name="80304-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08030459000166"></a>Perhaps I may illustrate why that is the case in terms of Europe. We hope that the EU Emissions Trading Scheme will apply to aviation in 2011-12. In the agreements announced by the Commission last month, the aviation sector is not distributed entirely among member states; the international airline industry is treated almost as a 28th member state of the EU in terms of emissions. Therefore, however that solution is worked out in Europe, it does not help us to solve this issue for the Bill in this country.</p>

<a name="80304-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08030459000167"></a>The UK already notifies international organisations of shadow figures for international aviation emissions based on bunkering. That may not be perfect&#151;no system is&#151;but, at some point, we have to make a choice. I see no merit in making a choice in 2012 as opposed to making a choice now. A decision taken then will be no more perfect than one taken now. In the mean time, we have an industry that is vital to the world&#146;s economy but which also has a vital part to play in reducing emissions and the threat to the climate. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08030459000170"></a>The complaint of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, is that aviation&#146;s emissions are growing by 5 per cent. We are talking about a growth of 5 per cent in 2 per cent of global emissions at the present time. If my arithmetic is correct, that is 0.1 per cent. I suspect that a growth of 0.1 per cent in global terms from all emissions is rather less than we achieve from, for instance, our road transport industry. I hold no brief for the transport industries in making that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08030459000171"></a>Third-world countries in particular are heavily dependent on income from perishables, which only they can produce economically and with few carbon emissions. If we were to try to produce those goods here, unless we used waste heat from power stations, we would be using fossil fuel to heat greenhouses. Third-world countries are also dependent on the tourist industry. Those industries are transport-based.

That is my first point. In the context of aviation, we are talking about a very small sum indeed in relation to the total global problem.</p>

<a name="80304-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08030459000172"></a>Secondly, in the case of aviation and, to a large degree, shipping, no alternative fuel is available. Technology can take us completely out of fossil fuels for road transport. That may seem like a daydream, but the technology already exists, provided&#151;this is the proviso&#151;that we change the way in which we source our energy. The technologies exist to make that possible as well. I have grave doubts about closing down a large and significant aspect of the global transport system, or making it more difficult or more expensive, when we need it in order to do a great deal of good in the world. We can change everything else, and that is where we should be focusing our efforts.</p>

That is narrowly what this is about. It is not about whether aviation should or should not be included in emissions trading or should or should not be capped. That is a red herring for the purposes of this debate. The narrow question raised by the amendment is whether it is possible, meaningful and useful to include in the Committee on Climate Change&#146;s first five-year target for carbon emissions aviation emissions that in some sense belong to the UK. I will address simply that point.</p>

<a name="80304-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08030459000174"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, acknowledged when he gave an example of how he would include aviation that it is exceptionally difficult&#151;indeed, meaningless and I would say impossible&#151;to designate emissions from international aviation as belonging to the UK as opposed to Europe, for example, and it would be extremely dangerous to do so. In due course, the Committee on Climate Change and the Government will have to decide how meaningfully to include aviation emissions in the UK targets&#151;not to aim to limit them. As I understand it, there is no disagreement among any of the parties in this House, or on the Cross Benches or in Europe, that international aviation needs to come under controls and that that would best be done with international agreements starting with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>

<a name="80304-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08030459000175"></a>Therefore, if the Bill is to be amended to insist that the Committee on Climate Change produces some meaningful targets for international aviation for the UK, we have to be convinced that it is possible for it to do so. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said that we produce figures now based on bunkering what fuel is put on to aeroplanes. He knows as well as I do that that does not in any meaningful sense represent the emissions arising from international aviation from flights into and out of the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08030459000176"></a>I respectfully suggest that the amendments would put the climate change committee, and the Government in responding to it, in a hopeless position. They could not come up with a meaningful figure that would be operational in any sense and on which action could be taken. As I said in Committee, putting sectors and emissions into targets must imply that somewhere along the line you are capable of taking actions to meet those targets. Noble Lords on all Benches know that aviation emissions need to be tackled but they are best tackled across the whole of Europe through the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. As a country we will never take action outside the EU Emissions Trading Scheme because, quite apart from anything else, that would be illegal; you could not do it. You would not be allowed to do it. Airlines would simply go to the European Court of Justice. Therefore, I respectfully suggest that to expect the committee in its very first year to produce figures that are both meaningless and completely incapable of being acted on is not a sensible way to proceed.</p>

This amendment is somewhat illusory. We cannot possibly resolve this issue on our own, nor can Europe. Europe can certainly take ameliorative action, and is doing so, with the support of most of the European airlines and of the unions, particularly my own, the British Airline Pilots Association. But to think that we can isolate ourselves and take ameliorative action on our own is pie in the sky; it will not happen. By their very nature international aviation and shipping&#151;shipping is far more difficult to resolve in this regard than aviation&#151;are susceptible only to an international solution. As I say, aviation is much more likely to achieve this action than shipping.</p>

<a name="80304-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08030459000178"></a>I am enormously encouraged by the fact that the new Australian Government have resolved to embrace an international solution. As I said in an intervention, all the major candidates in America also support that view. So we are left with the difficulty of India and China in particular. At present, they resist the conclusion that there ought to be an international solution but they are much more likely to come on board if America chooses to do so. Therefore, we are much closer to a positive situation than we have ever been. I am not saying that it will be easy to arrive at a solution but there can be no doubt that we are much closer to one than we have ever been before.</p>

<a name="80304-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08030459000181"></a>I worry that the Liberal Democrats in the other House might fall into the same trap unless they are alerted to the fact that there is a danger in going down this route. There may well be good politics in this, and there may be many a leaflet that can be circulated by Liberal activists around the country, which will inevitably happen, which will accuse the Government of not responding to the debate in the way that the environmental groups demand or require. The leaflets are not really going to deal with the central issue in this debate, which is the mechanism for delivery. We are now confronted, as my noble friend on the Front Bench will know, with amendments that we will debate later&#151;including my Amendments Nos. 175 and 176 and a number of amendments tabled by the Conservative Front Bench which I completely support&#151;that deal with mechanisms.

The argument about 60/80 will be dealt with by the climate change committee. The argument over aviation will be dealt with in 2012 under the European arrangements, and it will obviously be dealt with in the climate change committee. The noble Lord is defusing the need for the committee to feel that it has responsibility for these important areas. I appeal to the noble Lord, even at this late stage of the Bill, to perhaps reconsider the whole strategy that the Liberal Democrats are adopting in these debates.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, will appreciate that when my noble friend Lord Teverson and I sat on the Joint Committee on the Draft Climate Change Bill and heard all the evidence, we did not do so as Liberal Democrats but as members of that committee. Although we are now here on these Benches in a political form, all the evidence that we heard on the target that he has mentioned, with which we have already dealt, was that it should be 80 per cent. When we heard evidence on, for example, aviation, one of the things that most surprised me was how open the aviation industry was to some of these things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08030459000188"></a>Far from being political, we are reacting to the evidence that we heard.

In 20 years&#146; time, I do not want someone on television saying, &#147;Well, I&#146;m sorry, we were not interested in that recommendation; it was just a decision taken by Parliament&#151;a bunch of amateurs&#148;. I want people in 20 years&#146; time to say, &#147;We have to accept decisions taken 20 years ago in the climate change committee, because they were based on science&#148;. In my view the committee should take the decisions, but the Bill currently refers to advice. &#147;They were based on advice taken as a result of scientific work and research done by the Committee on Climate Change&#148;. The noble Baroness wants politicians to take the decisions; I want the scientists to recommend or, indeed, decide. That is the distinction.</p>

Will it make the EU Emissions Trading Scheme happen quicker, or will it make it more complicated to achieve? I do not think that anyone doubts&#151;the aviation industry recognises this&#151;that international air travel has to be brought into account. However, as the Minister reminded us in Committee, it is not helpful to have unilateral action, which in some ways confuses the issue and does not in any way help us to quantify the amount that has to be attributed in the UK account to international air travel.</p>

<a name="80304-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08030459000191"></a>The issue that ultimately has to be addressed is how to change people&#146;s personal lifestyles. Most of those who travel internationally, particularly on long haul, have to recognise that perhaps 25 per cent of

That is a stark difference from 2 per cent, which is the overall figure, because so few people travel internationally. So if you asked the simple question, &#147;Does this Liberal Democrat amendment advance and help the cause of having not just effective EU emission trading schemes sooner rather than later but action by other international agencies, which work at an even slower speed on these issues?&#148;, the answer emphatically is that it will not. Therefore the amendment is not going to help us. The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, says that we are here to debate these issues. Actually, we are here to improve the Bill, and that is quite different.</p>

We have no qualms about the intention underlying the Liberal Democrat amendments. However, on reflection, there may be a better way of going about it. Thus, we will speak on our way of addressing the problem&#151;placing a duty to regulate, based on international trade and transport&#151;in the next group of amendments.</p>

Therefore, I shall not prejudge Amendment No. 65. Indeed, if Amendment No. 64 is carried, we will not have the opportunity to debate Amendment No. 65. Nevertheless, there are issues that are covered by both groups. One of our best debates in Committee was on this issue. It lasted for a couple of hours. It was probably the longest debate we had on any of these issues. My noble friend Lord Bassam of Brighton, as the transport spokesman in this House, arranged a subsequent meeting so that noble Lords could discuss the issue. That turned out to be useful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08030464000002"></a>The Government agree completely that these are important issues&#151;no one is arguing otherwise&#151;and it is essential that the right decisions are taken based on a proper analysis and the best evidence base. That is why, in response to our previous debate, the Government have now brought forward Amendments Nos. 118 to 120, which would give both Parliament and the Committee on Climate Change a greater role in decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08030464000003"></a>I recognise that this group of amendments treats international aviation and shipping emissions differently, as the noble Lord said. I agree that the question of shipping emissions is particularly complex, and it is therefore very likely that we will need to approach international aviation and shipping differently under the Bill. However, I reassure your Lordships that the Bill as it stands does just that. It allows us, if necessary, to include either international aviation or international shipping emissions in our targets ahead of the other.</p>

We are working hard, in the International Civil Aviation Organisation and through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Bali action plan, to find a global solution, and we are already taking action in Europe. We strongly welcome the recent unanimous political agreement to include aviation emissions in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>

<a name="80304-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08030464000005"></a>Although the details are not yet finalised, including aviation within the EU Emissions Trading Scheme will mean that aviation emissions from 2012 are capped, that this cap is set at the average of 2004-06 levels, and that any growth in emissions above this cap all the way to 2020 will need to be compensated by emission reductions elsewhere within the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The current proposal is that this will apply not just to all flights between the 27 member states but also to all flights which arrive in or leave the EU. On that basis, the scheme will save 183 million tonnes of carbon dioxide&#151;roughly equivalent to the CO2 emissions for the Netherlands in 2004. This is a significant step forward, and I am sure that noble Lords agree that whatever we do under the Bill has to be consistent with the wider European and international framework.</p>

<a name="80304-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08030464000006"></a>As I think has been recognised during our previous debates on these issues, there are real practical difficulties here. That is why we think that we need expert advice from the independent Committee on Climate Change before we take decisions. I do not want to be overly critical of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, but when he introduced the amendment I did not hear him mention the mechanism for addressing these practical difficulties.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80304-0006.htm"/>


<a name="80304-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08030464000007"></a>As I said, this is a difficult and complex issue, and that is why we think that the Committee on Climate Change should address it. We will ask the committee, as part of its first task, to advise us straightaway on the impact of including these emissions in our 2050 target. It is also why, once the EU Emissions Trading Scheme rules are agreed, we will ask the committee for its detailed advice on a methodology for including international aviation emissions in our targets. We need to know whether there is a methodology which works and which is compatible with both the EU ETS rules and the wider international context, and what the impact of adopting it would be. Again, these are not straightforward questions, and that is why we believe the best approach is to wait for the committee&#146;s advice.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08030464000008"></a>That is also why the Government have tabled Amendment No. 120, which we will come to later. This amendment provides that, before making regulations to include international aviation or international shipping emissions, the Secretary of State must seek, and take account of, advice from the Committee on Climate Change. We think that this is the best way forward. If we were to include international aviation emissions in our targets immediately, as proposed by Amendment No. 117, how would that work in practice? For example, how would the UK&#146;s share of international aviation emissions be identified? Would it be on the basis of the fuel sold within the UK? If so, what would be the risk of perverse impacts, such as planes filling up elsewhere and flying here with a heavier fuel load, which could  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1009"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1009</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>increase emissions, or transfer traffic simply diverting from Heathrow to Amsterdam or Paris, with no environmental benefits whatever? These are practical issues. If we go unilaterally, it is no good us complaining if other countries take commercial advantage of us, as would be the case.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08030464000009"></a>How would this fit with aviation&#146;s inclusion in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, which we expect to start in 2012, and which will probably allocate emissions on a different basis? Would we have two systems running alongside each other? Or would we need to change systems almost as soon as started? This is not really the best approach to regulation on such an important issue. In addition, what would be the implications for the international negotiations if the UK decided unilaterally on a particular way of dividing emissions between countries? How would we avoid undermining our efforts to reach a global deal on this, bearing in mind that we all agree a global deal is required? Across the negotiating table we would be challenged that we had already done it: &#147;You have chosen your own way; why are you here trying to do a deal with us?&#148;. It does not make practical sense.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08030464000010"></a>These are important, practical, questions. I do not say that the Government have all the answers, but we ought to pose questions that were not posed in the moving of the amendments, and then ask the Committee on Climate Change to agree to provide advice on this before we decide whether to include these emissions. We therefore do not think that the approach taken in the amendment is the right one.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08030464000011"></a>The Liberal Democrat amendments would require the Secretary of State to define international shipping emissions within three years of Royal Assent. On the other hand, the amendments that we shall come to on this issue set a deadline of action under Clause 25, although I recognise that they take a different approach. However, our concern with the deadlines in these amendments, or indeed any arbitrary deadline, is precisely that&#151;that they are arbitrary. We ought to look at the matter in the round. The Government have made it clear that they are determined to find a comprehensive solution in these sectors and we are pressing internationally to do so. That is the forum in which we have to get the decisions taken. Why create an artificial constraint? That would be the effect of approving these amendments.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08030464000012"></a>Negotiations in these areas are incredibly sensitive and the possibility of reaching agreement sometimes hangs by a thread. It will make the negotiations which frequently take place&#151;I am pleased to say I am not too involved in them, but I get involved&#151;on the common agricultural policy among 27 countries look like peace on earth. These will be incredibly sensitive and we will be causing ourselves major problems if we put these amendments in the Bill and tie our hands. We must retain flexibility. To include the emissions in the European and international contexts is right and we are working hard to come to that kind of agreement on an international basis. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the noble Lord does not press this amendment.</p>

Work in the past couple of weeks has reappraised that and suggests what many have long suspected: that shipping may be twice the volume. Recognising that these are the early stages of a journey in five-year steps to 2050, is the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, satisfied that the Bill, as we are framing it, has flexibility so that we can deal with these things as and when both the international system and the greater knowledge and wisdom about how to include them make it possible?</p>

I saw the report of the work to which he has referred a couple of weeks ago. I think in Committee I gave some information about shipping which made it almost impossible for us to do the measurements at present. We cannot get an agreed methodology. The historic figures for UK shipping, based on the amount of fuel sold within the UK, demonstrate no discernible trend, which makes it very difficult for us to forecast future emissions as there is no evidence on which to base the forecast.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08030464000015"></a>Nevertheless, the nature of much of the international shipping industry is global and highly mobile and it operates without the need for permanent or continuous association with individual nation states. There is no agreed international methodology for attributing international shipping emissions to individual countries. A number of issues must be addressed before any methodology could be accepted, such as how to deal with the risk that vessels simply reflag to different countries or buy fuel at alternative locations; the lack of information about fuel efficiency of individual vessels or historic trade statistics; and the difficulties of calculating average emissions for a wide variety of vessels and engine types.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08030464000016"></a>We are taking steps, as I said in Committee, to address these issues through the International Maritime Organisation, but we are not there yet. When we have done that, we will be in a position genuinely to ask the Committee on Climate Change to make some kind of assessment. So the answer to my noble friend is yes. The Bill will facilitate it and does not stop us doing that. We are currently working on that at an international level. Therefore, to get the information and an agreed international methodology to put to the climate change committee is vitally important.</p>

The International Maritime Organisation, which is responsible for all regulations regarding international shipping, has been urgently looking into the question of ship emissions. I spoke to the secretary-general last week, who told me that the

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08030464000018"></a>I also remind the noble Lord, Lord May, that, although shipping may on the face of it be responsible for large amounts of emissions, he should remember that the vast bulk of international trade goes by sea. In fact, shipping per tonne mile is way more efficient than both lorries and aviation.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08030464000020"></a>I was particularly surprised at the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. Strangely enough, we tabled these amendments because we believe in them. As my noble friend Lady Miller said&#151;I do not want to spend too much time on targets&#151;it was the Government who put a target in the Bill, not us. All the evidence is that they have the wrong target in the Bill, so we thought that it might be a good idea if we put what is likely to be the best target in the Bill. That seems remarkably straightforward to me.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08030464000021"></a>Strangely enough, we believe that aviation is an important industry. It is also growing and has significant carbon emissions. We therefore have a number of choices. Do we&#151;as I got the impression that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, suggested&#151;ignore it and get on with the rest that we can absolutely define? That is not the right thing to do, because this is an important sector. Do we, as the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, said, say that including aviation will not do anything about the future and we should therefore not do so? Well, if that is true for aviation, it is true for every other sector covered by the Bill. Aviation is no different.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08030464000022"></a>Perhaps the only two reasons requiring more explanation are, first, whether we can measure it and, secondly, as the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, said, whether it affects the EU ETS and international trading. On the first, the EU ETS will not help us in our national definitions. It will not allocate UK aviation emissions. When we get to 2012, this problem will not be solved. It will not be any easier. Therefore, on the basis that it is better to act now than in the future when the problem of climate change becomes worse, the answer is surely to act now rather than five years later. Why procrastinate?</p>

<p><a name="st_112"></a>

<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="08030464000024"></a><b><a name="80304-0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08030464000695"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> My Lords, that question shows the misunderstanding of the amendment. It is about measurement. If we started an emissions trading scheme that applied to UK aviation only, I would back the noble Lord in rejecting it. As he said, all the Bill does is provide a mechanism. That mechanism is measurement; the Bill does not include any element of policy or implementation of policy. Measuring these emissions has zero effect on what happens, as in every other sector of the economy. Measuring is followed  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1012"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1012</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by government policy. It is clear that we might as well include it now as later. The mechanism for measurement will be no more straightforward or easy in the future than it is now. The EU is not going to provide us with a method of calculating UK international aviation emissions. It does not do that. International aviation emissions are separately treated outside member states in the post-2012 regime put forward by the Commission and endorsed by the Council of Ministers.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08030464000025"></a>Aviation is important. Let us get on with it now. I regret that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, cannot follow our approach. He made strong speeches at Second Reading, but I understand that he wants to approach this matter in a different way. I think this is fundamental to the Bill; otherwise we leave out a sector that needs to be in from the beginning. I recognise that the Government had the sector in the Bill from the beginning but that it would come in at a later date; do not believe that is good enough. I believe we need to act now. Therefore, I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

I hope that noble Lords will understand that the amendments seek to introduce a new idea on this vexed topic. I recognised in the previous debate the earnestness of the views expressed and noble Lords&#146; desire to seek a solution. I hope that the House can find such a solution in these amendments.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08030464000031"></a>Our amendments would provide a framework for the inclusion of emissions from international trade, travel and transport, but in a way that would get around some of the problems to which the Minister referred in the debate on the previous amendments. They are also designed to address the problems arising from the vocabulary of the debate&#151;the serious and possibly detrimental policy implications of just talking about aviation on the one hand and shipping on the other. Our proposal switches the focus to transport more generally. It addresses it in a broad and general fashion and, by doing so, provides a way in which the least carbon-intensive method of moving goods or people to and from the UK will be favoured.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08030464000032"></a>First let me explain the necessity of addressing this problem. Although the problem was to some degree covered in the previous debate and although, as the Minister recounted, we had a good and thorough debate on it in Committee, it is too serious for me not to reiterate the issues briefly. Not having a provision for the emissions caused by trade and transport is unjustifiable. If there is to be progress towards addressing climate change, these emissions need to be counted. The analogy constantly and aptly used is that it is like going on a diet but not counting the chocolate. To ignore trade and transport emissions is to ignore climate change.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08030464000033"></a>I know that the Bill has provisions to enable the Secretary of State to make regulations on aviation and shipping, but there is no duty for him so to do. Simply waiting around until the EU proposes a way of solving the problem or forces the UK to address it is, frankly, a bad way of governing. We appreciate that a lot of the regulation will require international co-operation and will depend on international agreements; that is the nature of the beast. However, if we truly intend to take a lead on climate change, we need to take a lead on addressing some of its biggest contributors. Therefore, our amendment would place a more positive duty: we specify that the Secretary of State must address these emissions in a five-year timeframe.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08030464000034"></a>On the essential difference between our amendment, which refers to goods and passenger travel, and the formulation in the Bill&#151;namely, aviation and shipping&#151;the problem with discussing emissions from trade and  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1015"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1015</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>transport solely in terms of aviation and shipping is that that runs the risk of placing a disincentive on shipping, which is a relatively carbon-efficient method of transport in terms of tonnage. The emissions caused by air travel are relatively easy to count by using bunker fuels in the country of origin or in the country where the airline company is registered. Indeed, we record much of that information already. Shipping is much trickier to regulate, especially as goods brought into the country by ship might have taken a variety of routes before being loaded on to a ship or small boat and being brought into the UK.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08030464000035"></a>When discussing transport emissions, we need to be careful not to exclude other carbon-intensive modes of transport, such as haulage by truck, which have a direct bearing on our imports and the shipping industry. For example, if shipping becomes heavily regulated, there might be an incentive to have ships dock at Rotterdam or, worse, Istanbul, and then to drive across the Continent and into this country via the Channel Tunnel. The Minister has referred to the problems that might arise from such a transposition of trade. Conversely, if the regulations on shipping are not sophisticated enough or concern shipping without any regard to the entire carbon footprint of the transport of goods, it might prove economical to have goods driven across much larger stretches of land and then simply loaded on to ferries to make the Channel crossing, when a large ship could have delivered the goods to England with a fraction of the carbon footprint.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08030464000036"></a>These amendments go to the heart of the problem by addressing the purpose of shipping and aviation, as well as of transport more widely&#151;moving goods and people to and from the United Kingdom. By expanding our view of transport, we stand a better chance of having regulation that addresses the problem systematically instead of including certain bits and not others, which may in the end create greater confusion and contribute to global warming more substantially than was originally intended.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08030464000037"></a>Let us consider the other more minor but still important emissions that are excluded from the Bill as it stands and which would still be excluded if we spoke only in terms of aviation and shipping. Ferries carrying passengers to France, the Netherlands and Ireland would have to be included under our scheme, as would international rail travel. The purpose is to provide a framework within which regulation can be made that will provide incentives to use the least carbon-intensive method of moving goods and people while ensuring that the entire scope of the problem is taken into account.</p>

<a name="80304-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08030464000038"></a>That might sound daunting or idealistic, but I am assured that there are potential mechanisms for addressing the issues that I have outlined. I do not pretend that it will be easy, but I have been assured by maritime experts that it is possible. At the moment we have the T1(L) form, which is mandatory for every piece of freight coming in from outside the EU and which accounts for the entire journey and method of transport used at each stage, for tax and duty purposes; within the EU, CMR forms are regularly used. The T1(L) form could be amended to take

Our amendments do not propose specific policies and I mention this only as an example to noble Lords to show that our amendments are not pie in the sky but have a basis in sound policies.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80304-0007.htm"/>


<a name="80304-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08030464000039"></a>The amendments would place a specific duty on the Secretary of State to make regulations within five years&#151;essentially for the next budget period. We have proposed this timeframe for two reasons. First, we want to ensure that it is done. At the moment the words &#147;may make ... regulation&#148; are too weak and we want assurances that it will happen. We simply cannot accept the argument that any Secretary of State would be foolish not to address these issues. This needs to be a firm duty in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08030464000040"></a>The second reason for the timeframe is that, while five years may seem a long period to some, it may be a short one for those who have to make regulation. We feel that five years is an adequate period for the development of a robust mechanism for counting trade and transport emissions. It means that these emissions would fit in neatly with the secondary budgetary period. It would also allow adequate time for international negotiations and ensure that our hands were not tied during talks on the new EU ETS and Kyoto. The period is still lengthy, but we would rather have a robust and effective mechanism than a rushed one that needed to be scrapped because it was ill conceived or because international agreements changed.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08030464000041"></a>We hope very much that the first budget period will be set in such a way that it takes into account the fact that the biggest contributors to climate change are not being counted. We feel that this approach is the most sophisticated and effective way of ensuring that we count all the important contributors to climate change, including international transport and the movement of people.

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08030464000043"></a>It is important that we include in the Bill international movements of people and freight, however that is described or defined, and that this has to happen within a timescale. We need to make sure that there is a duty on the Secretary of State to introduce whatever system is decided upon rather than the matter being left open-ended until some point in the future.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08030464000044"></a>When I first read the amendment, I thought it contained more than the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, described. I thought it was far more revolutionary and contained something I could welcome even more: that within the UK carbon footprint we would include the carbon footprint of all imports and take off everything that we export. In that way, we would have a carbon footprint that related to UK consumption or gross national income. That would be a very advanced concept but it would get around the problems of outsourcing. The United Kingdom and much of Europe have met their Kyoto targets so far purely by delegating manufacturing to China and other parts of the Far East.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08030464000045"></a>The amendment is not aimed at that. I understand what the noble Lord is trying to get at with the amendment and it is better than the Bill as it stands. There are potential issues around it but, if it was passed, we could perhaps resolve them in the future.</p>

<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="08030464000046"></a><b><a name="80304-0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08030464000698"></a>Lord Greenway:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said &#147;if shipping becomes heavily regulated&#148;; I can assure him that shipping is already heavily regulated and becomes more so by the week. What I cannot understand about the amendment is that international aviation and shipping includes the movement of passengers by sea and air, so I cannot see any great difference between this and the previous amendment.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08030464000047"></a>The problem with Europe, which has been mentioned, is that shipping is very much an international business. Any moves made locally in local areas are bound to complicate the international situation. I have worked on and off for many years for the Port of Los Angeles in California. Los Angeles and its neighbouring port, Long Beach, are in the vanguard of trying to cut down emissions connected with the ports and all traffic movements in and out of them.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08030464000048"></a>As I said in Committee, they have started a system whereby ships plug into shore power when they are in port. This is fine where shore power is provided mainly by nuclear or hydroelectric sources. Obviously, if the power is provided by coal-fired power stations it does not help very much. They also recently tried to bring in a local regulation whereby ships have to reduce their sulphur emissions within 15 miles of the port. That regulation was thrown out on appeal, with a higher court saying that that was the responsibility of the Federal Government and that local people should not be doing this kind of thing.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08030464000049"></a>That brings me back to what I was saying about shipping being an international business. As I said on the earlier amendment, the International Maritime Organisation is looking with some urgency at this problem. There is no one-size-fits-all as regards shipping and this is causing the problem.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08030464000050"></a>On emissions within Europe, we already have two areas where ships have to cut down the sulphur content in their engines&#151;one in the Baltic and a new one which has just come into operation in the North Sea and the English Channel. So already things are happening. It would be a great mistake, as the Minister said earlier, for shipping to be brought in now before some kind of international agreement can be reached.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08030464000052"></a>I rather like the amendment because it sets a realistic timescale&#151;the Secretary of State is required to regulate within five years&#151;and we are assured by the previous speaker that the International Maritime Organisation is tackling this issue with urgency. I would assume, if that is the case, that five years is not going to present a problem. In other words, something ultimately will be resolved in five years. Do not hold your breath, my Lords; I suspect that I may be proved optimistic in

Again with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, we know that the target is 2012 and it seems that the timescale of five years is appropriate.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08030464000053"></a>I like the amendment because it recognises that we are seeking to allow passengers&#151;indeed, in many ways, to encourage passengers&#151;to travel, but by the least carbon-emitting method. Taking an overall audit comparing maritime, air, rail and road and putting in place policies which encourage the least emitting form of transport seems a desirable objective which the Secretary of State should address in the medium term.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08030464000054"></a>The Minister spoke very convincingly and, as we knew he would, with some passion on the previous amendment about the need to ensure that we did not put in place measures which would put us at a disadvantage with our competitors. I do not think that that criticism can be held against these amendments and I will be very interested to know whether or not the Minister feels that to be the case. I find myself in a great deal of agreement with my noble friend who moved the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="08030464000055"></a><b><a name="80304-0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08030464000700"></a>Baroness Byford:</b> My Lords, I am very grateful to my noble friend for moving the amendment. As I am following on from my noble friend Lord Selborne, in some ways there is little more to add. I take the point of the noble Lord, Lord Greenway. We have had many debates in the Chamber on what to do about international shipping and I suspect that when the marine Bill comes along this issue will be raised again very fully.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08030464000056"></a>The amendment does not tie the Government as tightly as the previous one. We have time, a five-year period, in which to look at it and to see what can be developed internationally. When we have the Climate Change Bill before us, it is a great shame that we do not take the opportunity to use it for the betterment of everyone concerned. On a previous amendment, I said that we should not forget that our Government and our country are taking a great lead on climate change, and not to have something similar to the amendment proposed by my noble friend would be regrettable.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08030464000057"></a>I appreciate that the question of how one regulates it is difficult. As the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, said in regard to the import and export of goods, shipping often moves through several different phases; it is not only a one-stop journey but will involve other ports of call on the way. Getting around that will be quite a challenge.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08030464000058"></a>The amendment is certainly worth considering. The Minister clearly was not happy to accept the previous amendment, but if he is not able to take on board some of the proposals within the amendment, I hope that when he comes to reply he will give good reasons why not. I felt that his reply to the previous amendment was, &#147;We do not really like it and therefore we are not going to take it on board&#148;. This amendment is slightly more generous and more flexible than the other one and I hope that he will justify more fully why he cannot accept it&#151;if, indeed, he cannot&#151;but obviously our hope is that he will.</p>

<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1019"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1019</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should be included in the carbon account. The second is whether we are ready to include aviation and shipping in a system of penalties and incentives such as the ETS. Because the answer to the second is no, we say that we cannot include the emissions in the account. I really do not understand the logic of that. The emissions are the emissions, and that should mean everything that is emitted. There will be a number of categories of emissions that initially will not be strongly controlled or will not be controlled at all, and this is just another of them.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08030464000060"></a>It is not difficult to estimate what the emissions are for aviation and shipping, although it may not be exactly the same metric that we come to use when we get to the ETS. My argument is that we should put them into the account while the work goes on to find a method of controlling them. In the mean time, we will rely, in the case of aviation, on recasting air passenger duty as best we can so that it reflects CO2 emissions, not simply the number of people, as is already being planned. I would separate out completely what is in the account and the method by which we then seek to control the emissions in question.</p>

I wish to say only that my noble friend Lady Byford is supporting it, and I thank my noble friend Lord Taylor for moving it and for the way he described what we are trying to achieve. I hope that if he divides the House, this way will be the alternative to that proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, in his previous amendment, which was not passed.</p>

One is that it reframes aviation and shipping in terms of passengers and goods and services; and the other is that it inserts the word &#147;must&#148; instead of &#147;may&#148;. I hope I have got that right.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08030464000064"></a>The first of those is an interesting proposition to put before your Lordships. The question is whether that distinction between the movement of people and the movement of goods and services makes more sense than the distinction between the means by which the movement takes place, whether by air or by sea&#151;or, internally, by rail. I will listen with great interest to what the Minister says about that.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08030464000065"></a>With regard to aviation, on many occasions an aircraft will carry both goods and people. International aviation agreements are emerging in Europe, but it would be difficult to have one system of measuring or taking account of the movement of goods by air and another for measuring travel by land to ensure that the  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1020"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1020</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>emissions are the same, which I understand to be the objective of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment. Either there has to be a system that counts only emissions from air travel&#151;they are calculated on the amount of fuel used and are the same whether goods or people are being carried&#151;or you try to find a way of distinguishing between carrying goods and services and carrying people. I am not making the point very easily. There is an attempt to say that the issue is not of aviation or of shipping, but of moving people or moving goods and services. I am not sure, in practical terms, whether that is a workable process.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08030464000066"></a>I will not comment too much on &#147;must&#148; or &#147;may&#148;, other than to make a general comment about this particular clause and the desire in the Bill&#151;which the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, most forcefully expressed in his frustration as he wound up on the previous vote&#151;to say, no doubt in the face of pressures, that we as an individual country must take responsibility for every emission, even if some emissions are best dealt with in an international environment, as within Europe. The clause as it stands gives a great deal of credence to that view. I suggest that it is entirely possible that we could well distinguish between those emissions that we are best at dealing with as a country and those emissions that are best dealt with in international agreements. The latter group should be dealt with in that environment, and we should not pretend that we can say that these are British emissions as opposed to French or German emissions&#151;not least because the emitters will be free to trade in any case, and the actual emissions will be quite beyond our control in international agreements.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08030464000067"></a>The saving grace for me in the clause is that it says those necessary orders &#147;may&#148; be made. I have just a slight concern, although I may have misinterpreted this, that saying &#147;must&#148; means that we must say what the UK emissions are. I shall give the kind of examples that have already been given. If I and my family decide to go to India and do not fly direct from London to Delhi but go via Amsterdam, what are the UK emissions? If a Chinese or American visitor decides that they will be put off by passenger duty and will go to or from their country via Dubai, Paris or Frankfurt, what are the UK emissions? There are real problems here, and the clause does not do a great deal to deter the idea that we should perhaps distinguish between emissions. I suspect that the climate change committee will distinguish between those emissions that fall within an international agreement and those that do not. For that reason, I hope that when the Minister responds to this he is able to cope on the may/must issue. I will be interested to see what his answer to that point is.</p>

As has been said, there are two amendments here which would make key changes to the Bill. The first, which has been concentrated on to a large extent, would replace the concept of international aviation and shipping emissions with emissions from international passenger travel and imports or exports of goods. It would also put a time limit of five years on the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to exclude the emissions from our targets or require him to come down to Parliament after five years if they had not been included.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08030464000069"></a>I appreciate the spirit of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment. It has just been commented on in the Lobby&#151;votes are useful for having a chat with people&#151;that the amendment is very clever; it is trying to address the practical problems we looked at in Committee. We accept that. For the most part, the amendment grapples with precisely the same issues that I understand the Government grappled with when drafting the clause in the first place. I agree that one possible way of including the emissions in the Bill is through the categorisation described in the amendment; that is, passenger travel or freight.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08030464000070"></a>I assure the House that Clause 25 is drafted sufficiently widely that, should we decide that the amendment is the most appropriate way forward&#151;I have indicated that it has a lot going for it&#151;it would be perfectly possible to define the emissions in the way that the noble Lord suggested. However, there could be practical problems&#151;we will find this all the way through not just the Bill but also the way in which we operate the policies&#151;in relation to transport carrying both passengers and freight; for example, a boat with passengers and freight. The amendment might also risk international rail transport via Eurotunnel being included in measures to combat emissions from shipping and aviation industries on the grounds that Eurotunnel also carries international passengers and freight.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08030464000071"></a>My notes go to greater length, but I do not see the need to go further into them because I am offering practical arguments. Contrary to what the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, said, I do not do so because I do not like the amendment; I am trying to give practical reasons why we cannot accept it, as I did in the case of Amendment No. 64. I do not want to nitpick this amendment because, as I have said, the noble Lord&#146;s formulation, which we believe can be covered by the Bill as drafted, may&#151;to use an analogy used in another context earlier today&#151;provide a lifeboat for the way in which we come to a solution.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08030464000072"></a>Amendment No. 116 would set a time limit for including the emissions in our targets, or require the Secretary of State to explain to Parliament why they had not been included. I again sympathise with the noble Lord&#146;s intention. As has been indicated in the speeches made, the House shares the desire to tackle emissions from the sectors concerned as quickly and comprehensively as possible. I believe that there is also a strong measure of agreement that they are best tackled internationally; I do not think that anyone is arguing for completely unilateral measures. However, we come back to the same question as to the best way to reflect the points in the Bill in the first place.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08030464000073"></a>I make it clear that we have no problem with the idea of parliamentary scrutiny on the issue; indeed, the Government&#146;s own amendments would strengthen Parliament&#146;s role. The Bill already provides considerable scope for further parliamentary debate on the issues; for instance, in the context of the Government&#146;s orders setting carbon budgets, or amending the level of the 2050 target, which must be passed by affirmative resolution.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08030464000074"></a>However, as we have already discussed, the problem with setting any arbitrary deadline, which is what the  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1022"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1022</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>five years proposed by the amendment is, is precisely that: it is purely arbitrary. We need to have a better reason for having a deadline that might cause us problems. We do not want to suggest to our partners in the international negotiations that we are being driven by an artificial domestic deadline rather than a desire to achieve the right global solution, which could cause a problem for our credibility in negotiations. To avoid that risk, we are looking, as we indicated in response to the previous amendment, to maintain as much flexibility as possible to include these emissions when the context is right.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08030464000075"></a>However, I assure the House that we will not delay. When it is possible to move forward, we will do so. For instance, with international aviation emissions, we have already said that once the European Union emissions trading rules have been finalised, we will ask the Committee on Climate Change for its advice on the methodology. The timing for this will depend on progress at EU level, but we hope that the emissions trading rules will be finalised during this calendar year. We do not wish to pre-empt the committee&#146;s advice, but we would expect to be in a position to decide whether to include international aviation emissions in our targets ahead of the second carbon budget under the Bill, which runs from 2013 to 2017. The situation with respect to international shipping emissions is more complex, as we have already discussed, but I hope that my answer provides noble Lords with some reassurance.</p>

<a name="80304-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08030464000076"></a>We have always said that we want this to be a genuinely transparent process. I can confirm that the Government would be happy to provide regular information to Parliament on progress in the European and international discussions on international aviation and shipping. This should provide greater transparency. I hope that this would reassure both your Lordships and Members of other place that they would be kept fully and regularly up to date on the international negotiations as they develop. I hope that the assurances that I have provided about our commitment to take action on these emissions will persuade the noble Lord not to press his amendment.</p>

I think that he can see what we are seeking to do, and I think that he recognises that the Government&#146;s proposals in the Bill cramp the resolution of the problem. Although he said that it is perfectly possible to introduce a system which reflects the terms of the amendments on the basis of the wording that is already in the Bill, I suspect that he can see that the mechanism that we propose has a number of advantages. It is designed to address an area of omission. As the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, pointed out, the omission is that nothing will be on the carbon account until something comes up under the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08030464000079"></a>It is most important to emphasise that the amendment depends on international agreement no more than the Bill itself. In presenting the Bill, the Minister did not say, &#147;Well, this Bill is dependent upon other countries agreeing to do the same thing&#148;. He quite rightly came to the House and said, &#147;This is taking a lead on these issues. This is actually presenting a new way of dealing with a problem which is international in scope, but in which we can play our part&#148;. I therefore say to your Lordships that it is quite right to try to work with the amendment, in the belief that it will make for better legislation and might encourage the development of international agreement.</p>

While the Government are boasting about giving a lead by introducing the Bill unilaterally, without having had international negotiation&#151;as long as one does not count the devolved Administrations&#151;it does not mean that, when we go to the detail of the Bill, requiring international co-operation to get the right methodologies is not the right way to do it. We can be unilateral in giving the lead in introducing the Bill and the concept of the way in which we are trying to deal with climate change, but we need to operate with our international partners on the minutiae of the methodology.</p>

It would be far more desirable when we come to the second element of what we are trying to do, which is to find control mechanisms, to have international agreement to implement them. But as the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, pointed out&#151;and he was supported by the noble Lord, Lord May&#151;there are two separate issues. Do you include the carbon polluting elements of the British economy in our carbon accounts or not? If we can find a mechanism that does so in a much more comprehensive way, I think that noble Lords should support such a mechanism. That would not penalise the UK economy, but would lead to mechanisms to encourage the least polluting methods of goods movement and people movement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08030464000082"></a>I now turn to the second part of what is an important point to emphasise. I have valued the contributions of the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, to debates throughout the Bill. He got to the heart of the issue and could see the advantages of this way of looking at things. But he too was worried about the &#147;may&#148; and &#147;must&#148; element within this group of amendments. One needs a stick as well as a carrot. Legislation that actually says &#147;must&#148; is a stick, but it is designed to drive the issue. If the issue is not driven there is no incentive for the Government to recognise the seriousness of the issue and they can defer decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08030464000083"></a>On this side of the House, we readily recognise that international negotiations, in the nature of things, mean that sometimes it may not be the right moment.

That is a reasonable balance between pressure within the Bill to come to an agreement on regulations and the Secretary of State's discretion that this may not be the right and proper time to do so.</p>

<a name="80304-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08030464000094"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, government Amendment No. 69A seeks to provide greater transparency about progress in reducing UK emissions by requiring the Secretary of State to report on baseline emissions as well as emissions in the most recent year.</p>

<a name="80304-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08030464000095"></a>This amendment ensures that the Clause 12 report will contain information for each greenhouse gas on emissions in both the most recent year and the relevant baseline. I say the relevant baseline because for greenhouse gases included in our targets Clause 20 allows the Secretary of State to define this as a year other than 1990 for greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide. We will come to this clause later when we can discuss the safeguards to ensure that it is used appropriately.</p>

<a name="80304-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08030464000096"></a>Equally, for greenhouse gases which we have not yet included in our targets the appropriate base year may be 1990 or it may not. Government Amendment No. 69A allows the most appropriate year to be used. This is particularly important in the case of any new greenhouse gases which might be identified some time between now and 2050.</p>

<a name="80304-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08030464000097"></a>Noble Lords may recall that Clause 73 allows us to add to the list of greenhouse gases if climate science develops so that we would be required to report on the UK&#146;s emissions of these gases. If that were the case it is possible to envisage a situation where we do not have any data for the emissions of that gas in 1990.</p>

<a name="80304-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08030464000098"></a>Government Amendment No. 69A therefore ensures that for greenhouse gases which have not yet been included in our targets information will be provided on both emissions in the most recent year and the relevant baseline year, as defined by the Secretary of State. Our amendment recognises that the baseline year may not be 1990. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="08030464000099"></a><b><a name="80304-0008.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08030464000711"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> My Lords, this amendment adds welcome precision to the annual reporting mechanism. It places a duty on the Secretary of State to outline the net UK emissions of targeted greenhouse gases with respect to the 1990 baseline as well as specifying a baseline amount for those greenhouse gases that are not directly targeted under the Bill as it stands. This is certainly a welcome concession.</p>

<a name="80304-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08030464000100"></a>We are thankful that the Government have recognised the need to have more robust reports and welcome the amendment. It is obviously important to have the emissions reported against the framework of a baseline year. That is how our yearly progress is ultimately to be measured. When we speak of the reporting mechanisms  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1028"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1028</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and how we are to understand our progress, we in this House understand the importance of the figures. However, the numbers that are being reported are not always intelligible to the general public. It is important that the reports have regard to the baseline year so that popular understanding of how progress is measured can be fostered to the fullest extent.</p>

<a name="80304-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08030464000101"></a>It is also very welcome to see the Government&#146;s move to include the non-targeted greenhouse gases. We understand that all greenhouse gases contribute to climate change to a varying degree. As technology develops, other gases could begin to take a more central role. Thus, understanding the true scope of greenhouse gas emissions, even if they are not being targeted at the moment, will be a useful tool in assessing our progress and our room for improvement in the future. We suspect that in 20 or 30 years&#146; time, other gases will become more important. Having a robust method of reporting on non-targeted gases will allow us to understand the relationships between our efforts to reduce emissions and the reduction of these gases.</p>

<a name="80304-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08030464000102"></a>We have a few concerns, and I hope that the Minister will address them. The amendment specifies that non-targeted greenhouse gases will be reported according to a baseline that the Secretary of State considers appropriate. What are the standards of appropriateness? What regard will the Secretary of State have to international agreements? Will he be obliged to follow the lead of international treaties? Why is that not part of the amendment? Does he expect the setting of the baseline date to be done in consultation with the Committee on Climate Change? Would the Minister be willing to give assurances that the Secretary of State will consult the Committee on Climate Change regarding the baseline year for non-targeted greenhouse gases? Importantly, what is the timeframe for establishing the baseline year?</p>

<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="08030464000103"></a><b><a name="80304-0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08030464000712"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> My Lords, we on these Benches also welcome the amendment in general terms, and I would make many similar comments to those of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor&#151;although I will not repeat them&#151;about choosing the baseline year and keeping it in an international context. We would like to see more targeted greenhouse gases, but we will come on to that later.</p>

<a name="80304-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08030464000104"></a>It is important that all greenhouse gases, by international convention, are measured against a 1990 baseline, and that is recognised in the amendment. But there should be a hierarchy of preferences for new gases so that, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said, it is the same as international convention. It is much more straightforward if we are able to keep to 1990. Clearly, that will not be possible where records do not exist for that gas at the time, but there should always be a preference to keep the baseline year at 1990 in order to ensure that the whole process is not confused. Even now, we often forget that when we talk about targets and reductions we are referring to 1990 and not to the year in which this Bill is likely to be passed.</p>

To answer the specific questions, the government amendment covers both greenhouse gases that are included in our targets and  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1029"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1029</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>gases that are not included. For the greenhouse gases that are included in the targets, Clause 20 sets out a process for defining the base year. We will come to government amendments on this clause shortly, which will strengthen the independent scrutiny of how these powers are used. The second part of Amendment No. 69A relates only to greenhouse gases that are not included in our targets. We are talking only about reporting emissions, not how we count them towards the targets. We think that it is important that the Government should report to Parliament on the emissions of greenhouse gases even if they are not included in our targets, which will ensure the maximum transparency. The amendment ensures that Parliament will get information on emissions in the most recent year and emissions in the baseline year to make comparing the two straightforward.</p>

<a name="80304-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08030464000106"></a>We have to be realistic about this. This was once hinted at in Committee. Let us suppose that we identify a new greenhouse gas, the by-product of some industrial process that we have not got on the radar at the moment, in 2030. There might not be any information on emissions of that gas as far back as 1990, so a different baseline would be appropriate. Clause 73(3) allows us to include other gases in the Bill and in our reports under the Bill only if there is an EU or international agreement that it is a greenhouse gas. The point is that it is about the safeguards; there will be appropriate safeguards. It is important that we are happy to consider these points. The specific question that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asked me is not covered in my notes, but to me it beggars belief that the Secretary of State would not consult the climate change committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08030464000113"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, today we are debating the order that brings into effect two unitary authorities for Cheshire. I am well aware that this decision has raised considerable passion in this House and that is reflected on the Order Paper. We all have an interest in the future governance of Cheshire and, with this in mind and with the indulgence of the House, I hope that I can explain why we have already addressed many of the concerns raised by noble Lords in their amendments to the Motion. It has been  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1030"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1030</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a difficult decision, but nevertheless it is a decision which we believe provides the right governance for the people of Cheshire moving forward.</p>

<a name="80304-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08030464000114"></a>I will deal with this comprehensively, because it is important for the House to know how we have gone through this process and why we have reached the decisions that we have. I will therefore set out the general approach that we have adopted to unitary restructuring and the precise approach that we have taken in assessing this proposal and judging that it meets the criteria. I will also deal with the issues raised in the report by the Merits Committee. I emphasise before I do so that the JCSI, which has a key role in scrutinising legal instruments, has given the order a clean bill of health. I know that many noble Lords have emotional and political ties with Cheshire. Their concerns mirror the fact that we are also very well aware that, with every reorganisation, there comes a degree of local and sometimes historic disagreement, which can be a very unhappy experience for many people.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80304-0009.htm"/>


<a name="80304-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08030464000115"></a>While the Government set out the case for unitary authorities in the original White Paper, pointing to the confusion and weakness that is inherent in two-tier working when services and responsibilities are split, the choice of the way forward has been entirely a matter for the local authorities themselves. That is precisely what has made this restructuring process different from previous processes. What we have done is to simply invite those principal councils in England that wished to do so to put their own proposals for new unitary structures or enhanced two-tier working to overcome those challenges. Indeed, the option to put forward an enhanced two-tier solution for Cheshire was one of the options open to the councils. In the event, that did not prove achievable. The search for a unitary solution, as noble Lords will know better than I, goes back many years, with many councils believing for some time that a unitary solution was the only way forward. All seven principal councils had an opportunity to come forward with a joint bid for a unitary structure that they could all endorse. Likewise, in the event, this did not prove possible.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08030469000001"></a>In the end, this is a unique situation reflecting the complexity of local government relations in Cheshire, and the geography and political make-up determined that we received three different proposals from the councils in Cheshire. In our judgment, only two of those met the criteria that we set out in our invitation&#151;the proposal for a single unitary put forward by the county council and the proposal made originally made by Chester City Council and then subsequently endorsed and joined by the borough councils of Ellesmere Port and Neston, Macclesfield and Vale Royal for a two-unitary Cheshire.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08030469000002"></a>It is important that I explain the criteria that these two proposals needed to meet and how we made our choice between them. The criteria set out in the invitation were devised to reflect the aim of restructuring, which was to put in place local governance which would best enable an area to achieve economic, social and environmental success. Therefore we set out three criteria which specified what restructuring should deliver. These criteria therefore focused on strategic leadership,  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1031"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1031</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>genuine opportunities for neighbourhood flexibility and empowerment, and the delivery of value for money and efficiency of public services. That was a judgment about the future&#151;about likely outcomes if the proposal were to be implemented.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08030469000003"></a>However, when assessing a proposal for unitary local government, it is important to consider not only what the proposal would achieve once implemented, but what the change to the new structure would involve. Briefly, would it be worth the candle? Would it have sufficient support locally for the new unitary structure to be a success in delivering quality local services and in enhancing opportunity and prosperity? Therefore, our invitation also set out two criteria that if the change were to be made, it must be a change that would not set up new councils that were designed to fail; and that has meant, first, that those advocating change should show that it was affordable, and secondly that it would have the support of people who would ensure pragmatically that their partnership and commitment would ensure better services, better strategies for the entire community. That is precisely why we chose the form of words that there should be a,</p>
<ul><a name="08030469000035"></a>&#147;broad cross section of partners and stakeholders&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80304-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08030469000004"></a>As with the other criteria, the judgments were prospective. In the case of Cheshire, we received two diametrically opposing proposals&#151;one for two unitary authorities, which this draft order seeks to implement, and another for a single unitary authority. We made clear in our consultation paper published on 6 June 2007 that we chose the two-unitary option because we genuinely believe that it would deliver to a greater extent the long-term outcomes that we are seeking. It is important to stress from the outset that this is not a choice on which one delivers greater savings or which one has greater public support. It is about which one can better deliver long-term outcomes in a very challenging environment.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08030469000005"></a>I understand that some noble Lords disagree with our judgment and we have tried wherever possible to listen to, respect and respond to those concerns, but the fact is that opinion remains divided, just as it does on the ground in Cheshire, on the relative merits of the two proposals. I understand the sincere feeling among some noble Lords and the case for delay that we will hear this evening can be argued either because some noble Lords feel that delay would be a better outcome or that they still hold to a preference for a single-unitary option. Both positions are honourable but neither will serve the interests of local authorities now being formed in Cheshire&#151;and neither is open to us today.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08030469000006"></a>I shall go through the criteria. Noble Lords here may say that this proposal is neither affordable nor sensible, and the amendment to be moved by my noble friend Lord Grantchester reflects those concerns. We do not share those perspectives because, for a proposal to meet the affordability criterion, the transitional costs must be expected to be more than offset by the savings that the proposal is estimated to generate and this is expected to be achieved within five years. I shall explain how we arrived at the judgment, which we did not come to alone.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1032"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1032</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80304-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08030469000007"></a>The financial cases for each proposal were subjected to rigorous scrutiny by independent financial experts&#151;ex-local authority chief finance officers&#151;employed by the department through CIPFA and IPF. In the case of Cheshire, as part of our careful examination of the affordability criterion, we identified certain risks to the financial case put forward for the two-unitary bid and requested in August that the proposers of that bid submit further financial information on the viability of their business case. Our financial advisers independently analysed the business case in light of this further information. They undertook their own modelling, making their own assessments, and they concluded that it was right to categorise the proposal as high-risk, but within the safe context that the proposal met the affordability criterion.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08030469000008"></a>The advisers concluded that the levels of savings envisaged in the proposals were not unreasonable and that the business case, even after significant additional risk provisions, still produced ongoing savings of some &#163;16 million a year, which are at the high end of the sort of savings that we have seen in the unitary proposals that have been successful so far. We considered this risk-adjusted figure and a risk-adjusted estimation of the transition costs very carefully, and they are the figures on which we based our decision. They differ from the original bids because they are lower, but they support the conclusion that the proposal is affordable; transition costs are repaid within 3.7 years&#151;well within the five years that we set out as part of the criterion.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08030469000009"></a>Let me conclude on this point by answering a particular criticism that has been levelled at the Government in this House and the other place that we have not released publicly the assessment of our independent financial experts. We decided not to release this report&#151;not just in relation to Cheshire but in relation to all the areas where similar requests have been made&#151;because we consider that it falls under the exemptions in Section 35(1)(a) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, which relates to the formulation or development of government policy, and Section 35(1)(b) relating to ministerial communications. We consider that the public interest weighs against its disclosure, in particular because of the need to preserve the thinking space around Ministers when reaching decisions, to maintain the convention of the collective responsibility of Ministers.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08030469000010"></a>I turn to the issue of support, which is very important and is the subject of the amendments to be moved by noble Lord, Lord Wade, and by my noble friend Lord Harrison. Let me be clear about what the definition of,</p>
<ul><a name="08030469000036"></a>&#147;broad cross section of support&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08030469000030"></a>actually means, as set out in the original invitation. It is, essentially, about whether the new unitary authority genuinely meets its objectives and will work for local people. Again&#151;and this is different from any reorganisation that has taken place in the past&#151;we were conscious of the strain and stress in any change. We knew that the proposals would have to be tested against whether they would work, because they had the support of those, including partners outside local government itself, like the health or police services who would have to make them work.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1033"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1033</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80304-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08030469000011"></a>That is not the same as popular support and that is deliberately the case. We did not make this a test of public opinion; that is, whether we had a majority of public support. We did not base support on whether there was a majority of stakeholders, a majority of local citizens or a majority of some other group of interested persons who supported or approved the unitary proposal. In our original invitation we explicitly recognised that any proposal might not carry consensus from or within all sectors, and that is why we said that no single council or body, or group of councils or bodies, could have a veto. We left it to the local authorities to solicit opinion locally in the way they thought effective in order to demonstrate how the proposal would stand up against the support criteria. The responses we have received to the stakeholder consultation as a result reflect divided opinion, divided politics and divided loyalties.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08030469000012"></a>The two-unitary proposal was originally made by Chester City Council, and subsequently endorsed and joined by the borough councils of Ellesmere Port and Neston, Macclesfield and Vale Royal. Predictably, there was strong opposition from the county council on the basis of its unitary proposal, and from the remaining two districts, the borough councils of Crewe and Nantwich and Congleton. I can tell the House that Congleton&#146;s claim for judicial review was dismissed by the High Court on all grounds in September. Today, we have learned that the appeal has been dismissed unanimously by the Court of Appeal, which has also refused leave to appeal. We welcome this judgment. We urge Congleton, before it seeks to take its claim further, to think very carefully about what course of action is now truly in the interests of their council taxpayers and local communities.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08030469000013"></a>As I said, local polls conducted by the affected councils had varying but predictable results. A poll commissioned by the proposing districts showed a preference for the two-unitary proposal over the single-unitary proposal&#151;23 per cent compared with 16 per cent&#151;whereas a telephone survey conducted by the county council demonstrated 46 per cent of support for a single unitary compared with 22 per cent for the two-unitary proposal. Hostile district councils&#151;for example, Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council&#151;conducted specific polls where the results were also predictably hostile. However, polls were only one of the factors that we took into account in assessing the range and depth of support for a proposal.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08030469000014"></a>Stakeholder support was also predictably variable, with opinion being divided. Although there was a consensus from the majority of respondents in support of unitary local government in principle, it is fair to say that a majority of representations received from public sector stakeholders expressed a preference for the county&#146;s single unitary proposal.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08030469000015"></a>However, as I said, this has not been about a search for a majority. The two-unitary proposal has support from four out of the six district councils and some public sector stakeholders, such as East Cheshire NHS Trust and West Cheshire PCT, and some business and third-sector support, as well as some support from town and parish councils. On that basis we felt, and  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1034"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1034</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>continue to feel, entitled to conclude that the proposal has sufficient support for it to be able to work.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08030469000016"></a>We believe that support will be bolstered by that fact that the new unitary authorities propose to put in place new local area arrangements which build on established and successful practice in the Chester area. Those will ensure, with the new duty to involve under last year&#146;s local government Act, that local people are represented locally, that they have local influence and that they will be connected in new ways to the new local authority. That is a very important part of what makes these new unitaries &#147;new&#148;.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08030469000017"></a>Our judgment also turned on how closely the new authorities would match the existing economic footprint within Cheshire and therefore whether they or the alternative single unitary would be better able to take advantage of new opportunities and build on the economic realities. Again, we accept that there are differing views about this. The county council commissioned an independent report by the Centre for Sustainable Urban and Regional Futures, which sought to challenge the notion that east and west Cheshire are component parts of the neighbouring Manchester and Liverpool city regions. The proposing district councils, on the other hand, claimed that the findings in the report lacked hard evidence and that in any event the data in the report could be interpreted as supporting the east-west split. They used travel-to-work journey data to argue that the east and west were self-contained economic units.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08030469000018"></a>We carefully considered all the information submitted to us, and the views represented a range of different positions. We have read the report very carefully and are persuaded that the data in the SURF report was equivocal and that the travel-to-work journey data support the argument that the east and west are self-contained economic units. Furthermore, we believe that the reality now, and in the future, is that the economic drivers of Liverpool and Manchester&#151;and, to a lesser extent, Deeside&#151;will continue to dominate the region and offer greater advantages in the future. As it better matches this economic reality, the two-unitary option offers the possibility of a more focused approach to economic development to take advantage of that. We believe that the single unitary system would not offer those sorts of advantages.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08030469000019"></a>We are also convinced that these new authorities, through effective place-shaping, will be able to channel economic prosperity and influence outcomes throughout their communities, including those to the south that would perhaps consider themselves marginalised from this economic reality. We are convinced that the new neighbourhood and area committee arrangements will genuinely connect people with their local neighbourhood and new councils.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08030469000020"></a>I turn to the issue of deliverability and shall reflect on the Merits Committee report. The committee said that it understood the Government&#146;s wish to achieve an early resolution of uncertainties but suggested that,</p>
<ul><a name="08030469000037"></a>&#147;this be weighed carefully against allowing more time to prepare for the establishment of the new authorities&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08030469000031"></a>We have weighed and considered that carefully. We accept that implementation will be challenging. This  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1035"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1035</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is a complex undertaking and there are risks. However, we are confident. We have strong leadership, proper planning and the right level of input and co-operation from all the existing local authorities and stakeholders to ensure that these risks do not materialise.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08030469000021"></a>Strong evidence was presented to the Merits Committee that local government in Cheshire will provide, and is providing with increasing energy and commitment, the necessary leadership. The debate in another place provided further evidence of that. As I said, compelling evidence was presented to the Merits Committee that new councils in Cheshire are co-operating positively and practically to begin the delivery and transition process. Much of the preparatory work is already well advanced.</p>
<a name="time_19"></a>
<a name="80304-0009.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="08030469000039"></a>6.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08030469000022"></a>The Government are supporting and monitoring delivery through our regional office. My officials meet regularly with the joint implementation teams that are already up and running on the ground. The relevant government office works closely with the implementation teams pulling in service-specific expertise across the services, providing support where necessary, and helping to build the capacity of the officers where appropriate.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08030469000023"></a>There is also a requirement in the order for implementation plans to be drawn up, against which we will monitor progress. A recent implementation update report provided to my officials has also highlighted the desire of major partners to be fully engaged. This was picked up by the Member for Macclesfield in the debate in the other place last week, who said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="08030469000033"></a>&#147;In all the arrangements, all seven local authorities and their partners are actively and positively involved with major partners, signalling their desire to be more fully engaged. Good progress is being made&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 26/2/08; col. 1055.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="80304-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08030469000024"></a>I do not for a moment deny that this is a challenging situation. However, there are precedents with successful restructurings having taken place on a similar timescale in Humberside and Avon in 1995-96. We are confident that new flagship councils delivering strategic leadership, effective neighbourhood empowerment, value for money and equity in public services can be delivered in Cheshire on 1 April 2009.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08030469000025"></a>Perhaps I may spell out to the House the genuine risks of delay. If we delay, we risk creating a further period of uncertainty&#151;for a year or perhaps more&#151;for the people of Cheshire. What would that achieve? On top of that, the thousands of employees of the current councils will be in a state of limbo and uncertainty for another year. If we delay, we will derail the process which is now seriously under way of local government officers working together for the good of the people of Cheshire. We will jeopardise the progress that has been made. Again, I refer the House to the words of Members of Parliament for Cheshire in the debate in the other place. They know their constituencies and know what is happening on the ground. The Member for Weaver Vale said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="08030469000034"></a>&#147;Now is not the time to emphasise our divisions; we should be saying, &#145;This is what we&#146;ll do, and what is in the best interests of everybody whom we represent.&#146; We should take that agenda forward in a positive way&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 26/2/08; col. 1057.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08030469000026"></a>I have received a letter from the leaders of Macclesfield and Vale Royal borough councils&#151;the two councils that will be leading implementation in east and west Cheshire until the elections. In the letter, they say that they are,</p>
<ul><a name="08030469000038"></a>&#147;keen to get on with the task of implementation of the two new unitary authorities in Cheshire and to keep up the momentum which we are already achieving through engagement with officers and elected members of all existing councils in Cheshire. We would ask that you stress that to the House of Lords in the debate which you will be leading for the Government tomorrow&#148;. </ul>
<p><a name="08030469000032"></a>I have done that.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08030469000027"></a>If we delay, we break faith with the fact that, despite the genuine difficulties and unhappiness, there is now a growing willingness to make the decision work. Officials and elected members alike have come together in a determination to work through what is now best for Cheshire as swiftly and as clearly as possible. It is to the enormous credit of those professional officers and councillors alike who did not want this choice to be made that they are now determined to make it work. They need, and seek, the approval of Parliament.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08030469000028"></a>That approval has been forthcoming. The order has been considered in detail in another place, and the debate was constructive, despite some sharply argued disagreements. That reflects the progress that has been made and the shared desire in Cheshire to make unitary restructuring work.

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08030471000002"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for the rather lengthy explanation that she gave us of how the Government came to this decision. I listened to it with great care. I thought that, if she had come to a different conclusion, she would have said something very similar.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08030471000003"></a>I have lived in Cheshire all my life. My family has lived and farmed in Cheshire for a couple of hundred years at least and I was a county councillor in Cheshire in 1973 when we went through a reorganisation. My family business is in Chester and I have many interests in businesses and organisations&#151;charitable and social&#151;throughout the county. I know it extremely well. I decided to bring forward this amendment and to question the Government&#146;s decision because of the weight of influence that has been brought to bear on me from various parties who are very dissatisfied with the decision made by the Government.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08030471000004"></a>I do not agree that the evidence received indicated a strong view in Cheshire for the two unitary authority solution. Throughout Cheshire, the view is entirely the opposite. There is no strong feeling against the idea of  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1037"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1037</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>unitary authorities&#151;I personally approve of unitary authorities because they are more efficient, more competent and can more sensibly deliver a range of services to the citizens&#151;but I strongly believe that any change should have the one purpose of producing a better arrangement for the delivery of services to the citizens, to the ratepayers, to the businesses, to those who use all the services of a county council, to the elderly, to those who need social benefits, to education and to schools. Those should be of the best possible order and be delivered by an organisation that is as efficient and as well run as an organisation can be.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08030471000005"></a>The Minister made no comment of any criticism&#151;I do not think that anyone can&#151;of the existing structure within Cheshire County Council, which has run the county extremely efficiently and already delivers some 80 per cent of the services now received by the citizens of Cheshire, covering the whole range of activities for which the council is now responsible.</p>

<a name="80304-0009.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08030471000006"></a>I am sure that the Minister will agree with me that, over the period of this Government and previous Governments, the responsibilities of councils have increased enormously. I have no problem with that. Local delivery of services is no bad thing. At the same time, however, one must imagine that the greater emphasis on local delivery of services will increase rather than decrease; indeed, history indicates that that will happen. Therefore, for the future we need an organisation that is best fit to deliver those extra services; we need an organisation that attracts the most able leaders in the county, an organisation that attracts the most efficient and capable officers in the county and one that unifies all the activities of the county rather than destroys them.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08030471000007"></a>The noble Baroness referred to those matters that she wishes to create. I am more concerned about what will be destroyed. An organisation to which all the people in Cheshire look as their central body will be destroyed and split into two. One interesting thing that has happened in those areas on the periphery of Cheshire that have been sloughed off into other areas or into their own unitary authorities is that they still think of themselves as Cheshire; they want to be part of Cheshire. It is a long-term, historic county, to which those in it have a great deal of loyalty.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08030471000008"></a>I do not disagree with the noble Baroness when she makes the point that certain groups and certain authorities want to maintain their independence and want to be the new leaders. &#147;They would, wouldn&#146;t they?&#148;, as has been said in the past. That is their role, but that does not mean that that is the best solution. The best solution is one that overrides the local issues, rivalries and prejudices and looks at what is the best long-term decision&#151;I emphasise long-term decision. At the end of her remarks, the noble Baroness said that, if we do not agree this soon, there will be further delay, which will cause disruption. Frankly, I am not worried about a little delay now, provided that we come to the best decision for the people of Cheshire in the future.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08030471000009"></a>The Minister talked about the economic future of the county and how it might be more satisfactory if the county were divided into two units that had their economic allegiance in different areas. I completely  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1038"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1038</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>refute that scenario. Cheshire is an important economy on its own. Some 70 per cent of the economic employees in the county work in the county; they do not move elsewhere. Some of the finest companies in the UK are in Cheshire. I do not have to tell the House that it is one of the most productive rural counties in the country. It produces great leadership at all levels and has made an enormous contribution to the economy of the north-west. It is extremely important that it maintains a powerful voice in the north-west. By splitting it, we will not add to that opportunity. I do not accept the Minister&#146;s suggestion that the two divisions owe allegiance to other peripheral areas&#151;the two major cities of Liverpool and Manchester&#151;and I do not accept that that will happen in the future. The two major cities of Merseyside and Manchester have their own economies; they are thriving and effective areas, but so is Cheshire.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08030471000010"></a>The noble Baroness is working against what the majority of people in Cheshire want. Her proposal is not wanted by the business community of Cheshire; it is strongly resisted by the rural community in Cheshire and by its very active food production industry; and it does not have the support of all the citizens of Cheshire. I believe that, if we are to go forward as the Government propose, creating a new structure well into the future with the inevitable disruption that will occur, that will not be the best solution. I appreciate her point that sub-committees have been established and are working towards that end&#151;again, &#147;They would, wouldn&#146;t they?&#148;, as that is their role. I have no doubt that they will try their best to make whatever they have work.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08030471000011"></a>Neither have we found out what the financial implications are. The Minister made the point that it is not right for her to give certain information, but if people are to make the right decisions they need to understand the financial implications of these changes. History tells us that, every time we make decisions on the financial costs of local government change, those costs always end up at least twice as much as anyone ever anticipated. I am as certain as I can be that that will happen in this case. The implication of all the little things that the Minister has not mentioned or does not appear to have taken into consideration is that they will cause considerable problems. There are issues that are now dealt with by the county on a centralised basis, which everyone will find extremely difficult to divide into an east and a west.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08030471000012"></a>I return to my original proposal that there must be a much better understanding of the financial implications, which must be transparent and open to everyone. On that basis the people of Cheshire can be asked for their views. Surely if we are to make changes of this kind they need to be of such a quality and such a level that all those affected by them are behind them and can support them. So far, that has not happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08030471000013"></a>The noble Baroness makes the point that this is a difficult decision. Well, these are difficult decisions, because she is inundated with all kinds of pressure from all kinds of sources. But leadership must make those decisions away from the pressures, looking at the long-term picture of what is in the best interests of

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08030471000016"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, let me introduce you to the ancient, proud and historic location of the county of Cheshire and let me introduce you to the strange world of <I>Alice in Wonderland</I>, the creation of one of Cheshire&#146;s finest sons, Lewis Carroll. For tonight the Government plan to take us into Alice&#146;s Wonderland, to wipe the smile off the face of the Cheshire cat and to create two artificial entities of west and east Cheshire: two entities that have no friends, no heart, no history and no bottom, solidity or definition; two entities entirely devoid of that which gives communities and individuals character, place, definition and support. Tonight we forge two entities entirely bereft of location, location, location.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08030471000017"></a>I speak to my own amendment and support that of the noble Lord, Lord Wade, to try to avoid the break-up of this ancient, historic county of Cheshire, itself designated four star and still rising in its ability to respond to the people of Cheshire. Cheshire boasts of its chief executives in speaking of the quality of the people who have served this ancient county, even just over the past 30 years: Sir John Boynton was asked to help the Government out on the Rhodesia/Zimbabwe issue; Robin Wendt went on to work on care provision nationally; Colin Cheeseman is now a member of the Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society; Sir Michael Pitt recently reported on behalf of government on flooding; and Jeremy Taylor. That is the quality that the noble Lord, Lord Wade, was referring to&#151;the kind of quality that will be lost if Cheshire is lost.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08030471000018"></a>I strongly support the principle of unitary authorities. In a new incarnation, Cheshire can rise again as a single unitary. It has the capacity to absorb the 15 per cent of services currently given by the six district councils, because it supplies 80 to 85 per cent of existing work. It is ideally placed to oversee the transition, one of the follies of which is that there is no succeeding authority in existence to allow the collapsing of seven authorities into two. Of course, Cheshire can retain and, in its new incarnation, extend its reputation and its name as a county of bottom and worth&#151;a Rolls-Royce of a county, with a big engine, running smoothly, proudly and effectively at its heart, and a real place.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08030471000019"></a>My amendment to that of the noble Lord, Lord Wade, is designed not only to test the views of the people of Cheshire, but also to debate them in Parliament. I shall clarify the case for a single unitary but also plead for a delay, not as a delaying tactic but  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1040"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1040</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to ensure, if it is indeed the desire of this House and the other place to have two unitaries, that they are brought in successfully.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08030471000020"></a>The Minister&#146;s siren voice is saying, as we have heard tonight, that delay will postpone elections, that Chester City Council badly needs County Hall now in order to decant its people and that general mayhem will ensue. But the House of Lords is nothing if not the place to flag up dangers to the other House when it perceives them to be real. Indeed, the delay is not of our making. It is imperative, even if you think that the two unitaries are required. It is better to arrive at the best decision than the fastest decision.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08030471000021"></a>The delay is at the door of the Government and the district councils. The Government have hesitated three times in thinking about reorganisation in Cheshire since 2004. Only in July 2007, they dealt with five other unitaries with a clear verdict. However, this time, in looking at Cheshire, they said that what was proposed by the district councils and what was proposed by Cheshire County Council were both viable. They said that the five criteria were clearly passed by Cheshire County Council. Indeed, their problem was with the district councils. So poor and unconvincing were the district councils&#146; financial returns that the Government asked them to go away and redo the figures. They did not ask Cheshire County Council to do so, because it passed with flying colours.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08030471000022"></a>The Government reopened the matter and invited comments and then, abruptly, on 18 December last year&#151;the last day of term in your Lordships&#146; House and the other place&#151;they confirmed that they were minded to favour two unitaries over the single unitary. It is not on, for a Parliament that exists to scrutinise the Executive, for the Government to announce such a thing on the last day of term, shortly before Christmas when everyone went away.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08030471000023"></a>It was not only I who was surprised and it was not only Cheshire that was surprised that this decision was made in the dark days before Christmas. The Treasury was surprised, too. When I came back to your Lordships&#146; House, I opened a letter on 19 January from Andy Burnham at the Treasury, which said that the Government had not decided what to do with Cheshire, that the matter was out for consultation and that we were still going to go through the motions of examining the two possible solutions. I am grateful to my noble friend the Minister; when I brought this to her attention, she tried to clear the mess up. However, it was unsatisfactory. If there is delay, it has been brought about by my own dear Government.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08030471000024"></a>However, the district councils&#146; confusion did not help. The Government made great play of the proposals being from within Cheshire, originally sponsored, of course, by Chester City Council. It was claimed last week in the Commons debate that all six district councils supported the proposals. This is palpably false: Crewe and Nantwich has never supported them; Congleton has never supported them&#151;indeed, we hear of the judicial review that has been requested; and the original sponsor, Chester, no longer supports them, following its change of administration in the town hall. Ellesmere Port and Neston supported them, but tells me that it supported an entirely different proposal,  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1041"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1041</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which was to split the county into three unitaries so that it would be Ellesmere Port and Neston plus Chester, although without Vale Royal. It did not see the idea of Vale Royal being part of a unitary, but now it will be part of that unitary. Vale Royal is in turmoil. It supported the proposal on the chair&#146;s casting vote, which resulted in the resignation of a senior councillor who was upset. That leaves Macclesfield. Of course, Cheshire County Council has to be added to the six district councils. It has always been sceptical and, despite the hard work done by its officers and members, attempts to get some co-ordination with the district councils have failed.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08030480000001"></a>Large percentages are against the proposal. If we measure by the number of councils, their spending power and population, we have to conclude that a large majority are against. What about the Government&#146;s criterion of popular and stakeholder&#151;I prefer the phrase &#147;interested party&#148; to &#147;stakeholder&#148;, but I have to use it&#151;support? Crewe and Nantwich financed a countywide IPSOS Mori survey and, within Crewe and Nantwich, a local postal ballot in June 2007, which was approved by IPSOS Mori and scrutinised by external auditors. The countywide telephone survey demonstrated only 23 per cent support for the two unitaries. Some 30,000 postal ballot papers were returned and produced a figure of 5 per cent&#151;one in 20&#151;in favour of the two unitaries. In June 2007, BMG produced a preference survey for Cheshire County Council in which only one in four was in favour of the two unitaries. Since then support has slipped and opposition has mounted.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08030480000002"></a>In last week&#146;s Commons debate, Minister Healey talked about the necessity of providing a broad cross-section of support in Cheshire for these proposals to have two unitaries. Let us have a look at the broad cross-section of support. Let me name those who broadly support it. Mr Healey quoted AstraZeneca; Cheshire Building Society; East Cheshire NHS Trust; Western Cheshire Primary Care Trust; West Cheshire College; the Highways Agency; and Age Concern East Cheshire. That is it. Contrast that with the opponents: Cheshire Police Authority; Cheshire Fire Authority, of which I shall speak more; the Probation Service; Cheshire Association of Governing Bodies; Cheshire Association of Secondary Headteachers; Cheshire Association of Special School Headteachers; Cheshire Association of Primary Headteachers; Age Concern Cheshire; Merseyside and Cheshire Ambulance Trust; Central and Eastern Cheshire PCT; Cheshire Association of Local Councils; Cheshire Federation of Women&#146;s Institutes; Cheshire Federation of Young Farmers Clubs; Reaseheath College; Age Concern; Cheshire Landscape Trust&#151;I declare an interest; Manchester Airport plc; Cheshire Crimebeat; and the National Trust. I am not sure of the position of the chess club in Chester, but that does not represent a broad cross-section.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08030480000003"></a>Minister Healey also invoked the parish councils. He said that six out of 20 parishes were in favour of the two unitaries. The truth of the matter is, as the DCLG&#146;s paper demonstrated, that of the 53 parishes that replied, 48 were against. The failure to publish the DCLG responses has provoked more concern about the responses of the people of Cheshire to these proposals. We know that there were 906 responses,  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1042"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1042</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but the Government have published or allowed us to see only 233. Even the 233 responses from people and institutions in Cheshire show that only 5 per cent&#151;one in 20&#151;are for the proposed two unitaries.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08030480000004"></a>Your Lordships&#146; esteemed Merits Committee has pronounced on this. It sought only to pronounce on the response. There has already been talk about that this evening. When your Lordships comment on something, the most moderate of language is used. This is a compendium of those who are against the proposals and it is a source book for those who wish to see why that is the case. This is the conclusion of our Merits Committee:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="08030480000099"></a>&#147;We recognise that creating two new authorities to run some of the most complex services, such as child protection and adult care, must pose particular challenges. We understand the Government&#146;s wish to achieve an early resolution of the uncertainties caused by re-organisation, but suggest that this should be weighed carefully against allowing more preparation time for the new authorities to be established, bearing in mind the complexities that have been identified&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08030480000089"></a>Other noble Lords will speak to that, but children&#146;s and adult&#146;s services are complex issues, with which the members and officers of district councils are unfamiliar. The Minister said tonight that the Merits Committee gave some sort of green light, but I think it is far from that and as deep an amber and as near to red as could be found.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08030480000005"></a>I shall amplify two areas of particular concern that have already been labelled as those that oppose the two-unitaries solution. One is the fire authority. The chief fire officer has been in contact with me because he is worried that the concerns about running a proper fire service in Cheshire have not been recognised by the Government. The fire authority writes that,</p>
<ul><a name="08030480000107"></a>&#147;the Fire Authority will be heavily impacted by the changes to the council structures in Cheshire, both from a partnership perspective, and constitutionally ... Although earlier Government guidance suggested that arrangements for reconstituting the Fire Authority would be dealt with separately, we feel that it is both inconsiderate and naive of the Government for the Order to be issued without explicitly recognising the impact on organisations which draw their Members from affected Authorities, such as ourselves and the police authority.</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="08030480000100"></a>Moreover, the inability to spell out what impact the transitional arrangements will have on the Fire Authority and at what point changes will be made to our constitutional arrangements, is likely to damage the objective of establishing strong arrangements for empowering local communities&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08030480000090"></a>What are the criteria that have been put forward by the Government? Like the new and existing councils, the fire authority will have to ensure continuity of services, despite potential changes to over half the existing membership.</p>

<a name="80304-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08030480000006"></a>Let me now turn to the schools sector. I very much regret that despite many requests Ed Balls, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, has not met those of us from Cheshire who would have liked to have put him right about these issues. I quote from a letter of 26 February from the All Cheshire Schools&#146; Heads and Governors Association, which is a very comprehensive group of people. It says that the worries it has have about this hasty transition are the priority of education for the new authority; the new authorities&#146; financial positions and individual school budgets&#151;they are not known;  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1043"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1043</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>changes to centrally provided services; and the influence and authority of the directors of children&#146;s and adult&#146;s services. It also says,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="08030480000101"></a>&#147;These concerns, are, we believe, causing some schools to lose their focus on raising standards and divert their energies to combating perceived threats. A few of our schools are even considering what we consider precipitate and perhaps inappropriate courses of action to combat those perceived threats. It would therefore be most helpful if the DCSF, as the only currently existing body&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08030480000091"></a>because there is no succeeding body&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08030480000108"></a>&#147;with ongoing responsibility and authority could provide the reassurances that we seek. But the government must understand that if the finances of the two unitary councils are weak from the outset&#151;and they will be&#151;then the new authorities will inevitably struggle to provide the same services as at present&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80304-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08030480000007"></a>Finally, it states:</p>
<ul>

<p><a name="08030480000094"></a>the Minister&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08030480000110"></a>&#147;is utterly wrong that good progress is being made. There is not even get an agreed implementation plan. He is right that the process is challenging. In all other areas, county councils are absorbing districts and there is a continuity of authority approach. In Cheshire there is no continuing authority and the county council functions need to be disaggregated. There is no precedent for this and yet there is an expectation of working to the same timescales as other new unitary councils. The timescale will be achieved, but not in a smooth fashion and not without great cost, upheaval and distress&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08030480000009"></a>Interestingly, in her opening address, my noble friend said that there are examples from the past&#151;Berkshire, for instance, in 1974. But when Berkshire was split, it went down to the five existing district councils. Therefore, they had a fair start. Mention of Avon and Humberside is astonishing. They were unloved from the beginning and when there was the opportunity to get rid of them, people were pleased to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08030480000010"></a>We are talking about the county of Cheshire, which has been here for a thousand years. Cheshire County Council is a Rolls-Royce county. It has men and women with huge experience of public service. When it is asked to do something, it attempts to do it. I hear from the county council that officers and councillors are coming in from the district councils who know not what they are taking on, in terms of the sizable services, the implications for children and adult services, or anything else.</p>

When I was concerned with Cheshire County Council in the north-west, it was imperative that Cheshire County Council spoke with one voice. Otherwise, we in the north-west lost the gravitational power of Liverpool, of Manchester and of Lancashire. As the noble Lord, Lord Wade of Chorlton, mentioned the report from Salford University, which routs the proposition that somehow Cheshire in the west and Cheshire in the east gravitate towards Liverpool and Manchester, whereas in fact they have a unique, strong and thriving economy within themselves, I will not repeat that.</p>

In the case of Cheshire, that was the River Tame, the River Mersey, the Derbyshire hills and the Welsh border in particular. The church followed that, so the Diocese of Chester, when it was formed in its modern size, followed the Victorian county of Cheshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08030480000018"></a>In 1974, there was radical change, with about a third of the diocese, in population terms, moving into the new metropolitan counties of Merseyside and Greater Manchester. Subsequently, there was the formation of Holton and Warrington unitary authorities, spanning either side of the Mersey. So modern Cheshire is about half what it was until 1974. The past 30 years have seen further evolution in the former areas of Cheshire, with the demise of the metropolitan county structure and the emergence of the unitary authorities of the Wirral, Tameside, Stockport and Trafford, which impinge in various ways on the old county.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08030480000019"></a>My diocese now comprises the current county of Cheshire plus the various areas which have been affected by that series of reorganisations. My ministry has been across all those areas for the past 11 years and I have learnt to love, respect and serve them equally. One conclusion that I have drawn is that, when it comes to local government, it must be local and relate to local realities, beliefs, practices, traditions and aspirations. People do not want a sense of local government being imposed against the will of local people, being imposed roughshod.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08030480000020"></a>On the details of the proposal before us, although all the changes of the past 30 years or so have been happening to the north, the current county of Cheshire, with its county council and six district councils, has generally worked well. I endorse all that the two noble Lords who have just spoken have said about that. The county council in particular can claim a great deal of credit for its consistently excellent performance, which has been acknowledged by successive performance reviews. I imply no criticism of the district councils, with their more limited and local remits, but there has been overwhelming appreciation for the work of local government in Cheshire.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08030480000021"></a>In the performance assessments that have been made, the education service has always been a special beacon of excellence. I can testify to that from my direct experience of visiting very many schools&#151;infant, junior and secondary&#151;as well as the quite exceptional special schools that are such a credit to Cheshire. Current school provision across the county is generally good. I know this from comments of my clergy who move around the diocese with children. I very rarely have any problem with children not settling into new schools. In other parts of the country, a different tale is often told. I was therefore not surprised to see that those who are responsible locally for schools, as we have heard, have made particular and unanimous representations against the current proposals. As we all know, education is a very sensitive subject today in society, and indeed in politics, and rightly so. The unanimity of opposition from those responsible for educational provision to the proposals should be weighed particularly carefully.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08030480000022"></a>If what I have said so far is broadly accurate, we may well ask why we do not leave things as they are and encourage the county and the six districts to deepen and develop their partnerships and joint

As the Minister said at the outset, that was one of the possibilities which the White Paper and the subsequent Bill permitted. If it ain&#146;t broke, don&#146;t fix it. In many ways, reflecting on the discussions of the past year or two, that would have been the wiser course. It is not where we are now. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, that the single unitary authority has obvious objective merits, but the path to get to that other than by a process of much better consensus has been stony and difficult.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08030480000023"></a>Having seven different councils can look a little complex and messy, and so to some extent it was and is, but Cheshire is best seen as a fellowship, a family, of quite distinct, yet closely related and competent, communities: from Neston to Macclesfield, from Congleton, Crewe and Nantwich to Chester, from Alderley and Knutsford to Middlewich and Malpas&#151;I could name many others&#151;each with their strong local institutions and civic traditions, their town and district mayors. I have met dozens of them over the years. All of them are a credit to the county, and all aim to serve their people and to be examples of what we have heard of so far.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08030480000024"></a>The present two-tier arrangements may have degrees of inefficiency, but they are honed to work well and are widely appreciated, so where did the impetus for change come from? Inevitably, we would need to delve into the rather murky world of local politics to understand what started this current juggernaut to roll. There was also a belief, which came to be shared more widely, that a real case can be made for unitary local government. I accept that. Indeed, I lived through it in Yorkshire where I was a vicar before I went to Chester when Humberside County Council was dismantled.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08030480000025"></a>From a combination of political boxing and coxing, on which I would rather not speculate, and from a sense that in an ideal world the unitary structure probably was best, two clear proposals emerged: for a single unitary authority based on the current county boundaries; and for two unitary authorities based on an east-west split. The problem with the east-west split is that there is no natural geographical, social, cultural or business north-south boundary in Cheshire; it is a purely arbitrary line that is drawn to separate east and west in the way that is proposed.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08030480000026"></a>Unsurprisingly, given the strong traditions and many very able people involved in local government in the area, both these proposals were recognised as meeting at least most of the criteria which the Government had set down&#151;for affordability, strategic leadership, empowerment of neighbourhoods, and value for money in public services&#151;although the evidence that I have seen suggested that the bid for a single unitary authority would produce better value for money. It is much less clear to me that either proposal has support across a broad cross-section of partners and stakeholders. Indeed, in one sense it is a little illogical to pretend that both can, because in one sense they are mutually exclusive. This seems to be recognised in paragraphs 7.12 and 7.13 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the order. Paragraph 7.12 says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="08030480000105"></a>&#147;In all areas, a wide range of views was expressed&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08030480000096"></a>That is, there was a lack of consensus right across the views that were expressed. Indeed, if you were to distil the consensus, as has been said, it would be for the single unitary authority.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08030480000027"></a>On proposals to restructure this House, the Government are on record as saying that consensus is by far the best way to proceed. There is no consensus in Cheshire for either of the present unitary proposals, not least for the Government&#146;s present proposal. It does seem that the process has gone badly wrong somewhere along the line to get us to where we are this evening. If we need a clear demonstration of the lack of consensus, we need only look at page 9 of the summary of responses in the stakeholder consultation. I will not go through them&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, has already done that very effectively&#151;but it is difficult to read them and pretend that there is consensus for the proposal for two unitary authorities. One is left wondering why the Government have decided on the other option of two unitary authorities. It certainly does not seem to have been decided on the merits of the case, certainly not to the people of Cheshire. That is why I shall support the amendments.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08030480000028"></a>Let me emphasise that I, and everyone in Cheshire whom I know, will work hard to make work whatever is put into effect, however hard that will be. There is the good will and desire at the end of the day to make things work, but it is very difficult, speaking on behalf of the community in which I minister, to realise that we are starting from such an unsatisfactory proposal. In the short term, there will be much disruption, despite the good will with which the transition will be attempted. In the longer term, I fear especially for the educational provision, which has justly received beacon status and which is so important to the communities themselves. The Government say that achieving a broad cross-section of support does not mean doing a head count of those who support what is being proposed, but that what is being proposed is in the best interests of the people of Cheshire. I can tell the House that people want good schools and good education. They have it. They want a director of education, not a director of adult and children&#146;s services all combined together. That is one of the ways in which the two unitary authorities proposal is made to be affordable: by lumping too many things together.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08030480000029"></a>Let me draw my remarks to a close with a more general point. Those who favour the two-unitary solution have tended to do so on the basis that, whereas west Cheshire relates to Liverpool, east Cheshire relates to Manchester. The summary of responses speaks of city regional strategies in this regard, and the Secretary of State&#146;s letter giving her decision contains similar hints. I do not believe that the people of Cheshire think of themselves as outlying citizens of city regions. There is simply very little evidence that they think in that way. They think first and foremost with pride of the deep historic links in Cheshire itself. Perhaps those in the areas that were detached in 1974 have come to think of themselves as relating primarily to Manchester and Liverpool, but not those in modern Cheshire, which has many  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1048"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1048</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>thriving rural and semi-rural areas along with urban areas such as Crewe. The essential unity of Cheshire as such has emerged quite clearly once again during the recent recession in agriculture. One of the things I fear is that, if government agendas are driven so much by city and urban agendas, rural policy will not be given its own integrity and proper consideration. That is one of the consequences of driving a wedge through what is clearly the integrated agricultural county of Cheshire itself. So I hope that there is yet time for the Government to think again, hard though that may be to contemplate, to consult the people of Cheshire more fully and to ponder the right way forward before continuing on the present hasty path.</p>

It is true to say that debate over local government reorganisation in Cheshire has raged between the local authorities for more than a year. The decision has gone to replays and extra time, and many are now of the view that we must get behind the Government&#146;s decision. However, this is not the preferred option of Cheshire residents generally and I support all the comments made by my noble friend Lord Harrison and the noble Lord, Lord Wade. Indeed, we three Cheshire Peers have been agreed together, as with the business community and the majority of stakeholder responses, in supporting the county council&#146;s proposal for a single unitary authority. Throughout the debate I have been very encouraged by the Minister. She has listened and has taken forward several reports and submissions that I have introduced to her and to her colleagues in another place. It is very disappointing that all three Cheshire Peers have struggled to get audiences with Ministers on their case.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08030480000031"></a>The Government have judged the two submissions for unitary authorities on five criteria; namely, affordability, strategic leadership, stakeholder support, empowering local people and communities, and the quality of public services. The submission for a single unitary authority wins on every one, and in the most comprehensive fashion on the affordability criteria.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08030480000032"></a>The affordability case put forward in the submission for two unitary authorities has been the subject of several challenges. Throughout the review process, the county has expressed deep reservations about the financial robustness of the two-unitary option. Indeed, there has been a constant shifting of the figures. The final figures submitted on 1 October 2007 have served only to intensify this concern. The transition costs have increased from &#163;16.6 million to &#163;23.7 million, with the ongoing savings reducing from &#163;30 million to &#163;23.5 million. The Government are less than confident on those figures and have admitted that the objective of creating two new unitary authorities cannot be achieved within the cost and savings envelope set out in the original proposal. The Government called in the IPF. This is highlighted in the Explanatory Memorandum to the order, which imposes new expectations of costs and savings on the shadow authorities. This has been done on the basis of advice received from the IPF, which has not been made public.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08030480000033"></a>The county council was assured of transparency in the assessment process and the conclusion that can be

The new figures change the whole basis of the implementation process. They call into question any conclusions of Deloitte, which was appointed to carry out a risk assessment on behalf of the district councils.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08030480000034"></a>Surely, the ratepayers of Cheshire should be able to assess the assumptions, the assessments and the working figures of the IPF report which it used to reach its conclusion. This is the basis on which I put forward my amendment in the absence of this report being made fully available. It is now clear however that no matter whether we look at the independent review from Local Government Futures&#151;the assessment done on behalf of the county&#151;or the assessments done by the department, the impact of this reorganisation will be costly. The county will be divided into two. Both unitaries will be faced with direct economic problems and they will both lose money.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08030480000035"></a>The Local Government Futures review investigated the potential impact of any local government reorganisation in April 2009 on the allocation of the formula grant within the county. Under the current needs-based national methodology, the report concluded that the west Cheshire unitary would be entitled to &#163;82.7 million for formula grant and the east &#163;54.1 million. However, the proposed two-unitary model allocates only &#163;76.4 million to the west and &#163;60.4 million to the east. This local agreement deprives the west of &#163;6.3 million of formula grant per annum for each of the next three years&#151;the equivalent of almost 2.5 per cent on council tax. Effectively, this funding has been permanently lost in the form of a financial subsidy to the east, as in three years&#146; time the national grant distribution formula will be applied to the two unitaries using their locally agreed allocation as the base. The latest information from the Department for Communities and Local Government would seem to confirm the intention to recalculate the formula grant in this way.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08030480000036"></a>It is unrealistic to assume that one authority will agree to provide a substantial financial subsidy to the other; it could be in breach of an authority&#146;s fiduciary duties to its council tax payers. For the new unitary in the west, there would be genuine concern that the richer east, as defined through the objective needs-based formula, is being subsidised to the tune of more than &#163;6 million per annum on a permanent basis. It is difficult to see how this would be acceptable to the council tax payers of Cheshire West and Chester who would be paying this subsidy through higher council taxes and/or reduced services. For the new unitary in the east, the concern would be the unenforceable nature of this local agreement. Clearly, if the national formula is used instead, this would result in the east losing out by &#163;6 million compared to the current submission by the districts. That would only add to concerns over the financial viability of the districts&#146; submission for the east.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08030480000037"></a>It is vital that a full, independent financial assessment is undertaken when the county council&#146;s view points to a frightening scenario. Reserves are overstated and would be insufficient to meet the cash flow requirements of reorganisation. The two new unitaries would in

Far from achieving the required five-year payback, the proposed solution would now cost some &#163;103 million and, therefore, fails to meet the affordability criteria. Both new authorities will begin life with inadequate finances to sustain existing service levels and are highly dependent on quick transformation. The objectives of the reorganisation and of the order are unlikely to be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08030480000039"></a>Those individuals and organisations believe that this is a carve-up which has been steamrollered through another place; which the Government intend to steamroller through to implementation; and would steamroller it through your Lordships&#146; House had they not found such a lot of opposition tonight. I agree with them. They also believe that the Government&#146;s refusal to reveal the financial basis of the decision is also a cover-up, with which I also agree.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08030480000040"></a>I oppose the order and I support the amendments for four reasons. First, some of the assumptions are flawed. I shall give three from a letter to the chief executive of Cheshire County Council, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="08030480000106"></a>&#147;Cheshire would be too big for a unitary county council. There was a natural line dividing east from west ... cities provided the best form of local government&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08030480000097"></a>for Cheshire. Those assumptions are completely flawed. First, there are 12 counties and unitaries that are bigger than Cheshire on any criteria that one might like to look at. Are they to be split as well? Secondly, on the natural dividing line, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester has made it clear that there is no such natural dividing line. As a long-time resident of Cheshire, I very much agree with that. Thirdly, the idea that the cities of Liverpool and Manchester provide the focus for local government for rural Cheshire is completely ludicrous. The needs of a shire county are very different from those of a city.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08030480000041"></a>My second reason is that I believe that there is the tiniest amount of public support and organisational support for this proposal. It is delusional of the Government to think that there is &#147;sufficient support&#148;. There is not. I shall not go through all the figures quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, but they speak for themselves. It is nonsense to say that we want to consult local people and then not ask them properly, and certainly not listen to them. In another place the Minister listed seven organisations which support the proposals we are debating tonight, but the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, and I have a list of 19 organisations that are against it.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08030480000042"></a>My third reason is one that noble Lords would expect from me. I am very concerned about schools and children&#146;s services. Many noble Lords will have received letters from every single head of organisation  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1051"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1051</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in Cheshire and every single one expressed severe concerns. I have also heard from the Cheshire branch of the NUT. I shall give just two reasons out of the many cited. At present, we have a director of children&#146;s services who has overall responsibility for the implementation of the very ambitious Every Child Matters agenda. Now it is proposed that we have one director of children&#146;s and adult&#146;s services. That is simply not good enough; the agenda is too big and the magnitude of the task too great for one person, and I fear that children&#146;s services will suffer. The second reason given is school budgets. This Government sensibly announce school budgets three years ahead so that schools have stability and can plan properly. Because we have no continuing authorities under these proposals, schools will not be able to do that.</p>

<a name="80304-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08030480000043"></a>Finally, the timescale is completely mad. We have here an unprecedented reorganisation, the third for Cheshire in 15 years. I do wish governments would leave Cheshire alone to get on with it. Cheshire provides a very high quality education, and always has. I used to be a member of a school governing body in Cheshire, so I know that from my personal experience. To suggest that you can go through a change such as this one, a change that is totally unprecedented, in the same timescale as some of the other reorganisations that have been proposed is quite barmy.</p>

The arguments put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Wade of Chorlton, in support of his amendment are compelling and I do not think it is either necessary or helpful for me to repeat them. Whether in the end the decision is adhered to and the Government&#146;s proposal is accepted, the arguments in favour of a fuller and further inquiry, as proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Wade, seem to be incontrovertible. If they are not incontrovertible, at least there is a strongly arguable case for what the noble Lord has proposed. I strongly support him. If his amendment is accepted, it would follow that the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, also has great strength and merit. I would support it as well.</p>

Another was touched on by the right reverend Prelate: will these proposals meet the needs of local people, especially the rural population? The third is that, unless I misheard her, I thought the Minister said that some of the data were equivocal. If all those questions arise, it seems to me that the Government should think again, particularly with respect to the second question about the needs of local people. Moreover, the equivocal nature of the data is an important aspect. I do not wish to extend the debate with my comments but I strongly support the amendment of my noble friend Lord Wade.</p>

I do not know Cheshire well enough to be in any position to speak, and it would be impertinent of me to talk about boundaries and the particular alignment of districts, the political history, and the changes of political control which have produced alternative voices on reorganisation issues. But perhaps I may make a few comments about process as I understand it from the papers I have studied and the careful attention I have paid to the debate tonight.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08030480000048"></a>I sympathise with the noble Lord, Lord Wade, and my noble Lord Harrison on their instinctive feel for the history of the historic county of Cheshire, but I understand that the county of Cheshire is not being split into two. That somehow assumes that only the county is a local authority, and that it is being divvied up in some way. In fact, under this order, seven councils are to become two councils. Moreover, the notion that Cheshire has been an unchanging historic entity over the centuries does not conform to my understanding. Changes have already taken place in the historic county of Cheshire, in 1974 and again in the mid-1990s with the Banham review, when I believe my noble friend Lord Hoyle successfully won the case for Warrington being given independent unitary status. These things change over time as populations and business pressures change, and as needs alter.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08030480000049"></a>I understand that there was always the option of no change at all. My honourable friend in the other place, Mr Healey, extended an invitation to local authorities, saying that it was up to them whether they responded to seeking the unitary structures that, like the noble Lord, Lord Wade, I support. I believe the county council initially proposed a unitary council and that as a result, some of the alternative proposals for two or three unitaries, were brought up&#151;</p>

I do not want noble Lords to be kept for too long.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08030480000052"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Wade, I agree with the sympathies for a unitary authority, but Cheshire has not been untouched over the years. I think it is therefore reasonable to look at whether the proposed changes will offer the best value for the citizens of Cheshire. Recent research has been circulated by boundary committees in other local authorities which tries to connect the size of a local authority with its performance. It is based on best value performance indicators, comprehensive performance assessment value-for-money indicators and so on. Obviously the results are ambiguous, with some going one way and some the other, but it is clear from the report that in general, once a population goes beyond 450,000 to 480,000 there are real diseconomies of scale in some services. The two proposed unitaries would be for  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1053"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1053</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>populations of around 320,000 and 360,000 respectively and are therefore the optimum size, based on recent published research. Cheshire, with a population of some 650,000, goes well beyond the optimum.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08030480000053"></a>I take the point made by the noble Baroness that many unitary authorities are larger than Cheshire. However, this is not just about numbers. It also concerns geographical spread. In that sense we cannot compare a county with a densely populated, compact city. There is a real problem, if you have solely a unitary county, of whether at the end of it you have anything that could be called &#147;local&#148; government.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08030480000054"></a>The research also shows that the cost/benefit savings between two-unitary option and the single-unitary option are about the same. It is clear, as my noble friend has explained on previous occasions when we have considered orders of this kind, that this is not about head-counting, but seeing whether there is sufficient support on a well-informed basis, including the business community, for the changes proposed to make them workable. The fact that considerable evidence in the other place showed that the existing authorities are beginning to work well together to deliver these objectives seems to suggest that my noble friend&#146;s more pragmatic approach is a more valid one.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08030480000055"></a>Finally, we have heard from the courts today. The judicial review and the appeal process both support the Government, so the courts are saying that there is no reason for delay. I suggest to your Lordships that further delay and possible further doubts about how the future may go will serve only to dislocate a process to the disadvantage of services and staff, of the citizens of Cheshire, and of the resulting follow-on authorities. I hope that noble Lords will agree with that approach and not seek further to delay the order tonight.</p>

However, it is also about the realities of people&#146;s loyalties; their understanding of where they belong and with whom they identify.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08030480000057"></a>The noble Baroness also said that this was not a split into two, but that is not the perception of those who live in Cheshire, which I do not. But I have listened with great respect to those Peers from Cheshire who have spoken and, certainly from the correspondence that I have received, I am very clear that people see their county being dismembered for research which may or may not be valid but which certainly does not take into account the reality, as people see it, on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08030480000058"></a>In her opening statement the Minister made it clear that the forces which are leading the Government to choose the two unitary authorities revolve around affinity to the large cities of Liverpool and Manchester, to the west and to the east respectively. As the right reverend Prelate said, the people of Cheshire do not see themselves as outlying citizens of city areas. If I lived in Cheshire, which my family did at one time&#151;my mother&#146;s family&#151;and still do, I would be outraged at the idea that the county should be seen as something

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08030480000059"></a>I agree that brevity is very important on this occasion. I wish to make it very clear, if I have not already, that I very much support my noble friend Lord Wade.</p>

<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="08030480000060"></a><b><a name="80304-0012.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08030480000126"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> My Lords, I start by apologising to the Minister for missing the first couple of minutes of her introduction&#151;she seemed to slip her leash a little early&#151;but I got the gist of what she was saying in the remainder of her speech.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08030480000061"></a>It has been 40 years since I lived in Cheshire. I do not claim to be a Cheshire person but, after listening to the debate and the contributions from around the House, I find it difficult to make many points of contact with anyone who has been speaking about anything. I was concerned whether I should say anything at all because I disagree with everyone. The person with whom I came nearest to finding points of contact was the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, who introduced a degree of reality into the debate and an understanding of the background of local democracy and what it is all about. I agreed with about a quarter of what she said, perhaps a little more.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08030480000062"></a>I cannot support the concept behind the amendments that if there is to be a reorganisation to unitary authorities in Cheshire it should be a unitary county. Cheshire consists of many towns of different sizes and kinds&#151;vibrant towns in many cases&#151;and large areas of contrasting countryside; the idea that a unitary authority over such a large area is the ideal form of local government does not seem to be right. In fact, I would challenge whether such an authority could any longer be called &#147;local&#148;.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08030480000063"></a>Manchester has fewer people than the new Cheshire would have, but big cities such as Birmingham, and perhaps some others, are communities in themselves. Cheshire consists of a vast constellation of communities, many of them interlinked in a complex way. Indeed, there is no point in pretending that there are not many people in Cheshire, particularly in the north-east and in the west, who look to Manchester and Liverpool as their main centres of employment&#151;it is where they commute to&#151;and they have moved out. They are part of those economic regions. But that is not an argument for incorporating them in city regions. Indeed, in parts of the south of Cheshire people would look to Stoke-on-Trent, and to Newcastle, perhaps, in some areas.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08030480000064"></a>The questions of what kind of place Cheshire is is crucial. I do not like these proposed two new unitaries which seem not to make a great deal of sense. If you are going to divide Cheshire into two, that might be the best way to do it, but we are back to the obsession of this country with local authorities having to be larger than in any other part of the democratic world. We already have the largest local authorities in the democratic world and the Government are trying to make them even larger. I oppose that general trend. That is why I cannot support the Government in their Motion, but I certainly cannot support the amendments, which would make it far worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08030480000065"></a>On the question of timescale and delay, if this is going to happen it is important to have elections as soon as possible. That is what is happening here&#151;although not in all the new unitaries&#151;so at least the people who are setting up the new authority have got democratic accountability and credibility. The decision to go for early elections is right, although it causes all political parties&#151;not least my own&#151;great difficulties. If you are going to do it, 12 months is long enough.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08030480000066"></a>In 1973-74 the whole of local government in England&#151;apart from Greater London&#151;was reorganised. It was all two-tier; there was an upper tier&#151;the counties&#151;and the metropolitan areas. Everywhere outside Greater London was reorganised and it was not a disaster; it happened very efficiently in many areas. Many counties were set up that people thought were abominations and it is an interesting observation that the councils which have not been successful and have not taken off, whether at county level or at district level, were artificial creations. Places such as Tyne and Wear, I think it was called, and Avon were totally artificial creations and they were abolished. Of the districts which were created&#151;south-east this and north-west that and places that had to be invented with funny names which people did not know before the district was created&#151;some have been successful and many have not.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08030480000067"></a>I worry that authorities have to be given names such as East Cheshire or Cheshire East, West Cheshire or Cheshire West and Chester because you cannot think of sensible names to give them that people would know referred to that particular area.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08030480000068"></a>My final point is that local democracy and local government in this country are in crisis. Most of the debate has been about efficiency, economics, loyalties to areas and so on. The Minister talked about what really mattered being the long-term outcomes. I do not say for a moment that these things are not crucial; you have to have what is now called best value, efficient structures and structures that make sense in an economic way. However, no one has been talking about local democracy. The vision of what local democracy in this country ought to be about in future is something we all ought to start talking about seriously.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08030480000069"></a>One of the problems with local democracy is that it needs councillors. Reorganisations that reduce the number of elected councillors mean that everyone has to represent more areas and spend more time doing what councillors do on the council rather than in the community. That is an erosion of my vision of local democracy.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08030480000070"></a>Towns are important places when it comes to civic involvement, civic culture and, if you like, civic vibrancy. It is the towns, by and large; I am not saying that villages do not have their own institutions, society and all the rest of it since they clearly do, but the civic culture of this country&#151;the word &#147;civic&#148; shows this&#151;is based essentially on towns. It is always towns that give the lead. The problem with lumping towns together in hotchpotch authorities&#151;even quite large towns that have a real sense of civic pride and civic involvement, whether Macclesfield, Crewe or  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1056"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1056</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Ellesmere Point&#151;is that some of those towns will lose out in terms of status and future involvement. Many of the casualties of previous reorganisations, particularly the one in 1974, were towns that had a vibrant civic culture but lost it. Keighley, for example, was forced screaming into Bradford, and a great deal of its problems since then have been because it lost its civic culture and has had nothing; it became just two or three wards in Bradford. There are towns like that all over the country that got taken into hotchpotch, larger, amalgamated local authorities in 1974. What worries me about somewhere like east Cheshire or west Cheshire is that that is the fate that awaits some of those towns, which might not be resilient enough to avoid it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08030480000073"></a>We on these Benches support the principle of unitary government. However, it is a question of process. It is disingenuous of the Minister, however, to talk about this as a bottom-up process. The Government set the ball rolling, they have set all the frameworks within which these decisions have been made and they have made the decision to give Cheshire the two-authority solution. It is even more disingenuous to pretend that somehow it is the councils themselves that have come up with this solution. If local authorities were able to work together and share a vision for local government in their area, we would not be talking about local government review at all; we would live in a sort of two-tier nirvana where everyone worked well and the citizens all knew what everyone did. It is precisely because of the rivalries between councils that two-tier working has problems, and that is why we have this process now. To pretend that we can leave it all to the local councils and that what emerges is consensus is quite clearly flawed from the outset.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08030480000074"></a>All the financial information, and all the ways in which support has been expressed and assessed, has been provided by local authorities that have a vested interest in the outcome. What has been lacking is any sense of how the Government have assessed all that. Among the public and what the Government like to call the stakeholders, there is no real sense of confidence about how the Government have assessed the information they have been given by local authorities. The Government have made that even worse by claiming an exemption from freedom of information when it comes to the financial aspects. Just because you can claim an exemption from freedom of information does not mean that you should. In this case, more transparency would have done a great service to this process by showing the basis on which these decisions were made.</p>

It has been suggested that the transitional costs are about &#163;17 million and the efficiency savings about &#163;30 million. It is a highly optimistic payback period. When we debated the other orders last week, I asked the Minister what would happen in the event of those calculations being inaccurate. She made it very clear that it would be for the councils themselves to deal with the fallout from that; in other words, if councils have got their sums wrong, whether through overenthusiasm to make their case or because they do not understand the big services, it will be local people who will be hit by a combination of council tax rises, cuts in services or both together.</p>

If they are so robust, why are the Government not prepared to underwrite these costs? Why are they saying that it has to fall back on the councils? I fear that the district tier always underestimates the challenges involved in providing education and social care; they are services on a scale of which that tier has no experience.

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08030480000077"></a>There are three reasons why one would consider local government review. The first is that people want it. Well, I have seen no evidence to suggest a great clamour anywhere in Cheshire for this review. The second is that the process of review would provide economies and somehow be cheaper. It might be, but we do not know because government will not let us see the figures. The third reason is that services would be improved. However, the current council is already a four-star authority; it is a highly rated council; so there is no evidence to suggest that services will be improved by this process.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08030480000078"></a>The process in the case of Cheshire is very hurried. It is the only outcome from the current round of reviews which has created totally new councils. The authority which is providing 80 per cent of the services is to disappear, and we are to have a new authority within 12 months. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, that we should not delay making the decision, because that would leave a vacuum and make life very difficult. However, it is possible to delay the implementation a little longer. I am worried that we are to have elections this year. Many of the decisions have already been made. Due to the way in which the timetable has been set, they have been made by officers. There is no political leadership in the way that the Government have said that they want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08030480000079"></a>It is unclear what the Government are seeking to achieve by reorganisation in Cheshire. There have always been problems with two-tier working and there always will be, but, in this case, it is possible that the cure is worse than the disease.</p>

<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="08030480000080"></a><b><a name="80304-0012.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08030480000128"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> My Lords, if we have listened to a classic tale of how things should not be done, then this is it. When I was in local government, we used to have an apocryphal tale of how Governments came to conclusions on anything. It ran along the lines that a problem was perceived, which was soon identified across the department. Eventually, some bright little clerk at about the fourth tier would say, &#147;Well, my gosh, this is a solution&#148;. He would talk to his superior, who would say, &#147;Yes, by gosh, that might work. That&#146;s a solution&#148;. And he would talk to his superior, who would talk to the Permanent Secretary, who would talk to the Minister. And that was that. Of course, I am sure that that is not what is happening here.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08030480000081"></a>What we have been talking about, tragically, is process. This is the end of the process. I hope that, when we get to the end, the noble Baroness will say, &#147;Well, these are non-fatal amendments and, in fact, the order will be implemented&#148;. It seems to me that, whatever we say tonight, that is going to be the reality, which we unfortunately have to recognise. If the Minister is going to say anything else, I shall be very surprised.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08030480000082"></a>Other counties or areas are climbing up this greasy pole. The real question is whether the process is sufficient and sufficiently robust. Here, I come to the conclusion that the Government have been at fault, because they have not released sufficient information to the public for them to be persuaded. If one has listened to the whole of this debate, it is clear that, as people increasingly realised the implications of what was being proposed, opposition to those proposals strengthened. That is not unusual, but the problem is that there is no mechanism within the system to allow that opposition to have explanations or, when the opposition is as strong as it is in this case, to change the decision. This decision has not changed one iota, as far as I can see, from the original proposition. The Government will of course say that they invited proposals and they got these proposals. But the problem for the Government is that they then choose the wrong conclusions. The difficulty that they have is that they cannot get off that hook.</p>

<a name="80304-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08030480000083"></a>This is not a happy situation to be in. One report that I saw said that the process corrupts the body politic. That is a highly opinionated report and I would not give it any greater credence than that, but it is written by academics. We should never as a Government allow ourselves to get into a position where that could be an academic view of what was going on in government. It is incredibly damaging to the whole structure&#151;everything that we do and that we stand for as a House of Parliament.</p>

I am sorry for Cheshire. I have listened to the story and I am all too familiar with the territory&#151;not with Cheshire as a county, but with what has happened. That die was cast a long time ago and it is a warning to other authorities in the country that they need to look at what has happened to Cheshire. They need to examine what has been said in this debate tonight and then think very carefully about where they really want to go in the future. Counties already involved in this process will have to look at that and take a decision, but I hope that they will be more fortunate than the county of Cheshire.</p>

It is no surprise to me that the loyalties expressed about the county of Cheshire were done so in the tone and language that noble Lords used. I think that we agree on much of what has been said. Certainly, we all want the best for Cheshire. When it comes to the point, however&#151;and I pay tribute to the excellence of Cheshire County Council to which tribute has been paid throughout the House this evening&#151;the Government have to make a decision. Ministers have to show leadership, just as the noble Lord, Lord Wade, said. We have made a choice, which does not command the support of many of your Lordships, but which we genuinely believe on the best of evidence is the one that stands the most prospect of actually delivering outcomes. I will not repeat what I said in a long opening speech. I will just make a few points, primarily about the deliverability.</p>

<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="08030480000086"></a><b><a name="80304-0013.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08030480000130"></a>Baroness Byford:</b> My Lords, the Minister has reflected again on the position that the Government have taken, but the Government's decision was not based on consensus in any way at all. I hesitated to speak in this debate because I do not come from Cheshire, but the Minister cannot claim that the Government are doing this with the consensus of the people because, clearly, they are not.</p>

<p><a name="st_153"></a>
<a name="08030480000087"></a><b><a name="80304-0013.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08030480000131"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> My Lords, I did not claim that in my opening speech and I have not claimed that in any debate on any of the unitary authorities that we have had so far because the invitation that was issued specifically said that we would not seek consensus and we would not look for a majority decision. I will come on to that.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08030480000088"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, &#147;Why don&#146;t you simply leave Cheshire alone to get on with it?&#148; We would have been very happy if Cheshire had wanted to get on with it. There was absolutely no pressure at all on Cheshire to come forward with any proposal, as my noble friend Lady Hollis said. It could have adopted enhanced two-tier status. That would have been perfectly proper.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08030485000003"></a>I also take issue with the noble Baroness, Lady Scott. We were not disingenuous about there being a consensus. This was a genuine response by the local councils in Cheshire and there were two contradictory responses. That is what we were faced with. We were   


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1060"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1060</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in a unique situation. We had to make a judgment on that basis. The two unitaries solution was proposed by those local councils. It was not imposed and was not of our design. It was put forward to us as a democratic choice.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08030485000004"></a>I have heard apocalyptic language this evening. I shall explain why I think that noble Lords ought to have confidence in the people of Cheshire, in the local officers who are developing the proposals and will take them forward and in the committed local councils. For all the reasons given by noble Lords, Cheshire is a powerful idea. It has a long, complex and changing history, as the right reverend Prelate told us. I understand that Lewis Carroll of <I>Alice in </I><I>Wonderland</I><I></I>fame<I></I>came from Daresbury&#151;a unitary authority, which is interesting to reflect on. There has been a history of change, as there has been across this country. I come from East Sussex, a powerful and terrific county, but that does not make me any less conscious of the identity and history of Sussex itself. For all the reasons given by noble Lords, I cannot believe that what has been suggested will be Cheshire&#146;s fate, either. It is too powerful a county. We are looking at a way forward that enables east and west Cheshire to take advantage of what is offered and not to be driven by cities or confused by them, as some noble Lords suggested. All I am saying is that economic opportunities may more easily be realised by having two counties that can take advantage of what is on offer in a more focused way. No one is suggesting anything other than that.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08030485000005"></a>Noble Lords challenged the process. However, this was the most thorough process that we could have invented. It was open from start to finish. It proceeded by invitation and went through two stages of consultation. The financial information that was presented was returned twice to be reviewed and was then independently assessed. I can only repeat the reasons that I gave with regard to the Freedom of Information Act about why we thought it better to preserve Ministers&#146; capacity to take advice and make decisions. That is a very important principle. However, the process was very open and, as I said, the result proves that the measure is affordable.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08030485000006"></a>I turn to why we think that this will work. There was broad but not popular support; we have not made that defence. All the polls that were taken threw up a different result. However, there was support from sufficient partners&#151;people able and willing to deliver successful change. We made no further claims, but that was what influenced our decision. We think that the measure will work, given those critical partners, which include industry, some rural parishes and towns. We also think that it will work because it meets the affordability criteria, as I said. I also believe that it meets the criterion of local democracy. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, brought that out in his positive speech. We will have two new authorities but within that there will be new local arrangements for local connections and local identities. Those local identities will build on present identities and enable them to flourish. I believe that we have that balance right.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1061"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1061</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="time_25"></a>
<a name="80304-0013.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="08030485000180"></a>8.30 pm</h5>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08030485000007"></a>Let me turn to the crucial part, which is how this will work in the future. I have been slightly dismayed by the lack of confidence that noble Lords have shown in those who are going to deliver the change. I understand that these are new authorities and I understand that the county council was a repository of excellence and experience. That excellence and that experience are already being made available to the new councils as they proceed with implementation; we would not expect it to be otherwise. The joint implementation teams that have been set up have created work groups that are looking at the different service streams.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08030485000008"></a>For example, on education, about which the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and other noble Lords have spoken passionately, the Cheshire schools associations have already provided a very constructive paper that covers the entire range of issues under the people services block, which is going to guide this. Those who are leading implementation include the most senior county council officers, the Cheshire County Council director of children&#146;s services and the director of adult services. They will bring the best of their experience to bear on what must be the future for the new councils. This is what will give the best start and the greatest confidence.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08030485000009"></a>It is suggested that existing programmes and services are going to be disrupted or put at risk through the new unitary arrangements. Let me give noble Lords two examples. The specialised service for vulnerable children will meet the needs of children and their families in both the east and the west. There will be pragmatism at work to determine the best way in which to deliver services. The children&#146;s trust is very important and there is no intention of disrupting the arrangements for it. I am told that it will continue on the present basis. We are looking to pragmatic decisions about how best to deliver services.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08030485000010"></a>On schools, dialogue has already begun with head teachers through the lead chief executives for the east and west. Head teachers are setting out their concerns, but they are now part of this dialogue about how to make the transition and build on the very best. The DCSF is committed to this and has made clear how closely it will work with schools and education agencies in east and west Cheshire to deliver the best of those services. There is evidence that those people who need to bring their experience and excellence to make the new services work are not only willing but determined to do so. The very least that we can do is to support them in that process. I believe passionately that, if we in any sense promote delay this evening, we will do nothing but harm to those who are committed to this process and to the people of Cheshire.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08030485000011"></a>The time for disagreement and division has passed. That has been said time and again, both in another place and here this evening. We are not steamrollering this through, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, suggested. We are being urged by local leaders to allow them to get on with the job after a period of unhappiness. They are desperate to be able to do that. I quoted the leaders of the two critical councils. I conclude by quoting an e-mail that the Labour  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1062"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1062</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>leaders of all the Cheshire councils have sent directly to my noble friends. They said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="08030485000157"></a>&#147;Whatever our views might have been in the past, the decision by the Secretary of State has now been made. We must make the best of it, and time is scarce. I would hope that you would support the orders&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08030485000152"></a>This has been an important debate, but I urge noble Lords to heed those views and the views of the leaders of the local councils that I quoted earlier. I commend the order to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_154"></a>
<a name="08030485000012"></a><b><a name="80304-0013.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08030485000344"></a>Lord Harrison:</b> My Lords, I have already been admonished for the lack of brevity of my speeches tonight, so I shall take inspiration from Raúl Castro rather than from Fidel Castro in the length of what I have to say. Only three points have been made, so I can keep it brief.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08030485000013"></a>First, I thank my noble friend for summing up, but I remind her that, when the Government asked the district councils to look again at the financial implications of their case and when they put Deloitte in charge, Deloitte was surprised by the poor and threadbare nature of the debate. Indeed, they found that 28 of the 33 financial assumptions were above or beyond average risk.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08030485000014"></a>Secondly, I was intrigued by what my noble friend Lady Hollis said. She said that, as she had little knowledge of Cheshire, she wanted to make some general comments. However, she went on to say that Cheshire County Council, of its own accord, brought forth the proposal for the unitary authority. I can assure her that Cheshire County Council made every effort to get agreement on the proper way forward among the seven councils involved. It was only when no consensus emerged that Cheshire County Council decided to propose a unitary authority, which was glowingly accepted by the Government.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08030485000015"></a>Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, was the only voice against everyone. His memory of Cheshire is good. It is a patchwork of towns across a principally rural county. The advantage of the Cheshire County Council proposal was exactly that, under the overarching county, the ambition to set up five local boards would have had the effect of meeting and greeting local communities in a superior way to the existing example. Neston and Parkgate, with Ellesmere Port, would be separated and responded to. Crewe and Nantwich, famously locked together, would each be able to speak for themselves. The same would apply to Northwich and Winsford. Cheshire is essentially a centripetal county, not a centrifugal one. The Government have argued all evening that somehow it is disappearing across its borders. However, people want to come and join Cheshire because it has locus, or location. It means something.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="08030485000016"></a>I have every hope and belief that the county officers, if this decision is taken, will take on the burden and responsibility of dissolving the councils. They will do that because they are professional, right down to the bottom of their boots. I shall withdraw my amendment to the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Wade of Chorlton, in the hope that your Lordships will support his amendment. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08030485000017"></a>Amendment No. 1A, as an amendment to Amendment No. 1, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08030485000026"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we move on to the part of the Bill about the annual report. An area critical for the credibility and future operation of the Bill when it becomes an Act, as I am sure it will, is reasonably timely reporting. If we do not have that, it is difficult, not just in this place but for the public at large, to keep in touch with some feeling of real time on where we are on national targets and emissions.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08030485000027"></a>The timescale in the Bill is currently very long indeed. If the Bill was in operation now, we would not know what the emissions for 2008 were until May 2010. That is a difficulty on two counts. First, the information is very much out of date in the public&#146;s perception and for the debate that will, we hope, follow in this House and the other place. Secondly, there is a considerable lag in action that can be taken&#151;adjustments, actions and policies&#151;to address deviations and difficulties in meeting those targets. With the amendment, we are therefore saying that surely one

I remember saying in Committee, although I will not go through those arguments, that complex multinational businesses manage to&#151;indeed, legally must&#151;report within a year of their financial year end. Surely this is not impossible for a nation state in reporting its greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08030485000028"></a>This is an important area for management action, for the Government&#146;s action and policy, and for keeping decision-makers and the public up to date and fully involved in the outcome of those reports and that emission reporting. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="08030485000029"></a><b><a name="80304-0013.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08030485000347"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> My Lords, the amendment shortens the timeframe within which the annual report must be laid. Instead of waiting until March of next year, the amendment brings it back to December and we support it.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08030485000030"></a>I am sure that the Minister understands our concerns. Two years is a long time, and it seems absurd that the Government cannot get the figures together in a more timely fashion. March is now upon us. Had this Bill come into effect years before, we would this month be debating the annual report for 2006. Since then, there have been three different Secretaries of State for Defra, as well as a new Prime Minister. If we are to have real government accountability, the Government need seriously to consider the amendment.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08030485000031"></a>There is always a risk with the measures under this Bill that we will find out about what is happening long after it has been done. The effectiveness of accountability is inversely proportionate to the length of time between the end of a period and the report on that period. Shortening the timeframe necessarily strengthens the accountability. We do not want the report to become overshadowed by political spin. Having a report published in the second year would allow Ministers the chance to claim that the problems of the previous two years were no longer important or germane. It is thus extremely important that the timeframe is shortened.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08030485000032"></a>Will the Minister explain the circumstances that might lead to such a delay? Will he be specific about the sorts of things that need to be carried out to assemble the report and outline how long each aspect is anticipated to take? I expect there will be much discussion about the collection of data. I ask the Minister for some examples. Can he explain the nature of the data collection with regard to time periods? Is it a matter of calculations? Will surveys need to be done and collected? Is this an administrative problem? Does he feel that if there were to be more resources in Defra, he would be able to do it quicker or is it simply that the data can only be gathered in an historical perspective? There might be some problems with data collection; however, I hope that the Minister shares our concern about the timeframe of the reports. In an ideal world, we would like to see it reduced. What has been done to research streamlining the collection process? What specific ways have the Government considered in this regard? Is there any way to improve on it?</p>

The question of the timing of the Clause 12 emissions statement came up in Committee, and following that I wrote to noble colleagues involved in the debate, basically giving background. Essentially, the timetables in the Bill are based on international practice. Under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the UK must submit an annual emissions inventory by 15 April in the second year after the year to which it relates.</p>

<a name="80304-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="08030485000034"></a>There are also good, practical reasons for this timetable, which is necessary to ensure the quality of the UK&#146;s emissions data. Compiling the UK&#146;s emissions inventory to the highest international standards requires data collection from a wide variety of sources. It is a difficult, time-consuming and labour-intensive task, but it is one that needs to be got right. Some 30 or more experts both inside and outside government are involved in the process at various points during the year. To bring forward the date of publication of the full inventory, even by a matter of weeks, would be an extremely difficult challenge.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80304-0014.htm"/>


<a name="80304-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08030485000035"></a>Since our previous debates, together with the independent team of external consultants who actually deliver the UK&#146;s emissions inventory, we have looked to see whether the timetable can be accelerated. This is not being done by Defra alone. I realise there is a degree of suspicion about the first-class civil servants in my department, but they did not do this on their own. They did it along with the external consultants. They concluded that bringing it forward could not be done without compromising the accuracy and integrity of the United Kingdom&#146;s emissions figures. I remind the House that the most recent UK emissions inventory was accepted without any adjustment by the United Nations, so there is international recognition that the quality and accuracy of our emissions figures are very high; indeed, they are among the best in the world. I would not think that anybody would want to put that at risk. It is therefore for these reasons&#151;the UK&#146;s existing international commitments and the time needed to ensure the quality of the emissions figures&#151;that the final emissions report is not available until March of the second year following that to which it relates.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08030485000036"></a>However, I take this opportunity to reassure the House that the Government are committed to ensuring that as much information as possible on the UK&#146;s emissions is made publicly available as quickly as possible. We will not delay unnecessarily. If the emissions figures are available, we will publish them.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08030485000037"></a>I shall answer some of the specific questions. I may be repeating myself in Committee, but it is worth putting on the record. Compiling the UK emissions inventory requires the collection of data from a wide variety of sources; for instance, fossil fuel combustion is the major source of UK carbon dioxide emissions. These are based on BERR&#146;s digest of UK energy statistics&#151;I think that for BERR, I would read DTI, but you know what I mean&#151;which is published annually seven months after the end of the reporting year in question; that is, at the end of July.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08030485000038"></a>The inventory also covers the other Kyoto greenhouse gases and requires the collection of emissions data from other sources, including industrial installations, the Department for Transport, trade bodies, the Institute  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1067"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1067</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of Grassland and Environmental Research, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and the Environment Agency. Each step in the calculation process requires stringent quality control and assurance processes to ensure accurate reporting. This takes several months to complete the results for the many thousands of pieces of data produced. As I said, the UK emissions figures are then subject to rigorous crosschecking, quality assurance and quality control procedures, including verification and external peer review, before being finalised.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08030485000039"></a>Just in case anyone raises with me the fact that in January 2008, we have just published the United Kingdom&#146;s 2006 emission figures, only 13 months after the year in question, we recognise the considerable interest in these figures, which is why we seek to publish as soon as possible and as soon as they are available. Headline figures are available a short while before the full UK emissions inventory is published. We therefore recently published the headline figures for the UK's 2006 emissions. However, the full emissions inventory is not available until March. That is a much fuller analysis, which sets out the UK emissions in more detail.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08030485000040"></a>For instance, the data released in March contains a full breakdown of UK emissions by sector and by greenhouse gas and sets out the underlying data on what activity gave rise to the emissions. A full uncertainty analysis is also presented, together with details of the improvements in the inventory made from the previous year, so the information provided in March is much more useful when assessing the overall programme in terms of the different sectors and trade emissions.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08030485000041"></a>The Government provide annual emission figures to Parliament under Section 2 of the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006. Those figures are compiled on exactly the same basis as our emissions statement under Clause 12 will be. There have never been any complaints or questions raised about the accuracy of the figures that we already provide to Parliament. The accuracy and reliability of what we provide is very important; we should not put it at risk.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08030485000042"></a>I think that I have covered much of the detail; if I have missed anything, I will gladly come back to it.</p>

The point is that those headline figures are available and were published as soon as they were available. Obviously, the headline figures can be made available only on an accurate basis, bearing in mind the enormous amount of detailed work that has been done, but there is enough information to do that before publishing the full emissions inventory in March. We will produce them as early as possible. If that could be done in

It is to everyone's advantage if that can be done. I thank him for the briefing note that he sent round a couple of weeks ago, which I found most interesting. The difficulty on our side is that I, like many of us, are used to organisations saying that things cannot be done, and it is always difficult to evaluate that. I understand that the international reporting must be done within a certain time, but clearly there is nothing to stop it being done earlier than the date laid down under the international conventions. I fully accept the Minister&#146;s good will and wish to get this right. The sole motivation behind the amendment is to seek to enable the Government to take policy decisions about the future in a suitable period of time. That is a weakness of the timescales, which we might be stuck with, but for the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="08030485000049"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, you might be surprised that we bring this amendment back on Report, but we do so in the light of some of the changes that have been made to the Bill thus far and because we do not feel that all our questions about banking and borrowing have quite been answered. We understand some of the benefits of having a banking and borrowing system. We recognise that the provisions for overachievement are reflected in the Kyoto Protocol, and we appreciate that the United States&#146; acid rain programme, cited in the Stern review and by the Minister in Committee, has shown the advantages of such a system. We appreciate that banking can also help with the cost of mitigation. Further still, we appreciate the function of banking and borrowing mechanisms with regard to the price of carbon. We certainly would not want to see price hikes or sharp declines towards the end of the budget periods if there were some way of easing the transition to the next period.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="08030485000050"></a>The Minister agreed in his response that the 1 per cent figure reflects the likely situation when an unexpected shock occurs towards the end of the budget period. He mentioned the,</p>
<ul><a name="08030485000176"></a>&#147;borrowing of emissions from the next budget, but only in strictly limited circumstances&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08030485000153"></a>and the weather, population growth and the uncertainty of timing in delivering policies. However, he went on to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="08030485000177"></a>&#147;the current limit of 1 per cent in the Bill is not a number plucked from thin air. It reflects the likely situation when an unexpected shock towards the end of a budget period would otherwise lead to a risk of missing the budget&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="08030485000154"></a>In other words, he said that it provides,</p>

<p><a name="08030485000155"></a>Surely the whole point of the five-year period was to take into account the fact that unexpected shocks happen throughout the period and that we should be going into the last year with enough leeway to absorb that shock, should it come.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="08030485000051"></a>This leads me to my next point, which is linked to Amendment No. 16 in the name of my noble friend Lord Taylor, which was moved on the first day of Report and dealt with annual rolling targets, and the government amendment on indicative annual ranges, which won the day. Does the Minister think that the new addition of indicative annual ranges relates to banking and borrowing? If the Government are happy to bank or borrow 1 per cent of the emissions for a budget period, could this be used as a sort of template for the indicative annual ranges? I expect the Minister to tell me that the two things are not as closely related as I might think, but I would like to press this issue further.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08030485000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, argued that,</p>
<ul><a name="08030485000179"></a>&#147;the term &#145;indicative annual range&#146; is a little broad. It would help enormously if that range could be narrowed to a point where people could have some confidence&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 25/2/08; col. 495.]</ul>
<p><a name="08030485000156"></a>However, the Minister did not want to put a definitive figure on how wide that range would need to be. But if 1 per cent is the right figure for the end of the five-year budgetary period&#151;as the noble Lord said, it is not a number plucked from thin air&#151;surely, 1 per cent might be appropriate for his indicative annual range.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="08030485000053"></a>In a sense, the indicative annual range is operated in a manner similar to banking and borrowing; that is, if I understood it correctly, an appropriate amount by which we can fall short or go beyond a certain target would be specified. I understand that there is no precise target per se in the indicative annual ranges, but the maximum and minimum bounds operate in a manner similar to the 1 per cent above or below that can be carried over from one budget period to the next. Should the indicative annual targets have some relation to the banking and borrowing range? I beg to move.</p>

Obviously, this is more of a probing amendment. We were pushing for three-year targets. Therefore, the 1 per cent would be more easily worked out. The Minister was very helpful with some of the points that he brought forward at an earlier stage. At what point will the civil servants declare that they need to use the 1 per cent? Over a five-year target, obviously, year on year, it could be difficult to make sure that the 1 per cent is achieved. I agree that it is just in case there is a major variation from the figure year on year, but that takes account of a very stable environment. If there is a bad harvest one year, followed by bad harvests in the second and third years, will that lead to a major problem or is there a process to deal with that variation in relation to the 1 per cent? If a number of disasters affect the aim of the 1 per cent, it gives the impression

This is Report stage; it is not Committee stage. I probably cannot answer the noble Lord&#146;s question because unexpected events are unexpected events. The Committee on Climate Change will be a can-do committee and we are a can-do, open, transparent Government. As soon as there is a need to make a move, it will be announced. Scrutiny, clarity and transparency are crucial to this Bill, but I cannot begin to think on the unexpected. As the noble Earl said, this amendment was tabled in Committee. I am happy to repeat part of my explanation on why 1 per cent was suitable to be borrowed from a future budget.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="08030485000056"></a>It is true that the banking provisions reward good behaviour by providing an incentive to overachieve against the carbon budget and the borrowing provisions allow the Government, in strictly limited circumstances, to borrow a small amount from the next budget. As I explained in Committee, the 1 per cent figure is not a number plucked from thin air. It simply reflects the likely situation when there is an unexpected shock or an event towards the end of a budget period. It may be that, with the ebbs and flows of a budget period over five years, there is nothing in the bank. But if it is towards the end of the budget period and would lead to the risk that the budget was being missed, obviously that would be a good opportunity.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="08030485000057"></a>The 1 per cent was chosen because analysis suggested that allowing up to 1 per cent of a future budget would be consistent with the rise in emissions that may result from an unexpectedly cold winter or uncertainty surrounding emission data. It is based on evidence which shows that since 1990 there have been large emission rises due to three unexpectedly cold winters over the period, the coldest of which led to emissions being in the order of 3 to 4 per cent higher than the preceding year. This effectively means that if 0.8 per cent of the subsequent budget was borrowed&#151;that is, 4 per cent divided by the five years of the budget period&#151;the shock could be absorbed with a 1 per cent limit on borrowing, and the budget would still be met. This would not be the case if the limit was set at 0.5 per cent.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08030485000058"></a>The 1 per cent borrowing limit is based on looking at what has happened since 1990, which is a fair time to go back. In the period, three winters were much colder than in the preceding years, and that gave us emission rises of between 3 and 4 per cent. The overall figure was not higher, but the range showed that a 1 per cent borrowing would mean that consistently we would be able to cope with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="08030485000059"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, asked me some questions going back to Amendment No. 16 which I did not really understand. I shall take advice and, if need be, I shall write to him because I do not have anything I can use to answer him now.</p>

Would the annual range be up to 1 per cent or more than that?

</ul>(a) state the final amount of carbon units that have been credited to or debited from the net carbon account for each of the national authorities for the period; and(b) give details of the number and type of those carbon units.&#148;
<a name="80304-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="08030485000069"></a>The noble Duke said: My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment No. 79 before dealing with the others in the group. This amendment would require that the final statement for the budgetary period that reports on the UK net carbon account must also outline the final number of carbon units that have been credited or debited from the net carbon accounts of the national authorities. The Minister stated in Committee that there are no net carbon accounts as such for the national authorities; that is, there are no formal accounts. However, there would be de facto carbon accounts as each of the national authorities drive through their policies to reduce climate change.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="08030485000070"></a>Of course, many of the programmes and policies will come from Whitehall, but the very nature of the battle to reduce carbon emissions is that it affects all levels of society and every type of organisation. As a consequence, it also affects all levels of government, and thus we on this side of the House think that it would be particularly useful to understand what each of the national authorities is contributing to the net UK carbon account, so how much of the reduction takes place in the regions is important information to have reported. Having as much information on these matters reported to Parliament as we can would improve transparency and ensure that everyone is on the same page. It would also offer further advantages  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1072"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1072</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because different schemes may be operating at different levels throughout the devolved administrations, so it would allow for a substantial amount of comparison. If the Scottish de facto carbon account was faring much better than the overall UK budget, for example, it would provide an opportunity to explore Scotland&#146;s local proposals in an effort to implement them more widely.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="08030485000071"></a>This also brings in questions about the UK carbon account more generally and the actual logistics of the calculation. Can the Minister take us through the process of verification of compliance with the carbon budgets? Surely this will involve knowing the status of the accounts, with some degree of accuracy, of the devolved Administrations. Of course there will be circumstances in which the contribution to meeting the UK carbon budget will be difficult to assign to a particular region, but there will certainly be others that will be easy to assign.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="08030485000072"></a>Would this information in itself be valuable? Would it be useful to know to what degree emission reductions are occurring by virtue of companies that span across the borders and what are being accomplished on a much more local level? Can the Minister explain how the carbon accounts are put together and what logistical difficulties, if any, would there be in having a delineation based upon region?</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08030485000073"></a>Amendment No. 115, which is grouped with Amendment No. 79, concerns the national authorities but in a different way. It shares some overlapping concerns&#151;namely, on transparency&#151;but it would place a duty to publish the consultations with the national authorities when laying regulations regarding the carbon account. First, as a matter of principle, we cannot see why these consultations should not be published. It is important to know where the national authorities stand in relation to UK policy and which of their concerns have been incorporated into UK policymaking.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08030485000074"></a>There are also particular instances with regard to carbon accounting and their relation to national authorities that it might be important to publicise. One example is the burgeoning industry of hydroelectric power in Scotland which might eventually qualify as a way of generating carbon credits. That possibility is still to be debated in the Bill and I am sure that we will debate it in other forms at great length. Regulation affecting the definition of a carbon unit and how they are counted could be crucial to the industry and thus any consultation should be published. It is important to investigate the degree to which the Government are taking on board the concerns of the national authorities and whether or not some of these concerns might warrant parliamentary attention.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="08030485000075"></a>I found with some shock that Amendment No. 233 was also in this group. I had not realised that, having had the amendments separated, they had been happily coupled together again by the Government Whips&#146; Office. However, in the mean time, for the sake of convenience, I shall deal with all three as that is what everyone expects should happen.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="08030485000076"></a>The amendment ensures that the national authorities should set out the procedure to be used in reaching agreement in those circumstances where they are required to act jointly in terms of the Act. Clause 76(1) defines  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1073"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1073</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the national authority and Clause 76(2) states that functions conferred on the national authorities are to be exercised by all of them jointly. These relate specifically to functions in respect of appointments to the Committee on Climate Change and various activities detailed in Schedule 1.</p>

<a name="80304-0014.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="08030485000077"></a>However, the Bill makes no provision for the mechanism which is to be employed for the national authorities to act jointly. There is no provision for what happens if they do not act jointly. In Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Drefelin, said about the clause:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="08030485000162"></a>&#147;It will be important to ensure that its application to the devolved Administrations is set out very clearly and to ensure a joined-up approach between Administrations as far as possible, as the noble Duke and the noble Lord have already highlighted. We will be agreeing a concordat with the devolved Administrations about how we will work together on implementing the detailed elements of the Bill&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 4/2/08; col. 910.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="08030485000078"></a>However, the Bill does not provide any detail about the nature of this concordat and the amendment is designed to set out the procedure to be used for reaching agreement and also to provide that the agreement shall make provision for the consequences of failure to reach an agreement and what alternative actions may be pursued by the national authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="08030485000079"></a>It is of great regret that my noble friend Lady Carnegie of Lour has not been able to stay on because she has already addressed this question tangentially on one or two other areas during the evening. I beg to move.</p>

This should not be too much of a difficulty for the commercial sector. Within the EU ETS, everything is plant-based&#151;that is &#147;plant&#148; in terms of &#147;site&#148;, rather than of vegetation&#151;not company-based, so about half of emissions are already there within the reporting systems. If that were the case in every other area as well, it would be possible to divide out carbon emissions in terms of energy consumption by area. The difficulty of that might be transport.</p>

<p><a name="st_170"></a>

Is the noble Lord suggesting that we should try to split down aviation emissions even further into what comes from Wales, from Scotland and from Ireland? If so, does he anticipate that Scotland will refuse to have any international flights in and out for English residents?</p>

As I have said, it should be quite straightforward to write rules for this area; no rule is perfect and you have to choose the best. Given that airports in particular are in specific geographical locations and, on the whole, are not movable&#151;unlike the planes that go in and out of them&#151;I should have thought that it would be no more difficult than for any other area. I do not disagree that there could be issues with that,  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1074"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1074</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but the point is that it would be useful from a policy point of view, and to the national authorities and the UK as a whole, to be able to see that level of split with regard to emissions. That would be useful to the national authorities, which will have their own climate change programmes.</p>

<a name="80304-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="08030485000083"></a>On the whole we welcome this. There are questions about how disagreement by one of the national authorities will be resolved. To me, this is a fascinating area. There will be other policy areas where there has to be some sort of federal agreement by unanimity. I should be interested to hear from the Minister of other areas of policy at the moment that require agreement by all national authorities, what operates there, how that is dealt with and how that might be used in relation to the Bill.</p>

Although everything here has been done in a positive way, the underlying tone, both here and in Committee, is of failure; that is, we will never get agreement on this, they do it differently north of the border, and what are we going to do if it does not work? It is nitpicking and expects failure. Since it was introduced, we have been trying to make devolution work. There are lots of issues in Whitehall where even today we are at the edge and we have discussions. Sometimes we agree; other times we do not.</p>

<a name="80304-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="08030485000085"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, asked me for an example. I will give him one. Tomorrow, although I have now forgotten the long title, the new farm animal genetics advisory committee will meet. It is a new non-departmental UK-wide public body that was set up without the slightest difficulty after discussions between Defra, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. That was done under the concordat and under our normal procedures for taking the Government forward with devolution when UK issues are involved. That is a good example. It was only today that we announced the membership. It will have its first meeting tomorrow. I have got that off my chest and I feel better about it now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="08030485000086"></a>Issues have been raised to which I want to respond. In the other place, there are representatives of the Scottish Executive, because of the results of the elections last year. There will therefore be a different debate there. I say in answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, who I understand cannot be with us at this time of day, that the draft Climate Change Bill was published in March last year before the elections in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. For that reason, it made no provision on devolution, but a disclaimer stated that these issues were still to be agreed. Following the elections, the devolution aspects were agreed between June and September. The Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly passed legislative consent Motions in the autumn. It has been hinted that the Bill is not meeting  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1075"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1075</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with their approval. I am not putting words in their mouth or saying that they agree with every dot and comma, but they buy the package and the procedures in it.</p>

<a name="80304-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="08030485000087"></a>This group of amendments looks at various aspects of how the national authorities are involved in processes under the Bill. We discussed the overall issues in Committee. The provisions of the Bill have been agreed with the devolved Administrations and consent Motions have been passed. As I have mentioned previously, we are developing a detailed concordat with the devolved Administrations which will set out how we work with them to meet the Bill&#146;s requirements. This is the best way to ensure that our efforts are properly co-ordinated.</p>

<a name="80304-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="08030485000088"></a>When we discussed the issue in Committee, one of the big questions raised was what the devolved Administrations were doing to tackle climate change. I hope that I can reassure your Lordships that all three are strongly committed to contributing to emissions reductions. For example, the Scottish Executive have recently launched consultation on a proposed Scottish climate change Bill and a target to reduce emissions by 80 per cent by 2050.</p>

<a name="80304-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="08030485000089"></a>Within the One Wales agreement, Welsh Ministers have committed to a number of actions to address climate change, including an annual 3 per cent carbon-equivalent emission reduction in areas of devolved competence. The Assembly Government have also established a Climate Change Commission for Wales that will work towards building consensus on climate change in Wales and assist the development of new policies.</p>

<a name="80304-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="08030485000090"></a>The key driver for action on climate change in Northern Ireland is the Northern Ireland sustainable development strategy, which includes strategic objectives and targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 per cent by 2025. Specific actions include reducing electricity consumption by 1 per cent annually to 2012, making the government estate carbon neutral by 2015, improving energy efficiency in buildings and encouraging renewable energy sources. Perhaps I may give a little plug: virtually all that work in Northern Ireland was initiated and driven forward when Peter Hain became the Secretary of State. When we were direct rule Ministers, he made it a top priority to get cracking on it. It has been accepted and embraced by business and politicians in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Environment Minister has also made a commitment to reconsider a Northern Ireland emission reduction target once the certainty of the Northern Ireland emissions baseline has been established. So we think the Bill takes the right approach in working with the other authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="08030485000091"></a>Amendment No. 115, along with Amendment No. 95, would require the UK Government to publish the results of consultation with the devolved Administrations. It would not be right for the UK Government to be given that responsibility. It will be for each devolved Administration to decide whether it wishes to publish its representations. We have devolved: we have to let go from Westminster. If devolution is to work, those Administrations have to make that decision. In any case, the Secretary of State is under a duty to say how he has taken the representations into account. That

I hope that is the clarification and reassurance that the noble Lord is seeking.</p>

<a name="80304-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="08030485000092"></a>There are well established procedures for resolving differences between the UK Government and the devolved Administrations, as set out in the 2001 Memorandum of Understanding (Command Paper 5240). This Memorandum of Understanding established the Joint Ministerial Committee, consisting of UK Government, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Ministers, which has as one of its functions a role in resolving disputes. As I mentioned earlier, we will draw up a detailed concordat with the other national authorities in relation to the Bill. In the interests of transparency and continued constructive relations between the UK Government and the devolved Administrations, we expect to publish the concordat when finalised. That will have to be after Royal Assent, since the precise detail of the concordat depends on the final provisions of what is included in the Climate Change Act. That is the reality of the situation.</p>

<a name="80304-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="08030485000093"></a>Amendment No. 233 would require that we legislate for an agreement that sets out what happens if national authorities are unable to agree on an issue under the Bill. That is exactly what is already provided for&#151;albeit not in legislation&#151;in broad terms under the 2001 Memorandum of Understanding. We do not want to be heavy-handed about this.</p>

<a name="80304-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="08030485000094"></a>I was asked a specific question about the carbon units themselves. The department has prepared a briefing paper on carbon accounting, which I am happy to share with interested colleagues. I shall ensure that it is sent to the normal circulation list without noble Lords having to apply for it. The UK already has a well established system for tracking carbon units under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. That system has an excellent track record and has so far been licensed to 16 countries in addition to the UK. The UK Emissions Trading Registry is administered by the Environment Agency. It is a web-based system developed by Defra which facilitates the distribution, trade and surrender of emissions allowances, but it is a UK-wide system. The devolved administrations do not have carbon accounts under the Bill.</p>

<a name="80304-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="08030485000095"></a>I hope that that is considered to be a positive response. I understand why questions have been asked and I am not saying that they are all negative, but we are trying to make devolution work and procedures are in place, not just for the Climate Change Bill but for a whole range of issues where there are a mixture of devolved and non-devolved issues. My day job deals with farming, which is an EU issue and a devolved issue, so it is one that I am familiar with.</p>

Equally, it is difficult for us in drafting the Bill to know what we have to put into it until we know the contents of the concordat. There is an awful danger that we will start to go round in a whirlpool and get nowhere and that is the last thing that we want to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="08030485000097"></a>I can give my noble friend one marginal assurance. He asked a very similar question to mine at the end of Committee. The noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Drefelin, answered as best she could at the time about how all the Ministers in Scotland in particular would work together with the other devolved Administrations and the Secretary of State. Although she gave as competent an answer as she could, subsequently, one of the officials came across and said that the answer lay in the devolution Bills and quoted the relevant paragraphs. I am somewhat surprised that they did not put that into the Minister&#146;s brief tonight. It still leaves us with a dilemma. Will the Minister assure us that the concordat, when it is finally arrived at, will contain sufficient requirements to report the actual details of the carbon budget for Scotland, so that the Secretary of State will have enough information to provide a sufficiently accurate carbon statement budget when he has to do so? Without that assurance we are in great difficulty.</p>

The concordat will follow the Bill. We are not drafting the Bill in order to write a concordat. We are legislating through the Bill&#151;that is the key issue&#151;with as much co-operation as possible from the devolved Administrations. At the end of that stage the concordat will be agreed, based on the Bill. As I say, it is not necessary to draft the Bill in order to write the concordat. That is the wrong way round. However, there must be sufficient information to provide as much transparency as possible and I am sure that is exactly what the Scottish Administration want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="08030485000100"></a>Amendment No. 79 does not lay down the exact detail of what the devolved Administrations might have to contribute. The advice of the climate change committee could be sought if we are trying to separate out the measure. However, we are clear that devolution means that the devolved Administrations will each decide what they are going to do. They will have full rein to decide by how much they wish to reduce their carbon footprint. That will form the basis on which the UK carbon budget is set and the balance will be picked up by Westminster. But will we look at how the measure has been fulfilled and at how the different Administrations have carried out what they promised to do? As we said, if some of the policies have been more successful than others, it would be good to review them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="08030485000101"></a>As the Minister said, the draft Bill was published before the March election and the devolved Administrations agreed to the Bill that came before your Lordships&#146; House. However, in passing the legislative consent Motion the devolved Administrations do not go into the Bill in quite the same detail as we do here. Therefore, we should consider whether certain phrases

<a name="80304-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="08030485000102"></a>The Minister is on record as saying that the concordat will be published. That does not happen with all concordats and it will be very useful to see it. The carbon accounting system developed in London will be used for the national management of carbon accounts. Presumably, the devolved Administrations will either have to buy into that system or develop their own. It would be useful to have feedback on how they manage their accounts and consider the effect that has on the overall UK position. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We accept its recommendation that the Bill should explicitly rule out the possibility of amending carbon budgets after they have finished. One of the underlying aims of the carbon budgeting system is to provide certainty for investors and the public about the Government&#146;s ambitions for reducing emissions.</p>

<a name="80304-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="08030485000113"></a>The Bill allows for carbon budgets to be amended, but only in limited circumstances, following advice from the Committee on Climate Change and a vote in both Houses of Parliament. We believe that this provides the right balance between providing certainty for investors and the public and the flexibility to respond to significant changes since the budget was set.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1079"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1079</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="08030485000114"></a>As it stands, the Bill is ambiguous about whether a budget may be amended after the end of the period. As the Delegated Powers Committee and others have pointed out, the option to do so could undermine the investor confidence that the Bill is specifically designed to provide. The amendment therefore accepts the Delegated Powers Committee&#146;s recommendation and would make it explicit that a budget cannot be amended after the period has finished. I beg to move.</p>

This is a sensible amendment, which is in line with the sort of thinking that has motivated many of our amendments.</p>

<a name="80304-0015.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="08030485000116"></a>We are pleased to see that the Government are finally starting to table amendments that limit the ability of the Secretary of State to tinker with the rules to make his life easier. The scenario was perfectly possible before the amendment, especially considering the provisions for banking and borrowing, that a Secretary of State could have amended a previous period such that the actual emissions reduction was 1 per cent over the limit and then could have banked that reduction to ease his burden later on. That is the sort of thing that we certainly hope Ministers in future will not engage in. None the less, we have tried to ensure that it does not happen.</p>

<a name="80304-0015.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="08030485000117"></a>Thus, when the Government come forward to close up a potential loophole such as this one, we should be thankful. It shows that although we might disagree on a number of points, our attitudes might be converging on issues such as tightening the accountability and responsibility of the Secretary of State. In short, it is good to see that the Government, at least in this instance, are keen not to give the Secretary of State a way to let himself off the hook. We welcome the amendment.</p>

This reminds me of my favourite novel, <I>1984</I> by George Orwell, in which after a period was finished they would revise history to fit the circumstances at the time.

They concern the order-making provisions for the alteration of budget periods and the necessary consultations that must take place before such an order is laid. I shall speak to each of the amendments in turn.</p>

<a name="80304-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="08030485000128"></a>Amendment No. 90 is an attempt to standardise the timing constraint on the consultation period and to allow slightly more time for consultation to take place. In the Bill as it stands, an order to amend the budgetary period must be made within one month of the advice of the Committee on Climate Change being sent to the relevant national authority if the order is to amend that budgetary period, and within three months if it is to amend the future budgetary period.</p>

<a name="80304-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="08030485000129"></a>We understand the importance of sending a clear signal to business and industry and, thus, we appreciate the fact that, if a budgetary period has already started, it would be important to have the change made as quickly as possible to allow the industry and government departments to accommodate the new budgetary constraints. Because of this, we understand the short time limit that the Government have placed on the consultation period when the budget period has already begun. However, we have some slight reservation that this might not give the national authorities enough time for a full and proper consultation. We do not want this to be a situation in which the national authorities are not given adequate time or, to take a very cynical view, we do not want this to be an opportunity for the Secretary of State to push through a change in the budget that might be hugely unpopular without giving the authorities adequate time to prepare a thorough response.</p>

<a name="80304-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="08030485000130"></a>We do not feel that three months is too long in terms of industry and business. There might be considerations, depending on how close to the end of a budgetary period the order is being laid, but standardising this timeframe to three months would give everyone involved adequate time to be consulted on the alteration, as well as to prepare for its effects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="08030485000131"></a>Amendment No. 91 would place a duty on the Secretary of State to publish a statement setting out why the order ignored particular representations of the national authorities. This is an important way of  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1081"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1081</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ensuring that the national authorities are not left out to dry. We want to avoid the Secretary of State altering a budget for reasons of political expedience; we think that having a positive duty to summarise what has been ignored would strengthen this aspect of the Bill and prevent, if only to a mild degree, political expedience from creeping into the equation. This would seem to provide a straightforward mechanism to increase accountability.</p>

<a name="80304-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="08030485000132"></a>I know that the Bill seems to create a huge amount of reports and responses to reports but, given the gravity of the matter, it is essential that Parliament and the public are kept constantly informed. Does the Minister think it inappropriate for the Secretary of State to outline his reasons for disagreeing with the national authority before making an order? Surely not. Indeed, on what might be considered more major issues, the Government have produced amendments similar to this one. Consider the requirement for the Secretary of State to respond to the Committee on Climate Change&#146;s assessment on progress, for example. I know that this concerns the reputations of the national authorities, but the logic is similar.</p>

<a name="80304-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="08030485000133"></a>The fact remains that an alteration of a carbon budget would not be a small thing. We envisage it happening only in the most extraordinary circumstances. Could the Minister explain the circumstances in which he would envisage the Secretary of State altering the carbon budget? Would he expect it to happen for every budget? This brings us to more philosophical issues about the nature of budgets. My understanding has always been that these were relatively fixed things and would not be altered or changed much. Would the Minister be willing to give us this assurance? Surely the national authorities&#146; role in the consultation process will be crucial.</p>

<a name="80304-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="08030485000134"></a>I know that the Bill as it stands requires the publication of the representations that are to be taken into account, but we simply want a brief summary of those that are not being taken into account when the order is made. Although this might be the intention of the Government and, indeed, any sensible Secretary of State who want to provide the reasons, we would like to ensure that that is enshrined in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80304-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="08030485000135"></a>The final amendment in this group, Amendment No. 95, simply affects the timing of the publication of the consultation. We hope that there is not too much objection to placing in the Bill the requirement for the Secretary of State to publish the result of the consultation once the order is made. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80304-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="08030485000137"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 90, Clause 17 requires the Secretary of State, before amending the level of a budget, to obtain the views of the Committee on Climate Change and consider the views that the devolved Administrations may have regarding this advice. If the budget has yet to begin, the devolved Administrations will have a minimum of three months  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1082"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column 1082</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to consider the advice of the Committee on Climate Change and make their representations to the Secretary of State. If the budget in question has already begun, they will have a minimum of one month to feed their views into the Government.</p>

<a name="80304-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="08030485000138"></a>The difference here is simply to account for the fact that, if the budget has already begun, the decision on whether to amend it will need to be taken far more quickly. Amendment No. 90 would give the devolved Administrations at least three months to put forward their views, whether the budget had begun or not. That would limit the flexibility provided for in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80304-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="08030485000139"></a>We consider it right to require a decision to amend an ongoing budget to be taken more quickly, which is why the devolved Administrations are given less time to submit their views if the budget period has already begun. However, if at the time the circumstances dictated that the devolved Administrations could be given longer, it would be open to the Government to give them more time. This approach has already been agreed with the devolved Administrations, who, I am pleased to report, are perfectly happy with these timetables.</p>

<a name="80304-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="08030485000140"></a>Regarding Amendment No. 91, Clause 17 as drafted requires that the Secretary of State must publish a statement setting out whether and how the amendment of the budget takes into account any representations by the devolved Administrations. The important point here is that in legal terms &#147;whether&#148; means &#147;whether or not&#148; and &#147;how&#148; means &#147;how or how not&#148;&#151;it looks better when it is written down. The Secretary of State is already obliged to say what he disagrees with and the reasons why, so we believe that the Bill already addresses the legitimate concerns behind the amendment.</p>

<a name="80304-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="08030485000141"></a>I was asked specifically what the reasons might be for changing a budget. There could be a number. I cannot set them out in detail but they might include the following: changes to the international context&#151;for example, a new multilateral agreement that required the UK to adopt a reduction target that was not envisaged when the budget was set&#151;or that set new requirements for the UK under EU or international law. Another example would be if progress in developing or deploying a particular technology was faster or slower than expected. Another would be changes to the 2020 and 2050 targets, meaning that budgets needed to be revised&#151;perhaps to incorporate other greenhouse gases. A final example would be a significant and possibly unforeseen shift in fuel prices which changed the basis of emissions forecasts on which the budget had initially been set. All those are substantial possible reasons for change but would not be used as a backdoor method of changing a budget just because we could not meet it for some reason.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="08030485000142"></a>Amendment No. 95 requires the UK to publish the results of the consultation with the devolved Administrations. It would not be right for the UK Government to be given that responsibility. I shall repeat the phrase: we have to let go. The devolved Administrations must decide whether to publish their representations. They are free to do so; there is nothing to stop them. In any case, the Secretary of State is under a duty to say how he has taken the representations

That will be difficult to do&#151;one could put it more forcefully than that&#151;without broadly indicating what was in those representations. I hope that that list of possible reasons why a budget might be amended and the other answers meet the concerns of the noble Lord.</p>

As this is a skeleton type of Bill, we are very anxious to have some feeling of what is supposed to be within its remit and what is likely to happen. One presumes the devolved Administrations will understand the necessity of a short period for alterations within the period of a budget, although it will be a great challenge to them to get their heads round why the changes have taken place and how much of the changes they wish to implement themselves. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="wms_subhd_0"></a>
<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_head0"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="08030461000002"></a>Airports: VIP Suites</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08030461000008"></a><b><a name="80304-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08030461000058"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Malloch-Brown):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (David Miliband) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08030461000009"></a>With effect from 1 April, BAA will operate the VIP suites at Terminals 1 to 5 at Heathrow airport on a commercial basis and for a trial period of 12 months. Similar commercial arrangements will also apply to the VIP suite at Gatwick airport. The FCO's operational role and significant financial subsidy towards the use of these suites will end on 31 March. This will move the provision of this service on to a commercial basis, which accurately reflects the full economic cost of the VIP suites.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08030461000010"></a>Under the new arrangements, the FCO will continue to pay for state visits and those officially invited as guests of the British Government. All existing users remain eligible to use the VIP suites. Diplomatic missions in London, who account for 90 per cent of the suites&#146; use, will still be able to use the VIP suites for other high level overseas visitors, making the arrangements and payment direct with BAA.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08030461000011"></a>The FCO will continue its operational control of the Royal Suite at Heathrow and meet the costs for state visits and official guests of the British Government. All other users of the Royal Suite will be subject to full economic recovery charges, made payable direct to the FCO.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08030461000012"></a>As a result of these changes, the majority of current users of the VIP suites will see an increase to existing fees. The charges are necessary in bringing to an end the long-standing and considerable public subsidy. The FCO and BAA are writing to all current users to explain how the changes will affect them.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="08030461000013"></a><b><a name="80304-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08030461000059"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office &amp; Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Lord Jones of Birmingham):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Consumer Affairs (Gareth Thomas) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08030461000014"></a>This Statement provides a summary of the proceedings of the Competitiveness Council meeting held in Brussels on 25 February 2008.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08030461000015"></a>The council held an exchange of views on the Lisbon reform package and adopted its key issues paper, <I>Turning Challenges into Opportunities</I> with a view to forwarding it to the spring European Council (SEC) in March 2008.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS96"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column WS96</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08030461000016"></a>Areas of particular focus were the role of the Competitiveness Council in complementing the national reform programmes by meeting the Community-level objectives laid down in the Community Lisbon programme, the broad-based innovation strategy and the improvement of the business environment for SMEs through measures like the Small Business Act initiative, better regulation, simplification and the reduction of administrative burdens.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08030461000017"></a>The UK intervened to support the council&#146;s view that the integrated guidelines for 2008-10 were still valid and to support an evidence-based approach to the Community-level objectives. We acknowledged the central role of the Competitiveness Council in pushing forward the Lisbon agenda but stressed the importance of empowering it to examine the impact of allmajor EU policies on competitiveness e.g. the climate change and energy package and the need to continue to open markets within the EU and beyond. On innovation, the UK pressed for the involvement of member states in the &#147;lead markets&#148; initiative. Finally, we welcomed Vice-President Verheugen&#146;s statement that the Small Business Act (SBA) initiative should be a combination of measures, not solely legislative, and emphasised the importance of better regulation, common commencement dates, longer consultation periods and exemptions for SMEs.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08030461000018"></a>The council adopted conclusions on the single market review to be forwarded to the SEC in March 2008. Commissioner McCreevy welcomed the positive endorsement and said the follow-up would focus mainly on improving the policy framework, better regulation, policy tools, market monitoring and partnership working, but also on some policy initiatives like the Small Business Act.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08030461000019"></a>Any other business included a presentation by the Commission of its proposal to reduce the emissions of CO2 from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles which will be discussed at the Environment Council meeting in March 2008. The UK intervened to welcome the proposals but also to highlight its concern about their impact on small and medium-sized independent manufacturers and so to support calls for further discussion at the Competitiveness Council in May 2008.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08030461000020"></a>Under AOB items, the council also took note of presentations from the Commission on the defence package, the goods package, the consumer and internal market scoreboards, the European Clusters Conference and Memorandum, a strategic report on better regulation, and the climate-energy legislative package.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="08030461000021"></a><b><a name="80304-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08030461000060"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Andy Burnham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08030461000022"></a>I am today publishing the evidence gathered so far on the operation of the licensing laws introduced in England and Wales in November 2005, and setting  


<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS97"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column WS97</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out how we intend to monitor the licensing regime over the next few weeks and months, and the immediate action the Government are taking to tackle alcohol-related problems. Copies of the evaluation report are being placed in the Library of both Houses.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08030461000023"></a>This first review of the Licensing Act reveals a mixed picture.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08030461000024"></a>Its introduction has not led to the widespread problems some feared. Overall, crime and alcohol consumption are down. But alcohol-related violence has increased in the early hours of the morning and some communities have seen a rise in disorder.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08030461000025"></a>Our main conclusion is that people are using the freedoms but people are not sufficiently using the considerable powers granted by the Act to tackle problems, and that there is a need to rebalance action towards enforcement and crack down on irresponsible behaviour.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08030461000026"></a>Some aspects of the Act have worked well. Bringing together six previous licensing regimes into a single integrated scheme has resulted in a considerable reduction in red tape&#151;estimated at &#163;99 million per annum&#151;with benefits not just for business, but the third sector and non-profit making clubs too.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08030461000027"></a>The Act has also delivered new powers and flexibilities enabling local authorities and police to work in partnership to significantly reduce crime and disorder in some areas. At the same time, millions of people have been able to able to enjoy the convenience of shopping at a time that suits them and socialising in restaurants, bars and caf&#233;s beyond 11pm.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08030461000028"></a>Furthermore, contrary to popular expectations: the average closing time across all on-licensed premises has increased by only 21 minutes since the Act came into effect; the overall volume of incidents of crime and disorder has remained stable and not risen; and alcohol consumption, rather than increasing, has instead fallen over this period.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08030461000029"></a>In total, fewer than 4 per cent of premises (some 5,100) have licences permitting them to open for up to 24 hours a day&#151;many of which are hotels, stores and supermarkets. Only some 470 pubs, bars and nightclubs have 24-hour licences, but there is no evidence that more than a handful operate on that basis. The British Beer and Pub Association informed a Select Committee recently that there are only two traditional pubs in the entire country that operate for 24 hours.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="08030461000030"></a>But beneath these headline facts the picture is much more mixed. While crimes involving violence may have reduced over the evening and night time-period, the evidence also points to increases in offences, including violent crimes, reported between 3 am and 6 am. This represents 4 per cent of night-time offences.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08030461000031"></a>Similarly, while there is no clear picture of whether alcohol-related demands on A&amp;E services and alcohol-related admissions have risen, some hospitals have seen a fall in demand, others have reported an increase.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08030461000032"></a>It is also clear that the overall reduction in alcohol-related disorder we wanted to see across the country has not materialised consistently in all areas.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS98"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column WS98</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08030461000033"></a>The Government remain determined to address these issues, and the report published today has helped us identify a number of ways we can go further to protect the public, both in terms of using all the flexibilities in the Act to crack down on irresponsible behaviour, including more caution and conditions when issuing licenses and the withdrawal of licences in certain areas, but also introducing new initiatives to tackle anti-social behaviour associated with alcohol consumption.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08030461000034"></a>The announcements today contain measures to target those businesses that continue to sell alcohol irresponsibly and cause harm within our communities. To specifically address the small but unacceptable proportion of violent crimes occurring in the early hours of the morning, we will undertake further comprehensive research into post-midnight drinking patterns and their impact on crime and order, and will not hesitate to take the necessary action through new legislation and enforcement measures to tackle this.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08030461000035"></a>But we will take immediate action now. First, we will utilise existing powers to identify problem premises. We will make it easier to review premises where local intelligence suggests there is a problem.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08030461000036"></a>Secondly, we will encourage the imposition of tougher sanctions on those found to be breaching their licensing conditions. This includes the stipulation that there be far more instant closures of pubs and clubs in an area where there has been a disorder and indefinite closure by the courts for any breach of licence conditions. We will develop a toolkit for local authorities and police, building on my right honourable friend the Home Secretary&#146;s recently published guide for dealing with alcohol-related problems.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08030461000037"></a>Thirdly, we will change the offence of &#147;persistently selling alcohol to a person under 18&#148; from &#147;three strikes&#148; to &#147;two strikes&#148; in three months. This means that any seller who twice sells to underage drinkers and is caught doing so will immediately lose their licence.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08030461000038"></a>Fourthly, we will support the police and local authorities to identify problem hotspots by ranking geographical areas and concentrations of premises on the basis of the risks they present to crime and disorder, public nuisance and children. This will allow licensing authorities the ability to exercise more caution and conditions when issuing licenses, and wholesale withdrawal of licences in these areas, and permit local authorities and police to target enforcement resources more effectively at problem hotspots.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="08030461000039"></a>Finally, the message must be clear to all: breach your licensing conditions and you face severe and costly restrictions on your business&#151;with a new &#147;yellow card and red card&#148; alert system. A yellow card will put the problem premises on immediate probation together with tough and uncompromising sanctions. And when the circumstances are right, it will be a straight red card leading to withdrawal of the licence.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08030461000040"></a>To tackle wider anti-social behaviour associated with alcohol consumption my right honourable friend, the Home Secretary, will bring forward legislation to:</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS99"></a><b>4 Mar 2008 : Column WS99</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>increase the maximum fine for anyone not obeying an instruction to stop drinking, or to give up their drink in a designated public place from &#163;500 to &#163;2,500;make it easier for the police to disperse anti-social drinkers&#151;both adults and children&#151;from any location&#151;if necessary, we will change the law to make this happen; extend the use of acceptable behaviour contracts for young people caught drinking in public, to require them and their parents to attend a session with a trained worker; and in addition, we will be extending the alcohol arrest referral pilots that my right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced last month so that under-18s may also benefit from a brief intervention from a trained worker.  This will help deal with young people drinking in public who are already involved in criminal activities.
<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="08030461000041"></a>I, together with right honourable friend the Home Secretary will convene a summit of police and local authorities to explore how we can take these proposals forward.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="08030461000042"></a>The report published today is not the end of the story. The measures announced today are only part of the Government&#146;s comprehensive strategy for combating the problems associated with alcohol.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="08030461000043"></a>A significant programme of work is under way over the next six months. We are working with the industry on alcohol advertising, and welcome industry consideration to give much more prominence to clear information about the dangers of alcohol, and to actively support government campaigns to promote sensible drinking. We will strongly encourage them to press on with trials to test their effectiveness. If we need to, we will consider more restrictions.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="08030461000044"></a>Later in the year, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families will publish the Government&#146;s action plan on young people and alcohol containing further proposals for reducing drinking by young people specifically.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="08030461000045"></a>Later in the spring, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport will also set out measures for dealing with the relatively small number of people who continue to think it is acceptable behaviour to drink and drive.</p>

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="08030461000046"></a>The Department of Health will publish the results of the independent study commissioned from the University of Sheffield to look at the evidence on the relation between alcohol price, promotion and harm and in response will bring forward necessary action. The real cost of alcohol has fallen to historically low levels, and there is already an emerging consensus that more needs to be done to tackle irresponsible promotions and deep discounting that can lead to anti social behaviour. The Government will begin immediate work with the licensing authorities and

<a name="80304-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="08030461000047"></a>In conclusion, we are prepared to take action wherever the evidence suggests that it is necessary to tackle the problems associated with alcohol.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="08030461000053"></a>In a Statement to the House on 5 July 2005 the then Secretary of State for Transport announced that we were prepared to ensure that up to &#163;200 million a year would be available from the transport innovation fund to support the development of local packages of measures that combine demand management, including road pricing, and better public transport. He also announced that we would make &#163;18 million of pump-priming development funding available to support scheme development.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="08030461000054"></a>So far 10 areas have benefited from this funding. This has enabled them to analyse their current and emerging congestion issues and consider how demand management could form part of the solution. While we never expected every one of these areas to come forward with formal proposals straight away, I have been greatly encouraged by the work to date and thank those areas who have contributed to the debate. Already proposals have been submitted by Greater Manchester and Cambridgeshire, which we are currently assessing, and I understand that further proposals will be coming forward in the coming year or two.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="08030461000055"></a>We want to give more areas the opportunity to benefit from such packages. Therefore I am extending the commitment to make available up to &#163;200 million a year out to 2018-19, in line with our long term funding profile for transport. To support the development of business cases we shall be inviting authorities to bid for further pump-priming development funding for

There needs to be a truth and reconciliation process owned by the people of Armenia and Turkey. Outsiders can commend the idea to the parties, but they should not try to do the work for them&#151;undertaking this is an important part of the confidence-building and reconciliation process for the parties themselves. The Government will continue to encourage the parties to embark on such a process. In the mean time, we should resist the temptation to pre-empt its conclusions.</p>

The Government would be ready&#151;in the interest of sending a clear signal of EU commitment to Serbia's European future&#151;to contemplate signature of an SAA if there were clear agreement that ICTY conditionality were to remain clearly embedded in the accession process and to apply at the next relevant stage. A further relevant consideration is Serbia's response to developments in Kosovo. Violence against international personnel in Kosovo or against diplomatic premises in Belgrade, and statements by Serbian Ministers that condone this, clearly create an unpromising background for progress in the EU's relations with Serbia.</p>

It is important that we go on equipping people of all backgrounds and talents with the skills that they need to be properly qualified to work wherever they wish. However, the vast majority (90 per cent) of those highly skilled workers are being employed by UK-based employers using the higher-level skills that they have acquired to make us a highly competitive and productive economy on the world stage. Many of the 10 per cent who seek opportunities overseas return at a later date.</p>

The CPA is the bedrock of stability and democratic transformation in Sudan and 2008 is a critical year in the agreement's implementation. The census, preparation for elections, continued installation of the joint integrated units and demarcation of the north-south boundary are important milestones ahead and we will support both parties in helping to achieve them.</p>
