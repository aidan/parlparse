<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Carlisle </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80303-01_para0"></a>What measures are being undertaken to help the applicant nations of central and eastern Europe, in particular Latvia and Lithuania, which are not in the first wave of accession negotiations, to prepare for entry to the European Union at the earliest opportunity.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80303-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the Luxembourg European Council took the necessary decisions to ensure that the enlargement process was all-inclusive. As part of that, the accession process will begin on 30th March with all 10 central European applicants.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-01_para1"></a>The Luxembourg European Council also decided on measures to reinforce the applicants' preparations for accession. An enhanced pre-accession strategy, centring on accession partnerships and increased pre-accession aid, accompanied by an analytical study of the EU acquis, will help Latvia and Lithuania fulfil the Copenhagen criteria and come into line with EU legislation. The London European Conference on 12th March is another important element on inter-governmental co-operation within that process.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Carlisle: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that helpful Answer. Is he aware that the right honourable Member for Livingston in another place presided over the European Union Association in Brussels on 23rd February? What, if anything, was achieved at that meeting? Will Her Majesty's Government utilise the association to ensure that the nations not in the first wave have a good opportunity of joining the EU before the end of this decade?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of the meeting. It is part of the ongoing process of engaging the civic society in the applicant countries. The Luxembourg summit also ensured that aid would be geared to those countries in the greatest need. In most cases, those not in the first wave entering formal negotiations will receive benefit from that decision.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that one of the great bars to entry to <P>


<a name="column_1088"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1088</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the EU of Latvia and Lithuania and many other countries is the continued operation of the absurd common agricultural policy? If we want those countries to join the European Union, would it not be as well to get rid of that ridiculous policy as soon as possible?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, it is part of the Government's intent drastically to reform the CAP. That requires detailed negotiations with existing members and further discussion of how the policy would apply to potential new candidates joining the European Union. In that context, it is a problem if it remains unreformed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   My Lords, despite the Luxembourg European Council, mentioned by the Minister, and in the light of the recent failure of the Amsterdam conference to prepare satisfactorily for enlargement of the EU, do the Government agree with Commission proposals under Agenda 2000 to hold another IGC? What effect would that have on the likely timetable of future EU enlargement to enable the smooth admission of eastern European countries, in particular Lithuania and Bulgaria?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the Amsterdam Treaty achieved a fair amount in preparation for enlargement. However, a number of institutional issues were left over which must be addressed. The Government believe that that will not involve a major inter-governmental conference the size of Amsterdam. We believe that those institutional issues can be resolved in time and in parallel with the probably long and difficult negotiations for accession, even of the first countries to join.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the Government intend to reform the CAP and not abolish it?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord will find that I did not repeat precisely the words of my noble friend Lord Stoddart. We intend to reform the CAP, but we require agreement to do so. The imperative for reform is clear in the enlargement context and in other areas.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister seek to dispel the note of optimism in the Question, which presupposes that the European Union in its present form will be in existence when the countries concerned will be joining? Will the Minister induce his noble friends to take a closer look at the implications of the Amsterdam and Maastricht treaties, which by this time they might have had the opportunity to examine?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I never wish to discourage optimism; indeed, I have for some time been attempting to dispel the pessimism of my noble friend Lord Bruce about such matters, but without any success whatever. I suspect that these issues will be returned to in our debates in Committee on Amsterdam, which will take place in a few days' time.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the larger the Community becomes the less possible it <P>


<a name="column_1089"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1089</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is to harmonise the laws of all the countries involved? Therefore, has not the time come for a complete revision of the Rome Treaty, the original proposals of which may have suited the first six countries but are now utterly impossible to implement?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   No, my Lords; I do not accept that view. Indeed, one of the great economic and social benefits of enlargement will be the creation of a single market spanning the whole of Europe. Those regulations have already been adopted to a large extent in those countries which are seeking membership. The fulfilment of the single market across eastern and western Europe will be the greatest achievement of the European Union, and the greatest guarantee of prosperity both east and west.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, in that case, can the Minister expand on the answer that he gave to his noble friend Lord Stoddart of Swindon in which he referred to detailed discussions with existing members? Can the noble Lord tell the House exactly how many votes are required to carry reform of the common agricultural policy, and how many votes the Government are, at present, confident of securing towards that noble aim?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, there is already a proposition on the table from the Commission for partial reform of the CAP, which we strongly support. That is the first step. There appears to be majority support for that position. However, the more radical reform that we would like to see will require some persuasion. We do not require unanimity but we do require a qualified majority in most aspects of the agricultural policy.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, given that the lavish transfer payments enjoyed by the Republic of Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal will not be available to the Baltic States, or other applicant countries, because the money simply is not there, is the Minister certain that it is in the genuine interests of Latvia, Lithuania, and so on, to join an organisation so bureaucratic, over-regulated and interfering as the EU? Would they not be much better off with a genuine advantageous free trade agreement instead?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, without accepting for one moment the description of the EU advanced by the noble Lord, I can tell the House that I believe this to be a matter for the peoples of those countries to assess. As I understand it, the overwhelming view in those countries is that they wish to join the European Union. Therefore, we should help to develop their prosperity and their civic institutions to that end.

<A NAME="80303-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80303-01_para2"></a>Whether recent financial difficulties in certain Far Eastern countries may reduce the number of students from those countries who undertake further education in the UK, and whether this may in turn cause financial difficulties for some UK universities and other higher education establishments.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80303-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment   (Baroness Blackstone): </B>  My Lords, it is difficult to predict exactly what the impact of the various currency collapses in South-East Asia will be on the numbers of students coming to the UK, though there is clearly cause for concern. The Government applaud the substantial efforts made by higher education institutions to alleviate the hardship of many of the students affected, enabling them to continue to study here. The Higher Education Funding Council for England is looking at the potential effects on individual universities and higher education colleges and will offer advice to any who might need it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-01_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend the Minister for that reply. However, is she aware that I have received some information from the Council of Vice-Chancellors and Principals which indicates that, if there were a total withdrawal of those students, the amount of money lost would be as high as &#163;300 million? Further, another &#163;300 million could be lost that these students normally spend while they are over here. These are serious figures. Will the Minister do her best to make sure that the Government keep this situation under review and take any action that may be required?<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980303/text/80303-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I can confirm that my noble friend's figures are quite correct. It is estimated that about &#163;300 million comes to universities direct from the fees paid by students from these countries. They probably inject approximately another &#163;300 million indirectly into the UK economy. They constitute about 11 per cent. of the total number of overseas students. The Government are closely monitoring this matter and are working with the British Council to establish exactly what the extent of the problem may be next year and what can be done about it. Meanwhile the Government very much applaud the efforts of higher education institutions in helping existing overseas students from this region to deal with any hardship.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Quirk: </B>   My Lords, does not the Minister agree that the 50,000 students from the region, the greatest number of whom are from Malaysia and Hong Kong, who come to this country annually are an important resource not only to higher education which benefits, as the Minister said, by &#163;300 million a year--Imperial College receives &#163;9 million a year out of that--but also <P>


<a name="column_1091"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1091</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to British industry as a whole, largely because of the networking that students get involved in during their years here? Would it not be a good idea and in their interests for British firms which have major involvement in the region to set up bursaries for as long as the emergency continues so that we can maintain this flow of students to this country?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the Government regard overseas students in our universities as an important asset and one that we want to maintain. It is, of course, up to companies of the kind that the noble Lord, Lord Quirk, describes to decide whether they want to develop sponsorships or scholarships of this kind. I believe that some already do. The Government would very much welcome more of them establishing programmes of this kind. Meanwhile the Government, through the Chevening scholarship scheme, the Commonwealth scholarship scheme, and scholarships run by the British Council, offer awards to a substantial number of overseas students, including large numbers from this region.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Beloff: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that there is a particular problem, not so much with the Far East as a whole, but with regard to Malaysia? I have information that the number of Malaysian students coming to this country is falling rapidly. Does not this suggest that we made a mistake when we classed Commonwealth students as general overseas students while European students pay lesser fees? Would not the simplest thing be to treat Malaysians as honorary Europeans from the point of view of fees?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the decision to change the fees paid by overseas students was made by the previous government some years ago. The noble Lord, Lord Beloff, is absolutely right that the fall in the number of students from this region is especially pronounced in Malaysia where there has been a drop in applications this year of about 25 per cent. I am, however, glad to say that for most of the other countries the number of applications is holding up, although, of course, applications may not necessarily result in entrants to our universities later this year. As regards treating Malaysian students as Europeans, I am not sure that Malaysian students would welcome that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, a figure of &#163;300 million of revenue that universities may lose has been mentioned. Can my noble friend advise the House what proportion that is of total university revenue income?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, there is no suggestion that all of the &#163;300 million that students from this region are paying in fees will be lost. That is the total sum they are currently paying. The Government and the universities hope that applications will continue to be submitted and that the eventual fall will be relatively small. As I just said, I am glad to say that the <P>


<a name="column_1092"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1092</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>number of applications from most of the countries in the region is holding up. The &#163;300 million is a tiny percentage of the total income of our universities.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, does not the noble Baroness agree that the problem of losing students from the South-East Asian countries is compounded by the overall decline in applications of home students? Therefore the problems for universities are much greater. Will the noble Baroness confirm, or deny, that the &#163;165 million extra that will be allocated to higher education in 1998-99 is permanent year on year funding that is additional to the base funding for higher education?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the second part of the noble Baroness's question does not seem to bear much relation to what is on the Order Paper. The &#163;165 million extra funding that has been found by the Government for next year arises directly from the changes in the funding of students that the Government are introducing. I cannot say what will happen in years after that because of the comprehensive spending review.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister take some comfort from the fact that I seem to recall that over 30 years there have been recurrent occasions when everyone has prophesied woe as regards students coming from the Far East to this country--sometimes that was the result of the policies of the government of the day and now the fall in numbers is the result of financial circumstances in the Far East--but in each case there has been an extraordinary resilience on the part of the students, the political fears have proved unfounded and the attractions of British higher education have remained supreme?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree with everything that the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, has just said.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80303-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Health   (Baroness Jay of Paddington): </B>  My Lords, social services authorities in London, as indeed elsewhere, are seeking to discharge their duties towards asylum seekers as they are currently defined in the most cost-effective and appropriate way. How this is done is, of course, a matter for individual authorities. We would, however, expect those seeking to move asylum seekers to consider very carefully the consequences of doing this, including the impact on the asylum seekers themselves and on the existing communities in the receiving area, and to seek <P>


<a name="column_1093"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1093</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the views of the local authority concerned. As I said in answer to another Starred Question on asylum seekers in your Lordships' House last week, we do not believe that the present system is working well. That is why the Government are reassessing the whole process, including the way that welfare support is delivered to asylum seekers.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Evans of Parkside: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. Does she accept that a number of issues are raised by the proposal of Westminster City Council to relocate asylum seekers on Merseyside, as reported in the Evening Standard? Is my noble friend aware that Merseyside has probably the highest male unemployment in Great Britain and that if there is imported competition for the limited number of jobs available it may cause some friction with local jobseekers? Will the refugees' applications for asylum be speeded up or retarded by living in Merseyside rather than in London? More importantly, will my noble friend give a categorical assurance that no Merseyside local authority will be called upon to make any contribution towards the cost of the imported asylum seekers, no matter how long those asylum seekers remain on Merseyside?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, all of the points that my noble friend has raised reflect precisely the considerable concern that is felt about this problem by the asylum seekers themselves and by the relevant local authorities. I assure my noble friend that we are aware of the potential for difficulties on Merseyside in terms of employment. That is why Westminster Council consulted carefully with the local authorities on Merseyside before deciding to take this step. As I am sure my noble friend is aware, the step was taken because of the large numbers involved. Suitable accommodation in London is now scarce. I assure my noble friend that the costs will continue to be borne by the London local authority. He will be as aware as I that a large number of asylum requests are pending. The Government are seeking to speed up that process.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-02_spnew14"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Lichfield: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that local authorities near Gatwick airport estimate that expenditure on unaccompanied children seeking asylum is approximately &#163;1.2 million a year? If so, is it not time for the Government to decide that the National Assistance Act will not be used in the long term for providing support to asylum seekers but that a return to a realistic benefit system is both cheaper and easier to administer?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-02_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, we are very much aware of the problem of unaccompanied children. As the right reverend Prelate says, it is a problem in areas around airports and seaports in this country, and is growing. It is very much a focus of the review being undertaken. The review is comprehensive and will deal with the subject of unaccompanied children among the other relevant issues.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Ludford: </B>   My Lords, the Question refers to government policy. The Minister replied that it was up <P>


<a name="column_1094"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1094</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to local authorities. It is precisely the absence of a national policy after 10 months in office which so concerns many of us. We are anxious to hear the results of the review. We believe that it should be a national responsibility to welcome and support asylum seekers. Is the noble Baroness aware that the Refugee Council is worried that one result of the current situation is an adverse impact on race relations? That is of great concern to many inner London authorities where the excess costs to local authorities are between &#163;0.5 million and &#163;1 million a year. When budgets are being cut across the board the situation is not helpful to race relations. The Government are undermining the position.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, as I said in answer to previous questions, the Government are at least as concerned as any Member of your Lordships' House about difficulties which many local authorities face on this issue. That is why at central government level, led by my noble and right honourable friends from the Home Office, the Government are addressing the matter as a central policy issue. With her roots and background in local government, I am sure that the noble Baroness would not wish central government to override the autonomous decisions of local authorities on this matter.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that she gave no effective reply to the question of the right reverend Prelate? It is a most interesting and constructive suggestion that I have not heard before. Would the noble Baroness care to reply to it?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to the noble Lord if he feels that I did not reply specifically. The reason that I did not do so was precisely because the issue of the children's grant, the levels of which have not been fixed for next year, is subject to the general consideration on the national strategy which the noble Baroness and other noble Lords have rightly demanded should be forthcoming.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that Westminster is not the only London borough which has had to decant asylum seekers to other parts of the country? Lambeth has had to do the same for reasons of cost effectiveness. Even so, in 1997-98 the council taxpayers of Lambeth are having to foot a bill of no less than &#163;1 million for looking after asylum seekers. Does the noble Baroness not consider that it is grossly unfair that the residents in a borough which is home to many deprived people should have to bear those additional costs?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, yes, and that is precisely why we have said that the National Assistance Act, induced by court action in previous years, is not a suitable way of dealing with the problem. That is precisely why we are addressing the issue. One interesting result of moving asylum seekers from the London boroughs is that I understand they tend to <P>


<a name="column_1095"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1095</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disappear. That may be a way--I do not mean this frivolously--by which local authorities seek to avoid some of their responsibilities. For example, I understand that when Westminster tried to move a large number of asylum seekers to Great Yarmouth where there was a certain amount of reasonable accommodation, it being a seaside resort with only seasonal pressures, 74 per cent. of the asylum seekers simply disappeared. I am sure that the noble Lord would not wish that to be adopted as a policy.

<A NAME = "80303-03_para1"></a>The Government paid &#163;480 million in direct subsidies to Scottish farmers in 1997, an all-time record.

<A NAME = "80303-03_para2"></a>In addition, the Government recently announced that charges for implementing specified risk material controls from 1st April 1998 will not be recovered from the industry.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the paradise he describes does not exist and that the figures for Scotland will be worse than the 34 per cent. drop this year? If the noble Lord wishes to help the industry, surely the Government should have taken up the &#163;940 million in January, as they could have done. The figure from the European Union has now dropped to &#163;642 million. Why has that money not been taken up as it has been by other countries in Europe?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, in addressing the problem of the beef and sheep sectors, we put forward support for &#163;85 million on a UK level which virtually reaches the ceiling available under the agri-monetary compensation system. So we have compensated the most hard hit sector for the adverse effects of currency appreciation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-03_para5"></a>I should point out to the noble Lord that the &#163;940 million that is often referred to is not free money in any sense of the word. Fifty per cent. of that would have to be funded entirely from the UK taxpayer and, as a result of the Fontainebleau Agreement, of the remaining 50 per cent. 71 per cent. would have to be funded by the UK taxpayer.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-03_spnew11"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, as with all statistics, does it not depend how far back one goes? Does the Minister agree that between the 1970s and 1980s farm incomes fell by half, and by half again during the 1980s? They were restored to some extent after the reform of the CAP in 1992 and have now begun to fall again because of the problems with the exchange rate and the green pound.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-03_spnew12"></A><B> A noble Lord: </B>   The question is too long.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-03_spnew13"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it is only by increasing their efficiency and output, and by reducing labour, that farmers have survived this far? They are now down to the bone. Does the noble Lord appreciate how important it is that some help is given?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may point out that, taking a longer term perspective, aggregate income last year was still higher than aggregate income in 14 out of the past 25 years. I would also point out that the support given to agriculture in Scotland, at &#163;480 million, is equivalent to the total budget of Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, and represents support running at &#163;14 per week for the average family in Scotland.

<A NAME = "80303-04_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: In speaking to this amendment I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 238, 239, 240 and 242. Amendments Nos. 237C, 239 and 240 would restrict the making of detention and training orders to offenders aged 15 and over.

<P>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1098</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para2"></a>We agree that there is a strong case for rationalising the courts' present complicated powers to detain juveniles. However, we are concerned that, in the case of offenders aged under 15, giving the courts strengthened powers to order detention could produce a sharp and undesirable increase in the detention of children, most of whom would be better dealt with by supervision in the community.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para3"></a>At present, courts can pass sentences of detention in a young offenders institution on offenders aged 15 and over. For that age group the new sentence would simply replace the existing power. However, it would significantly increase the court's powers to detain young people under 15. Offenders aged 10 to 14 can currently be sentenced to long-term detention under Section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 if they commit an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years (or more when committed by an adult); be sentenced to a supervision order with a "residence requirement" which requires the local authority to place the young person in local authority accommodation (where necessary, secure accommodation can be used) for a specified period of up to six months; or be taken into care through civil care proceedings if they are out of control and, if necessary, held in local authority secure units. We consider that this range of powers is adequate to ensure that juveniles can be detained wherever that is genuinely necessary, and we are very concerned about widening courts' powers to detain this age group.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para4"></a>The courts' powers are to be extended in two phases. First, in April this year, the Government will introduce the Secure Training Order, a new custodial sentence for 12 to 14 year-olds which was part of the last Government's Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994; and the Detention and Training Order contained in this Bill will then supersede it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para5"></a>Past experience shows that removing young people from family and community life is likely to magnify their difficulties. Not only is the normal maturing process interrupted, but reintegration back into normal life presents great difficulties and can lead to long-term problems. All forms of institutional care or custody for young offenders have high reconviction rates; 89 per cent. of juveniles leaving Prison Service custody are reconvicted within two years.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para6"></a>However, high reconviction rates are not restricted to Prison Service establishments: they are also common to other forms of institution. Research into the effectiveness of approved schools (and community homes with education, as they subsequently became) indicates that they increased rather than reduced the likelihood of re-offending. The 1975 edition of the Home Office Handbook, The Sentence of the Court, showed that 65 per cent. of first offenders and 78 per cent. of offenders with previous convictions who were given approved school orders were reconvicted within five years. When the characteristics of offenders were taken into account, those leaving approved schools had a reconviction rate 49 per cent. higher than would otherwise have been expected from their characteristics and records.
<P>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1099</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para7"></a>Even institutions which adopt constructive regimes invariably produce high reconviction rates for young people. Research studies from the late 1970s into secure units for juveniles--such as the Dartington Social Research Institute's study, Locking Up Children, published in 1978, by Spencer Millham, Roger Bullock and Kenneth Hosie (well-known names)--showed that reconviction rates were very high, even though secure units were taking younger and less delinquent children than had been the case several years previously. The Dartington unit found that boys in secure units were younger and less delinquent than in earlier years: 62 per cent. were under 14&#189; years of age. Yet of 587 boys released from secure units and followed up for two years, 76 per cent. of those released to the community re-offended. The majority then underwent a further spell in an institution, usually a borstal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para8"></a>More recently, the Dartington Social Research Unit's study, The Experiences and Careers of Young People Leaving the Youth Treatment Centres (1989), followed up 102 young people leaving youth treatment centres between 1982 and 1985. After two years, 72 per cent. of boys released from youth treatment centres into the community have been reconvicted. The overall figure for boys and girls was 59 per cent., and after three years the proportion had risen to 73 per cent. The study found that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"some groups are more likely to be convicted than others, for instance, persistent delinquents who had three or more convictions prior to entry". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para9"></a>There is no reason to believe that detention and training orders will succeed in producing low reconviction rates when similar measures in the past have markedly failed to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para10"></a>It is particularly disturbing that the Bill gives the Home Secretary a power to extend the Detention and Training Order to children aged 10 and 11. I find that really quite horrifying. Even if their sentences are served in local authority secure accommodation, it should be remembered that such establishments hold an increasing number of young offenders aged up to 16 serving sentences of long-term detention imposed for grave crimes such as murder, manslaughter, rape and robbery. Some of these things are really horrifying, and I hope that the Minister will respond with sympathy and perhaps think of changing some of these policies. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="80303-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees   (Lord Boston of Faversham): </B>  I should point out to the Committee that as Amendments Nos. 240 and 242 are also being spoken to, if Amendment No. 240 is agreed to, I cannot call Amendments Nos. 241 to 243 inclusive.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Windlesham: </B>   I wish to raise the question of the provenance of the new detention and training orders for young offenders. As far as I can see, they were not mentioned in any of the three youth justice consultation papers nor, as a result, in the tabulated responses to those consultation papers which were helpfully placed in the Library. Unless I have overlooked something--and the Minister will tell me if I have--these highly significant new orders seem to have been a late addition.
<P>


<a name="column_1100"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1100</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para11"></a>The first public reference to a "new custodial sentence" appears in Chapter 6 of the White Paper (Cmnd. 3809), published in November 1997. That document outlines the Government's intention to introduce a novel disposal for young offenders from the very early age of 10 to the age of 17: half the sentence would be spent in custody and half under supervision in the community, with a provision for shortening or lengthening the custodial element depending on the progress made. There is a considerable element of new administrative discretion, and that alone should command attention. The orders will run from a minimum duration of four months to a maximum of two years. We are told that it is the Government's initial intention to implement these new orders only for those aged 12 to 17, but with a power to extend by order to children as young as 10 and 11.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para12"></a>Although the proposed new orders for detention and training have some good features--for example, I think we should welcome the focus on preventing offending--there must nevertheless be reservations about the significant extension of powers of the courts to detain and even imprison children between the ages of 12 and 15, especially if there is a possibility of a later reduction of the age to 10. I shall have more to say later about custodial confinement of young and very young offenders, but I believe it is more appropriate to do so when we reach Amendment No. 245.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para13"></a>Will the Minister say whether the provision was a late addition? Secondly, will he say whether there has been any consultation with the agencies that will implement the new orders, apart from raising the matter for discussion by the Youth Justice Task Force? Thirdly, will he say whether the Government will accept that great care will need to be exercised in making young people under the age of 15 subject to these orders, even if they have a record of failing to respond to previous non-custodial penalties?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-04_spnew2"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Lichfield: </B>   In rising strongly to support these amendments, particularly Amendments Nos. 239 and 240, I assure the Minister that I share the very proper concern of the Government, and of other speakers, that people of whatever age, however young, should take appropriate responsibility for their actions and that the victims and potential victims of their criminal behaviour should be protected from further harm. That is what we mean by justice, and that is clear.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para14"></a>However, we must be sure that the degree of responsibility that we ask children and young offenders to take is commensurate with their capacity to understand it, to bear it and then to turn it to good use. Children of that age have all their lives before them. Surely we ought not to give up on them until everything constructive has been tried.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para15"></a>That is necessary not only for the sake of the children. In order to protect others from the future harm which may be wreaked on them by these children, we must be sure that the punishment meted out is a punishment which will be most likely to prevent these children and young people offending again. It must be a punishment, I suggest, which seeks to discover the reasons for the offending behaviour and how they might be remedied. <P>


<a name="column_1101"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1101</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It must seek to educate, to support and even to constrain; but its purpose must also be to divert the young people from offending again.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para16"></a>It is interesting to note that during the 1980s there was a substantial reduction in the number of young people receiving custodial sentences but that that trend has been sharply reversed since the early 1990s. I am told by the Children's Society that, in 1996, 5,300 young offenders aged 17 or under were received into prison custody--the highest number since 1986. Yet, as I understand it, there is no evidence that the behaviour of such children and young people was significantly better in the 1980s. The difference was the way in which we punished them. We punished them with a view to their futures by what has been called "tough love", by challenging them to face up to what they had done, educating them and standing no nonsense, but making clear that we had faith in them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para17"></a>Since that time there have been many projects, some provided by the Children's Society, which have worked successfully with offending children and young people to turn them away from crime. Regrettably, many of those projects, and certainly those run by the Children's Society, have had to close because funds allocated by the previous government have not been renewed. If we have not provided such opportunities for every young offender to change, we have no right to lock up him or her.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para18"></a>We can be sure of one thing: from the evidence, custodial sentences do not divert young people from crime. Properly constructed, rigorous diversion programmes afford a better chance of doing so, at less cost and in a way which will fully express society's responsibility towards young people.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para19"></a>From the conditions contained in Clause 60, it is clear that the Government recognise that particular attention needs to be paid to offending under-12s and under-15s in respect of sentencing. As the law now stands, provision exists for locking up those few for whom, by any reasonable standard, no alternative exists.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para20"></a>It is worth noting that the inclusion of a power to sentence young people, particularly those under the age of 12, to a custodial sentence is completely out of step with the prevalent approach in Europe, where young people under that age are not usually viewed as criminally responsible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-04_para21"></a>There are no grounds for extending the current provision in the way laid out in Clause 60. I hope that the Minister is willing to think again.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

I wish to ask the Minister about the expected scale of the use of subsection (2)(b) of Clause 60.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-05_para0"></a>My maiden speech during the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill focused--non-controversially, of course--on the creation of youth training centres on a regional basis. The centres were described as prisons for 12 year-olds. We now have a measure before us which appears to create the possibility of prison for under-12s.

<A NAME = "80303-05_para1"></a>I acknowledge that some children need secure accommodation. The environment of such accommodation must be of a very high standard, for these children have to be enabled to grow up in spite of being in secure accommodation. Security must be an important component in their care programme, but it must never become the dominant component. We want them to grow away from their offending behaviour rather than be confirmed in it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hilton of Eggardon: </B>   My name too is attached to these amendments. I am astonished that the Government are seeking the power to gaol 10 to 12 year-olds, the sort of draconian measures we argued against so ferociously when we were discussing the Criminal Justice Bill in 1994. It saddens me to see the present Government going down the same draconian route that was pursued by the previous administration.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-05_para2"></a>We tend to turn to America for examples of how to deal with offenders rather than to other parts of Europe which often have far more enlightened regimes. To add to the evidence of research provided by my noble friend Lady David, experience nearer home, in Northern Ireland, was that gaoling 12 to 15 year-olds led to a 90 per cent. reconviction rate. I really do not believe that this is an effective use of resources or a humane way of trying to secure reduced offending by young people.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-05_para3"></a>There is also the danger, of course, that it is cheaper to put people into youth custody centres. The cost may be as little as &#163;20,000 per offender per year whereas with other forms of detention--and certainly some young people do need to be kept in secure accommodation--it can rise to as much as &#163;150,000 per place. There will therefore be pressure on courts and on local authorities to use youth custody rather than local authority places.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-05_para4"></a>These financial pressures on the criminal justice system are to be deplored, particularly in relation to young people. I urge the Government to think again, particularly about seeking the power to gaol 10 to 12 year-olds which seems totally inhumane and counter-productive.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I do not think that I disagree with any of the fundamental purposes identified by noble Lords who have spoken to these amendments. In respect of specific questions put by the noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, I entirely agree that great care will have to be exercised in deploying this power. I should like to set that in a context which will be profoundly different to what has gone before by virtue of other remedies--I use the word carefully--which we are offering in this Bill, which I think have been the general subject of approval. The noble Lord referred to consultation and asked when the DTO first appeared. It is true that the DTO was not in the first three consultation papers. It was, as he says, in the November White Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-05_para5"></a>On the review that the Government conducted, we came to the conclusion that previous custodial arrangements were really rather chaotic. They had <P>


<a name="column_1103"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1103</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>grown up piecemeal, perhaps without a coherent strategy. On assessing that situation we came to the conclusion that the DTO was the appropriate remedy to be available to the courts in some circumstances. We consulted the Home Secretary's task force. The noble Lord is quite right. But we went wider. We asked lay practitioners, the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Directors of Social Services, the Criminal Justice Consultative Council and the Magistrates' Association. So even if the conclusion is not to universal satisfaction, our consultation was a decent and considered one.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-05_para6"></a>The context I propose to spend a moment on, because I recognise the strength of feeling and indeed sympathise with it, is that we are not simply choosing piecemeal remedies and thinking that any of them is a perfect answer to these undoubted problems. We have to think of what we are offering as alternatives in this spectrum. No More Excuses, the White Paper of November, said that we wanted the courts to have a fully effective range of sentencing options, community based, I stress, as well as custodial, for all juvenile offenders. We must not overlook the action plan order; we must not overlook the reparation order. I take entirely to heart the observation of the right reverend Prelate. We do have what I think he would describe as moral duties to young people before incarcerating them. One way to discharge that moral duty, I agree, is to make the young offender realise what he or she has done. The action plan will deal with that; the reparation order will deal with that. It will be demonstrated to a child, however young, that he does have moral responsibilities though it is a child's responsibilities, not an adult's responsibilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-05_para7"></a>I agree that we need to steer young people away from crime if we can. The melancholy truth is that for some children, a relatively small number, a degree of positive constructive custody has to be provided but only if we have discharged our community obligations to nip offending in the bud early and not simply allowed the system to be abused by delay, compounded by inappropriate penalties, so that although the child is not actually encouraged to continue to be a criminal he is not assisted to stop and sees no constructive purpose in stopping.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-05_para8"></a>We believe that custodial sentences should not be regarded simply as an end in themselves but that they are sometimes needed to protect the public by removing the young offender. That, of course, is only a temporary relief. We are looking to positive, constructive regimes to prevent further offending but only at a stage when alternatives have been considered. That is why I accept the melancholy story that previous statistics point to. We have to bear in mind, however, that quite often reoffending rates often derive from a number of circumstances including the fact that no action plan order is at present available, nor any reparation order. And, of course, quite often in the past young offenders have been sentenced to custody--I say this with no harshness--at too late a point for it to be of assistance to them. If one leaves custody too late it does no service to the offender but simply increases the likelihood of further offending.
<P>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1104</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-05_para9"></a>Where custodial sentences are clearly required for 12 to 17 year-olds, we need the detention training order to put in place a framework. That framework has stringent requirements, which appear on the face of the Bill, before custody can be imposed. The tests set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1991 must be satisfied. Either the offence must be so serious that no other sentence can be justified or, in the case of a violent or sexual offence, only custody is adequate to protect the public from serious harm from the offender.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-05_para10"></a>It is a sad proposition but there are circumstances when custody is the only adequate remedy to protect the public from serious harm. That being so, I would suggest, with great respect, that there is another moral and social obligation that any government have; namely, to protect the public so far as is consistent with decent progressive regimes for those who have to be incarcerated.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-05_para11"></a>No one wants to see what is, after all, a child under 17 incarcerated. If all were well, all came from good families, and all had the opportunities that we in this House have had, there would be no need for custody. But that is not the world in which we presently live.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-05_para12"></a>I turn to the different question of the under 12 year-olds. It is not yet apparent that there is a need to introduce this order for 10 and 11 year-olds, and therefore that is my answer to the question put by the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, as to the likely take-up. The Bill, as it stands, as a number of noble Lords indicated, contains simply a power for the Secretary of State to extend the order to include this age group. If experience demonstrates that that is required to assist with a positive, constructive regime for offenders, even of that young age, or for public protection, we would have to give it very careful consideration before the Secretary of State were minded to introduce the power by order.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-05_para13"></a>We propose to monitor the courts' use of detention and training orders for over-12s. We want to monitor carefully the underlying rate of offending by 10 and 11 year-olds. If the order were extended to 10 and 11 year-olds--no one would want to do that other than with a heavy heart--before imposing such an order the court would have to satisfy itself of three things: that the offending is serious enough to justify the use of custody under the tests of the Criminal Justice Act 1991; that the offender is persistent; and, additionally, that only a custodial sentence is adequate to protect the public from further offending by him.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-05_para14"></a>These are not welcome responses to concerns which I recognise as sincerely held and legitimate. However, that is the Government's policy. I believe that it is a soundly based policy which should prove useful in assisting very young people and protecting the public.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   I should like to thank very much the noble Lords and the right reverend Prelate who have supported me on these amendments. I was very interested to hear about the work of the Children's Society which is not being funded as it should have <P>


<a name="column_1105"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1105</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been. I do not think the Minister responded to that or indeed to the right reverend Prelate's point about Europe. For us to be the worst country in Europe for detaining young people is something which we must all find quite abominable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-05_para15"></a>I thank the Minister for his long and careful reply, which will need to be read extremely carefully. All the evidence proves that detention, prison and custody do not work and I do not believe they will work any more now. I realise how much care will be taken before someone is put into custody but I firmly believe that it is wrong to put young children into custody. I know that it is only a power for 10 and 11 year-olds, but even so there is something really abhorrent in it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-05_para16"></a>I shall read carefully what the Minister has said, but I think that we shall almost certainly be coming back at the Report stage with further amendments on this subject. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="80303-06_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie </B>   moved Amendment No. 241:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 48, line 15, leave out ("is a persistent offender") and insert ("has a history of failure to respond to non-custodial penalties and is unable or unwilling to respond to them").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-06_para0"></a>The noble Earl said: With the leave of the Committee, perhaps I may speak to this amendment on behalf of my noble friend Lord Dholakia. Amendment No. 241 does not alter the Bill; it merely alters the wording. It sets out to provide a definition for the emotive term "persistent offender". Such an offender is rightly defined in the amendment as a teenager who,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"has a history of failure to respond to non-custodial penalties and is unable or unwilling to respond to them". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-06_para1"></a>It is always helpful to have this clearly in the Bill so that everyone knows what is meant. There is a difference between a persistent offender and an offender with some previous convictions. The former has a different attitude to his offending behaviour, identifying a lack of motivation to curb that offending behaviour. The latter can be thought of as a teenager trying frustratingly to find the limits imposed by society, and learning, albeit slowly, from the experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-06_para2"></a>My initial reaction to seeing the words "persistent offender" in the Bill was that this was an unhelpful outbreak of labelling. Telling anyone whose behaviour must change that he is a persistent offender runs the risk of confirming the situation and, what is worse, creating a justification for continuing offending behaviour. I believe that the amendment avoids this unhelpful and counterproductive labelling process. I also note that the wording of the amendment has been lifted from the Criminal Justice Act 1982. I beg to move.

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1106</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>if I say a word or two about it while also offering a degree of support for the amendment moved by the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-06_para3"></a>Again, our amendment is merely one that changes the wording of this clause and suggests that the words "further offending by him" in subsection (2)(b)(i) be replaced with the words "serious harm". Those words are more inclusive words in terms of the kind of problems the persistent offender, or whatever he might be called following the amendment moved by the noble Earl, might cause. They are designed to offer better protection and better guidance to the courts as to when they should make use of the power. I shall be interested to know what the Government think in relation to that amendment and I shall listen carefully to what the Minister has to say.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-06_spmin0"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees: </B>  As Amendment No. 243 is being spoken to, I should point out to the Committee that if Amendment No. 242 is agreed to, I cannot call Amendment No. 243.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   I should like to speak briefly in support of Amendment No. 241. It is a well known principle of education that you do not tell a child that he is a bad boy; you tell him that he is a boy who has behaved badly. The use of the words "persistent offender" will tend to encourage a child to role play the part of a persistent offender and it may well give him street cred among his peer group. I support Amendment No. 241.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   As a layman, it seems to me that both the Liberal Democrat amendment, Amendment No. 241, and the Conservative amendment, Amendment No. 243, are well thought out and would improve the Bill. I hope that the Government will give them both serious consideration.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I wish I could think that they are well thought out. Those of your Lordships who have had the responsibility of sitting in court in a judicial capacity--we have with us a former Lord Chief Justice--will realise that when fixing a sentence the court needs to have very specific evidence. There is no more specific evidence than the evidence of previous convictions. The expression "persistent offender" makes it quite clear that the obligation of the court is to consider previous offences.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-06_para4"></a>If, as an alternative and instead of using that expression, the court has to go into a history of failure to respond to non-custodial penalties and the question of whether the child was unable or unwilling to respond, a great deal of evidence will have to be taken and conclusions from that evidence could very well vary. In order that justice may not only be done but appear to be done with a degree of certainty, it is far better to stick to the phrase "persistent offender".
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-06_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   I have to disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Renton. I have sat in a judicial capacity as a magistrate; admittedly it was rather a long time ago. I do not think it will be too difficult to find out whether <P>


<a name="column_1107"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1107</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>someone has been unable or unwilling to respond. A probation officer or a social worker could perfectly well explain what had happened. I very much dislike the phrase "persistent offender" and I am totally in sympathy with the mover of the amendment and the other noble Lords who have spoken in favour of it. I hope that this time the Minister may have a better response.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-06_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I am sorry to say that the noble Baroness is likely to find me a persistent offender until later in the evening. I spoke at a little length on the first group of amendments. I said then that we found the present provisions for custody not focused or coherent. Therefore, we are looking to something which is new and capable of being flexible, positive and constructive. I have already set out the conditions and I do not repeat myself.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-06_para5"></a>Amendment No. 241 would change the additional test which must be met before an under-15 year old can be made the subject of a detention and training order. Instead of the court simply having to satisfy itself that the offender is persistent, it would have to go through the further test of a history of failing to respond to non-custodial penalties and also that the offender was unwilling or unable to respond to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-06_para6"></a>I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, that telling someone he is a persistent offender is not going to be a badge of merit; but, equally, telling him that he has a history of failing to respond to non-custodial penalties and he is unable or unwilling to respond to them, is not likely to improve the shining hour. So with great respect to the noble Lord, I do not believe that his point is well made. We believe that to limit the court's discretion to impose a detention and training order where it would be appropriate, is not the way forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-06_para7"></a>Amendment No. 243 is a still further narrowing of the criteria on which a detention and training order could be imposed on 10 and 11 year-olds, should the provision subsequently be introduced for that age group.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-06_para8"></a>We believe that Amendment No. 243 is narrowing too far. It is deeply distressing, but there are offenders of that age who cause a good deal of harm to other vulnerable sections of the community. Children are particularly vulnerable, but not uniquely vulnerable. Quite a lot of people have their lives made a misery by very young offenders. The Government have a duty to attend to their interests as well--not to put their interests above all else but to give them a decent regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-06_para9"></a>If the order is made by the Secretary of State in due time, and if one has someone who is already a persistent offender at that age and the court is convinced that custody is the only way to protect the public from further offending, we believe that court intervention, as an opportunity, should be there. We do not believe that raising the threshold any further does anyone any favours, neither the victims nor the defendants. We have struck a balance in the legislation between restricting the use of custody and giving the courts sufficient discretion.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-06_para10"></a>I stress again that before one comes to the conclusion in many cases that a child needs to be in custody, or should be in custody, there are alternatives which we are providing. We believe that they are capable, if worked properly, of transforming the way in which we deal with young children. I refer to the action plan, the reparation order and other remedial measures which do not involve custody. We specified them on earlier occasions. Sometimes small children can do infinite harm whether or not they recognise it. Sometimes they will need to be dealt with constructively, carefully, but nevertheless firmly.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-06_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for his answers. While it may be for the convenience of the more judicially-minded Members of the Committee that a persistent offender is just someone who has committed many offences, as someone coming more from the social work end of the process, there is a difference between an offender who commits the same offence several times and someone who commits a different offence each time. Persistence means continuing to commit the original offence. From the social worker's point of view, trying to promote change is never helped by labelling because, as I have said, it allows the offender to say, "I am fated and predestined to do it". That is not a useful thing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-06_para11"></a>The Minister has declined to accept my definition. I was hoping that he would very willingly insert it in Clause 92, which gives the opportunity for a definition. Perhaps it may appear as a government amendment later. The Minister has kindly smiled at me. Therefore, without more ado, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 48, line 30, leave out from ("be") to ("24") and insert ("not less than 4 months or more than").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-07_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: I hope that the Minister will smile on me. This is a very simple and straightforward drafting amendment. Clause 60(5) currently states that detention and training orders,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall be 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18 or 24 months". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-07_para1"></a>No further discretion is allowed other than that the order should be for one of those seven specified times. My amendment suggests that it should be not less than 4 months and not more than 24 months, allowing the court to choose its own time within that band. That seems a much simpler way and leaves greater discretion to the court. I do not know why the Government drafted the matter in the way they did. I shall be very interested in the noble Lord's explanation and to know whether he could allow the court that little bit of extra discretion. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="80303-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I am sorry that I smiled at the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie. I shall try to improve my behaviour in future. The noble Lord has indicated the consequence of his amendment if it were accepted. We have gone to discrete periods of four, six, <P>


<a name="column_1109"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1109</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>eight, 12, 18 or 24 months because we want to make the orders readily understandable to the offenders; to try to prevent inconsistencies in sentencing; to help in designing constructive regimes and sentence plans; and to have equitable early and late release arrangements. I quite understand that a view, which could reasonably be come to, is that proposed by the noble Lord. We thought about it with some care because this is an unusual sentencing regime. But for the reasons that I have briefly mentioned we came to the conclusion that this was the better way forward.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   I find that a fairly extraordinary response. The Government wish to make the matter understandable to the offender. I do not see why they cannot understand the court giving a sentence of 22 months, 20 months or whatever, and some figure other than four, six, eight, 10, 12, 18 or 24 months. I take it that our education system has not come to such a pass that the only numbers that offenders can understand are the seven numbers put in front of them. I would have thought that other numbers would be within the grasp of most offenders. However, I take the noble Lord's point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-07_para2"></a>The second argument he put forward was that he desires consistent sentencing and I support him in that. But I fail to see how setting out seven discrete periods increases the possibility of consistent sentencing. That is a matter we shall come to later on. We all like to see a degree of consistency, but I fail to see why one cannot have consistency when the court has the discretion to choose any time between four months and 24 months. Having said that, I do not believe that this is an amendment of fundamental importance. I shall look again very carefully--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Before my noble friend sits down, perhaps I may with humility intervene, to say that it is an extraordinary situation to find such a provision in the Bill. Normally, we try to give the court discretion to impose a sentence to fit the crime and the offender's previous record. Under Clause 60(5), although a court could impose an order for four, six, eight, 10, 12, 18 or 24 months, it would be excluded from imposing a period of detention of, say, 14, 15, 16, 20 or 22 months, which is quite absurd. I implore the noble Lord the Minister, who is generally so open-minded, to think again before my noble friend withdraws his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The provision does not take away discretion from the courts but places the discretion in discrete bands. The court will have to put its mind to whether a term of four, six, eight, 10 or 12 months is appropriate or, in more serious cases, 18 months or, in the most serious cases, 24 months. We believe that useful device will have two consequences--consistency of sentencing and maintaining the principle <P>


<a name="column_1110"></a>

<A NAME="80303-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   I noted carefully what the noble Lord the Minister said, which is that the provision is not taking away the discretion of the court but placing it in discrete bands. That seems to me to be taking away a degree of discretion but, at this stage, it would probably be best if I were to take away my amendment. In doing so, may I say how grateful I am to my noble friend Lord Renton for his support. I will read carefully what the Minister had to say and I may possibly return to this matter at a later stage, when we can look in more detail at the noble Lord's argument--which I am afraid I do not accept.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-07_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment provides that time on remand should automatically reduce the term of a detention and training order. Clause 61(6) as it stands requires the court to take account of time spent on remand in custody when sentencing a young offender to a detention and training order. The amendment provides that time spent on remand will automatically reduce the sentence. Prisoners on remand are not only deprived of their liberty but are usually held in the most restricted conditions in the prison system. It would be unjust to make them serve this time twice over.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-07_para7"></a>It may be argued that courts should be permitted to disallow remand time from counting when the defence has wasted time before a trial. There is, however, a risk that defendants will thereby be penalised for the behaviour of dilatory or less than competent defence lawyers and that, in cases involving co-defendants, one defendant could be penalised for delays caused by another. We prefer to see the problem of time-wasting before trial dealt with by the rigorous application of time limits applicable to both prosecution and defence at each stage of the pre-trial process.

I am not convinced that I can support this amendment because I am a little worried about automatic backdating. I know that is part of the English system but I want to speak briefly about the Scottish system, which can be characterised by the fact that the defence solicitor or agent makes a plea to the sheriff for the backdating of the sentence in the event of the defendant having been in custody before sentencing. That provision allows the sheriff to grant backdating provided that the individual who has been in custody did not deliberately waste time or was in some <P>


<a name="column_1111"></a>

Although she has not had much luck with the Minister so far this afternoon, I very much hope that a great beam is crossing my noble friend's face even now and that he will grant this amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-07_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The purpose of these new orders is to run for a set period that will be clearly understood by all concerned--the defendant, his or her family, the supervisor and victim. The period must be long enough but no longer than is required to allow effective intervention and rehabilitation insofar as that may be brought about. We want to protect that clarity and to allow for effective intervention. We have therefore taken a different approach to the crediting of remand time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-07_para8"></a>Currently, remand time is deducted after the sentence has been passed and the residue is served in custody. We want the courts to be in a position to be as flexible as possible. If the amendment were carried, the courts would be obliged to reduce the term of each detention and training order by the period spent on remand. That would take away the court's flexibility to take account when sentencing of the time spent on remand. I put in parenthesis our determination to rid the system as far as humanly possible of dreadful cumulative delays.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-07_para9"></a>If a court decides, having considered things carefully and taken into account the time spent on remand--and it may be, the reasons for that time--that four months is the right period for the individual to have, I repeat without apology, a positive and constructive regime intended to prevent reoffending, we believe that the court ought to be able to say, "Four months is the appropriate length. We have taken into account the time spent on remand. There will be no automatic deduction".
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-07_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   We are getting used to stonewalling by the Minister and to lack of a generous response. I thought that everybody was very worried about the length of time that young and older people are kept on remand, thereby filling prisons and other places of custody, such as secure accommodation--which seems altogether bad. Many times, people who are kept on remand are not given a custodial sentence. The whole question of remand ought to be looked at seriously. I thank my noble friend Lord Acton for his support. Again, of course, I am disappointed at such an ungenerous response. I shall read what the Minister said but I give no guarantee that I shall not return to this matter at the next stage.

<FONT SIZE=3>noble Baroness, Lady David. Both my amendments and the amendment of the noble Baroness are designed to prohibit the placing of children under the age of 15 in Prison Service custody under a detention and training order. It first appears as though the noble Baroness's amendment is a more elegant way of achieving that objective, as it is easily comprehensible. It states exactly that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"where the offender is under the age of 15, such accommodation shall not include a young offender institution". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-08_para1"></a>I have approached the matter differently, by excluding Clause 62(7)(b), to keep young offenders out of Prison Service custody, while, for the over 15s, I have excluded subsection (7)(a), respecting a secure training centre. My reasoning is that I think it appropriate that there should be some way of ensuring that over-15s do not overlap with under-15s, allowing the risk of cross-fertilisation, if I may put it in those terms, with the over-15s corrupting the under-15s. However, I shall no doubt be informed that that is not the right way to set about it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-08_para2"></a>I do not want to rehearse some of the arguments that were put forward earlier when we discussed the question raised on Clause 60 by the noble Baroness, Lady David, on when custody is appropriate for under-15s. Although custody might be appropriate, there are occasions when Prison Service custody would not be appropriate. That is why we have tabled these amendments in their current form. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-08_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Henley, has described the purpose of my Amendment No. 246 as being to prohibit the placing of children under 15 in Prison Service custody. The current minimum age for being sent into Prison Service custody is 15. However, as it stands, Clause 62(7) apparently enables a child of any age who has been given a detention and training order to be placed in a Prison Service young offender institution. That could mean a child as young as 12 or even, if the lower age range of the order is reduced from 12 to 10, a child as young as 10. Presumably, it cannot be the intention of the legislation that young children should be placed in Prison Service accommodation. I believe that that should be made absolutely clear on the face of the Bill.

<A NAME="80303-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Windlesham: </B>   The abolition of child imprisonment is one of the great causes of penal reform in the 19th century although the main changes did not come until the Children Act 1908. It would be a sad day if, nearly a century later, we were to see the clock being set back.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-08_para3"></a>The principal objection towards which Amendment No. 246 is directed is not really to the notion of confinement where that is unavoidable above the age of 15, but is essentially to the place of confinement. We can all agree with the Home Secretary's opening words in the preface to the White Paper:

<A NAME = "80303-08_para4"></a>We can all agree with the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, that destructive behaviour by some teenagers regrettably can, and at times does, cross the line between <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>what is anti-social and what is criminal. In those circumstances, the young person concerned needs to be confronted with the consequences of his or her behaviour. If a custodial sentence is justified, it is the "how" and the "where" that is crucial.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-08_para5"></a>Several Members of this Committee will remember the highly charged debates during the passage of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 on the secure training orders and, in particular, the part played in those debates by the late Lady Faithfull. At that time I recall Labour Front Bench spokesmen arguing vigorously for persistent young offenders to be detained in local authority secure accommodation rather than in one of the proposed new training centres. There were supposed to be five national training centres, containing no more than 200 young people--that is, 40 in each--which would be managed by the Prison Service or by private contractors. That was three-and-a-half years ago. Where are we now? Not one of them is in operation. One has been constructed and is, I believe, due to be opened this April. So, here we have the next major criminal justice Bill and the innovation of one government being superseded by the innovation of another before it has come into effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-08_para6"></a>But the lesson is the same: prison department establishments (whether young offender institutions or secure training centres) are the least effective of all the available disposals if measured in terms of preventing reoffending. We entirely accept what the noble Lord, Lord Williams, said--indeed, it is implicit in the Government's approach as set out in the White Paper--that much of this legislation is aimed at the need to prevent reoffending.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-08_para7"></a>All forms of institutional care and institutional custody for young offenders unhappily have high reconviction rates; but 89 per cent. of juveniles leaving Prison Service custody are convicted again within two years, and that is a staggering percentage. I strongly support the amendments.

<A NAME="80303-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   Perhaps I may follow what the noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, said about the philosophy of this Bill. I am afraid that my government seem to go against so much that went on in the last century and much more recently. I remember--I am sure that older Members will remember--Lady Wootton, who was very much in the vanguard of thinking on all these matters. I well remember in 1994 how the late Lady Faithfull fought for children not to be sent to prison but to have secure accommodation available. It saddens me that we are now going into reverse on all this.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   In this order we want to offer flexibility in the arrangements for dealing with young offenders. We want to be able to place individual young offenders in accommodation according to their individual needs and maturity. That is why the order at present provides for the placement of young offenders in a young offender institution, a secure training centre, <P>


<a name="column_1114"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1114</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>local authority secure accommodation, a youth treatment centre or other accommodation which may be directed by the Secretary of State. The result of these amendments would be to restrict the options.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-08_para8"></a>No one wants to see a child deprived of liberty. I would suggest that very often different children mature at different rates and that chronological age is not always a good indicator of either maturity or, just as importantly, vulnerability. The consequence of these amendments would be that one could not put a vulnerable offender who had just turned 15 and was subject to, for instance, a four-month detention and training order, in a secure training centre, whereas a less vulnerable 14 year-old, just a few weeks younger but subject to a full two-year detention and training order, could be placed in a secure training centre until release, possibly after his 16th birthday, but not in a young offender institution.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-08_para9"></a>I concede that those are extreme examples, but they indicate that one does not want to look to limiting discretion to place young offenders in the secure accommodation which is most suitable to their needs. We do not believe that restricting flexibility is the way we should be going.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-08_para10"></a>I take up a point which my noble friend Lady David made earlier about secure accommodation for holding young people on remand. We are reviewing the range of secure accommodation to hold young people on remand or when they have been sentenced and how we can make best use of it. That review should be completed quite soon and will inform consideration of how to deal with the very difficult question of juveniles in secure accommodation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. He said that the review would be completed quite soon. Can the noble Lord say whether "quite soon" means that the review will be completed before the Bill leaves this House or while the Bill is in another place having completed its passage through this House?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-08_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I doubt that the review would be completed before the Bill left this House, bearing in mind the nature of the review. If I am given any specific details I shall in the usual way write to the noble Lord.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-08_para11"></a>One does not want legislative inflexibility built into the regime. If a child has to go into custody of whatever kind that should be related sensibly and flexibly to the needs of that individual child. Children can vary quite significantly. There are some bold, sophisticated, subtle young people who are well versed in crime at the age of 13 or 14. Equally, there are lost souls who are rather vulnerable and easily led and need to be dealt with differently and not on the basis of chronological age.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-08_para12"></a>I hope that I have set out clearly the Government's position and that the review of the secure accommodation is of some comfort to my noble friend. On that basis I ask the noble Lord not to press his amendment.

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1115</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lords on various occasions speaking from the Dispatch Box for the Government have used the words "soon" and "quite soon". According to my understanding, those words can have a variety of different meanings. I have the impression that on this occasion the "quite soon" is not as soon as all that and it is quite likely that we shall not have the benefit of this report before the Bill leaves this House and goes to another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-08_para13"></a>I shall read very carefully what the noble Lord said. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady David, will do likewise. I have a sneaking suspicion that both I and the noble Baroness will wish to return to these issues at Report stage and possibly Third Reading so that they can be explored further. With that warning, perhaps the noble Lord will do his utmost to ensure that the "quite soon" in relation to the review is genuinely "quite soon" and that the review will, with a little luck, arrive in time to assist noble Lords at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="80303-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton </B>   moved Amendment No. 248:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 50, line 36, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) An offender who is a girl under the age of 18 shall be kept separate from adults and shall be detained in a separate institution such as local authority secure accommodation, or in a separate part of an institution also holding adults, unless, after assessment and in exceptional circumstances, it is held to be in the best interests of the offender to be held with adults for a temporary period.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-09_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 248 would make it unlawful for girls aged under 18 to be held with adults in prison. This would bring the UK into line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 37, to which the Government have entered a reservation, requires that juveniles and adults should be held separately. The information supporting this amendment was obtained by the Howard League's inquiry in 1997, which I had the privilege to chair, into the use of prison custody for girls aged 15 to 17. The inquiry visited all prisons that held teenage girls under the age of 18. It was able to talk to governors and staff and consult the probation, education, medical and psychology departments of each prison. The inquiry also interviewed over 80 per cent. of the girls under 18 who were being held to find out their offences and backgrounds.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-09_para1"></a>The inquiry's report Lost Inside! The Imprisonment of Teenage Girls was published on 27th October 1997. All the girls who were interviewed were between 15 and 17. All were vulnerable and damaged youngsters in trouble. Forty per cent. had been in care; 65 per cent. had experienced broken families; 57 per cent. were excluded from school or were long-term non-attendees; 41 per cent. admitted to drug or alcohol abuse; and many had been abused.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-09_para2"></a>During 1997 over 300 girls aged under 18 were held in adult prisons. At any one time there are between 60 and 80 girls held in the system. In 1992, however, there were only about 25. We believe that <P>


<a name="column_1116"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1116</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the main reason for the three-fold increase is that courts send girls to prison more readily than previously. Girls who are given a custodial sentence under Section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982, which deals with detention in a young offender institution, are always held in women's gaols alongside adults. This occurs because there are no specifically designated young offender institutions for girls as there are for boys, who are always held separately from adults. In order to abide by the letter of the law these prisons are designated as young offender institutions, although in reality they are adult prisons with few facilities for young people and with regimes designed for adults.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-09_para3"></a>Should not young girls of 15 and 16 have full-time education? The Prison Service is unable to provide special units to accommodate small groups of girls around the country because the number is too small, and one large young offender institution would result in children being hundreds of miles from home. The best option is to hold the girls in local authority secure accommodation units where, apart from providing rehabilitative regimes designed for adolescents, there is a better chance of those girls being nearer their families because the units are regional.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-09_para4"></a>Under the clause girls as young as 12, and possibly 10, who are sentenced to detention and training orders can be held in adult gaols which are also designated as young offender institutions. This arises because the definition of "secure accommodation" in Clause 62(7) of the Bill includes young offender institutions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-09_para5"></a>In August last year the High Court ruled that the Home Office policy of holding young offenders in adult gaols at the start of their sentence was unlawful. Four of the five holding prisons which took prisoners direct from the courts after sentence were adult prisons with no designation as young offender institutions. Since then a number of these prisons have been redesignated as both adult prisons and young offender institutions. Since the Flood case the Prison Service has begun to reorganise the prisons to provide separate sleeping accommodation for juveniles. However, the practice remains that during the day teenagers share regimes with adults and mix with them, still in breach of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-09_para6"></a>The Prison Service argues mixing adults and children provides the children with mothering figures and that as a result young girls are less volatile; but there is a danger that young girls will become bonded to prison. Further, those who mother the girls are themselves often damaged women who are unlikely to be able to provide good role models for the children to follow. The danger is that relationships that appear to be mothering can hide subtle bullying which prison staff may find hard to detect. The risk of contamination from adults is no less with girls than with boys. Girls are just as <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>impressionable and will want to emulate women who have committed more sophisticated offences such as credit card fraud. They particularly look up to women in their 20s.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-09_para7"></a>The Howard League found that despite being minors the girls were not often given protection under the Children Act. The Howard League inquiry found cases where girls were mixing with adults who had committed serious violent and sexual offences against children. For example, a 15-year-old was placed in a cell next to a woman who had been convicted of procuring 15-year-olds into prostitution. The Howard League is concerned that questions about sex and other issues around growing up are becoming distorted for children at the crucial ages of 15, 16 and 17 at a time when they are sorting out their difficult problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-09_para8"></a>While the presence of the older women may help in keeping young girls less volatile, we believe that this can be achieved by holding the girls in small groups in local authority secure units.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-09_para9"></a>Many prison staff are not suited to working with demanding youngsters, nor do they particularly want to do so, having been recruited to work with adults. They are also largely untrained in dealing with a vulnerable and difficult group. The only training available is a three-day training pack, designed by the trust for the study of adolescence. Since the prisons are essentially designed for adults, the girls represent a very small percentage and are included in the adult regime. There is little provided which is designed for their rehabilitation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-09_para10"></a>The culture and environment in prison is damaging for adolescent girls. They are engulfed in a world of dysfunction where emotionally damaged women regularly self harm, where any number of drugs are widely available and where bullying may be endemic. The girls are the odd ones in the prison and they are expected to behave like the adults that they are not. Typically, teenage behaviour is not tolerated by staff and older prisoners.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-09_para11"></a>The amendment is flexible enough to allow girls in exceptional circumstances, for example if they wish to have a baby with them, which may be in their best interest, to be held with adults for a temporary period.

That is the question of young girls who are mothers or mothers-to-be. Can the Minister say whether there is any mother and baby accommodation at all outside prison?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Mallalieu: </B>   I support the amendment brought by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, and in doing so pay tribute to her and her panel who last year produced a report that was both powerful and damning on a relatively small number of teenage girls for whom our present system, frankly, makes no appropriate provision.

<P>

<A NAME = "80303-09_para13"></a>As a barrister visiting prisons, one is normally confined to the areas set aside for legal visits or, on occasions, to the hospital wing, if one's client is being held there. The impression one gets of the atmosphere and regime is usually quite superficial and restrictive. However, women's prisons are those which over the years have left the deepest impression on me: an undercurrent of bullying, intimidation, favouritism and ganging up, all set against a background of a closed community of mainly emotionally damaged women, is sometimes palpable even from where I have been sitting during brief visits.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-09_para14"></a>The report produced by the Howard League from a panel chaired by the noble Baroness opened my eyes and confirmed that impression as reality. Older women who find themselves in prison are very often, perhaps more often than not, serious social misfits, and yet into that unhealthy and corrupting environment we are currently sending juvenile girls for whom, because of their small number and no doubt the expense that would be involved, we have made no proper provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-09_para15"></a>As the report showed, a high proportion of them sadly come from care, which is an indictment in itself. Others come from broken homes and a widespread background of abuse. The report refers to the high incidence of self-mutilation among those young girls whilst in prison, which says more than any words about the state of mind of so many of these youngsters who we are treating in this way; yet we are currently putting them into regimes which are designed for adults, and under the care of staff who have had only the most rudimentary training in how to deal with this age group.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-09_para16"></a>As the noble Baroness stated, unlike boys who are kept separate from adults, we usually place these very disturbed girls in close proximity to older women who are themselves often damaged, and we expose them to a culture of corruption.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-09_para17"></a>As the noble Baroness indicated, what we are doing appears to be contrary to Article 37 of the United Nations Convention. There is an alternative, and that is local authority secure accommodation with proper rehabilitative regimes which are designed for this age group. They would surely provide a better chance for the future for these young offenders than exposing them to older women who the system has already plainly failed. The amendment to this part of the Bill gives an ideal opportunity to our Government to stop this happening. I beg to support the amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80303-10_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Tenby: </B>   I rise to support the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lady Masham. My noble friend has already done a great deal of valuable work in chairing the group which produced this extremely useful report at the end of last year on the use of prison custody for girls between 15 and 17 years of age, of whom there are probably no more than 60 at any one time within the system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para0"></a>In a way, the amendment and others which follow all hinge on the undesirability in a civilised society of committing various groups of offenders to senior prison establishments. In this case it is girls who, bizarrely, are not given their own separate young offender establishment.
<P>


<a name="column_1119"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1119</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para1"></a>I fully realise the administrative implications which will follow should the amendment be adopted. No doubt the Minister will enumerate those implications in his reply. Let me try to make an educated guess as to some of the reasons he may advance. The numbers are small: we know that already. To have a custom-built section in a designated prison will inevitably mean concentration of all such prisoners there, almost certainly far from family and support probation services. It will place too high a financial burden on the prison estate. That is a situation that over the years the Government have inherited from past administrations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para2"></a>All these arguments have merit: it would be foolish and unfair to say otherwise. No-one is blaming the Government for this state of affairs. This thoroughly unsatisfactory situation stems from years of neglect and the absence of imagination on the part of previous administrations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para3"></a>What we do have a right to say, surely, is this: let us do something about it now. A complete reorganisation and refunding of the programme for local secure accommodation could remove these girls from the prison system now and for ever, especially if we take the bold step of parting local secure accommodation, at least for the purposes of funding, from the Health and Social Security Department, and passing it to where it belongs, the Home Office and Prison Service. If that revolutionary suggestion does not take the smile off the noble Lord the Minister, I do not know what will.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hurd of Westwell: </B>   I support the noble Baroness, Lady Masham. I do not believe that she needs a great deal of support because the work she has done in this field gives her a unique authority to speak. She has mobilised the argument very well.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para4"></a>I pray in aid Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, who, in his thematic review of women offenders published last year, stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There are serious child protection issues in mixing young prisoners with others... We noted, for example, women convicted of procuring being held alongside 15 and 16 year olds". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para5"></a>That deals with the mothering argument which the noble Baroness expected to meet from the Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para6"></a>The Minister may argue--and we can understand why he should do so--that the Prison Service is now committed to providing wholly separate units designated to the needs of teenagers. But, as has been pointed out, the numbers are small; we are talking about 80 15 to 17 year-old girls in the system at any one time. Separate prison units for that purpose would be expensive and, as the noble Baroness pointed out, they would inevitably mean that such girls would be held hundreds of miles away from their own homes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para7"></a>The Chief Inspector of Prisons went further. In the same review he stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I am convinced that the Prison Service is better suited to, and more appropriate for, dealing with adults and that children",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para8"></a>that is, children of both sexes,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"should no longer be its responsibility. I am also convinced that, whilst some of the particular needs of children in custody are shared with young adults, they have other distinct needs in the areas of <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_1120"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1120</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>protection, maturation and education. I therefore conclude that the Prison Service should relinquish responsibility for all children under the age of 18". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para9"></a>As has been pointed out, the number of girls sent to Prison Service custody trebled between 1992 and 1996. Many of us would believe that most could and should be punished in the community. However, for those who genuinely deserve and require a secure environment, detention should be in local authority secure accommodation which, for all its faults--such accommodation can never be perfect--is likely to be closer to home and more responsive to the needs of children than a prison can ever be.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   I support the noble Baroness. In doing so, I join those who have paid tribute to her consistent commitment to this issue. If we take penal policy seriously, as regards serious offences, we can never underestimate the importance of punishment and the protection of society. However, in a civilised society, the greatest challenge of all in penal policy is the rehabilitation of the offender. In the treatment of young girls, I find it difficult to imagine anything which could engender a greater likelihood of delinquent behaviour in later life than the issue raised by this amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para10"></a>There is plenty of evidence to indicate that even when dealing with the most serious offences, if the right kind of individual and personal attention can be provided for the young girl found guilty of the crime there is a real chance of building a better life for the future. It is easy in such debates to ignore or to make only a passing reference to the fact that in almost every case there are horrific stories of conditioning in younger life, in family circumstances and so forth which those of us who come from what can be described as more normal family circumstances find difficult to believe.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para11"></a>For all those reasons, I hope that my noble friend will take the amendment seriously and will accept it. I have heard him argue that we must be realistic, that not everything can be done at once and that only small numbers are involved. However, perhaps I may say without being accused of being over emotional, each individual case represents a 100 per cent. problem in terms of the individual. To say that only a small number of girls is involved and then to ignore the future cost to society in failing immediately to find appropriate treatment is extraordinary. Therefore, I cannot believe that it is possible to underestimate the need for urgency in action.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para12"></a>I know that the Minister is sympathetic. I hope that today he will say that his department is determined to move faster in this matter and that he will indicate that by accepting the amendment tabled by a noble Baroness who is second to none in her understanding of and commitment to the issue.

<A NAME = "80303-10_para13"></a>I am on my feet because I wish it to be on record that some of us on this side of the Committee, quite apart from the noble Lord who has just spoken with far greater experience than I, support the amendment. It is, so to speak, an all-party amendment. I wish to ask the Minister seriously to consider not only the relatively small number of people involved, 60 or 80--a handful compared with the mass of prisoners--but also the cost involved compared with the cost to society if action is not taken. A balance must be struck. I hope that the Minister will give us a firm assurance so that we do not have to divide on the issue. However, if there is a Division, I shall support the amendment.

Everything that could be said was said, first by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, and then by other Members of the Committee. I believe that no rational distinction can be drawn between the position of adolescent boys, who are kept separately from adults, and adolescent girls. I believe that the case for adolescent girls is even stronger; they should not be contaminated by too intimate a contact with older women.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para14"></a>I hope that on this occasion the Minister, who has not been particularly giving in connection with the Bill, will assure the Committee that it is not a matter of cost and that he will accede to the requests which have been made.

All the chaplains and voluntary workers in prisons would wish to support the noble Lord, Lord Judd, in pointing out that small numbers represent a great opportunity. Small numbers enable relationships to be struck which lead to the prime aim of rehabilitation sought by every Member of the Committee. The amendment represents the most effective way of achieving that result.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-10_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   I support the amendment. The penultimate line mentions the "best interests" of the young girl. The noble Baroness gave as an example the possibility of a girl staying with her young baby, but I have two further ideas of what it might be. The first would be the application of crisis theory; the idea that one might promote change by shocking the individual with the reality of imprisonment. The second one is the rather mistaken view that the young woman might learn a coping strategy for imprisonment just by being in prison. I should particularly like to reject that, because I believe that it is much more important that young offenders learn coping strategies for living in the community.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Members of the Committee will remember that the noble Baroness raised this matter by way of a tabled Question a short while ago. I do not believe that anyone who has heard what she said today, or read the reports to which she <P>


<a name="column_1122"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1122</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, referred, could approach the topic other than with a sense of deep unease and unhappiness.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para15"></a>It seems to me that the amendment really deals, first, with the question of accommodation; and, secondly, with mixing during activities. The Flood judgment in 1997 required the Prison Service to put right what was wrong in the present arrangements. It means that all female offenders under the age of 21 years are now held in designated parts of female prisons. In some cases there are separate houses or separate wings. Whether it is a separate house or a separate wing, those designated areas operate under young offender institution rules.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para16"></a>It is possible that for specific reasons some young women should be in a prison rather than in a young offenders' institution. That is what is allowed under the Criminal Justice Act 1982, but it only applies on a case-by-case basis and not a category basis. Reference has already been made to some examples in that respect; for example, placement in a mother-and-baby unit or the need for specialist medical or psychiatric care, which will not always be available in the sort of local authority accommodation that has been suggested as the answer to these problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para17"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Acton, asked me a specific question, the answer to which is, no. There is no local authority home with a mother-and-baby unit. The Prison Service has four: one at Holloway, one at New Hall in Wakefield; one at Styal in Cheshire and one at Askham Grange, the open prison, in York. I readily accept that it is no answer to say that the number involved is fewer than 80, indeed, that is something that we must consider.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para18"></a>If we had the number of distinct local authority units which has been mentioned we might well end up with a number of local authority secure accommodation units containing as few as five persons. It is very difficult to get a decent, meaningful and constructive regime for education, training and appropriate programmes to help address problems so as to do away with the possibility of reoffending in units which are that small.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para19"></a>I know that this point has already been made, but we should not overlook the fact that the possibility of contact with family and with the home community can be maintained. This is no excuse; nor is it a reproach. We inherited a situation which is difficult. I do not pretend that we have even begun to achieve a perfect solution.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para20"></a>So, what have we done? We have reorganised the Prison Service so that there is now a framework for delivery of a regime specifically directed to women and female young offenders. A good deal of the impetus for that came from the report of the chief inspector and from the report to which the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, made such a notable contribution. Moreover, some of that impetus has come from within the service and a part of it is predicated on our belief that custodial sentences are not an end in themselves.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para21"></a>I mentioned earlier the review of the range of secure accommodation for holding young persons who are remanded in, or sentenced to, custody. I can assure the Committee that that review also includes now--in the sense that the review is still continuing--consideration of <P>


<a name="column_1123"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the most appropriate arrangements for the small number of girls held in custody. I agree with what my noble friend Lord Judd said; namely, that whether the number is 60 or 80 is not really material. Each one of those girls is an individual. I emphasise the sense of deep unease that one feels when one looks at what the chief inspector said in his report and, indeed, at the findings of the Howard League report.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-10_para22"></a>All I can say to Members of the Committee is that, for my part, I take such concerns most seriously. I am not seeking to avoid Home Office responsibility for this problem which is both long-standing and serious. I cannot accept the amendment. However, I undertake to transmit what I take to be the unanimous, strongly expressed and held views of this Chamber to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   I should like to thank all supporters of the amendment for their very strong support. I also thank the Minister for his response. However, I must point out to the noble Lord that, when we were looking at secure accommodation, we found that some very serious offenders are now housed in secure accommodation provided by local authorities, while less serious offenders--for example, young girls--are in prison. The situation really does seem upside down and extraordinary. Before we reach the Report stage, I hope that the Minister will review the situation because it seems to be entirely wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-11_para0"></a>When we visited New Hall prison, which is near Wakefield, we found that the girls were being locked up at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. That is really very damaging for young teenagers who, as we all know, can be very difficult. Indeed, the complete lock-up takes place at 5 p.m. That is not a healthy situation. Bearing in mind what the Minister said and, indeed, the strong support expressed by Members of the Committee, I shall carefully consider what is going to happen. It is possible that we may have to divide on the matter on Report if we do not receive a satisfactory solution. Indeed, that will put emphasis on the whole matter when it goes to the other place. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   Before we leave this part of the Bill, I should like to ask the Minister whether he can say how the Government envisage the training component of detention and training orders will actually be organised in practice. Can the Minister say how it will be done, given the fact that there are likely only to be small numbers of people undergoing these orders in individual places? Who will provide the training; in other words, what type of personnel will be involved?
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-11_para1"></a>One should also bear in mind at this stage that those young people becoming the subject of such orders are likely, as the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, said when speaking to the last amendment, to be highly vulnerable, whether they are girls or boys. Indeed, many of them will have come out of care, will have been excluded from their previous schools and may have a history and a record of suffering sexual abuse. So they will be difficult people to teach and train. I wonder who will be found to undertake this particularly demanding job.

<A NAME = "80303-11_para2"></a>Further, can the Minister tell the Committee where the training will be delivered? Will it be in the place of custody? If not, I can foresee there will be problems escorting people to and from the training. These are all questions to which, as far as I know, we have not yet had an explanation from the Government in the course of the Bill. I apologise that on this occasion I have not given the Minister prior notice of this point.

<A NAME="80303-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The noble Baroness has dealt most graciously with this important matter. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, is quite right. Normally, we try to arrange these matters in correspondence. I am perfectly happy to do that. Part of the answer to his question is that it is intended that a sentence plan will be drawn up at sentence with a member of the YOT scheme. Progress in custody and afterwards will be monitored. On release there will be supervision. It seems to me that that is not as full an answer as I ought to be able to give the noble Lord. Will he allow me to write to him with fuller responses to his detailed questions, as we have done in the past?
<P>

("( ) An offender detained in pursuance of an order under subsection (3) above shall be deemed to be in legal custody; and a fine imposed under that subsection shall be deemed, for the purposes of any enactment, to be a sum adjudged to be paid by a conviction.").

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-11_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 249 I wish to speak also to the amendments grouped with it, Amendments Nos. 250, 251, 252, 253, 254 and 255.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-11_para8"></a>Amendments Nos. 249 to 255 are technical amendments to ensure the smooth functioning of the detention and training order and the transitional arrangements for the secure training order. They clarify that those detained under provisions relating to either order are deemed to be in legal custody. The amendments also provide that a fine imposed for breach of supervision requirements of either order will be treated as a fine imposed on conviction. Normal court powers to deal with fine defaults will apply to those fines. The Bill as it stands includes no power to enforce the fine should the offender or the parent default. The amendments are intended to rectify this omission.

<A NAME = "80303-11_para9"></a>Amendment No. 250 extends the powers currently available to the courts to deal with defaults of other fines to fines imposed for a breach of supervision requirements imposed under a detention and training order. There is no power at present.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-11_para10"></a>Amendments Nos. 251 to 254 amend Clause 91(2) which sets out the modifications which may be made by an order under Section 2 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 and in Section 4 of the 1994 Act. Subsection (7) of Section 2 provides that a person detained elsewhere than in a secure training centre because accommodation there is not immediately available, under subsection (2), or because he has been transferred elsewhere because of special circumstances, under subsection (4), is also deemed to be in legal custody. Amendments Nos. 251 to 254 ensure that subsection (7) applies to both those situations while an order under Clause 91 is in force and that subsection (5), which defines those who may provide accommodation, continues to apply to transfer under subsection (4).
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-11_para11"></a>Amendment No. 255--the final amendment in this group--provides an additional transitory provision governing the period before Clause 60 of this Bill relating to detention and training orders is enacted. This new subsection (4A), inserted in Section 4 of the 1994 Act, which deals with breach of supervision requirements for secure training orders, provides that a fine imposed under subsection (3)(b) of Section 4, for breach of requirements, shall be deemed to be a sum adjudged to be paid by conviction. With that explanation of these technical amendments, I beg to move.

<A NAME="80303-11_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   The noble Lord helpfully wrote to me about a number of government amendments that he was proposing to table.

I have, though, listened carefully to what he has had to say about them. As far as I can make out, I have no objections.

<A NAME = "80303-11_para22"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: Since I do not claim pride of parentage in this amendment, which provides for the setting up of a standing advisory council on criminal justice and the penal system, I think I can say without immodesty that it is a very important amendment, as indeed is demonstrated by those who have added their names in its support.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-11_para23"></a>The aetiology of the amendment is of some significance. The 10th April 1995 was the centenary of the report of the Gladstone Committee on Prisons. The crucial contribution which that committee made to penal thinking was its insistence that the reformation of prisoners should become one of the primary aims of the prison system. It argued that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the present system, while admirable for cohersion or oppression, is excessively deficient in the reformatory side". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-11_para24"></a>The committee proposed that prisoners' treatment,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"should be more effectively designed to maintain, stimulate or awaken the higher susceptibilities of prisoners, to develop their moral instincts, to train them in orderly and industrial habits, and whenever possible to turn them out of prison, better men and women, both physically and morally, than when they came in". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-11_para25"></a>To mark this centenary there was sent to The Times a letter under the joint signatures of Professor Sean McConville, Sir Louis Blom-Cooper, the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, Professor Anthony Bottoms, the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, Sir Ralph Gibson, John Harding, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Llanfairwaterdine, Professor Terence Morris, Brendan O'Connor Friel, and the noble Lord, Lord Runcie. It stated among other things:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We think the time is right for an overview, on the scale of the Gladstone enquiry, to propound a sound authoritative penal philosophy for the 20th Century". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-11_para26"></a>The letter went on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Over the last two decades the United States has shown the tragic and counter-productive results of mixing competitive party politics in such policy debates and thereby inflaming public opinion. This is a field where the national interest demands that bipartisanship should be striven for, even while legitimate party differences are debated". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-11_para27"></a>The letter stressed that it was essential to provide a mechanism to address these important issues--criminal and penal policy--dispassionately, authoritatively and constructively.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-11_para28"></a>In the debate on the Address on 19th May 1997 I invited the Government to make provision for a comprehensive reassessment of a rational penal policy and thereby to restore much-needed public confidence in the system. In a subsequent debate I repeated the invitation. I was accordingly delighted to learn that my <P>


<a name="column_1128"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble and learned friend the Lord Chief Justice, on two occasions in two lectures, subsequently endorsed my suggestion. His last comment was made at the conclusion of the annual lecture of the Prison Reform Trust given by him last June. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If a revived Advisory Council were able, with the benefit of intensive world-wide research and consultation, to reach authoritative conclusions which commanded the respect of public and the professional opinion, and if those conclusions were given legislative effect, this Parliament would earn an assured place in the history of this country". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-11_para29"></a>Of course I accept that crime is a complex phenomenon and that there is no "quick fix". The various parts of the criminal justice system--the police, prosecution, the court, the Probation Service and Prison Service--often address quite different agendas, and this was acknowledged by the establishment of the Criminal Justice Consultative Council in order to reconcile the potentially conflicting aims of these disparate agencies. I accept, of course, that the public are impatient, indeed angry and frightened, at rising crime and want results from the police and the criminal justice system. But the public require to be far better informed than they are at present. They need to know that there is no realistic prospect with the present degree of overcrowding in prisons and the continuing cutback in prison budgets, of prisoners at the end of their sentence being either better equipped or better motivated to lead an honest life than when they began their sentence. On the contrary, the reverse is often the case. The public ought to know that if the present harsh sentencing regime continues it is expected by the Home Office to give a prison population of nearly 83,000 for the year 2005. That is virtually double what it was some five years ago. It will involve crippling expenditure for new prisons, additional staff and associated expenses.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-11_para30"></a>On 18th February, last month, during a debate on life prisoners and release procedures, I learned from an admirable speech by the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater of Butterstone, that not only have we more than 3,500 lifers in our system at the moment but they represent more than the entire lifer population of Europe put together. Why is that, and why do we have a higher proportion of our population behind bars than any other nation in Western Europe? We have 120 prisoners for every 100,000 people in the general population compared with 89 in France, 84 in Germany and 65 in Sweden. Have other European countries more effective community-based alternatives to incarceration? How have other countries gained public acceptance of alternative strategies to traditional imprisonment? Is there in Europe a more balanced approach to sentencing; and, if so, how has that been achieved? These and other questions need careful research, and I submit that this can only be successful by an authoritative and dispassionate body of the kind we recommend.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-11_para31"></a>In conclusion, in case it should be suggested that criminal policy has been now removed from competitive party politics, let me remind your Lordships of Amendment No. 218A, which was <P>


<a name="column_1129"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1129</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>moved by the noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, only a week ago. It related to Section 2(5) of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, which provides for mandatory life sentences on second conviction of certain violent and sexual offences. What was sought by the amendment was very modest. It was to remove paragraph (d), which provided that Section 18 offences of wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent should not trigger the mandatory life sentence. The noble Lord explained that while some Section 18 offences were very serious indeed, and rightly carried up to a maximum of a life sentence on first conviction, at the other end of the scale is a large cluster of relatively minor incidents. He explained that the most cursory scrutiny of some recent Section 18 appeal cases revealed sentences as low as six months upheld on appeal. He emphasised the absurdity of a judge being obliged to impose a sentence of life imprisonment and then explaining, as he is bound to do, that the tariff--the period to be served for retribution and deterrence--was only a few months.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-11_para32"></a>The noble Lord was in good company in saying that it was absurd. At Second Reading the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, put it in this way:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it is nonsensical to invite a High Court judge to say, 'I am sentencing you to life imprisonment. By the way, you can expect to serve 18 months'. That is a perversion of the system. It will bring the whole system into disrepute".--[Official Report, 27/1/97; col. 1063.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-11_para33"></a>The fact that the noble Lord's case was unanswerable was made doubly clear by the fact that the self-same amendment had been moved by the Government when in Opposition, and indeed by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn. Quite unabashed, he resisted the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, saying in terms, that he did not resile from anything he had said in the past. The very idea of mandatory life sentences had been condemned when in opposition by the present noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and by the noble Lord who is currently the Leader of the House. Crime is one of the most difficult and complex problems confronting the Government. The advisory council proposed could give valuable assistance in solving it. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80303-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   In the dying days of the previous government, the protests of the Liberal Democrats over the Police Bill, the Crime (Sentences) Bill and the Scottish crimes Bill were regarded by some of your Lordships as little more than Liberal hand-wringing while the Front Benches on both the Conservative and Labour sides got on with the serious stuff--the dutch auction on toughness: who was going to be "more righteous than thou"; who was going to be tougher. But what lay behind our protests was concern at the wild swing in penal policy over a period of a mere six years.

<A NAME = "80303-12_para0"></a>In March 1991, the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, introduced the Criminal Justice Bill into this House with these words:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>individual case is, of course ... not a matter for Parliament. It is, after all, only the sentencer who will know all the facts of the case".--[Official Report, 12/3/91; col. 73.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para1"></a>The noble Earl noted that for some offences only imprisonment was a fitting punishment. But he continued,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for many other offences, particularly for property offences, it has long been recognised that imprisonment frequently does more harm than good. It can turn inexperienced offenders, who may be verging on the edge of a criminal career, into hardened criminals".--[col. 74.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para2"></a>Those of us who sat as recorders in 1990 and 1991 will recall that we were urged by the Government not to take into account previous convictions. That caused conflict with the judges themselves, who thought the Government and the Home Office were going soft on crime. I recall a sentencing seminar in which a very senior judge advised us to ignore the Home Office--if we thought the defendant was to go to prison, he was to go there. "Let them find the places", is what he said.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para3"></a>At that time, again, in accordance with that philosophy, the attitude to penal reform was characterised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, in his 1990-91 inquiry, in which he called for a civilised regime for prisons and justice for prisoners.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para4"></a>Then everything changed. The noble Baroness, Lady Hilton, has already referred to the 1994 Act. But it was in 1995 at the Conservative Party conference that the Home Secretary announced a change of policy--the minimum mandatory sentences and life sentences for second offences. The noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, referred to that as, "policy making by proclamation". I hope the noble Lord will forgive me if I adopt those words. Judges were thereafter characterised as soft on crime; and in response to that they filled the gaols to the point that, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, just mentioned, the prison population has doubled and is likely soon to reach 83,000 inmates.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para5"></a>The White Paper, Protecting the Public, which followed the Conservative Party conference speech was discussed in this House on 23rd May, 1996. The late Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor of Gosforth, said, as many noble Lords will recall,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I venture to suggest that never in the history of our criminal law have such far-reaching proposals been put forward on the strength of such flimsy and dubious evidence. The shallow and untested figures in the White Paper do not describe fairly the problems the Government seek to address. Still less do they justify the radical solutions it proposes".--[Official Report, 23/5/96; col. 1025.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para6"></a>Indeed, one noble Lord was quite rightly moved to say of minimum mandatory sentences for burglary:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"That is not just; it is a perversion of justice and one which, I am sorry to say, is brought about on the basis of low motive".--[Official Report, 23/5/96; col. 1031.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para7"></a>That same noble Lord later commented on automatic life sentences for pub punching or glassing 10 years after the event of an offence of unlawful sexual intercourse, and used these terms:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I believe it to be a pity--and worse, an infinite shame--that matters of this sort are dealt with on the basis of mottos at party conferences. That demeans our society".--[col. 1032.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para8"></a>It was, of course, the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para9"></a>Last week, I was decidedly hurt during the debate on Amendment No. 218A of this Bill to which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, referred, when the noble Lord, Lord Williams, questioned the motives of those of us who had proposed that Section 18 offences be removed from the list of mandatory life sentences. He asked:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Is this a principled attack, or is it--dare I question?--simply an opportunist attempt to focus on one part of the provisions? Those with more metropolitan minds than my own might think that opportunism rather than principle was driving some of these observations--not all of them".--[Official Report, 24/2/98; col. 611.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para10"></a>I was so deeply hurt that I was, very unusually, moved to interrupt and to inquire whether the noble Lord's views had changed since the views that I have recounted to your Lordships expressed only a year or so earlier. The noble Lord replied:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"My view has not changed".--[col. 611.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para11"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Renton, has said, referring to the "open mind" of the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, it is open to the point where he can hold two conflicting opinions at the same time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para12"></a>This amendment seeks to set up a permanent advisory council which will take criminal penal policy away from the fighting cocks in the cock pit and set up an authoritative body which can provide a continuing view of the criminal justice system and give to both government and the public a dispassionate and factual assessment of priorities, benefits and costs upon which policy can be based.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para13"></a>The sort of issues that such a council should address are matters such as these. What are the causes of criminal behaviour? How can crime be prevented or reduced? How successful is our present criminal justice system in convicting offenders, and what improvements are desirable? What types of sentencing should be introduced? We have heard today that the DTOs have been introduced without any prior consultation; we debated that provision earlier.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para14"></a>What are appropriate sentencing levels, having regard both to other jurisdictions and to public opinion? The noble Baroness, Lady David, said that it was abominable that this country should be the worst in Europe for imprisoning young people. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, made the same point. We need to compare our penal system with those of the European Union countries with which we work so closely.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para15"></a>Where should resources be spent in dealing with offenders? Should they be spent on building more prisons, or on courses of rehabilitation and support in the community? How can public confidence be improved in the system of criminal justice; and in particular how should the victims of crime be treated, both as witnesses and complainants, and how should they be compensated for the hurt that they have suffered?
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para16"></a>I hope that an advisory council of this sort would provide no more the flimsy and dubious evidence referred to by the late Lord Chief Justice in his speech as the basis of policy. I support the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bingham of Cornhill: </B>   It is surely true that in the fields of criminal justice and penal policy we all, <P>


<a name="column_1132"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1132</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wherever we sit, share the same objectives. Wherever possible, we all want delinquency to be nipped in the bud. We all want extra-judicial remedies to be applied wherever they are appropriate and likely to be effective. We all want the law to be modern, intelligible and, again, effective. We all want trials to be conducted so that the prosecutor has a proper and adequate opportunity to prove guilt and the defendant has a proper and adequate opportunity to contest it. We all want sentencing to be carried out with due regard to the traditional objectives of retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation and, perhaps now, incapacitation, having regard to the circumstances of the individual offender and the individual offence. We all want penal methods to be effective and humane.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para17"></a>There is very little disagreement about ends, but finding the most effective way of achieving those ends is a much more difficult task. It is a task to which we have over the years devoted immense legislative effort. In the past decade there have been seven major criminal justice statutes and over 20 more limited measures.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para18"></a>It is, of course, necessary that the law, practice and penal policy should be kept under review and overhauled where necessary, and it is right that governments should be free to act quickly when the need arises. But surely it cannot be wise--and it is certainly not efficient--to enact a series of measures hard on the heels of each other, often modifying or repealing the previous measure. Noble Lords will be able to think of examples of legislative measures which have been brought into force, only for their deficiencies to be quickly demonstrated, and other measures which have never been brought into force at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para19"></a>The purpose of the amendment, which I support in no adversarial or carping spirit, is to provide the Home Secretary and the Government with a reservoir of wise, informed, objective and non-partisan advice on the important and intractable problems which confront him, them and us. It need not be a recipe for delay, although a measure of deliberation is not out of place in this field. There will be a financial cost, but that must be weighed against the cost of trial and error.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para20"></a>The recommendations of this body will in no way fetter the judgment of the Secretary of State, but I hope and expect that they will inform and strengthen that judgment. I hope that the amendment may be recognised as a constructive and helpful proposal, intended to promote the achievement of shared objectives.

<A NAME="80303-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I rise to support the amendment moved by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, and his call for the setting up of an advisory council. I remind Members of the Committee that there is nothing new in this proposal. An advisory council on the penal system was set up by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, in, I think, 1966 and existed until 1980. I had the honour to be a member of it in its early days. Other than myself, it had a highly distinguished membership. The noble Baroness, Lady David, was a member. I thought she was, but I see she shakes her head. The late Lady Wootton was its first chairman; the <P>


<a name="column_1133"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>then Bishop of Exeter, Dr. Mortimer, was the vice-chairman. Professor Radzinowich, Dr. Walker, Sir Louis Blom-Cooper and various other people involved in the penal field were members.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para21"></a>The purpose of that council was to attempt to take matters of penal policy out of the ambit of party political debate. I believe that its reports were of value. Reports introduced the proposals for suspended sentences. The council looked at the whole question of non-custodial sentences. There was a report on prison policy, dealing with the question of a policy of dispersement as against a policy of concentration for serious offenders. There was a report on the regime of detention centres. I notice that in a recent article Sir Louis Blom-Cooper described some of the reports as being indifferent and some outstanding. In hindsight, one only remembers the ones that were outstanding. But I do know that we were greatly fortified by the existence of that advisory council when, in 1970, under the late Mr. Reginald Maudling, I became a junior Minister in the Home Office and we were faced with a paper from the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, pointing out the vast likely increase in the prison population unless action was taken, which led to the introduction of community service and suspended sentences and the extension of parole. I believe that the establishment of an advisory council would assist in taking these matters out of the political arena.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para22"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Judd, said in an earlier intervention that we must remember that the purpose of sentencing is not only punishment and deterrence but also the rehabilitation of the individual. There is a need to remember always the importance of punishment and deterrence, but I believe that a degree of humanity is also needed. I believe that had that council, which regrettably was done away with in 1980, existed during the past decade, we should have avoided the wide fluctuations in penal policies which we have seen and which the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, mentioned. I believe we should have avoided the absurdity of mandatory minimum sentences and the extension of the mandatory life sentence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-12_para23"></a>Over that period we have seen policies recommended at one stage being stood on their head by the same government a few years later. We have seen parties change completely their approach to individual proposals, largely affected by what they believed was the public opinion of the moment. I believe that a standing advisory council would assist in avoiding those pressures and would allow issues of penal policy to become matters of common consent and agreement in this House. I strongly support the amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80303-13_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Longford: </B>   I rise to support strongly the amendment. The main points have already been made but, following a few remarks, I shall make a point which comes best from someone on these Benches.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-13_para0"></a>We surely all recognise the extraordinary difficulty of the position in which the Home Secretary, that high-minded Christian socialist, finds himself today, when all enlightened opinion is on one side in these discussions and the passions of the so-called multitude <P>


<a name="column_1134"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are on the other. He, of course, is employed to solve the problem; he has chosen that destiny, and we wish him well.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-13_para1"></a>I wrote an article for The Tablet newspaper headed, "If I were Jack Straw". It was rather impertinent to make such a suggestion and to conceive of such a fantasy. When I became Leader of this House in 1964, I had been chairman of the relevant Labour Party committee, whose main proposals were put into law a few years later. Six of the members of that committee were in the Labour government. My old friend Evelyn Waugh, a famous writer, wrote to another old friend that he was glad I was not going to be Home Secretary because otherwise we would all be murdered in our beds. Apart from the fact that I was a Member of the House of Lords, I do not believe that that was ever likely. Today the Home Secretary has his problems, and we are trying to help him.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-13_para2"></a>The main facts have been pointed out. We have been told that it is reckoned that between 1993 and 2005, a period of 12 years, the prison population will double. Why? Does anyone know any reason why it should double? Someone arriving from Mars might say, "I suppose there has been a great increase in crime". According to official statistics, there is no increase in crime; there has been a decrease in crime in the past four years. If one applies to the Home Office--where, curiously, one department seems to deal with crime and another with prisons--for projections, there are not any, at least as far as I can discover.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-13_para3"></a>Nevertheless, let us assume that crime will stay where it is, yet in the course of 12 years the prison population will have doubled. Some tremendous philosophy or, if you like, some bogus philosophy, must lie behind this extraordinary change in policy. We are all aware that when Mr. Michael Howard came to the Home Office he soon announced that prison works. That idea, of prison as a salvation of humanity, has been adopted all too brutally. It would be nice to say that with this enlightened Government of ours, the Labour Government, something different will come into operation, but there is no sign of it yet. I personally hope and believe that this high-minded Government will introduce some new atmosphere altogether, but there is no sign of it yet. We hope they will. We have been hoping for 10 months, but still we go on hoping. That is the situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-13_para4"></a>I want to add a further thought. The Labour Party won a great election victory, and one of the important slogans was, "We are going to be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime". No new meaning has yet been given to that in practice but it could be very important if interpreted in the right way. If we think of the 64,000 prisoners that there are now, we are all too well aware that a high proportion of them will offend again. We are also aware that the degree to which they offend and the extent of their offences will depend quite a lot on how they are treated in prison. So if we are looking for the causes of crime, we can find one cause, which is the maltreatment of prisoners in prison. That is something that gives a lot of meaning, in my opinion, to the attack on the causes of crime.
<P>


<a name="column_1135"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-13_para5"></a>So there it all is. I entirely agree with what has been said. An advisory committee would strengthen the hand of the Home Secretary, the well-meaning, Christian, socialist Home Secretary, in doing his duty. All alone, it is very hard to face public opinion and do something unpopular--on the face of it unpopular until the public is re-educated. I do not think that word was actually used today but the noble Lord has used it to me before now: the re-education of the public on penal matters. That is the essential task today, and I believe that that task will be very much facilitated by the amendment of the noble and learned Lord.

<P>
<A NAME="80303-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hurd of Westwell: </B>   I would like to join those who support this amendment. Of course, as my noble friend Lord Carlisle has pointed out, there was such a body in the past. As he has also pointed out, it did valuable work; in fact it was largely responsible, as he said, for the introduction of the CSO. I do not think anyone could deny how useful, admirable indeed, a form of punishment outside prison that has been. The death of that earlier body is best recorded in the account by my noble friend Lord Windlesham in his classic work Responses to Crime. He wrote:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the ordinary way, no incoming Home Office minister, least of all one with the qualities and style of William Whitelaw, nor the officials advising him, would have contemplated abolishing the ACPS ... But the times were not ordinary ... In [the Prime Minister's] scornful view, many such bodies, known as quangos, were not simply unnecessary but represented an insidious spread of patronage, concealing at the same time the growth that had taken place in the apparatus of central government". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-13_para6"></a>And so the word went out that the temple should be cleansed. I seem to remember that my noble friend Lord Renton wielded a particularly vigorous broom in that campaign, and not just the money lenders and those who sold doves but the runners of quangos were expelled from the temple. It can be noted that some of the quangos have crept back into the temple since then, but not this particular one.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-13_para7"></a>I think a very strong case has been made for a body of this kind with a rather wider remit, as is now proposed, than the old ACPS, for two reasons, one of which has been given and one of which has not. It is desirable to move criminal justice policy to some extent from the sudden flash floods of emotion which follow a particular disaster or tragedy. It is silly to decry such emotion because we all share it and it is perfectly natural and human that there should be such very strong high feelings in the aftermath of a disaster. But it does not necessarily follow that these high feelings should dictate the future substance of the law.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-13_para8"></a>There is an overwhelming case, it seems to me, for a pause for reflection and experienced advice. I speak as someone who was an actor in one debate, a spectator in another, the two debates following the firearms tragedies at Hungerford and Dunblane. That is the first point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-13_para9"></a>The second point is that I believe a body like this would be a good precaution and safeguard against the wear and tear which is imposed on a criminal justice system by too much adversarial argument. I join others <P>


<a name="column_1136"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1136</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>who have made this point. Adversarial argument in this sphere can, like an acid, corrode the merits of a debate and the substance of a policy. We should not seek to inhibit the Home Secretary's freedom of action on consideration. Certainly, we should not seek to inhibit parliamentary discussion. I believe that there should be more parliamentary discussion on these matters. I feel that prisoners in particular are a neglected corner of our public life. I do not believe that a Prime Minister of this country has ever visited a prison. This is the first time that I have made this assertion in the hearing of a Minister of the Crown. I hope that perhaps on some occasion the noble Minister will either refute me, and I shall be delighted, or suggest that some remedy is at hand.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-13_para10"></a>Of course, Parliament has a duty to society, a duty to protect society, and a duty to the victims of crime. So those of us who are interested in this subject should encourage and not stifle discussion. The question is not whether there should be discussion but whether it is sensible that it should be divided on mainly or principally party lines. I do not believe that the contest as to which party is toughest on crime is essentially a meaningful contest. I believe that those who strive for that prize are likely to find that its laurels fade quite fast.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-13_para11"></a>I believe that there is now a chance for a reasoned truce because the heat, to some extent, has died out of this debate. In some political matters the line of debate seems to me to fall naturally between the parties: the role of the state, the balance between spending and taxation. These are, in a way, left/right issues and it is natural enough that they should be debated between parties as armies, as regiments, organised, divided on a left/right basis. But for foreign affairs and defence, as your Lordships know, as practised also in the other place, there is a different convention, for excellent reasons. These are not usually matters where the lines of debate are the same as the lines between parties. I believe that that should be true of debate on the criminal justice system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-13_para12"></a>The Home Secretary has to deal with, the Government has to deal with, we all have to deal with, very large numbers of people involved in making this system work. They are not servants of government and they certainly do not feel themselves to be adherents of a particular political party: the judge, the magistrate, the police officer, the prison officer, the probation officer. All these stand in somewhat different relationships to the Home Secretary and they are none of them creatures of government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-13_para13"></a>In the past few months, by good fortune, I have had occasion after a long gap to renew acquaintance with a good many of them as they go about their jobs. They are under great pressures from the nature of crime, the increase in crime, the nature of our society, the difficulties in dealing with these problems. We should not add to these people the extra pressures which come if we in Parliament tackle these matters on an adversarial and point-scoring basis. It is simply not fair <P>

<A NAME="80303-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </B>   The sentencing advisory panel proposed in Clause 67 of the Bill is welcome. It will have two effects. First, it will provide consistency and stability in the sentencing area. Secondly, it will have the effect of removing the political influence on sentencing which, regrettably, has been so apparent since just before the general election.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-14_para0"></a>The amendment proposed by my noble and learned friend Lord Ackner will extend that principle to the whole realm of criminal justice in this country. For that reason, I lend my wholehearted support to the amendment. It will have the result of producing stability over the criminal justice system, as the advisory panel will in sentencing. It will, one hopes, remove once and for all from the realm of criminal justice the urge of the political say. I can see no disadvantages in the amendment and, with any luck, it will provide enormous advantages to our system of criminal justice.

<P>

<A NAME = "80303-14_para1"></a>I still visit prisons. I am a vice-president of the Butler Trust, which was formed in honour of a great Home Secretary, whom I admired greatly. We operate in prisons and we reward what is done in prisons. I should tell the Committee that an enormous amount of good work is done in prisons. We know the bad things that go on in the prisons because we see them reported in the press. But a great deal of good work is done not only by prison officers but by civilians of all kinds. Their work is rewarded. I am a trustee of NACRO and of APEX. I keep in touch with the prisons, although I am no longer heavily involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-14_para2"></a>In the work I have done as a politician, my involvement in prisons as Northern Ireland Secretary was greater than it was as Home Secretary. I speak on the basis of that experience. The old Advisory Council on the Penal System was extremely valuable.

<A NAME = "80303-14_para6"></a>It must be broad in its terms of reference, not the individual selective reports on particular issues to advise the Home Secretary, or the Northern Ireland Secretary, or whoever it might be. As was pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, it is then up to the Home Secretary or the Northern Ireland Secretary whether to accept the advice. The overview should be provided by a different body from the ACPS. The pamphlet goes on:

<A NAME = "80303-14_para7"></a>These are some of the general inquiries that might be carried out: the principal causes of changes in rates of offending; effective means of reducing certain crimes; maximising public benefits in repressing crime; the role of the police and prosecution; what punishment can and cannot achieve.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-14_para8"></a>My query is whether a repeat of the old organisation is the right way to do what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, and his noble friends have been putting to the Committee. We need the broad view of what is happening in society; how it is changing; the crime in schools and the crime in inner cities. I represented an inner city area of a great northern city. Inner city crime is something unto itself. It is unnoted by many people because the middle classes do not live there. The teachers and the doctors come in like missionaries every day. An authoritative report on inner city crime would be extremely valuable as a general view of what is happening to society.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-14_para9"></a>I support the amendment but I believe that we should give this matter a little more thought. To me, the old organisation worked at one time. I found that very valuable. But that was for one purpose. We should have a Royal Commission or something like it and resuscitate the old organisation. I support the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, in his amendment.

<A NAME="80303-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   I should like briefly to endorse what the noble Earl, Lord Longford, said, that this amendment is likely to help the Home Secretary. I would add that it would be likely to help all succeeding Home Secretaries.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-14_para10"></a>The trouble with the great issues of crime and punishment with which the amendment, the Bill and the Committee are wrestling is that they attract powerful <P>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1139</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>opinions which derive from prejudices and from what are sometimes called instincts. They are seldom faintly held prejudices or instincts. That makes life extremely difficult for Ministers, who are elected by many who hold these prejudices and instincts as well as others and who also have to face party conferences and form and shape their party's policies.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-14_para11"></a>Some excellent phrases have been uttered in this short debate. The one on which I fasten is that uttered by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, "a reservoir of wise, informed, objective and non-partisan advice". That was echoed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, "dispassionately, authoritatively and constructively" advising. It is not just Ministers who find life very difficult by reason of the very strong feelings--sometimes pejoratively called "instincts and prejudices"--which spring up from these great questions. Judges, too, have to exercise whatever discretion is allowed them. Does that not contract and expand according to the fashions of the politics of the day that Ministers and Parliament have given them?
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-14_para12"></a>I believe that if there were to be a council of this character it would--by reason of what that reservoir would contain--help to inform the public in a way which is lacking at the moment. It would also inform Ministers which would be of great help to them and to Parliament. The function of a reservoir, of course, is to be drawn on. I hope that it will be drawn on if we create this reservoir as I very much hope we shall.

<A NAME="80303-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lowry: </B>   I promise to be brief. I speak as a former Lord Chief Justice in a much smaller jurisdiction. In that capacity I was not entirely unacquainted with politics. There was one important issue which I need not discuss, but which could easily have become a political football. On that issue I counted myself fortunate to enjoy the support of two Prime Ministers, two Lord Chancellors, a succession of dedicated law officers, one of whom has just sat down, and at least two Secretaries of State, one of whom has just addressed the Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-14_para13"></a>But it is not primarily from Northern Ireland that I draw the inspiration to support this amendment. My view is based on what, in recent years, has been said and done in this jurisdiction. The Committee has heard examples and I shall not repeat them. The Committee has also heard the noble Lords, Lord Carlisle, Lord Hurd and Lord Mayhew, who speak from experience and, in my respectful view, they speak wisely. Whatever precise solution is adopted, a way must be found to remove from the party political sphere the kinds of issues, examples of which have been given to the Committee. I say "party political" because the issues mentioned will often merit vigorous debate in this House and in the other place and will remain proper political issues in that sense. I support the amendment.
<P>

<a name="column_1140"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>intention of joining until I came into the Chamber and discovered that the Committee was discussing something about which I feel with such passion.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-14_para14"></a>For three years I was the Minister responsible for the Prison Service, although at a more junior level than that of other noble friends who have spoken and therefore, possibly, a little bit closer to the workface. I visited a great many prisons. The noble Earl, Lord Longford, must be right. Something must be wrong with a system which allows the current rate of growth in the prison population to persist. It cannot be right. The arguments that I used to advance as long ago as 1985 for the reason that our prison population compared so ill with those of other European countries, cannot survive in the face of the growth that has taken place since then.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-14_para15"></a>Our prisons are filled with people, most of them young by the Committee's standards. As regards the millions of crimes committed by people under the age of 25 years, if Members of the Committee look at the report of the Audit Commission of November 1996--and I speak from memory and therefore subject to correction--one will find that only about 2.5 per cent. of all those criminals actually received any corrective treatment whatsoever even including the police caution. Yet those who are corrected cost a staggering amount. The effect on young people who go to prison is not rehabilitative. I wonder whether the aim of rehabilitation has been almost lost sight of by the Prison Service in the face of the weight of numbers now pressing within the cell doors.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-14_para16"></a>But those people are put there for containment and punishment. That is unproductive, but produces hardened, more expert and more frequently offending criminals. They push up the statistics. That moves me. It is a tragedy because most of the people in prison need never have been there if they had received the right treatment in their early days.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-14_para17"></a>All of us start more or less level. It is our experience, the way in which we exploit it and the way we are guided which decides whether we are to become criminals whether of the fraudulent, well-heeled sort of the City or of the ill-shaven, thuggish sort of the back streets. Children do not become criminals by chance but because of the effect on them of events and the failure of adults to guide them away from criminality, usually through a lack of love.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-14_para18"></a>It is late. I had not intended to speak at all. Any amendment which takes the decision on imprisonment in particular out of the political forum, as my noble friend Lord Hurd said, must have my support. I beg the Minister to give it his.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I support the amendment. As many Members of the Committee have said, the criminal justice system over the past few years has become far too politicised. As my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford said, in recent years and particularly in the run-up to the last election, both the Government and the Opposition parties were bidding against each other to see who could take the most repressive attitude towards crime. What is remarkable and very gratifying <P>


<a name="column_1141"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1141</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>indeed is that an entirely opposite attitude has been taken on this occasion by everyone who has spoken in this debate from all parties and from the Cross Benches.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-15_para0"></a>One result of the politicisation, as the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham, pointed out, is that there has been a mass of legislation. Since 1990 we have had, among other Acts, the Criminal Justice Act 1991, the Criminal Justice Act 1993, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, all of them major pieces of legislation, now followed by this Bill, which is of at least equal significance.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-15_para1"></a>This legislation concerns substantive law; the investigation of crime; the prosecution process and sentencing. But the legislation notably lacks consistency and a basic philosophy throughout. Of course, criminal justice is in a sense a political matter. The prevention and prosecution of crime and the conduct of the penal system are among the most important responsibilities of government. But criminal justice does not need to be the political battleground to the extent that it has. There is a clear need here to lower the temperature.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-15_para2"></a>We now have a standing Civil Justice Council to oversee the important programme of the reform of civil procedure instigated by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Justice Woolf. Membership of that committee was announced in a Written Answer by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor last week. But surely there is a need at least as great to have a standing council on criminal justice as an authoritative and expert body to advise the Secretary of State. By advising the Secretary of State it will be advising the public. Above all, what is needed here is a better-informed public. I believe that this amendment will go a long way towards achieving that result.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   I feel that I shall appear to be like a character in a Bateman cartoon, as the man who spoke against the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Ackner. I hope that I will have some support from the noble Lord, Lord Williams, when he responds and that I may offer him a degree of support in advance. Whether the noble Lord wants that support is another matter. He seemed to deal perfectly adequately with the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, just as he dealt last week, with the utmost skill, with the amendment of my noble friend, Lord Windlesham.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-15_para3"></a>Considering the eminence of all who have spoken--particularly my noble and learned friends--I speak with considerable diffidence in begging to differ on this amendment. I am filled with alarm by the very idea that party politics should be taken out of criminal justice and that it should merely be left to the consideration of the great and the good--which is, in effect, what the amendment seeks to do. We are told that the amendment's purpose is to establish a standing advisory council to inform the public. It looks much more like an attempt to imprison and impose constraints on the Home Secretary when he comes to make policy. The idea that such matters are best addressed by a council, not by democratic processes, is fundamentally wrong. They <P>


<a name="column_1142"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1142</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should be a matter for the Home Secretary, who is answerable to Parliament and responsible to the electorate. It ought to be for him to address policy and for that policy to be argued out in Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-15_para4"></a>No one can argue that such matters do not receive sufficient time to be argued in Parliament. We have debated this Bill alone over some five days in Committee, and I believe that the Minister and others of your Lordships agree that it has not been debated in a party political manner. Noble Lords in all parts of the House have spoken. No support for the line I am taking has come from the Government Benches but I look forward to hearing from the Minister in due course.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I invite my noble friend not to overlook that what is proposed is purely an advisory council. The Home Secretary will have to consider its advice, which he may or may not accept. In any event, the democratic process will operate and the two Houses of Parliament will have the last word.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   I accept that is what the amendment sets out but neither the Minister nor myself are naive. I know exactly how a council of this sort will work and the constraints that it will impose on the Home Secretary. I speak from experience when I say that we have seen much the same in the realm of social security. The Minister will know of the Social Security Advisory Committee, which imposes constraints. It might be that there are better arguments for such a body in that case but it imposes constraints on what it is possible for the Secretary of State for Social Security to do. An amendment of this kind would impose just such constraints on the Home Secretary and limit what he could do. Once the council has pronounced on such and such a matter, it will be much harder to argue against it. We will be told that the matter has been considered a great deal by experts. The views of the people--about whom we hear so much from the new Labour Government--could be ignored.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-15_para5"></a>The amendment proposes to establish a quango of the sort that was set up in the mid-1960s and which was very sensibly removed in 1980--to which my noble friend Lord Hurd referred. I do not think that this is the right moment to bring back a quango of that sort. I hope that the Minister will resist the blandishments of all who have spoken in favour of the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-15_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   I have been provoked by the noble Lord, Lord Henley, to speak. I do not believe that any constraints would be imposed by the amendment. Such an advisory council might lead to ideas, as did the one before it. The noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, and others, mentioned community service and suspended sentences. I strongly support the amendment and hope that my noble friend the Minister will do the same.

<P>
<A NAME="80303-15_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Tenby: </B>   I rise extremely briefly--my noble friend Lady David has done this for me--to redress the balance yet again. I warmly support the amendment in the name of my noble and learned friend, Lord Ackner. The compelling case for such an advisory council has <P>


<a name="column_1143"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1143</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been devastatingly made by distinguished lawyers in all parts of the House. It may be thought presumptuous of me to attach myself to their coat-tails. My only excuse for doing so is that I may in some small part be able to speak for the lower courts, in which I have had the honour to serve for a number of years.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-15_para6"></a>Anyone sitting as a magistrate in the 1980s and 1990s will have been appalled by the changes in sentencing policy that went on during that period, as a direct result of what was seen by political parties to be beneficial to their interests at any particular time. Quite apart from the moral and judicial damage those parties caused throughout the legal system, and the lack of any identifiable long-term strategy in sentencing matters, the burden on--what are, when all is said and done--part-time contributors to the legal system was substantial.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-15_para7"></a>Training programmes for one year were completely overturned by what took place 12 months later. As the prayer book says, there was no health in it. We must resist all attempts to go down a path where today's fashion dictates tomorrow's sentencing policies. That would be quite wrong. Let us step back and take a long, dispassionate and hard look at crime in all its multifarious aspects and plan an imaginative and decent strategy for the 21st century. Where better to begin than with the standing advisory council suggested by my noble and learned friend Lord Ackner?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   This area of crime and punishment and how to deal with it is central to most people's conscious existence. Whatever we do, we must take public opinion with us and we must earn and maintain confidence and trust in the judiciary, criminal justice system and penal system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-15_para8"></a>It is right that the Government should have available to them well-informed advice to inform and underpin their policies. There is nothing between us on that. The previous organisation, which lasted from 1966 to 1980, did good work. As the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, may have hinted, it was not always the most speedy of mechanisms because sometimes it took three or four years to prepare its reports--but it did good work.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-15_para9"></a>The real question on which the noble and learned Lord's amendment requires us to focus is how best to ensure that the Government are provided with useful and appropriate advice. He believes that the re-establishment of something like the former standing advisory council--although, I agree, with a different remit--is the answer. That is one possibility and one that needs to be thought through carefully.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-15_para10"></a>Quite a lot has changed since 1980. The Government have a lot of post-1980 sources of advice. The Criminal Justice Consultative Council has representatives of the criminal justice system and is usefully underpinned by local area committees made up of local practitioners. The Trial Issues Group deals with improving the way in which the criminal justice process works and gives practical advice to the Government. The Law Commission, to which I willingly pay tribute, does masterly work on law reform.
<P>


<a name="column_1144"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1144</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-15_para11"></a>We also have reports--we have dealt with one in a little detail this afternoon--from the Chief Inspector of Prisons and from the Chief Inspector of Probation. As has been said, under this Bill we want to establish a youth justice board (Clause 32) which will advise the Home Secretary on the operation of the youth justice system, and in Clause 67 we propose a sentencing advisory panel. We also have reports from the Institute of Criminology; research papers from universities; international research material; and collation and co-ordination of research and statistical work in the Home Office itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-15_para12"></a>There are, therefore, various mechanisms from which we can draw useful benefit. The real question is: would an advisory council of the sort proposed give further value? If it would, it is clearly worth considering, but not on the basis of simply looking to the past for solutions without being sure that they take proper account of more recent developments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-15_para13"></a>The noble and learned Lord's amendment indicates that the advisory council might provide advice to the sentencing advisory panel. It is probable that those who serve on both are likely to have much the same background. Will there be virtue in that particular structure? It seems to me that if an advisory council is to be of benefit, it is important to ensure that it has clear terms of reference and does not simply replicate existing sources of advice. Should it have a standing brief or should it be available to offer advice on issues specifically directed to it? Should its membership be fixed? Should it have the opportunity to co-opt further members on an ad hoc basis who might have a particular background and particular expertise to help it to consider specific issues? In the Government's view, all those matters deserve further thought. We would also have to decide whether the body should be statutory or non-statutory. I appreciate that the present form of the amendment indicates a statutory basis, unlike the former advisory council.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-15_para14"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice put forward his carefully reasoned remarks which were intended to be constructive and helpful. Without, I hope, appearing presumptuous, I take his remarks entirely in that spirit and I know that the Home Secretary is of the same view.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-15_para15"></a>There are a number of issues here which are worthy of further consideration and which would benefit from further discussion. Therefore, despite the criticisms made of my lack of openness, on this occasion the recidivist repents in part. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, will appreciate, I do not make any promises. I hope that he will accept that we have attended to all the speeches that have been made this afternoon. On the basis of what I have said, with no promise but with the undertaking that I have given that we take your Lordships' observations seriously, I hope that the noble and learned Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   I have not quite understood exactly what the noble Lord, Lord Williams, is offering. The lack of generosity which he has been instructed to show throughout the passage of this legislation is not <P>


<a name="column_1145"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1145</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>something for which I blame him. That is his brief. No one could have carried out the obligations of his brief more courteously or more efficiently than the noble Lord, but we wish to know what the brief entitles him to say. If the brief merely says, "I will ask those in the Home Office to read Hansard", I find that particularly uninvigorating. It is not what we have been asking. On the other hand, if the noble Lord says, "If you do not divide the Committee, I will assure you that we will give favourable consideration (although we do not bind ourselves to agree with it) to what has been urged so forcefully and fully, with but one exception", that is quite another matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-16_para0"></a>Perhaps I may deal with what the noble Lord, Lord Henley, said. As has been pointed out, he totally overlooked the word "Advisory" which occurs throughout the amendment. The council is to "advise",
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Secretary of State on ... adequacy and effectiveness". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-16_para1"></a>It is to "advise" the Secretary of State on various aspects of the penal system. To show that the advisory council will not trespass on the sentencing panel, the amendment specifies,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"at the request of the sentencing Advisory Panel ... providing such advice and assistance as may enable the panel the better to discharge its functions". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-16_para2"></a>In relation to the attitude of the noble Lord, Lord Henley, and his party, one is reminded of the occasion when I successfully moved an amendment that there should be a right of appeal against the tariff which the judge pronounces in murder cases. That right of appeal exists in regard to the tariff for all other sentences which result in life imprisonment. The amendment was resisted although its purpose was to provide the Home Secretary with greater wisdom as to what the tariff should be, still leaving him the opportunity to make his own decision. It would have provided him with the advantage of having the trial judge's view either altered or confirmed by the Court of Appeal. The Home Secretary would not have it. This House said that he should have it and, by a large majority, we carried the amendment, but it was reversed in the other place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-16_para3"></a>What were the then government resisting? They resisted the giving of advice to the Home Secretary which he could accept or reject. But the Home Secretary might be embarrassed by that advice because, stupidly, he might go contrary to it and then he would be open to criticism in this House and outside it. The approach of the noble Lord, Lord Henley--I do not say that it is the approach of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, because he has not committed himself--is, "Don't embarrass me with advice; allow me to be as pigheaded as I wish to be". I find that a very unattractive stance. That is why I ask the noble Lord, Lord Williams, to be a little clearer about exactly what is the nature of his generosity, if any, before I decide whether or not I shall seek to divide the Committee.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I thought that I had made it as plain as I possibly could by saying, "There are a number of issues here which are worthy of further consideration and which would benefit from <P>


<a name="column_1146"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1146</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>further discussion". I think that that is fairly plain. I cannot guarantee "favourable consideration" because the noble and learned Lord would not expect me to come to a conclusion, standing here as I do; nor would he expect the Home Secretary to come to an instant conclusion because that would be contrary to the theme of the advice that he has been giving us so carefully which is, "You may listen carefully before you make up your mind".
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   Then I shall remove the word "favourable" and ask whether the noble Lord would accept the word "sympathetic". That in no way confines him to anything. It merely means, "Consider it with an open mind", but says that in one word. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that suggestion.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   We will consider this with an open mind because we believe the issues here are worthy of further consideration and would, I respectfully repeat, benefit from further discussion. So, the word "open" is attached to the word "mind" in the context of "further consideration and further discussion".
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   With the advantage of those further and better particulars, I am prepared to ask leave to withdraw my amendment, although obviously intending reculer pour mieux sauter should that be necessary.

<A NAME = "80303-16_para11"></a>At this stage obviously the noble and learned Lord is unable to say who or what kinds of people are likely to be appointed. In general, I am not in favour of a prescriptive provision of this kind setting out precisely who should be sitting on the panel.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-16_para12"></a>I move the amendment purely as a probing amendment to seek guidance from the Government as to what kinds of people are to be appointed to the panel and what kinds of interests they are expected to cover. I also make the more general point that it is very important that the various classes that I specify in the amendment should be represented in one way or another; in other words, those who have experience of working with or on behalf of victims of crime such as circuit or High Court judges, police officers, magistrates or small businessmen.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-16_para13"></a>The problem about producing a list of this kind--the noble and learned Lord will no doubt make the point absolutely clear--is that it can be as long as one's arm and it will still not feature all those who should be included. I recognise the demerits of the amendment and have no intention of pressing it or anything like it, but I should be grateful if the noble and learned Lord could indicate the Government's thinking about the kinds of people to be included and the range of their experience. I beg to move.

<A NAME="80303-16_spmin0"></A><B>The Solicitor-General  (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </B>  As the noble Lord indicated, Amendment No. 258 raises questions about who will serve on the new sentencing advisory panel. I am grateful to the noble Lord for the suggestions contained in his amendment and for giving the Government an opportunity to state their thinking in relation to the composition of the panel. Under Clause 67 appointments to the panel will be a matter for my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor to decide in consultation with the Home Secretary and the Lord Chief Justice. No final decisions have yet been taken on the composition of the panel. I can confirm however that the matter is under discussion between the Home Secretary, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-16_para14"></a>It may assist if I set out in outline the role of the panel and how we see it working as this will inform any decision on the membership. The panel has been set up to provide informed, well researched and objective advice to the Court of Appeal. It needs to be independent yet capable of reflecting the view of a wide range of interested parties and acting as a conduit for those views to the Court of Appeal. It must not however be seen to be dominated by any particular sectional interests. The panel has been set up to promote consistency in sentencing by providing the Court of Appeal with some additional but very important tools which will assist in the framing or revision of guidelines. It will be important for it to have the right mix of "coal face" experience and broad-based knowledge of the criminal justice system. At the same time however it should not be too big and unwieldy if it is to act quickly and in a corporate fashion as we want it to. This means that we are probably looking at about 12 members. Clearly, that limits to some extent the <P>


<a name="column_1148"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1148</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>range of people and groups that can be represented on the panel. The panel however will consult widely so those whose interests are not directly represented on it will still have every opportunity to feed in their views.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-16_para15"></a>The kind of people we expect to be on the panel may include for example academic lawyers, researchers, sentencers and sentence providers and one or two people completely independent of the criminal justice system. The Government are very interested to hear suggestions made by noble Lords tonight about possible membership. I am sure that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor will take those into account, along with the views of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, and the Home Secretary with whom he is in discussion. Similarly, on the question of who will be consulted, it is important that we do not seek to be too prescriptive at this stage about membership of the panel. Appointments to the panel will not be made until the Bill receives Royal Assent. It would be unfortunate if at some stage in the future we were prevented from appointing an eminently suitable candidate simply because he or she did not fit into some pre-determined category.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-16_para16"></a>I hope that that explanation helps the Committee to understand how the Government see the panel at the moment. I hope very much that the noble Lord, Lord Henley, will not seek to press his amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80303-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   I have just returned from a conference in Swindon of the Criminal Justice Consultative Council. The conference was very much devoted to race issues. One of my concerns is the victims within the criminal justice system, particularly those in ethnic minority communities. At Second Reading I said that 16 to 17 per cent. of the prison population consisted of black people and that 24 per cent. (or one in four) of female prisoners were black. A number of studies, including one by the department of criminology at the University of Oxford, illustrate discrepancies in the sentencing of black people. I ask the Minister to ensure that when this matter is considered people from the ethnic minorities in the criminal justice system are represented in the membership of the advisory panel. I also note that the Probation Service is omitted and suggest that that should be put right.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I am grateful for the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, about ethnic minorities and victims. The panel will have certain members but it will consult people before it expresses its views to the Court of Appeal about the guidelines that it proposes. I cannot say at the moment whether these particular ideas will be taken on board, but I can assure the noble Lord that they will be considered. However, for the reasons that I have given I believe that it is wrong at this stage to be too prescriptive about both the panel and the consultees. The consultees may vary from case to case, but I assure the noble Lord that his remarks will be taken into account.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   I am grateful for the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. I agree that my group <P>


<a name="column_1149"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1149</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>does not include those he mentioned. One could go on lengthening the list so that it becomes almost as long as one's arm. I do not recommend that approach, as I hope I made clear in moving the amendment. I do not believe that one should set out a prescriptive list. For that reason, therefore, I am very grateful for the explanation that the noble and learned Lord has given about the consideration that will be given to this matter when the panel is set up. I am entirely satisfied that all those who should be included will be included or, if they are not included, that they will certainly be consulted by the panel as and when appropriate. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-17_para0"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Henley </B>   moved Amendment No. 258C:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 53, line 36, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) The Panel may at any time, and shall if directed to do so by the Lord Chancellor, propose to him that guidelines for the sentencing of offenders by magistrates' courts be framed for any category of summary or either-way offence.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-17_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: This replaces an amendment I originally tabled as Amendment No. 257A which is now withdrawn. I am advised that it is possibly a better attempt to achieve what I tried to achieve in the earlier amendment. I daresay that again it will be found not to be the best way of dealing with the matter, but no doubt I can have advice from noble Lords when they respond.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-17_para2"></a>The amendment seeks to achieve a greater degree of consistency in sentencing in magistrates' courts--something which, I understand, is dealt with in other courts by the sentencing advisory panel. My noble friend Lady Anelay will know from her personal experience that there is considerable inconsistency from one court to another. For example, someone may be sentenced in magistrates' court A for a serious road traffic offence and told in no uncertain terms by the Bench that, if he appears again before them having committed a similar offence, he will definitely lose his licence for six months or a year, but when, having repeated the offence, he appears before another magistrates' court 100 miles away, he is not dealt with appropriately. The original warning will therefore have had no effect and no meaning whatsoever.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-17_para3"></a>The amendment will introduce greater consistency to the magistrates' courts while ensuring that the courts still have discretion to act as they wish, so they are not bound to follow the advice absolutely. It is important that they should have that discretion but there should also be a degree of consistency. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-17_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Tenby: </B>   I support the principle of the amendment in trying to achieve an overall standard throughout sentencing. It is undoubtedly a scandal that, according to various statistics, a person has a far greater chance of going to prison if he appears before court A for a shoplifting offence than if he appears before court C in another part of the country, where he may have his wrist slapped and get away with a small fine. That is clearly unacceptable. In the past, people have been <P>


<a name="column_1150"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1150</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>inclined to be indulgent about the situation, saying that it is funny and quaint. I do not find it so. There is a great deal to be said for uniformity, at least in principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-17_para4"></a>However, noble Lords, particularly those who are involved in these matters, know that there are regional peculiarities and differences. If a certain area is suffering from a plague of offences arising from football hooliganism, then one might be more severe in sentencing than if it were a rare occurrence. I understand the difficulties facing those who are trying to frame a workable amendment, but the principle is a good one.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I fully understand the principle underlying the noble Lord's amendment, to which the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, has spoken so eloquently. In the Bill, the sentencing guidelines drawn up by the Court of Appeal would cover indictable-only offences, those offences which can only be tried in the Crown Court, or offences that are triable each way, in a Crown Court or a magistrates' court. They would not apply to summary-only offences which can only be tried in the magistrates' courts. The present position is that guidelines for summary offences are drawn up by the Magistrates' Association.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-17_para5"></a>When we developed our proposals, we specifically considered the position of the magistrates' court and consulted the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice. His view was that it would be inappropriate for the Court of Appeal to take on this role and disrupt the current arrangements, given that summary-only offences almost never came before that court. We agreed with that view and concluded that it would be better to retain the existing position whereby the Magistrates' Association, which has great experience in this area, draws up such guidelines. It is worth underlining that, as the Bill is drafted, the Sentencing Advisory Panel advises the Court of Appeal and no other body, and it is not clear from the amendment--although I do not take this as a major point--who is supposed to produce the guidelines envisaged by the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-17_para6"></a>Noble Lords might say that we should provide for the Sentencing Advisory Panel to have a role in advising the Magistrates' Association in these matters, but the Magistrates' Association is a non-statutory body and it would therefore be difficult to frame statutory responsibilities around it. In practice, the Magistrates' Association may wish, when considering guidelines for magistrates' courts, to have regard to the advice produced by the panel and the guidelines produced by the Court of Appeal. I am sure that fruitful discussions could take place between the two bodies: indeed, the Magistrates' Association is likely to be one of the bodies which the panel must consult when consultees are identified.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-17_para7"></a>I fear that it is right to leave matters on that basis. These provisions are not intended to undermine the position of the Magistrates' Association in this regard, and it is very difficult to incorporate the Sentencing Advisory Panel by statute in relation to the Magistrates' Association. I hope the noble Lord will agree to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   The noble and learned Lord is relatively sympathetic. I accept that the amendment is <P>


<a name="column_1151"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1151</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>probably defective in some way but the noble and learned Lord did not offer a solution to deal with the problem of inconsistency which everyone, including the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, recognises.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-17_para8"></a>Can the noble and learned Lord and his colleagues in the Home Office between now and Report give some little consideration to whether there is not a measure that one could introduce which might go some way towards achieving what I wish to achieve; or is he saying that he regrets that there is very little that can be done?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-17_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I am saying that I regret that there is very little that can be done through the mechanism that is being proposed or any other mechanism that one can think of in relation to the clause. The reason for that is that the Sentencing Advisory Panel is there to advise the Court of Appeal. We consulted the Lord Chief Justice and he has said that it is inappropriate to expand the panel's role or to give an increased role to the Court of Appeal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-17_para9"></a>We have thought carefully about how we can help the magistrates' courts through this mechanism and we have concluded effectively that it cannot be done. I regret it, but I am afraid I cannot give any comfort at all in respect of the amendment. The noble Lord may have to take his medicine now.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-17_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   I thank the noble and learned Lord for his openness in offering his regret. I will consider the matter carefully between now and Report and decide whether to come back to it. If not, I will take my medicine like a man. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="80303-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Henley </B>   moved Amendment No. 258A:

<BR>
("( ) Judges and magistrates shall not be required to adhere to, or even to consider, any guidelines proposed by the Panel for the benefit of the Court of Appeal.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-18_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment makes absolutely clear that the courts still have a discretion in sentencing. It does not conflict in any way with earlier amendments but addresses the situation in all courts, whether magistrates' courts or otherwise.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-18_para1"></a>The amendment seeks to make the situation clear on the face of the Bill, which is the important point; that the courts must make decisions for themselves, even though they follow the guidance. In the end the courts have to make the decisions. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The effect of the amendment is to make clear that sentences need not have regard to advice from the Sentencing Advisory Panel. I make it quite clear that there can be no question of sentences being required or expected to have regard to the panel's advice to the Court of Appeal. The panel's advice is just that, advice to the Court of Appeal alone.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-18_para2"></a>The Court of Appeal will be required to have regard to the advice of the panel. However, it will be for the court to decide how much account should be taken of that advice, and it may even reject it. Sentencers will <P>


<a name="column_1152"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1152</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and should have regard only to the final sentencing guidelines produced by the Court of Appeal. We do not believe that it is necessary to make that clear on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-18_para3"></a>I hope that, given those assurances, the noble Lord will accept that the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I listened with great interest to the discussions on this and the two previous amendments. All those who have been in practice, like Members on the Front Bench, know perfectly well that everyone undertaking judicial work at first instance is at the mercy of the Court of Appeal when it comes to sentencing principles.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-18_para4"></a>I find the situation slightly strange because the Court of Appeal--what should be called the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal, but for some reason generally is not--is presided over by the Lord Chief Justice and not by the Master of the Rolls, who presides over the civil side. The Lord Chief Justice is very influential in laying down the sentencing policies decided upon by the Court of Appeal. They are binding on the courts of first instance.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-18_para5"></a>We now find that the Lord Chief Justice is to have another capacity. Not only will he be consulted on who should constitute members of the sentencing panel, but, under subsection (4), he will be consulted on the advice to be given by the panel. Therefore, the Lord Chief Justice will have a dual capacity, dealing with the same matters in a different way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-18_para6"></a>I hope and believe that the work which he does as Lord Chief Justice presiding over criminal decisions in the Court of Appeal will be dominant and that he will not have to submit himself to the relatively minor part which he may play in the work of the sentencing panel.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I agree with the noble Lord's observation that all sentences are at the mercy--if that is the right word--of the Court of Appeal. That will remain the position even after the Bill becomes law. I understand that as regards the sentencing advisory panel, the Lord Chief Justice will have two roles. First, he is to be consulted on its membership. Secondly, under subsection (4), where there is a reference to the panel or a reference originating from it, the Lord Chief Justice shall be consulted by the panel as to whom it shall then consult before giving its advice. I believe that that is a comparatively minor involvement in the deliberations of the panel and is not nearly as important as the role he will play in presiding in the Court of Appeal, determining what the sentencing guidelines should be.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for his explanation. He has made the position quite clear.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-18_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   I, too, am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for those two explanations. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

Before Clause 80, insert the following new clause--

(" .--(1) Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 is amended as follows.
<BR>
(2) In subsection (1), after the word "vehicles" there are inserted the words "and to demand the removal of face coverings".
<BR>
(3) In subsection (4), at the end there is inserted--
<BR>
"(c) to demand the removal of face coverings that might intimidate other persons or which might inhibit subsequent identification of offenders.".").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-18_para10"></a>The noble Viscount said: In the unavoidable absence of my noble friend Lord Carnarvon, for which he tenders his regrets to the Committee, I move Amendment No. 258B. When my noble friend first raised the matter by way of a Starred Question on 5th February, I detected support for it from all sides of the House. I hope that that sympathy will be reflected in the Minister's response today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-18_para11"></a>The issue is simple. Many of those engaged in unlawful disputes--for example, on demonstrations such as the National Front rally in Dover last November, in crowd hooliganism as recently occurred at a football match in Bristol in the autumn, or in an armed robbery--use face and head coverings of various kinds. There are two objectives in doing so. The first and most obvious is to escape detection, a result far more likely with the use of close circuit TV and videos were they not to adopt such tactics. But there is another reason which is in a way even more sinister. It is to instil fear in those unlucky enough to be in the way of such deplorable activities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-18_para12"></a>Although the police have been aware of the problem for some considerable time, the Association of Chief Police Officers is against the creation of an offence for wearing such head and face coverings. In law, it would present considerable difficulties because some people might wear protective clothing for a variety of lawful reasons. I refer, for example, to a scarf wrapped around the face to counter toothache; a covering to ameliorate some other ailment; or--who knows?--even a motor cycle dispatch rider attempting to enter the Home Office with letters of support to Ministers for their sympathetic consideration of amendments to the Bill! But this is a serious matter which invites a speedy resolution.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-18_para13"></a>The amendment, which carries the support of the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Police Federation, seeks to amend Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. It would permit a police officer to demand the removal of face coverings before crime and disorder took place. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-18_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   I support the amendment. The noble Viscount rightly reminded the Committee that we discussed the matter when the noble Earl, Lord Carnarvon, raised it at Question Time on 5th February. I then made it clear that if the Government wished to make changes through the mechanism of the Bill we would offer sympathetic support to try to ensure an easy <P>


<a name="column_1154"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1154</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>passage. Having offered my support, I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say. Are the Government able to proceed with the Bill, or do they believe that further work and consultation is required before proceeding down this route?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-18_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   I joined in the Starred Question on 5th February and suggested that a little care might be needed with the wording of any effective piece of legislation on this issue. My noble friends who have tabled the amendment have taken care to distinguish between people who for one reason or another are legitimately covered up and those who are not. I support the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-18_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, and to the noble Earl, Lord Carnarvon, who have discussed the problem with me; the noble Earl before his Starred Question on 5th February and the noble Viscount subsequently. On 5th February, on behalf of the Government I made it plain that when we had representations from the Association of Chief Police Officers we would give its views careful attention. We have received its views and it supports the measure, as does the Police Federation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-18_para14"></a>The result would be that Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 would be amended to give the police the power to demand the removal of face coverings in certain circumstances. There arises the question of a safety device, about which the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, was concerned on 5th February and tonight, as to how one deals with individual liberties and strikes a proper balance between that and the reasonable requirements of the police. The trick here, so to speak, is that the power is only exercisable within a given locality for up to 24 hours at present and only on the authority of an officer of at least superintendent rank, where that officer "reasonably believes" that violent incidents may be prevented by using that power. I should point out to Members of the Committee that that superintendent rank may well be reduced to that of inspector or above later this year. I just thought that I ought to mention that detail.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-18_para15"></a>Our stance is that we believe there is a mischief here. People wear balaclavas or crash helmets partly to avoid identification and partly to intimidate. It is not limited to one category of demonstration quite often found, perhaps, on inner-city estates--for example, National Front marches and those of such organisations. Therefore, we wish to consider this as a matter of urgency with a view, if the practical issues can be resolved, to returning with a government amendment at a later stage of the proceedings on the Bill. On the basis of that undertaking, I hope that the noble Viscount will feel able to withdraw the amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-19_para4"></a>Organisations working with young offenders have expressed concern about Clause 80 in particular because they consider that the Government should not use local authority places to lock up more 12 and 14 year-olds before removing all 15 and 16 year-olds from the prison system to secure accommodation. Sending juvenile defendants to penal establishments has long been regarded as a recipe for criminal contamination, intimidation, and, all too often, self-harm and suicide attempts. Since the mid-1970s there has been bi-partisan agreement that remanding this age group to Prison Service custody is undesirable and that, when remanded juveniles need secure conditions, they should be held in local authority secure units staffed by residential childcare workers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-19_para5"></a>I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, mentioned earlier the research document of the Howard League which showed how harmful prison was to 15 year-old girls. It is terribly important; indeed, we should not start locking up even younger people or putting them in secure accommodation when those <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>places could be used for 15 and 16 year-olds. This time, I hope that my noble friend the Minister will accept that we have a point. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="80303-19_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Colville of Culross: </B>   My amendment has been grouped with Amendment No. 259. With the leave of the Committee, I hope that I can ungroup it because it deals with a totally different subject and I was busy when the groupings were announced. I trust, therefore, that I can move it separately in a moment. I should be most grateful.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-19_spnew3"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Lichfield: </B>   I feel that I must rise to my feet again to support the noble Baroness because of my very grave concern that Clause 80, as she pointed out, will make it possible for children as young as 12 to be remanded to a young offender institution or prison rather than to local authority secure accommodation. While I am aware that the provision refers to serious crimes, we are still talking about children and young people who have either not yet been convicted or, if they have been, are still awaiting sentence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-19_para6"></a>Members of the Committee may or may not be aware that the Children's Society--one of the other organisations to which the noble Baroness referred--is a voluntary society of the Church of England and the Church in Wales, which has long been concerned about the current state of the law under which 15 year-olds can be, and are, remanded to prison.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-19_para7"></a>In November last year, the Children's Society launched its Remand Rescue Initiative, a national campaign to end remand to prison for young people and to help those already imprisoned on remand. This campaign is not just one of persuasion: it is based on the society's work in Feltham Young Offender Institution and in Doncaster Prison, which it plans to extend to other prisons.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-19_para8"></a>In the first six months of work at Feltham, the Remand Rescue Initiative worked with 176 15 and 16 year-olds. It was found that half of them had previously suffered sexual or physical abuse or bullying, or had engaged in self-mutilation of one sort or another. While something under a quarter had actually been in local authority care, 86 per cent. were known to social services, and 62 per cent. had not been attending school, either because they had been excluded or because they had got into the way of truanting. All these young people had either been charged with serious offences or were awaiting sentence following conviction. Some of those charged would, presumably, be acquitted. It is important to bear in mind that, according to a study by the Association of Chief Officers of Probation, only 12 per cent. of young people remanded into custody had committed violent offences. Yet here they all are, in prison, despite the fact that we have abundant evidence to show that it does them harm, and equally abundant evidence which shows that the constructive alternatives to prison remand have a positive effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-19_para9"></a>The inclusion in the Criminal Justice Act 1991 of provision increasing the likelihood that such young people would be remanded to secure local authority accommodation rather than prison came at a time, which Members of the Committee may remember, of high <P>


<a name="column_1157"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1157</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concern over the suicide of the 15 year-old Phillip Knight, who was on remand in custody. His death is to our shame; and it is deeply to be regretted that he was not the last young person in prison to put an end to his life.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-19_para10"></a>There have been calls for an end to remand into prison for young people from the following: the Chief Inspector of Prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham; from the General Secretary of the Prison Governors' Association, David Roddan; and from the Chairman of the Magistrates' Association's Youth Committee, Lynne Ravenscroft. They are not sentimental people, as bishops may be expected to be. They know what is required of a criminal justice system and they do not shy away from ensuring a necessary rigour of regime. If they believe that the current system is treating young people badly, how can we in this Bill continue along the same path?
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-19_para11"></a>Still more, how can the Government be contemplating catching even younger people in the net of remand into prison? Of course I am aware that the Government, all governments, are perpetually being asked to provide resources for a variety of needs. Previous governments have failed to do what it takes to ensure that local authorities can provide the required secure accommodation--I want to underline that--but some government, some day, must get this job done. In the meantime I am convinced that we should not be extending the scope of the problem to include 12, 13 and 14 year-olds.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-19_para12"></a>The Government may say that the wording of the clause reflects their awareness of the vulnerability of children as young as 12, but I have to say that I would need to hear from the Minister a good case indeed for these changes before I could be persuaded of their rightness. I strongly support the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-19_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hilton of Eggardon: </B>   The right reverend Prelate has made the case much more powerfully than I can. I entirely support what he said in particular about Feltham, which I have visited on a number of occasions. In addition to the bullying, self-harm and even suicides of young boys, the regime is wholly inappropriate for 15 and 16 year-olds who should be attending school, who have truanted for many reasons and who are often illiterate. If they are lucky, they receive one hour a week of education in reading and writing. That is totally inappropriate to provide them with skills to cope with life thereafter. Those who are not bullied or commit suicide or who do not subject themselves to self-harm, are probably those who adapt to living in this regime with older boys of 18, 19 and 20. In many ways they are being hardened, adapted and taught to lead the lives of criminals. In my view it is wholly inappropriate to remand 15 and 16 year-olds to establishments such as Feltham, although the staff there do the best they can with something like a thousand young boys and young men who are locked up there. I urge the Government to think again about the need to remand 15 and 16 year-olds to prison service custody.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   I had not planned to intervene in this debate but I visited Feltham when I was working <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>for the Apex Trust a few years ago. The inmates were probably some of the most aggressive that I ever saw when considering penal reform. There were young, aggressive males who were keen on bullying and establishing their status. The environment in such an institution is probably tougher than in an adult prison. I strongly recommend that the Government consider these amendments as otherwise those who are most vulnerable will be accommodated with those who are most likely to oppress them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-19_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Perhaps I can clear up one misunderstanding, if I have it correctly. Clause 80 will not allow 12 year-olds to be remanded to prison or to young offender institutions. They can be remanded only to local authority secure accommodation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-19_para13"></a>We recognise absolutely the need to deal with the remand to prison of 15 and 16 year-old boys. Our policy is quite unambiguous. We wish to move to a situation where the practice is no longer necessary. The 1991 Criminal Justice Act provided for the eventual replacement of courts' powers to remand 15 and 16 year-old boys to prison with a new power to remand 15 and 16 year-olds, boys or girls, to local authority secure accommodation. This power was widened by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to include 12 to 14 year-olds. As the present legislation stands, the power cannot be applied to this age group before it is applied to 15 and 16 year-olds.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-19_para14"></a>The reason 15 and 16 year-olds are still being remanded in what the Government believe are inappropriate conditions is mainly the lack of suitable local authority secure accommodation. There has been a building programme which has added 170 places to the local authority secure estate but that has been outstripped by the numbers of 15 and 16 year-old boys on remand in prison which has stood recently between 220 and 270. What we therefore want to do is to start the process of implementing policy on court-ordered secure remands in stages. This means that the courts' power to remand in these circumstances will apply to all 12 to 14 year-olds, 15 and 16 year-old girls and 15 and 16 year-old boys who are adjudged by the courts to meet the vulnerability definition in Clause 81(3). For the moment we cannot extend powers to the remaining 15 and 16 year-old boys because at present there is no available local authority secure accommodation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-19_para15"></a>Quite reasonably the right reverend Prelate and the noble Baronesses stressed the urgency of the situation. On 15th October officials in the Home Office wrote to all directors of social services in England and Wales, representatives of the Local Government Association, the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Social Services for England and their Welsh equivalents to inform them of the Government's view. There was a first meeting with the associations and officials on 18th November to discuss questions of finance and the review that the Government have initiated--I mentioned it to the Committee earlier this evening--of the juvenile secure estate. It was agreed that a joint approach was required. There was a <P>


<a name="column_1159"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>second meeting on 13th January this year and now further work is being done under a technical group made up of representatives from central and local government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-19_para16"></a>The review of the juvenile secure estate is part of the Government's comprehensive spending review. We are reviewing the whole range of secure accommodation for young people, including local authority secure units. We want to make sure that all assets and resources are used to the best effect, in particular--I refer to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hilton--in meeting educational needs and tackling offending behaviour.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-19_para17"></a>The outcome of the review, which is due shortly, will, of course, be considered as a matter of urgency by the Government. One of the points we shall have to decide is the nature of the further expansion of the secure estate. I have gone into a little detail on dates, which I know perhaps is not normal. I have done that to indicate that we recognise the concerns that have been expressed and to indicate the seriousness with which the Government are determined to do away with remanding 15 and 16 year-old boys to prison custody.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   I shall need to read that response carefully. It seems to me that perhaps the Minister has the same horror that I have of 15 and 16 year-olds being in prison, and particularly 15 year-old girls. I am quite horrified at 12 to 14 year-olds having to be kept in secure accommodation, although I know that some of them can be real tearaways and need to be kept in secure accommodation, at least for a time. I hope that the Minister will not pay too much attention to public opinion. It seems to me that parliamentarians should lead public opinion and not bow down to it. Capital punishment would not have been got rid of if parliamentarians had not led public opinion. I think that too much attention has been paid to that lately. That is a great pity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-20_para0"></a>I was extremely grateful for the right reverend Prelate's speech in which he said everything better than I did. I remind my noble friend the Minister that all the children's associations, not only the Children's Society, feel strongly about a great deal of what is happening in this Bill. I have had an interesting response and I am happy to read it. Therefore, temporarily at least, I can only withdraw this amendment; but I am not committing myself to not coming back to it on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-20_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Colville of Culross </B>   moved Amendment No. 260:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 67, line 39, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) In subsection (5) of section 23 of the 1969 Act, for the words "serious harm from him" there shall be substituted the words "the risk of his committing further serious offences".").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-20_para2"></a>The noble Viscount said: I offer this amendment to the noble Lord, Lord Williams, in the hope that it may be helpful. He knows my views about the adequacy of local authority secure accommodation and the number of occasions on which it can be used. I was extremely interested to hear what he has just said about the review that is being carried out. He told me last week--if I <P>


<a name="column_1160"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1160</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>understood him rightly--that the youth court has a duty to remand children and young people to local authority secure accommodation. It is indicative of the muddle into which this legislation has arrived--it was discussed in the major debate earlier today--that had the noble Lord been talking about Section 23 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 which was inserted by the Children Act 1989, he would have been right. Another Section 23 has since been inserted by the Criminal Justice Act 1991. That does not put any duty on the youth court to remand children and young persons to local authority secure accommodation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-20_para3"></a>In the Bill we look forward to consolidation. That is the purpose of Schedule 6. At present, two places in the 1991 Act refer to the expression "protect the public from serious harm". The first is in Part I. The reference goes back to the provision for longer than normal sentences under Section 2. The interpretation is found at the end of Part I.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-20_para4"></a>Very sensibly, I think everyone would agree, the Court of Appeal said that before sentencers pass longer than normal sentences they require some fairly extensive reports, often of a psychiatric nature, or at the very least a substantial pre-sentencing report before such sentencing is justified. The same phrase has been inserted into the new Section 23 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969. Technically speaking, it does not occur in the 1991 Act. It has merely been inserted retrospectively into the 1969 Act. Nevertheless, the phrase is exactly the same.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-20_para5"></a>We want to make a differentiation. It is difficult enough for youth courts to remand children and young persons to local authority secure accommodation. Since it is a matter of remand instead of bail, the matter has to be dealt with urgently. Therefore there should be no reference to having to obtain reports for psychiatric assessments or anything of that kind at that stage. That requirement comes when sentencing or other disposals are required.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-20_para6"></a>In advance of consolidation, I suggest that we should use a different phrase. I believe that the words I have put forward mean exactly the same but they do not carry the overtones of longer than normal sentences in Part I of the 1991 Act. Equally, they would not carry the overtones of requiring extensive and complicated reporting before the powers were implemented. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Viscount for his explanation. Indeed, he had notified me of the intention behind the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-20_para7"></a>The background to the secure remand criteria is that the 1991 Act has within it a test for remands to local authority secure accommodation which has two criteria: one related to the alleged offence; the other to the need for public protection.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-20_para8"></a>The offence-related criterion has two elements. The young person concerned must have been charged with or convicted of a violent or sexual offence, or an offence punishable, were he or she an adult, with imprisonment for a term of 14 years or more. The second element is that the person has a recent history of absconding while <P>


<a name="column_1161"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1161</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>remanded to local authority accommodation, and is charged with or been convicted of an imprisonable offence alleged or found to have been committed while he was so remanded. The first covers the more serious offenders. The second limb covers young people who, while on remand to local authority accommodation, continue to cause problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-20_para9"></a>We believe that court-ordered secure remands should be restricted to the most serious cases. The seriousness of the offence or the persistence of the offending behaviour is not itself a sufficient justification for such a remand whether this be to prison or to local authority secure accommodation. In addition, therefore, the Act requires the court to be of the opinion that only such a remand would be adequate to protect the public from serious harm from the young person. In relation to sexual or violent offences, "serious harm" means death or serious personal injury, occasioned by further such offences committed by the young person. "Serious harm" is not defined in relation to other offences. However, the definition for sexual and violent offences gives an indication of the gravity of the harm to which the public would have to be exposed from a young person in other circumstances before the test is likely to be satisfied.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-20_para10"></a>The amendment is to substitute the risk of his committing serious further offences. We are not entirely clear what "further serious offences" would be found to mean. The courts are, I think, familiar with the term "serious harm" but there is no real guidance about what "further serious offences" would mean. The existing criteria are designed to apply to the most serious cases. As we discussed earlier today, local authority secure accommodation is a limited resource. We believe that it should be limited to the most serious and persistent offenders. We think that there would be a danger that the noble Viscount's amendment would lower the threshold so that it would be applied to young persons who could and should be remanded to alternative and more appropriate accommodation more commensurate with their alleged offences.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-20_para11"></a>We recognise that placing a young person in secure accommodation is a serious step. That is why in sentenced or remand cases we believe that secure accommodation should be reserved for the most serious and persistent offenders. I recognise the intention behind the amendment, but we are not prepared to support it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-20_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Colville of Culross: </B>   I do not seem to have explained myself very well. The noble Lord tells the Committee that the test which now appears in Section 23(5) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 is the same as appears in relation to longer than normal sentences. I never believed that that was the case. The definition for the purposes of longer than normal sentences applies only to Part I. The new section inserted into the 1969 Act does not occur in Part I. It is true that the same expression is used. However, since that legislation was enacted the Court of Appeal has dealt with the tests for the purposes of Part I. It has said nothing about the Children and Young Persons Act 1969.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-20_para12"></a>I agree with the noble Lord that these are exceptional cases. We certainly do not want to devalue the seriousness that attends upon sending someone on remand to local authority secure accommodation. However, I am considering the consolidation point. I do not believe that the noble Lord's advisers have foreseen the problem that will arise when these exactly similar expressions occur in a single consolidation Act and have to be interpreted by a court in accordance with different criteria.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-20_para13"></a>I seek only to help the noble Lord. I am not trying to devalue or reduce the thresholds. I wish only to make it possible in a suitable case for the youth court rapidly to remand someone to secure accommodation without having to obtain a lot of reports. I should have thought that it was a helpful and constructive suggestion. If the noble Lord does not like my wording, so be it; one never gets the wording right. But I should have thought that he would accept the idea underlying the amendment in particular in the light of the forthcoming consolidation. Is the noble Lord really not prepared to think about the matter again?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I understand the intention because the noble Viscount and I have been in correspondence. We believe that the present wording is better. I am receiving contrary legal advice from the noble Viscount and officials. I may need to look at the issue again. I am always willing to do so. If the noble Viscount says I have got the law wrong, I shall recheck it. The answer may be found in Section 23(13)(c) of the 1969 Act. I readily agree that I may have got it wrong and the noble Viscount may be right. Perhaps he will give me the opportunity to reflect. I recognise that his intention is simply to be helpful, and I am seeking to respond in that way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-20_para14"></a>Perhaps the noble Viscount will allow me to revisit Section 23 of the 1969 Act. Whatever my conclusion is after revisiting the legislation and taking further advice, I shall write promptly to him.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

However, I am wondering whether he has thought about the impact upon people aged 12 and 13 who will fall within the new Clause 80 as now proposed. I should have thought that it is the wrong test. I am not trying to devalue the provision. If the noble Lord is to re-examine the issue, I am grateful, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="column_1163"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1163</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Minister having already given in some detail, in response to discussion on two previous amendments, the facts about the government review that is taking place with regard to the juvenile estate. It always seems that we use the most remarkable words to describe the facilities that will hold young people in custody. I am pleased to hear that such a review is going on. I hope that it may come to a fairly swift conclusion. I wish to make one or two points with regard to the problems of secure accommodation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-21_para2"></a>Amendment No. 260A would insert into Clause 80 the requirement:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It shall be the duty of the local authority to provide accommodation for the purpose of any remand order made by the court". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-21_para3"></a>Clause 80 deals with remands and committals of young people, about which so much information has been given. As stated, remands involve a speedy need to find accommodation for young children. We are talking about a circumstance in the near future where the numbers of such young people who require secure accommodation will presumably increase. I know that the Minister hopes that this provision may be precautionary rather than a measure that has to be implemented. However, one has to face the reality that these provisions, in the short term, if not in the long term, will lead to a larger number of young people requiring to be found secure accommodation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-21_para4"></a>Amendment No. 260B is included because, if one makes sure that secure accommodation has to be provided by the local authority, then line 22, after the word "applies", ceases to be relevant. The court does not first have to ascertain whether secure accommodation is available if we have already stated that it must be provided prior to action by the court.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-21_para5"></a>My reason for proposing the amendment is based on experience of having to make an order committing a young person to secure accommodation in the knowledge not only that it might be difficult to find such accommodation locally--in the case of young people, surely that is what we must try to achieve, if nothing else--but also that it might be impossible to find secure accommodation anywhere within reasonable travelling distance. On occasions, that has happened simply because, within some local authorities, a position of political dogma has determined that there should be no provision at all of secure accommodation. That has meant children being sent outwith their county districts in order to find secure accommodation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-21_para6"></a>I hope that the government review has taken into account the "patchwork quilt" of provision that has heretofore existed and the resistance, on a dogmatic basis, of some local authorities to providing secure accommodation at all. I hope that the Minister is able to assure me that these matters have been taken into account. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-21_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Tenby: </B>   I support the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. In many ways, all these amendments on custodial sentences for young offenders are linked. Had it not been for the fact that others more distinguished than I spoke to the earlier amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady David, <P>


<a name="column_1164"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1164</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I could indeed have spoken to it as I supported it too. Since the amendments are linked one must be careful not to be repetitious or to make a Second Reading speech. It used to be said that Queen Mary, when she died, had Calais written on her heart. I sometimes think that if a future pathologist cuts me open, he will find written on mine, "secure local accommodation".
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-21_para7"></a>The Minister may reasonably reply to the spirit of the amendment--which is, after all, a probing amendment--that this condition cannot be made if such accommodation is not available. Under present trends I have to say with a heavy heart that that may be all too likely. With the power now to remand children over 12 direct to local authority accommodation, 15 and 16 year-old girls to local secure accommodation, and 15 and 16 year-old vulnerable boys also, one wonders how they will all fit in, despite the extra 170 places which are now available.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-21_para8"></a>In that context, the review of juvenile secure estate is very much to be welcomed. I appreciate the Minister going to the trouble to spell out the meetings that have taken place as an indication of the commitment that the Government have in relation to this problem. We can only hope that the government survey will spotlight the need for more local secure accommodation and that ring-fenced funds will be made available for the purpose.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-21_para9"></a>I know that there are competing demands on government finances. I know that health and education have an almost insatiable appetite. I know that there are few political brownie points to be won by expressing concerns about our prisoners and prisons, especially in the juvenile sector. Nevertheless, it is quite simply the sign of a civilised society that we should care about these matters, as indeed I know the Minister does. I therefore warmly support the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Perhaps I may deal with Amendment No. 260A very briefly, as I believe the noble Baroness recognises that Section 61 of the 1991 Act already places a duty on local authorities to ensure that they are in a position to comply with any security requirement under Section 23 of the Children and Young Person Act 1969. So that amendment would not be of any practical utility.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-21_para10"></a>Amendment No. 260B would in effect remove the requirement that in cases where the courts have adjudged a boy to be vulnerable--we discussed these matters earlier--a place has to be identified in advance. We understand that there is a case to be made for saying that there should be no limitation on the courts' powers to apply the legislation. However, we cannot overlook one of the reasons that has brought us to have the review referred to.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-21_para11"></a>We are having to proceed step by step. I agree that a good argument can be made for matters to proceed more quickly. However, we have to have the review. We are dealing with the most vulnerable. For a court to decide to remand a most vulnerable boy or girl, it will need to have quite a lot of information: from the Probation Service, a social worker, a member of the youth offending team, and other information which it might <P>


<a name="column_1165"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1165</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>think appropriate. Then an assessment has to be made by the probation officer, the social worker or the youth offending team member in advance as to whether the boy concerned is likely to come within the definition of subsection (5)(a).
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-21_para12"></a>We believe that it is in the interests of the probation officer, social worker or team member to have established in advance of the remand hearing that there is indeed a suitable secure place available. If one does not have that requirement, the whole exercise is pointless. I believe I was guilty of a slip of the tongue when I said "boy or girl." I meant "boy", of course, not "girl". I realised as soon as I said it that I had made a mistake. We believe that this requirement is necessary. It ought to be an essential part of the assessment process. If the amendment were agreed to, it would place the courts in a very difficult situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-21_para13"></a>The noble Baroness was kind enough to say that I had already dealt in part with the review of the juvenile secure estate. Perhaps I may expand. It is a review of the whole range of secure accommodation for young people, including local authority secure units. What we are trying to achieve is that all the resources employed in the accommodation and care of accused or convicted juveniles who need secure accommodation are used to best effect. It includes educational needs and tackling offending behaviour. I can assure the noble Baroness that the review, which is of pressing urgency, is casting its net very wide indeed. It is, of course, within the context of a comprehensive spending review, and the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, pointed to the fact that there are financial constraints.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-21_para14"></a>I repeat what I said earlier: we wish to see an end to the practice of remanding 15 and 16 year-old boys to prison custody. I can speak with some personal knowledge of these matters because the case mentioned by the right reverend Prelate of Phillip Knight, who killed himself in Swansea Prison, formed part of an inquiry which I conducted. I can only reiterate our policy and our determination to see an end to the practice.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-21_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St. Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that response. I shall consider carefully whether we need to pursue the matter further at Report stage. I accept that Amendment No. 260B does not achieve the objective which we had intended and shall not wish to return to that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-21_para15"></a>I am grateful to the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, for his comments. He underlines what is felt by all those involved in the sentencing process with regard to young people. Any decision taken to put a young person into any form of custody is a decision taken with a very heavy heart and one where sentencers need to feel that suitable accommodation is available for that young person, particularly in the context of this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-21_para16"></a>Having heard the words of the Minister tonight, I shall at this stage beg leave of the Committee to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 68, line 28, leave out from ("applies") to end of line 30.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para0"></a>The noble Earl said: Amendment No. 261 seeks to probe why there is a need for the use of prison for 15 and 16 year-old boys. The Bill allows the use of local authority secure accommodation, a remand centre or a prison. I am unhappy that that three-way choice should be open to magistrates. I should prefer to see in the Bill the Scottish process whereby a child may be admitted to a prison only after an "unruly" certificate had been obtained by the procurator fiscal. I prefer that situation to the one in the Bill because it would mean that a child would be placed in a prison only if it was proved that he could not be contained in secure accommodation or a remand centre. I believe that that approach has more justice in it. A child admitted to a prison would be there strictly as a result of his own actions. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   We have already discussed these problems and perhaps Members of the Committee will forgive my not repeating some of the observations I have made.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para1"></a>I say again that we are sensitive to these concerns. The Minister of State at the Home Office, Mr. Michael, has held a number of meetings recently on this issue. These have included discussions with the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Children's Society, who have campaigned for a long time for the abolition of remanding 15 and 16 year-old boys to prison.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para2"></a>If this amendment were passed, prison remands would immediately be abolished when the Bill became law. There are no remand centres designated for the purpose. Therefore the practical consequence of the noble Earl's amendment would be that all remands would be to local authority secure accommodation. As I identified earlier, there is a lack of such accommodation, and that might mean that the court would have no way of remanding to secure accommodation, even where the court adjudged it necessary in order to protect the public. I believe that that is not a consequence that anyone could sensibly look to. Bearing in mind what I said earlier about the way the Government's policy is set, I ask the noble Earl to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-22_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   I accept that we have in some respects returned to this subject. I should be happy to see the retention of the part of the Bill which I sought to strike out if it referred to prison as being a last resort. As the provision is framed, I believe that magistrates could decide on prison as one of three options. I do not believe that that is what anyone wants. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton </B>   moved Amendment No. 262:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 69, line 46, leave out ("38A(1)") and insert ("38A(1)(a)").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para6"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 262, I shall, with leave of the Committee, speak also to Amendments Nos. 263, and 265 to 269. This series of amendments concerns the workings of the home detention scheme, under which prisoners serving between three months and four years, who are near the end of their sentence, could be released on curfew, enforced by electronic monitoring.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para7"></a>We are keen to ensure that the new home detention curfew works as efficiently as possible, that those offenders who do not meet the discipline it imposes on them are dealt with effectively and that circumstances which are unforseeable when governors are assessing the suitability of a prisoner for release under curfew are suitably provided for.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para8"></a>We believe that those offenders who fail to comply with the terms of the curfew or who return to their offending ways should be quickly recalled to prison and debarred from future eligibility for release under home detention curfew. We are also, however, keen to ensure that offenders are given the opportunity to continue to benefit from the phased reintroduction to society which home detention curfew represents, even when their circumstances change to such an extent that compliance with the terms of their original curfew become difficult.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para9"></a>There will, of course, be occasions when a curfew cannot be monitored and it may well be that, despite the screening process provided by the risk assessment, further information comes to light about the possible threat posed by an offender who has been released under home detention curfew. Clearly the right thing to do in such cases is to recall the offender to prison.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para10"></a>It is with those aims that we propose the following amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para11"></a>Amendment No. 262 is consequential to Amendment No. 269.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para12"></a>Amendment No. 263 ensures that any offender who is at any time returned to prison, having been convicted of an imprisonable offence committed while subject to a sentence from which he had been released early, will not be eligible for release under home detention curfew.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para13"></a> Amendments Nos. 265, 266, 267 and 268 allow prison governors, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, to change the hours or place of curfew once the offender has started the home detention curfew licence period. This will ensure that changes in the circumstances of an offender, such as work commitments or a change of address, which would make compliance with the terms of the licence difficult, can be accommodated without first recalling the offender to prison.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para14"></a>Amendment No. 269 adds two further circumstances under which a licence can be revoked and the offender returned to prison. It will ensure that, in addition to <P>


<a name="column_1168"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1168</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>those who have failed to comply with the conditions of the curfew, offenders who can no longer be monitored at the place specified in the licence and offenders who pose a threat to the public can be recalled to prison.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para15"></a>Clearly offenders who, having passed the risk assessment, are subsequently found to represent a risk to the public, should be returned to prison. Offenders who, for whatever reason, can no longer be monitored at the place specified in the licence, by the same token, should not be allowed to remain at large. If there is no way of monitoring their compliance with the terms of the curfew, the effectiveness of the curfew is negated. I beg to move Amendment No. 262.

("( ) The Secretary of State shall publish guidance as to the criteria which will qualify a prisoner for early release under this section.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: I beg to move Amendment No. 263A. Clause 82, which we have just considered, gives effect to the Government's policy for the early release of prisoners who are serving from three months to four years.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para19"></a>This amendment would require the Secretary of State to publish guidance as to the criteria which would qualify a prisoner for early release under this section.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para20"></a>At Second Reading I raised this issue and I am grateful to the Minister for writing to my noble friend Lord Henley in January on matters surrounding this point. He responded to my concerns in what I might call a three-pronged approach. I hope that today he can confirm that it is the Government's intention to adopt the proposals outlined in his letter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para21"></a>He listed categories of prisoners who would not be eligible for a home curfew. Those were: those serving extended sentences within the meaning of Clause 46 of the Bill; those convicted under Section 1 of the Prisoners (Return to Custody) Act 1995; those subject to a hospital order, a hospital direction or transfer directions under the Mental Health Act; those liable to removal from the United Kingdom; those who have previously failed to comply with the requirements of a home detention curfew or a curfew order enforced by electronic monitoring, or those who have a due release date which means that they would spend fewer than 14 days on curfew.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para22"></a>That list is helpful. I am merely asking tonight whether the Minister can confirm that those are still the excluded categories within the Government's understanding of this matter, and whether any further thought has been given since that letter of January, and therefore whether any further additions have been made to that list.
<P>


<a name="column_1169"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1169</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para23"></a>The second part of that three-pronged approach is that the Minister further stated in the letter that the Government are considering what further considerations should apply when assessing which of the prisoners, among the other categories not excluded, shall then be selected for home detention curfew. That is among those who first of all fall within the categories who will be eligible for consideration, and of course among those who actually apply to be considered.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para24"></a>The Minister stated in the letter that prisoners who have already passed the release on temporary licence risk assessment or who have already successfully completed a period of temporary release will normally be considered as suitable unless other risk factors come to light. Again, that is a helpful indication of how individual suitability for release might be assessed. I would be grateful if the Minister would confirm that this is the Government's position on the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-22_para25"></a>The last part of the three-pronged approach was that the Minister stated that he hoped to be in a position to show draft guidance on eligibility to the House by the time the provisions were considered in Committee. I wonder whether he can fulfil that hope and my expectation tonight, and say whether that draft is now available.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   I do not object to the principle of Clause 82 but I think that this amendment, or something like it, will provide a very necessary and desirable safeguard. The public at large will not be very happy at the idea of prisoners being released, albeit on licence, after serving only a quarter, or just over a quarter, of their sentences. That goes completely against the grain of the last government's policy of honesty in sentencing, if I remember the phrase correctly. I think, however, they would be somewhat mollified if an amendment such as this were to be accepted.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Belstead: </B>   Perhaps I may say a very brief word in support of my noble friend Baroness Anelay on this amendment. I have not seen the exchange of correspondence so I ask first of all, from my place in the Chamber, about those who are suitable to be chosen for electronic monitoring. It would be interesting, certainly for myself, to hear a little more from the Government Front Bench about those who will be suitable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-23_para0"></a>The real reason I have risen to speak is that if one looks at subsection (4) there is set out the eligibility date for the different groups of short-term prisoners, for all of whom the day of release will be very much earlier than it has been under the present arrangements. As the Government will know very well, at present prisoners serving fewer than four years are eligible for early release at the half-way point of their sentence, but under Clause 82(4) the times for all different groups of under four year prisoners will be very much earlier for their early release than now.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-23_para1"></a>That leads me to the question I want to ask. Are the Government confident that electronic monitoring will create a situation where the rate of reoffending will not <P>


<a name="column_1170"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1170</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be higher than it is now and the prospects for rehabilitation will be better because of the electronic monitoring and the surveillance that goes with it? That is really quite a simple question.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-23_para2"></a>I have some views of my own from having read papers about electronic monitoring but I am anxious to hear this evening the views of the Ministers, briefly but succinctly, as to the success as they see it, of electronic monitoring.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   First of all, the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay of St. Johns. The answer is that the contents of the letter still stand. I appreciate that only the noble Lord, Lord Henley, and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, to whom it was sent, have seen the contents of the letter so perhaps I should also undertake to send a copy to both the noble Lord, Lord Monson, and the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, who have intervened in the debate. Nothing that has been said in the letter has been departed from.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-23_para3"></a>So far as concerns the publication of the criteria, I can assure the House that it is our intention to publish the criteria as part of the more detailed guidance that the Prison Service will use to assess suitability for home detention curfew. The assessment will seek to balance any risk to the public presented by the bringing forward of the release date against the potential benefits of incorporating a period of home detention curfew within the prisoner's sentence. We are currently preparing the guidance, and hope to issue it shortly. I will ensure that it is placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament as quickly as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-23_para4"></a>I believe, however, that it would be very unusual for guidance of this kind to be given statutory status without any overriding reason. Moreover, with a new procedure of this kind, it would be beneficial to retain the flexibility provided by non-statutory guidance, which can be amended in the light of experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-23_para5"></a>Questions have been asked about precisely what categories of prisoner will be considered for it. That will be dealt with in the guidance and, to a certain extent, has been dealt with in the letter that everybody will see.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-23_para6"></a>What will be the criteria that the Prison Service will use to assess suitability for release under the scheme? The exact details of the risk assessment process are still being developed, but the type of factors that the Prison Service are likely to consider will include whether release on home detention curfew will pose an unacceptable risk to the public; whether there is a substantial risk of reoffending during the home curfew period and whether it is likely that the offender will fail to comply with the conditions of the curfew.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-23_para7"></a>Who will decide? It will be for the prison governor to decide.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-23_para8"></a>How can the Government claim that releasing these prisoners will not present a risk to the public? There will always be a risk of reoffending by these prisoners. Even if found unsuitable for release on this scheme, they will be automatically released at most two months later. Our job is therefore to minimise the risk they present. We <P>


<a name="column_1171"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1171</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>believe that the electronic monitoring will help to that extent but to go further would be injudicious at this stage.

<A NAME = "80303-23_para9"></a>I think that answers, albeit not completely, all the questions that have been raised. In those circumstances, I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

I am also grateful for his comment that the guidance, although not with us in Committee, will be published "shortly". I have been advised by colleagues who have previously served in a ministerial capacity about the variations between the definitions of "soon", "very soon" and now "shortly". As a novice at the Dispatch Box, I shall have to keep a log of how the definition comes to be proved to exist in the end. At the moment, I need to cover myself because I do not yet quite know what the noble and learned Lord means by "shortly". In those circumstances, I cannot promise not to come back to this matter at Report. However, in the meantime, I ask the permission of the Committee to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-23_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment would enable prisoners under 16 to be eligible for the early release provisions set out in Clauses 82 to 86 without having to be electronically tagged. In appropriate cases, school age children could be given early release under conditions other than tagging.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-23_para14"></a>There are particular problems attached to the tagging of children of school age. The young people concerned would have to attend school with a tag strapped to their wrist or ankle, marking them out as an offender. Whereas adults can easily conceal a tag beneath their clothing, schoolchildren involved in physical education and taking showers will find it difficult to hide their tag. Some children will find this very humiliating and embarrassing while others are likely to react by boasting about their tag and wearing it as a badge of honour, adopting a hard image to live up to it. This is the opposite of the attitudes towards which we are trying to steer young offenders.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-23_para15"></a>In view of the potential problems, it would make sense to allow discretion for school age children to be eligible for early release subject to supervision and conditions other than tagging. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I rise briefly to say that the noble Baroness's amendment is a matter of plain common sense. It would be potentially devastating for a child to have to go to school wearing a tag. In extreme cases it could even lead to suicide. I am aware that the <P>


<a name="column_1172"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1172</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>monitoring procedure does not have to be carried out during school hours, but the tag, as I understand it, will not be removable for the parts of the day when the child is at school. I hope very strongly that the Government will see fit to accept the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-23_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I recognise the points which have been well made, if I may say so, by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. It has to be recognised that there are special factors to be considered in applying curfew orders and electronic monitoring to juvenile offenders. We do not want to exclude the opportunity of using this on under 16 year-olds, but further work needs to be done.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-23_para16"></a>I hope it is of assistance to the Committee if I say that, in order to research these sensitive matters more fully, we have started to pilot in Norfolk and Manchester the use of curfews imposed as a sentence under the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 for 10 to 15 year-olds. Obviously, that will not be the work of a couple of weekends. It is due to end in the summer of 1999. After that, we will evaluate their success and appropriateness for this age group.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-23_para17"></a>In order for the lessons to be learnt and to give due weight to what has been said, we intend to introduce at the earliest opportunity a government amendment which will allow for the introduction of the home detention curfew for juvenile offenders to be delayed until the outcomes of these trial projects have been fully evaluated. In order that all juveniles are treated on an equal basis, the phased introduction would apply to all those aged 10 to 17. The amendment was well explained and I hope that our response is satisfactory.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-23_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, for his support for the amendment and I thank the Minister for his response, which I think is acceptable.

<P>

<A NAME = "80303-24_para4"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 84 shall stand part of the Bill?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Belstead: </B>   I wish to ask a question about Clause 84. Does subsection (1) of Clause 84 mean that short-term prisoners will be recalled henceforth, when the Bill becomes law, by the Parole Board and not by the courts? If I have that right, does subsection (1) also mean that a short-term prisoner henceforth can be recalled for not complying with the terms of his or her release licence whereas now a short-term prisoner must have reoffended in order to be recalled? I am perfectly happy if the Minister would like to write to me on that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-24_para5"></a>I raise it because, if I have it right, Clause 84 marks a very substantial step forward with regard to the recall of prisoners. If I am not too far out of order, perhaps I may also say that Clause 85 undoubtedly marks a very substantial step forward with regard to the recall of all prisoners. That clause, which the Deputy Chairman of Committees will be calling in just a moment, shows that the Government have observed a major lacuna in the present arrangements and are putting it right by providing that a prisoner who has been recalled will, under the Bill, be released at the three-quarters point of his sentence, but under supervision to the end of his sentence, which is not the case at the present time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-24_para6"></a>I raise these points because, in terms of public protection and the rehabilitation of prisoners, I believe that the Government have got Clauses 84 and 85 absolutely right. Speaking from the opposite side of the House from the Government, it gives me pleasure to be able very respectfully to say so.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for his remarks. He is correct in the description he gives of the effect of Clause 84. I should point out that there are transitional provisions in Schedule 8 to the Bill to enable Clause 84 to be introduced later than other provisions in this part of the Bill. His remarks on Clause 85 were not a question but a congratulation. While I am on my feet, perhaps I may indicate that the letter I was so generously offering to send everyone--the letter of 29th January 1998 from my noble friend Lord Williams of Mostyn to the noble Lord, Lord Henley--is in the Library and so can be looked at.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
After Clause 89, insert the following new clause--
<BR>
(" .--(1) Section 16 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997 (designated life prisoners) shall have effect and shall be deemed always to have had effect with the amendments made by subsections (2) and (3) below.
<BR>
(2) In subsection (2), at the beginning, there shall be inserted the words "Except in a case to which subsection (3A) or (3B) below applies,".
<BR>
(3) After subsection (3), there shall be inserted the following subsections--
<BR>
"(3A) This subsection applies in a case where a person--
<BR>
(a) was sentenced, prior to 20th October 1997, in respect of a murder committed by him before he attained the age of 18 years; and
<BR>
(b) has been released on licence, other than under section 3 of the 1993 Act, whether before or on that date.
<BR>
(3B) This subsection applies in a case where a person--
<BR>
(a) was sentenced, prior to 20th October 1997, in respect of a murder committed by him before he attained the age of 18 years; and
<BR>
(b) has been released on licence, other than under section 3 of the 1993 Act, after that date without his case having been considered under subsection (2) above.
<BR>
(3C) In a case to which subsection (3A) or (3B) applies, Part I of the 1993 Act shall apply as if the person were a designated life prisoner, within the meaning of section 2 of that Act, whose licence had been granted under subsection (4) of that section on his having served the designated part of his sentence.".
<BR>
(4) Where, prior to the commencement of this section, a certificate has been issued under subsection (2) of section 16 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997 in respect of a case to which subsection (3A) of that section applies, the certificate shall be disregarded.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-25_para0"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: In moving this amendment I shall also speak Amendment No. 307A. For all its complex appearance, Amendment No. 287A has a simple purpose, which can be summed up simply. It is to make good an omission from the transitional provisions contained in Section 16(2) of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997 dealing with persons sentenced for murder committed while they were under the age of 18. This amendment aligns them with the earlier transitional provisions made for discretionary life prisoners contained in the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993 in order to avoid possible unfairness to prisoners in a small number of cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-25_para1"></a>The amendment deals with under 18 years of age murderers who have already been released on licence. The 1997 Act gives under 18 years of age murderers who come within the definition of designated life prisoners the right to a review by the Parole Board for Scotland. The Parole Board (Scotland) Rules 1993, as amended, constitute the Parole Board for Scotland as a court for this purpose once the offenders have served the designated part of their sentence, as certified by the Lord Justice General.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-25_para2"></a>Under the current transitional provisions of the 1997 Act, an under 18 years of age murderer who has already been released under the statutory provisions which <P>


<a name="column_1180"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pre-dated the coming into effect of the relevant provisions of the 1997 Act must have a designated part certified by the Lord Justice General in order that the new provisions governing his release can apply to him. That is notwithstanding that at the time he was first released the Secretary of State and the then Lord Justice General considered that he had served a sufficient period to satisfy the criminal justice requirements for punishment and general deterrence.

<A NAME = "80303-25_para3"></a>Therefore, this amendment would provide that where an under 18 years of age murderer has been released by the Secretary of State under the pre-1997 Act procedures, he will be deemed to have served the designated part of his sentence for the purposes of the new procedures. That means that the Lord Justice General does not require to set a designated part and arrangements thereby mirror the transitional arrangements made for discretionary life prisoners. The amendment further provides that in any relevant case in which the Lord Justice General has made a certificate setting the designated part, it shall be disregarded. This ensures that all the transitional prisoners gain the benefit of the amendment. To that extent the amendment provides for retrospective application.

<A NAME = "80303-25_para4"></a>Amendment No. 307A is consequential to the new arrangements. I beg to move.

Section 18(2) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 was amended by Section 47 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997.

<P>
<A NAME="80303-27_spmin3"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Baroness Hayman) </B>  rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 23rd February be approved [24th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-27_para19"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this order covers all the detailed provisions needed to enable the London referendum to take place on 7th May in accordance with the provisions of the Greater London Authority (Referendum) Act 1998. As will be evident, the order is neither a lightweight nor a simple document, but a draft was made available in the Library of the House during the later stages of the Act and I hope that it has proved useful.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-27_para20"></a>In preparing the order, we have drawn heavily on the valuable precedents set by the Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Act 1997. The supplementary provisions worked well in that legislation; indeed, noble Lords will recall that they were specifically debated and approved by this House as a schedule to the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-27_para21"></a>Of course, in London there are special circumstances because we are combining the referendum poll with the local elections. We have had extensive consultations with returning officers, chief executives and electoral administrators at all stages in drafting this order and I would like to support the comments made earlier today by my honourable friend the Minister for London in thanking these people for all their hard work. They have made a major contribution to our preparations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-27_para22"></a>The order as a whole takes the usual local election procedures and adapts them for the purposes of the referendum. This approach gives the referendum procedures the usual protections afforded by election law, while also making it possible for the London borough council elections to be held at the same time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-27_para23"></a>At first glance, the order appears rather complex, but that is not the case as in many places much of it amounts to little more than changing the word "election" to "referendum". However, as I have said, the order contains a number of provisions particular to the referendum and I shall explain the most significant in a little detail.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-27_para24"></a>Article 7 of the order sets out who will act as returning officers for the referendum. This would be the returning officer in the local council election for each London borough.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-27_para25"></a>Article 9 sets out the form for the back of the ballot paper. It is very similar to that used in local elections and follows the form used in previous referendums. The wording on the front of the ballot paper is something about which we had a great deal of debate in this House, and is as prescribed in the schedule to the Greater London Authority (Referendum) Act 1998.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-27_para26"></a>We have held careful consultations on the form of the ballot paper with chief executives, electoral administrators and in particular with the Royal National Institute for the Blind--for whose help we are indebted.
<P>


<a name="column_1189"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1189</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-27_para27"></a>As a result we have devised a ballot paper which I am told is a fine shade of daffodil yellow and uses a large and bold typeface. I am sure that noble Lords will agree that the design is clear and comprehensible; it is intended to make sure that the referendum ballot paper is able to be read without difficulty by almost everybody. I am placing copies of the proposed ballot papers in the Library of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-27_para28"></a>Article 10 deals with counting the votes. The principal Act provided for the appointment of a chief counting officer for London and of counting officers to count the votes in each borough. It places on those counting officers the normal requirements to make arrangements for the count and gives them the powers to enable them to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-27_para29"></a>Finally, as I indicated earlier, the adaptations made in Articles 12 and 13, and the schedules associated with them, make all the necessary amendments to representation of the people legislation to enable the referendum to go ahead. The adaptations made are broadly equivalent to those in the schedule to the Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Act 1997.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-27_para30"></a>The order follows a well precedented formula which draws upon the valuable work done in the recent Scottish and Welsh referendums. We have consulted extensively with experienced returning officers and others in preparing these considered proposals and have sought to make the whole process as open as possible. The order is essentially a technical measure, but we believe that it will enable an efficient and smooth referendum to take place on 7th May. I commend it to the House.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-28_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for explaining various of the order's provisions. I should like to ask just a few questions which I am sure I could have answered for myself had I devoted more attention to the fine print of the order. I am afraid that there has been a little laziness on my part.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para0"></a>Article 9, to which the Minister referred, relates to the number printed on the back of the ballot paper and counterfoil. Can the Minister confirm that the same provisions with regard to official marks will apply to both the ballot for the referendum and that for the local elections? I am not seeking to make particular comments about perforations, but I am anxious to be assured that voters will not be required to check for different things when they enter a polling station. We know what happened at Winchester and on other occasions. My concern is merely that there are not different procedures.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para1"></a>I have some minor questions relating to Schedule 2. The back of the ballot paper is to carry a reference to the name of the electoral ward in the borough. I understand that it is intended to announce the count for each borough at that borough--in other words, the public will know how each borough has voted in the referendum. What is the purpose of having the name of the ward on the ballot paper? Is it intended that the count shall be detailed on a ward-by-ward basis?
<P>


<a name="column_1190"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column 1190</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para2"></a>Why is it intended that the same ballot box should be used, given that that will mean that counting officers have the job of separating the ballot papers? I am sure that the matter has been discussed with returning officers, but simply as a matter of procedure I am interested in understanding why it is thought that that is more satisfactory than attempting to have separate ballot boxes. I recognise the problems that are likely to arise if even one or two ballot papers are placed in the wrong box. Inevitably, the whole lot has to be emptied.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para3"></a>My final comment relates to Part I(7) of Schedule 2 and to applications for postal and proxy votes. I rather laboured the point during our debates on the Bill, and I am grateful to note that I need not have done so because the provision is here. Indeed, the Minister gave assurances to that effect during the passage of the Bill. I am glad that only one application will be required.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-28_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may add the thanks of these Benches to the Minister for her explanation and presentation of the order. Our only comment is to express our sadness that there are not to be two questions. However, we debated that at earlier stages. We wish the referendum well and we shall watch with the greatest of interest to see what the people of London decide.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-28_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to both noble Baronesses for their comments and for their welcome for the procedures that we have established.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para4"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked about the numbers on the back of the ballot papers. I can confirm that the provisions for official marks will be the same for both polls, so there will not be the problem to which she alluded. As I understand it, the inclusion of the name of the ward on the backs of individual ballot papers is at the request of the returning officers and is for their own administrative reasons. I confirm that the count will be on a borough, not on a ward-by-ward, basis. That will be the way in which the results are announced. There was considerable concern that it should be possible for borough results to be seen. There is no intention of sub-dividing the results to ward level.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para5"></a>On the issue of the two ballot boxes, the noble Baroness is absolutely right. Returning officers expressed the view, from their experience, that the likelihood--indeed, the certainty--that some ballot papers would be put in the wrong box was such that having two boxes would not simplify matters, but would complicate them. It was felt that a full separation would be needed anyway. As I understand it, when two polls have been held on the same day in the past, it has been found to be more efficient to have one ballot box and to carry out the separation afterwards.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para6"></a>I was grateful for the remarks of the noble Baroness about the provisions for applying for absent votes. As I have said many times in the House, the Government hope that the campaign on absent votes will be successful and will filter through to other elections.

Except in one important respect, our proceedings will be exactly as in a normal Committee of the Whole House. We shall go through the Bill clause by clause; noble Lords will speak standing; all noble Lords are free to attend and participate; and the proceedings will be recorded in Hansard. The one difference is that the House has agreed that there shall be no Divisions in a Grand Committee. Any issue on which agreement cannot be reached should be considered again at the Report stage when, if necessary, a Division will be called. Unless, therefore, an amendment is likely to be agreed to, it should be withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 8, at beginning insert--
<BR>
("( ) The Bank of England shall henceforth be known as the Central Bank of the United Kingdom ("the Bank").").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 1, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 74, and 75 and to Clause 41 stand part of the Bill. I am deeply disappointed to hear that I cannot carry on my roller-coaster of victories on behalf of Scotland that I started yesterday evening, but I shall have to have some forbearance in this Committee stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para12"></a>I have put down this series of amendments for two reasons. One is that the name of the central bank of this country--of Great Britain and Northern Ireland--being the Bank of England does seem a little unusual in the newly devolved geography of our constitution. Secondly, it allows me to ask what, if any, parts of this Bill will fall to be devolved to the Scottish parliament. I shall start with the second point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para13"></a>As far as I can see, none of its parts will fall to be devolved--they are all reserved--but I asked the question at Second Reading. I rather hoped that the noble Lord and his officials have been able to look through the Bill and decide whether, indeed, any parts <P>


<a name="column_CWH2"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH2</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are to be devolved. The Scottish parliament will, of course, have considerably more powers than the Welsh assembly or than any potential Northern Irish assembly which may be introduced. My question is therefore directed largely at the Scottish parliament, but it would also be helpful if the Minister would indicate whether any parts of this Bill will be devolved responsibilities of the Welsh assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para14"></a>The Scottish parliament will have considerable economic powers, and I shall come to those issues later in the Bill. It seems to me that, in every piece of legislation that we now pass, we ought to have a clear statement from the Government as to what, in any Bill we are discussing, will be devolved in the future so that we know whether this is the last time your Lordships' House and the other place will have the chance to address the issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para15"></a>If all the matters in this Bill are reserved, as I suspect they are, I wonder, as a second question, whether any of those matters will be the subject of the various concordats which I understand are to be drawn up between the United Kingdom Government in Westminster and the Scottish government in Edinburgh. I am not entirely sure whether the Scottish parliament will meet in a brewery or in the former headquarters of Strathclyde Regional Council. That seems to be the subject of considerable debate in Scotland at the moment, as indeed does the question of a knighthood for Mr. Sean Connery. Those are, however, side issues, and I am sure I would be out of order if I developed them any further. We ought to have a straightforward answer, and it should be quite easy for the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, to give a fairly straightforward answer about the position of this Bill following devolution.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para16"></a>The first reason I raise this matter is the reason I mentioned as to why the central bank of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland--collectively known as the United Kingdom--is not known as the central bank of the United Kingdom. Every Scottish schoolboy knows, but I am not entirely sure whether every English schoolboy knows, that the Bank of England was founded by a Scot. But then anybody who goes into the Square Mile of the City today will find that the place is, by and large, run by Scots. However, that is a different issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para17"></a>It is interesting that of all the European Union states, the United Kingdom is the only one whose central bank does not carry a clear identification of the state for which it is the central bank. The Bank of England has fulfilled the role of the central bank of the United Kingdom since the Bank Charter Act 1883. In 1832 a so-called secret committee on the Bank Charter focused on the desirability of one bank of issue for Great Britain and whether that should be the Bank of England. The committee report resulted in the Bank Charter Act 1833. The Bank Charter Act 1844 prohibited new banks of issue in the UK and that piece of legislation has been revised many times, most recently in the 1987 Banking Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para18"></a>The Bill before us today introduces some further statutory provisions for the Bank of England. It contains reform of its constitution, of the duties of the court of <P>


<a name="column_CWH3"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH3</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>directors and makes new provisions relating to funding, the accounts and profits of the Bank. Most importantly, it sets up a Monetary Policy Committee within the Bank. That Monetary Policy Committee is given a statutory basis for the operational responsibility in relation to monetary policy: the setting of interest rates, in fact, as far as most ordinary people and most business people will be concerned. The Bill sets out the framework in accordance with which the Bank's monetary policy functions are to be exercised. I suspect that that is what will probably take us most of today to discuss.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para19"></a>It seems to me, as I said on Second Reading, that what we are looking at today is the first step in the process towards the independence of the Bank of England consistent with being a member of the single currency. As I believe I said on Second Reading--if I can remember the phrase--if the Prime Minister ever plucks up the courage of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to join the single currency, quite clearly we shall have to have a second Bill to make the Bank totally independent and not just of operational independence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para20"></a>It has been suggested to me by, among other bodies, the Law Society of Scotland that in this new circumstance where the Bank will have a much greater role as the central bank of the United Kingdom within the European monetary system and where that role will be played out in the new geography of the constitution of the United Kingdom, we should perhaps ask ourselves whether it is not time that the central bank of the United Kingdom should be called just that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para21"></a>After all, we are to have a government in Scotland--with perhaps limited powers but nonetheless with powers. I am not sure whether I can call it a government, but we are to have an organisation in Wales which will take many of the decisions regarding Wales--and not here at Westminster. It does seem to me that many people in Europe might find it rather odd, especially when they find that in Brussels they are dealing with a government of Wales and a government of Scotland, that the central bank covering those two countries is not called the central bank of the United Kingdom but is called the Bank of England.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-28_para22"></a>I know the historical precedents are all there and everybody is probably well aware of what the Bank of England does at present. However, in the new geography of the constitution of our country, the central bank will hold a new position, initially through its Monetary Policy Committee in deciding monetary policy and eventually--and I suspect eventually will not be too long delayed--in being an independent central bank according to the Maastricht Treaty, in order to allow us to take part in the euro. I make no observations about whether we should or not. I just see that as being the direction of government policy. The Minister really ought to address the question of whether we should take this opportunity to call our central bank what indeed it is--the central bank of the United Kingdom. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80303-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I guess that the noble Lord introduced this amendment in order to talk about Scotland, which I will not talk about. However, I assumed that it was also <P>


<a name="column_CWH4"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH4</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>relevant to the second point he raised, which was our membership of EMU. As the noble Lord knows, I am in favour of joining EMU and still take the view that I would rather we joined earlier than later.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-29_para0"></a>The country which is the member of the European Union is the United Kingdom; as far as I know, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and England are not members of the European Union. This is a technical point, which leads to my question. It is clear that this Bill does not meet the requirements for EMU independence of a central bank. What is interesting, although academic--and I do not use the word "academic" in the pejorative sense ever but in the sense meaning important--is whether there is anything in the various treaties that we have signed that will oblige us to call our central bank the central bank of the member country, namely the United Kingdom. I do not know whether my noble friend has an answer to that. Do we have an obligation to give it the national title, or in theory could it be called the "Bank of England", even though England is not a member of the European Union? I look forward to the answer to that question.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-29_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I would like to support this amendment. I too have the problem of the Law Society of Scotland explaining a number of points which seem similarly technical to me. What the noble Lord, Lord Peston, has just said is absolutely right--whether we will be in or not, it would be right that the bank should be called that which describes the country of which it is the central bank. That makes sense.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-29_para1"></a>There is perhaps also a political point--with a very small "p"--which is that people in Scotland had not noticed until comparatively lately that there is anomaly in calling the Bank of England the Bank of England. They probably did not realise the extent to which it had to do with them until it began to set interest rates. Since that has happened there has been quite a lot of comment that it is rather an odd thing that the bank setting the interest rates for all of us should be called the Bank of England, which in a way is understandable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-29_para2"></a>With this matter, as with so many others, points which have been taken for granted with the United Kingdom will be highlighted as devolution happens. That is because of the discussion on reserved powers. People will see a distinction between the powers that are reserved and the powers that are devolved, and doubtless there will be a good deal of argument about that. So far it is not very great and the facts are emerging in the other place as reserved powers are discussed, but it will become an issue. Perhaps it is a bit unwise not to make a change. I can quite see that it will be a great shame for a great many people, because the Bank of England is known very lovingly as "Auntie" and everyone will wonder whether Auntie is the same with a changed name; and I hope the Government will take this point.
<P>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-29_para3"></a>I deal first with the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish. He is smiling now, as he smiles when he moves amendments, for the very obvious reason that he is enjoying himself, and quite right too because he is no longer in government. He is going to be in opposition for a long time; he might as well enjoy it. May I add one or two questions to those of my noble friend Lord Peston? I share his view about joining as early as possible, although he did not quite put it in that way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-29_para4"></a>I should like to ask my noble friend whether it is government policy that we should join a single currency and, therefore, the European Central Bank, as early as possible. I am sure that is government policy, although my own definition of it might be somewhat different, not necessarily from that of the Chancellor, but from that of the Prime Minister. I would be glad if my noble friend would confirm that as government policy. He need not wait for notes, he will know the answer.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-29_para5"></a>I hope he will also confirm that this Bill will need to be overtaken by the event of our joining and becoming part of the European Central Bank, because there are matters within the Bill--and, I hope, some others that we would propose putting in it--that would not be compatible with our membership. I should like him to confirm that when he says he is not accepting the amendment of the noble Lord, as I assume he will. I myself, however, would have no objection whatever to it being called the "Bank of the United Kingdom". I have no problem with that amendment personally and make that clear, although I gather it cannot be pressed to a vote today, which was never the intention of the noble Lord who I see smiling. Incidentally, the Select Committee, which I have the honour to chair and of which the noble Lord, Lord Boardman is a member, went to Frankfurt last week and is going to Bonn tomorrow. We have looked at the European Central Bank in some depth and as far as I know, there is nothing in there concerning what the different national central banks should be called.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-29_para6"></a>I would imagine that those who set up the European Central Bank could not give a damn what the national banks were called! At the end of the day--and indeed I put this question last week, in Frankfurt--I am not sure what the role of the national central banks will be. They will not have much of a role but they will remain in existence. Again, perhaps my noble friend will confirm that. I assume there will remain national central banks, whether they be called "of England" or "of the UK", even when we have a European Central Bank. For the moment, I will simply ask my main question to my noble friend, that I assume this Bill will fall once we join a European Central Bank.

<P>
<A NAME="80303-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Boardman: </B>   I must say that I find convincing the arguments of my noble friend but, frankly, I am worried about them. First, if EMU, to which the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, referred, should come about--and there are grave reservations over it--there will need to be so many changes that the name of what we call our central bank will be a minor issue. Secondly, we should not forget what the Bank of England really means. <P>


<a name="column_CWH6"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>It is a hallmark of respectability and responsibility throughout the world. I should personally be very sorry to see the disappearance of its name. It means much more for the United Kingdom as a whole, around the world, than any name we might produce. Nevertheless, having said that, I must accept that the arguments put forward by my noble friend are convincing.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Montague of Oxford: </B>   One can quite understand that people outside England are hoping there might be a different title. However, I am mindful of the tremendous reputation throughout the world that the Bank of England already possesses, as well as the confusion that might come about. We know that we are to have a Central Bank for Europe; I do not think we shall talk about the "Central Bank of the United Kingdom". We shall probably go in for shorthand, and call it simply the "Central Bank", and we shall not know which we are talking about!
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-29_para7"></a>When I am in America, I am often asked to explain how it is we always refer to Queen Elizabeth of England. I have no doubt that provides irritation in some places, but we do not seek to amend it. I suggest that we stay with this great reputation we already hold and do nothing to harm that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-29_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   It is always nice to start off the Committee stage with a wide-ranging debate and it is particularly nice when, from time to time, it grazes on the margins of the subject matter of the Bill, as this debate has. For that I am very grateful. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, is still on an emotional and psychological high after having achieved 50 per cent. victories with his huge majority in this House. If he thinks that is good statistically, then I leave him happy in that thought and I do not seek to challenge it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-29_para8"></a>I shall deal with the serious matters that have been raised before I go on to talk about the name of the Bank. The serious matters are, of course, that there are no matters within the Bill which are to be devolved. As the noble Lord recognised, they are all reserved to Westminster. There is no likelihood of any concordat between the Scottish parliament and the Westminster Parliament on any of the matters covered by the Bill. The Bill is concerned with one currency and a single set of financial markets. Although I recognise that all legislation going through Parliament now has to be consistent eventually with devolution, and I have been grappling with that problem on the National Lottery Bill concurrently with this Bill, no such question arises on the Bill itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-29_para9"></a>In answer to my noble friend Lord Peston, we can call the Bank what we like as far as the European Union is concerned. We can call it the Bank of Brobdingnag, and they would not be worried about it. The European Monetary Institute has given its opinion on the contents of the Bill, and has not seen fit to make any comment on the name of the Bank.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-29_para10"></a>My noble friend Lord Barnett seeks to tempt me into a restatement of government policy which would be more precise about the timing of our joining of EMU, but I shall not succumb to that temptation. As he knows <P>


<a name="column_CWH7"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH7</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>perfectly well, the Government believe that in principle British membership of a successful single currency would be beneficial to Britain and to Europe. The key factor is whether the economic benefits of joining for business and industry are clear and unambiguous. If they are, there is no constitutional bar to British membership of EMU. That is not to say sooner rather than later; that is a statement of fact.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-29_para11"></a>My noble friend Lord Barnett also asked me to reassure him that the Bill will not fall when we eventually join EMU--those were his words. I can confirm that it will require amendment, but the basic provisions of the Bill will not be changed as a result. It will require substantial amendment. It is not designed to conform to the Maastricht criteria, which we shall consider with later amendments. Of course the Bank of England will remain in existence. It has many roles other than that which is concerned with European monetary union, and, again, we are free to debate those as we go through the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-29_para12"></a>As to the issue of the name itself, I was glad to hear from the noble Lord, Lord Boardman, the true voice of conservatism. I am slightly worried about the headlong rush of the Hague opposition into new conservative, new iconoclasm. They are perfectly willing to throw away 304 years of distinguished history. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay, gave us a little bit of history himself about the Bank of England, which was very welcome. But the Bank has a reputation after 300 years, and to make a change of this kind, which is neither strictly necessary nor, as everybody agrees, particularly important, would not be of any great value. If we were going to do so, surely we should do it in anticipation of EMU. Should we not call it the "Central Bank of some offshore regions of the European Union", which would have the great advantage of having the acronym CENSOR, which I commend to the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish? If it ain't broke, don't fix it--let us leave it alone.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80303-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am grateful to noble Lords who took part in this short debate. I am grateful to the Minister for confirming what I thought was the position: that all the matters in the Bill are indeed reserved in the devolutionary settlement, and that there will be no need for concordat in any of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-30_para0"></a>I fully accept the point made by the noble Lord, my noble friend Lord Boardman and the noble Lord, Lord Montague, about the position of the Bank of England, and the fact that it is known throughout the world and its reputation, and so on. I fully accept that and I see the force of their argument. However, I must say to the Minister that to argue that if it has been running for 300 years nothing should be done to change it comes ill from a Government who are changing the Constitutional Settlement and the Treaty of Union which has been running for something like 300 years. If the Government are truly radical, they should be looking at <P>


<a name="column_CWH8"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH8</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>all the ancient traditions and not just the Treaty of Union, which some of us feel is even more sacrosanct than the Bank of England ought to be.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I think the noble Lord would enjoy this afternoon and tomorrow afternoon rather more if he recognised that the Bill makes substantive changes to the role of the Bank of England. We are interested in the proper conduct of economic, fiscal and monetary policy, which is why we are making changes. What we are not doing is making trivial changes to the name.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I fully understand. In fact I said in my introduction that we were making major changes, which is why I thought we ought to look at the name, especially as the major change, in my view and in the view of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, and the noble Lord, Lord Peston, is but an introductory change to the greater change to come when we move to be part of the European single currency. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, should not dismiss this too much out of hand.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-30_para1"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, made some telling points about the Scottish position. One source of great irritation to the people of Scotland is to come south and find that Royal Bank of Scotland bank notes are not accepted here. In the new geography we are creating in the United Kingdom, I suspect that by the time the noble Lord comes back with the next Bill to make the Bank of England truly independent there will be a devolved government in Scotland. He will then find that it will be a little more than just myself and the Law Society of Scotland who will be asking, "Isn't it time we looked at the reality of this and called the Bank what it really is, not the central Bank of England, but the 'Central Bank of the United Kingdom'?".
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-30_para2"></a> Whether the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, will be discussing these matters two or three years down the road, who knows? We may have been translated to other responsibilities. But if we are, I hope he will remember my prophecy, that the government of Scotland will be suggesting that this ought to be changed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-30_para3"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord for his assurances about the position of the Bill vis-a-vis devolution and for his understanding at least of the importance of the Bank in the economic life of the whole of the United Kingdom. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

Page 18, line 9, leave out ("3") and insert ("5").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-30_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: In Schedule 1 we are dealing with the composition of the court of directors. I do not want to make too much of this because further on we come to the terms of engagement of the members of the <P>


<a name="column_CWH9"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH9</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Monetary Policy Committee where this issue is much more important. I have separated it exactly for that reason.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-30_para8"></a>The court of directors is important, although later on we are going to tease out just exactly what its role is going to be vis-a-vis the Monetary Policy Committee. At present the court is composed of people whose appointment is on a four-year term basis. The Government propose here as elsewhere to change it to a three-year term. That is quite a short term. Indeed, it is much shorter than the life of Parliament. In the course of the schedule it is suggested, quite rightly, that the Government will look to stagger some of the appointments. They will not make them all for one year to begin with. Perhaps the Minister can give us some of the Government's thoughts on how they will do it. Will they make a few of the appointments for one year, a few more for two years, and a few more for three years in order to get to the position that I believe is necessary? I welcome what the Chancellor of the Exchequer said in the Official Report in the other place on 20th May:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Court will be substantially reformed, so that it is able to take account of the full range of industrial and business views in this country, and for the first time it will be fully representative of the whole of the United Kingdom".--[Official Report, Commons, 20/5/97; cols. 508-9.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-30_para9"></a>Given what I said in my first amendment, I obviously welcome that. Indeed, five of the recent appointments very much accord with the Chancellor's view.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-30_para10"></a>We have Mr. Graham Hawkes from Wales, Roy Baillie from Northern Ireland, and we have Mr. Jim Stretton from Standard Life from Scotland. Although two of the others do not currently live in Scotland, they both have their roots there--Sheila MacKechnie of the Consumers' Association and Mr. John Neil, the Unipart boss. I am sure we could add some more names, reflecting the whole of Britain. In fact Mr. John Neil, although he does not reflect Scotland now, reflects other parts of Britain. I welcome these appointments, and I welcome the decision of the Chancellor being brought into reality to broaden the geographical base and the spread of interest of members of the court. I would like to see a similar spread of interest, and I notice that the noble Lord, Lord Montague, also wants to see it in relation to the Monetary Policy Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-30_para11"></a>In its preliminary report on corporate governance, the Hampel Committee recommended that directors should submit themselves for re-election at regular intervals and at least every three years. I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, might pray that in aid. However, we are not talking about quite the same thing, because we are not talking about re-election by a company but we are actually talking about reappointment, and about the control by the Chancellor of a bank which is supposedly moving towards independence. That will be the theme of many of our discussions on amendments this afternoon.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-30_para12"></a>In the court's terms, three years does not seem to me to be long enough to show proper independence. It gives the Chancellor the opportunity to weed out anyone <P>


<a name="column_CWH10"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH10</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whose views turn out not to accord with those of the Government. Indeed, given the majority down the corridor, I do not think I could be accused of straying into pessimism about my party's position when I say that whoever the Chancellor appoints this year is likely--whether the appointments are for one year, two years or even three years--to be in a position to sack them or reappoint them before this Parliament comes to an end. That calls into question, at least in my mind, the independence of the Bank from the Chancellor.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-30_para13"></a>I suggest to the Minister that it might be worth considering a longer term of engagement for the members of the court, so that at least some of them--perhaps not all of them--will inevitably spill over into another parliament. One Chancellor in one parliament will not be able to clear out the whole lot if he discovers that his appointments do not sing from the hymn sheet from which he thought they should.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-30_para14"></a>I accept that the court is not as important as the Monetary Policy Committee. It is not quite the same issue as I believe it is for the Monetary Policy Committee, but it is nevertheless important. It is a reflection of the independence of the Bank. I welcome the decision about appointing members to the court representing a wider spread in Britain that perhaps we have had heretofore. That would be greatly helped if the Government would accept my amendment of five years, or even put in their own amendment of four years, for the term of office for the court of the Bank. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Montague of Oxford: </B>   In some areas, we are thinking along the same lines. I am just rather nervous about this idea. Attention has rightly been drawn to the distinguished members of the court, but they are distinguished because they are already well into their careers. If we appoint them for five years, I am worried that we could well have within the court a very large number who have retired, although I have not looked at the statistics of this. It is wise to bear in mind that there is nothing to stop these people being reappointed. There is the political risk, to which reference has been made, but I venture to suggest that the noble Lord may be over-stating that. For example, as regards quangos, we do not say that no quango leader should be appointed for less than five years. We should bear very much in mind the flexibility that comes with three years, and the possibility of reappointment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I notice that the noble Lord has not explained why it is different from the amendment moved by his party in Committee in the House of Commons. The existing provision is that members of the court should serve for four years. When we proposed in the Bill that it should be reduced to three, his colleagues in another place suggested that it should stay at four. He has not given any particular justification for it going up to five, but it is a sign of welcome flexibility of which I am sure we shall see more this afternoon and tomorrow.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH11"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH11</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-30_para15"></a>The reasons are straightforward for reducing the term. These are issues of corporate governance which are pretty widely accepted nowadays. The noble Lord anticipated me by quoting the Hampel Committee:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"All directors should be required to submit themselves for re-election at regular intervals and at least every three years". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-30_para16"></a>That seems to us a perfectly good justification in itself for what is being proposed. We have to balance the possible conflict of having people there long enough to gain experience to learn on the job with ensuring that we have an opportunity to get rid of people after their terms of office are completed if they are not pulling their weight--not so much if they disagree. They are there to disagree and their disagreements will be well known, but if they are not acting actively as members of the court it is right that without undue formality it will be possible simply not to renew their terms of office.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-30_para17"></a>The noble Lord asked me about staggering appointments to get a staged turnround. All the existing members will be reappointed for the balance of their existing terms which vary in expiry date from 1999 to 2001, and then the new members, as the Chancellor announced on 18th February, will have terms designed to ensure that roughly equal numbers of appointments expire each year. I believe that that meets the noble Lord's objective.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-30_para18"></a>This is not an issue of fundamental principle. However, we believe that, on balance, the interests of good corporate governance lead to a term of three years as proposed.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for his reply and the noble Lord, Lord Montague, for the points that he made. They are reasonable points. Having sat on Government Benches and discussed these things, it does come down to a matter of judgment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para0"></a>I have to say to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, that paragraph 8 in the schedule gives the Bank, with the consent of the Chancellor, the power to remove people who do not attend or are unable or unfit to discharge their functions, so the idea that somebody could be stuck on the court without attending and pulling his weight in that way is not really a good argument.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para1"></a>However, I appreciate the point that has been made about the three years. I put in five years rather than four years simply because I was attempting to be logical with the appointment of the governor three or four lines above. If the noble Lord had given me four years I would have been more than happy to accept that. The point is that three years is rather short.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para2"></a>As I have said, I am not sure where the election is. The electorate seems to be about one man, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, unless there is to be a cabal in No. 11 Downing Street and various Ministers are to be brought in and they are to have a vote on who should be on the court. To describe it as a "re-election" is not strictly accurate; "reappointment" perhaps, but not re-election. I understand that people can be reappointed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para3"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the position. There does seem to be a major difference between the court and the Monetary Policy Committee <P>

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 3, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 28, and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, will speak to Amendment No. 24, which all cover the same subject.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para8"></a>The problem here is that there are a number of amendments that try to address the same problem; that is, the independence of the Monetary Policy Committee. The way in which this particular amendment is framed includes the court but, if it is of any help to the Minister, I am not addressing the substance of these amendments to the court. I wish to address our attention to Clause 13 of the Bill and the Monetary Policy Committee. Because the court is not nearly such an important body as far as economic and monetary policy is concerned, I am content to leave it the way it is. However, the Monetary Policy Committee is entirely different.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para9"></a>As I said at Second Reading--a number of other noble Lords drew attention to this also--the members of the Monetary Policy Committee are either appointed directly or indirectly by the Chancellor, who has his finger in every one of the pies. I refer to the Governor and the deputy governors, the two members appointed by the Governor after consultation, and the four members appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. A number of amendments, of which this is just the first, suggest that perhaps it would be better if the Monetary <P>


<a name="column_CWH13"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH13</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Policy Committee was less beholden to the Chancellor; less the creature of the Chancellor--or at least his creature on appointment and potentially his creature on reappointment if it does not perform in a way the Chancellor wants it to perform. That may not be because it performed badly, but that it performed in a different way because it has a different view of monetary policy than the Chancellor thought when he appointed it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para10"></a>In the other place the Treasury Select Committee came forward with an amendment--agreed, I believe unanimously, by all the members of that committee, Labour and Conservative, and indeed with a Labour Chairman--to say that there should be confirmatory hearings. There was considerable discussion in the other place as to whether it would be a case of nodding through after a hearing, or whether it would be confirmatory hearings as per the hearings in the United States where, if the Treasury Select Committee said, "We do not like this person", it could black-ball them, and there are variations on that theme. I fully accept that to go down the American road would be a huge break with the traditions in this country but, on the other hand, granting the Monetary Policy Committee even operational independence is also a huge break in the way in which we have operated things in this country, because the Chancellor is no longer directly responsible for these matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para11"></a>If we go to the next step--and inevitably one cannot avoid looking at the next step--the Monetary Policy Committee will have even greater independence, and therefore the appointment of people to the Monetary Policy Committee will be of huge concern to the monetary and fiscal policy of the United Kingdom and to the well-being of almost all the people of the United Kingdom. It is important therefore that we look at how the members of the Monetary Policy Committee will be appointed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para12"></a>I have changed the amendment a little simply to introduce the fact that perhaps some of your Lordships have enough expertise and interest in these matters to want to play a part in any hearings that may be conducted by both Houses of Parliament. I should not like the poor people suggested by the Chancellor to have to go through two grillings, one from the Treasury Committee of the other place and another from a committee set up in this House. I therefore suggested that we have a Joint Committee of both Houses to look at the nominees and question them, and to explore whether or not they meet the criteria of Clause 13(4) of the Bill. If they do not meet the criteria in the opinion of the Joint Committee, it should give reasons why they do not. It would then approve or not approve and report to both Houses, which report the Chancellor would receive as well. The implication here is that if the Chancellor is advised that the committee does not approve his nominee, he would not proceed with that nominee; but that if it approved, then of course he would proceed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para13"></a>The way Clause 13 is currently tabled gives the Chancellor considerable powers of patronage. There is not much accountability. We will explore what accountability there is to the court, but there will in fact be precious little. We believe that the Select Committee <P>


<a name="column_CWH14"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH14</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the other place and a suitable committee of this place joined together would be a proper forum in which to examine the people nominated by the Chancellor.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para14"></a>In the other place an amendment was moved by my right honourable and honourable friends, but there was also an amendment moved by the chairman of the Select Committee, who is a Labour Member. The Labour members of the Select Committee have not exactly been chosen from the potential rebels in this issue. I did not note, for example, the names of Mr. Austin Mitchell or Diane Abbott on the Treasury Select Committee, or indeed other Labour Members who are a little unhappy. It seemed to me to be a collection of people whom, in the nicest way, one could describe as pretty reasonable loyalists who could be expected to be kind to the Government. I am not complaining about the Government doing that; all governments try to do that if they possibly can. So the proposal from the Treasury Select Committee is made stronger by the fact that some of the Government's critics, as far as the monetary policy moves here are concerned, were not members of the Select Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, simply dealt with the Treasury Select Committee. Perhaps because I have been here a little longer, I decided to take the feelings of noble Lords into account and suggest a Joint Committee. Undoubtedly, the Treasury Select Committee will be able to call on the members of the Monetary Policy Committee and will be able to discuss matters with them. What it will not be able to do, however, is to say whether or not it approves of their appointment, which I accept is a major step for us in this country. Indeed, in the other place the Government made much of the fact that we were not asking for this to be done in relation to other quangos.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para16"></a>I know that there are many other important quangos in the country, but I honestly cannot think of a more important quango than the one we are setting up in the Monetary Policy Committee. It is very important. It will play a key role in the economic life of our country, and there ought to be some checks and balances on the Chancellor's ability to appoint his own nine good men, or women, and true. This is one suggestion as to how we might go about it. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="80303-31_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   Amendment No. 24, which seeks to do essentially the same as the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, equally has as its root the thought that the appointments that are here being made are among the most important public appointments which a Minister has to make. When one thinks of the absolute importance that Ministers or Chancellors in the past have given to the setting of the interest rate, the secrecy in which that has been shrouded and the importance with which that decision has been taken, we must recognise that this is not just any run-of-the-mill series of appointments. These really are important appointments. It is therefore important that the people who are appointed have the confidence of Parliament and, as far as possible, the confidence of the country.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para17"></a>As far as the country is concerned, it is probably the case that members of the Monetary Policy Committee will never be household names. However, one of the advantages of confirmation hearings is that they at least have some exposure to the public gaze, which at the moment they do not, and at a time when members are being appointed rather than a month--or, as may be the case, months--later when a decision is being made which changes interest rates.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para18"></a>I believe also that it is important that Parliament should feel that it has had a say in quizzing people who are appointed to this particular committee as well as, indeed, to other important public appointments. The very fact of having confirmation hearings will have some influence, or could do, on appointments at the margin. There is an idea, or concern, held by some people, that the Chancellor could put all his chums on this committee to obtain the result he wished for. However remote a possibility that may be--and one, I am sure, to which the current Chancellor would never fall prey--the very fact that the appointments have to stand public scrutiny at the point of appointment, rather than later on, may give him pause.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para19"></a>Again, at the margin, the Chancellor has to be made aware of any proposed change in the appointment and any decision to appoint someone else to the Monetary Policy Committee, rather than continuing with an existing member. If the Chancellor knows that that change is to be considered by the committee and the new appointment scrutinised, it may give him pause from standing down an independent-minded committee member.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para20"></a>As we have looked at the arguments for what seems to us a sensible and relatively modest change, which would enhance the credibility of this committee, we have tried to understand the reticence of the Government to agree to it. There seems to be an increasing tide of opinion in Parliament that confirmation hearings of various kinds are the way to proceed. It is interesting to note that not only do we now have the Treasury Select Committee proposing, in effect, confirmation hearings here, but as the Liaison Committee reported last year in another place, a number of committees are now doing this informally. The Defence Committee, for example, effectively has confirmation hearings for the Chief of Defence Procurement. There are also a number of other cases where Select Committees in the other House see this as being a sensible use of their authority and influence. This is an area of activity which will gain--and is gaining--support.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para21"></a>We have therefore looked to see what major arguments in principle the Government have adduced for not agreeing to that change at this stage. In another place, the Minister explained that the Government had an open mind, but that the issue needed more thought; that it should not be bolted on to the Bill. I always grimace at the idea of something needing more thought, particularly when it is not exactly a difficult or complicated issue. To say that the matter needs consideration is often, in my experience, a substitute for real thought. That does not, by itself, constitute a good reason for delay.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para22"></a>There is an argument that these poor characters might be questioned across too wide a range of their experience. Indeed, they might be asked about their private life--the John Maynard Keynes question, as it became known in another place. The Treasury Select Committee has already dealt with that point adequately by producing its report on confirmation hearings. That sets out exactly how it would constrain the areas of questioning, so that one was looking at the technical competence of the people, rather than their private lives, or their stances on monetary policy. To the extent that there was an argument about questioning, it has been answered.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para23"></a>It has been argued also that the confirmation hearings would give members of the committee the opportunity to get at the government of the day. Perish the thought that Select Committees should get at the government of the day, but I thought that was their purpose: to make the government of the day, and their nominees, justify themselves! I do not believe that is an adequate explanation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para24"></a>Finally, the paradoxical objection has been raised--having said that this is a major change and we should not rush--that it would be wrong to have the change without a whole raft of other confirmation hearings, across the whole range of public authorities and that it cannot be done alone. If one is to have any at all, a whole raft of public appointments must be dealt with. That seems to be extremely thin gruel.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para25"></a>If one believes, as we do, that it makes sense to have confirmation hearings for these appointments, one should go ahead and do it. Confirmation hearings for other public appointments could equally be made on their merits and we could have an evolutionary development that as changes occur in the structure of the appointments made by government, the whole question of confirmation hearings could be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. I am looking forward to the Minister's reply today, but I have not heard any compelling arguments as to why this change should not take place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para26"></a>I make one final point about the difference between our amendment and that of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish. It relates to the question of a Joint Committee between this House and another place, as opposed to the hearings being heard by the Treasury Select Committee alone. My first thought was that this was an extremely good idea, not least because of the experience which we see in the Committee today and elsewhere in this House. I have been persuaded in discussions with colleagues that given the role that this plays in respect of taxation and macro-economic policy is very limited and given that we do not have a committee which looks at economic policy across the board, it would be strange to select this small area and suddenly give the House an authority which it does not have in any other area of economic policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-31_para27"></a>While I believe it is an on-balance argument, we remain of the view that the most appropriate way of dealing with this at the moment would be to give power to the Treasury Select Committee to scrutinise these appointments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-32_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   In speaking to these amendments, I start with Amendment No. 24 in the name of the noble Lords, Lord Newby and Lord Taverne. I am loath to tell the other place what it should do. Therefore, I certainly reject their amendment. It is up to them to make what progress they can. In so far as the subject is tempting, it seems to me that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, is nearer to a position than noble Lords could come to, although it is not one that I would go along with.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-32_para0"></a>As I understand the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, certainly as it is written down, I would regard the central wording as "competence and personal independence". That is what he is about. In a sense he is implying that the Chancellor, whether the present one or one of his successors, would be prone to appoint people who are not competent, incompetent, not personally independent or biased in some critical way. It is an example of the state that this country has come to that what we say about present and future Chancellors could be tabled as an amendment to a Bill. In the old days, given a Committee of this sort, we would have taken it for granted that although they would certainly appoint people that they thought well of, they would appoint the best people. That does not mean that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, is wrong in worrying about these things.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-32_para1"></a>My view, however, proceeds along the following lines. For this to make sense, we have to ask ourselves whether in practice confirmatory hearings improve matters. Our main experience of confirmatory hearings is in the United States of America, and anybody who has seen those would walk a million miles before introducing anything like that into the British constitution; I certainly would.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-32_para2"></a>I am well passed this sort of thing now, but in my younger days, I would have liked to have been thought of as a possible member of the Monetary Policy Committee. But being the arrogant person I was and still am, the notion then that a group of Members of Parliament could remotely query me on my competence or independence would mean that I should not want to be considered as a candidate. I know that is arrogant, but I am not alone in being the kind of person in this Committee who might take that view. We may have confirmatory hearings in this country because we occasionally make errors of that kind, but I would not like us to go down that path.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-32_para3"></a>What I would like to see happen--and I believe it can happen--is for the Monetary Policy Committee to be seriously scrutinised by the Treasury Select Committee. I hope the Minister will confirm that there is nothing to stop the Treasury Select Committee sending for these people as individuals and saying to them, "Why did you take the line that you did in the minutes? Is it not strange that in your academic writings of several years earlier you took exactly the opposite view until you came on to this committee?", and so forth.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-32_para4"></a>To refer to the noble Lord, Lord Newby, we do not have an equivalent committee, but he will recall that in my Second Reading speech I suggested that your <P>


<a name="column_CWH18"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH18</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lordships should have the kind of committee which I regard as well within the Parliament Act where we, too, could scrutinise the Monetary Policy Committee. Indeed your Lordships might like to know--not to put on the face of the Bill--that my noble friend Lord Barnett and I will be writing to the relevant authorities in the House suggesting that we have such an all-party committee, itself independent, because it is a matter in which we are interested. As the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, pointed out, we might be able to make a small contribution on these matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-32_para5"></a>I am glad that the topics have been raised. I certainly believe the Monetary Policy Committee must be subject to very powerful scrutiny, including scrutiny which would imply when it comes to reappointment that perhaps there was a lack of independence or a lack of competence--not necessarily, but perhaps. I am glad the amendments were raised, although I do not believe we should go down that line. However, in the case of your Lordships we should go down the line of positive response to the Monetary Policy Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-32_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Boardman: </B>   I find it strange that a Government who held themselves up very clearly as requiring to give the Bank of England a larger degree of independence have managed to retain to themselves the control of the key appointments--those of the Bank of England and the monetary committee. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, under the scheme that is proposed, has control over both those bodies.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-32_para6"></a>I can understand that the noble Lord, Lord Peston--although I do not agree--should find greater fear of being examined and rejected by a committee than being examined by a hostile Chancellor and rejected. I am sure none of us would wish to discard his experience. But the independence which is granted in the appointments by my noble friend's amendment is one which is compelling. I am particularly attracted by his suggestion of having a Joint Committee of both Houses. It saves a lot of duplication on time, and my short experience of Joint Committees when they have operated has been entirely fruitful. They seem to cut through a great number of the problems which arise in one House and with which the other House disagrees. That is one I would commend.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-32_para7"></a>Turning to the monetary committee, my noble friend has already said that all of the nine members are either appointed by the Chancellor or appointed with his consent. There is no possible way in which one can claim this is giving them independence. I am sure they will be men of independent character, but they are appointed for only three years. My noble friend pointed out why five years would be more appropriate, but they are appointed only for three years, and in the last year, when they are coming up for reappointment, one wonders whether their judgment can be influenced by the longer-term outlooks that may be held within the Treasury. Assuming that would not be so, it still remains that it is the Chancellor's discretion to call for them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-32_para8"></a>I would urge in both the amendments put down by my noble friends for a Joint Committee that they should look at the directors of the Bank and decide whether <P>


<a name="column_CWH19"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH19</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they are appropriate people. I preferred Amendment No. 28, that with regard to the parliamentary scrutiny of the board appointments. This should also apply to members of the monetary committee. They should be coming in here with that degree of independence where the Government's reins have been handed over to the Bank of England. If it had been said, "We are asking the Bank and our nominees to do such-and-such a thing and they will tell us what they want", that would be one thing, and understandably would make the Bank of England quite independent in certain matters. What has not been said is, "We will make sure who runs the Bank of England".
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-32_para9"></a>I ask that these amendments should be carefully considered and supported.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-32_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   I say to my noble friend Lord Peston, too little ability maybe to be a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, but too old--most certainly not! I would not accept that. As to whether any member of the Monetary Policy Committee could be brought before a Select Committee of the House of Commons, I must tell my noble friend that I would not want to be a member of a monetary policy committee, or any other committee, who refused to go before a Select Committee of the other place. He would find himself in serious trouble, and as a former chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, I do not know of anyone who ever refused to appear. I am sure that that will apply to the Treasury Select Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-32_para10"></a>Let me turn to the amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, suggested that it should be done by the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee. As my noble friend said, that is nothing to do with us; this particular point is nothing to do with financial matters in the same sense as your Lordships' House does not deal with financial matters such as the Finance Bill. This is a quite different issue altogether. Of course this House can deal with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-32_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mackay, talked about a joint committee. The words he used were "a suitable committee of this House". As my noble friend Lord Peston said, there is not such a suitable committee of your Lordships' House. That is nothing to do with this piece of legislation--or rather it is to do with this piece of legislation in the sense that there should be a suitable committee of your Lordships' House, and my noble friend Lord Peston and myself, as he indicated, will be seeking to ensure that there is such a committee. My noble friend will be pleased that he does not have to deal with that particular point because he does not have to decide that issue. Certainly it is quite wrong that there is no suitable committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-32_para12"></a>It was suggested that the European Communities Committee Sub-Committee A could deal with it. As the noble Lord, Lord Boardman, will agree, it already has more than enough to do without having to deal with this as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-32_para13"></a>I do not like confirmation hearings either, as the noble Lord, Lord Newby, has suggested, but the new clause that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, has suggested is not unreasonable. On the other hand, even if it is not in the <P>


<a name="column_CWH20"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH20</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bill, members of the Monetary Policy Committee, the Government and anybody else will undoubtedly be called before the Treasury Select Committee in another place, and I hope in due course a committee in this place, and they would be very foolish indeed to seek to refuse to appear.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-32_para14"></a>That is the answer. I am not trying to usurp the role of my noble friend in replying to the amendment, but Amendment No. 3 with the new clause is unnecessary, I would think, if I may reply on his behalf. I personally do not support that, but I believe that there should be a Select Committee of this place to deal with these matters.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Montague of Oxford: </B>   Perhaps I might make a further point. This does sound rather alluring, but there is an aspect of it that might be rather worrying. We have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Newby, of the tight parameters about the examination that would be given to these confirmatory hearings. Could that tight examination also apply to the press? Surely if the media knew that an individual was going to come up for consideration, they would trawl every aspect of that individual prior to the hearing. It is no good saying to the media, "Oh, it's irrelevant. The Committee cannot take that into account at all". By the time the confirmatory hearing arrives the person's reputation might be ruined. It might also be enhanced, but that is less likely.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-33_para0"></a>I fear that with that prospect, candidates of great quality might not want to risk that. I believe it is a rather dangerous course. We see it with the media at the moment and I would urge that we be a little hesitant at this time until the whole question of confirmatory hearings has been thought through.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lords, Lord Mackay and Lord Newby, for clearly explaining their amendments and the differences between them. I suspect that the differences between them lie more with the fact that the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, are about a joint committee of both Houses, rather than the fact that the noble Lord stopped short of giving a veto to his joint committee. In practice, as I am sure he recognises, if a parliamentary committee had declined to give its support to a candidate, it would be very difficult for the Chancellor to press ahead with the appointment, despite the wording of the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-33_para1"></a>It is true that, if that is the case, we would be embarking on a very substantial change. Like the noble Lord, Lord Newby, I am not against embarking on substantial change, but we must look at the circumstances rather more closely than we have done.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-33_para2"></a>First, let us look for common ground. We agree, and the Bill makes clear, that we are looking for candidates who are selected for their professional competence and personal independence. Clause 13 on the Monetary Policy Committee requires the Chancellor to appoint only people with,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"knowledge or experience which is likely to be relevant to the Committee's functions". <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80303-33_para3"></a>Noble Lords will agree that the appointments that the Chancellor has made have been welcomed on all sides as meeting those criteria, just as the reappointment of the Governor of the Bank of England has achieved a wide welcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-33_para4"></a>The issue of parliamentary confirmatory hearings, however, is indeed a very much wider issue than the Bank of England. I am not suggesting that Giles Radice, the Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, has delusions of grandeur or that he would suddenly turn strongly about this matter, holding up potential candidates to ridicule and abuse before they even appeared before his committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-33_para5"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord Peston. I do not think that the experience of the United States Senate is a very propitious example for us. The power which the Senate has over the appointment of all sorts of people--ambassadors, judges and who knows what--has been distinctly double-edged. It might have been a necessary result at the time of the framing of the United States Constitution of a particular view of the relationship between the Legislature and the Executive, but we do not have that view of the relationship between the Legislature and the Executive. I am bound to say that the example we have been set in the last 224 years of the effects of the division of powers and the way in which that division of power is implemented by means of confirmatory hearings does not fill me personally with great confidence. I have to say "personally" because, as is well known, the Government have an open mind about whether parliamentary committees should have greater involvement in the selection of candidates.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Boardman: </B>   If I may, I would like to recall the Joint Committee between both Houses on the consolidation of Bills, for example. This brings together the best legal minds in this House and in the other place, and it works extremely effectively.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-33_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Yes, indeed, but there are many examples of effective parliamentary scrutiny. The Government are certainly not against parliamentary scrutiny, whether in a single House of Parliament or in both Houses of Parliament. But that is quite a different issue from confirmatory hearings on individual candidates for particular posts. There is no conflict at all between what I am saying here and our admiration for parliamentary scrutiny, whether of legislation or of any other aspect of public life. We have not in any way opposed the view of the Select Committee, which has already said it will take the opportunity which it has to interview and interrogate individual members of the Monetary Policy Committee and to provide detailed scrutiny of the activity of the Monetary Policy Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-33_para6"></a>I am not sure that I like the example of my noble friend Lord Peston saying to them, "As an academic before you were appointed you said one thing, now you are saying another". I remind him of his hero, John Maynard Keynes, who said:

<A NAME = "80303-33_para7"></a>I agree with that and that he, as somebody who expresses his views and has done all his life, should adhere to doing so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-33_para8"></a>I am particularly pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, should feel strongly about this matter since in his Amendment No. 31 he rules himself out from consideration as a member of the Monetary Policy Committee. However, we will come to deal with that later. It is a tribute to his objectivity if not to his judgment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-33_para9"></a>There are those who feel that this major constitutional change deserves consideration. I am not one of them. The Government are certainly prepared to consider the issue in its broader sense but I have to say that, if they did consider it, it is unlikely that the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England is where it would start.

<P>

<A NAME = "80303-33_para10"></a>We have had an interesting debate. There was a slight difference between the noble Lord, Lord Newby, and myself as to whether it would just be the Treasury Select Committee of the other place or a Joint Committee of both Houses. There was also the question of what role either would play in taking evidence and in bringing members of the Monetary Policy Committee before it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-33_para11"></a>Perhaps I might start with the Treasury Select Committee or the Joint Committee. As the noble Lord, Lord Peston, said very clearly, there is nothing to prevent this House looking at monetary policy; it is taxation matters that we are forbidden to look at. When I looked at this debate in the other place I noticed that it was only the Treasury Select Committee and I remembered the many times at OFT at which I spoke for the Treasury, as does the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. I was chided for not having debates after we had the Budget and after we had budgetary-type Statements. People pointed out to me that this House had a role to play, even though it was limited in what it could do with regard to taxation. Without flattering anyone or looking at anyone, there are some prominent academic economists and there are some prominent former Treasury Ministers who would certainly perform quite an interesting role in a Joint Committee of both Houses. I decided to bring in the Joint Committee in order to bring this House into play as it rightly should be in play.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-33_para12"></a>I was interested to hear the noble Lords, Lord Barnett and Lord Peston, say that they intended in this new situation to suggest to the powers-that-be that we should consider having a committee in this House on Treasury-type matters where members of the Monetary Policy Committee could be interrogated, brought before the committee and their views explored. That would be a useful step forward.

<A NAME = "80303-33_para13"></a>The real point here is that of confirmatory hearings. I am in little doubt that the Treasury Select Committee in another place is going to have hearings. Indeed, in its report it said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We believe very strongly in the importance of ensuring that the appointment process is carried out with openness and independence from political influence. We therefore intend, even in the absence of statutory provision, to instigate hearings and make reports to Parliament". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-33_para14"></a>So the Treasury Select Committee intends on its own say-so, to have confirmatory-type hearings, not just hearings after people have been put in post.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-33_para15"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Peston, that the reason I put in,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"criteria of competence and personal independence", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-33_para16"></a>was simply to try to ensure that any confirmatory hearings did not go down the kind of route that they tend to go down in the United States, where they seem to be much more interested in a person's marital fidelity and so forth than they are in their competence as monetary policy-makers. It was therefore an attempt to limit the kind of ground which a Joint Committee could plough that led me to put in the words that appear in paragraph (a).
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-33_para17"></a>We have an had interesting debate. I have a sneaking agreement with those noble Lords who have asked whether we really want to go down the road of the United States. We are quite different, in that the Chancellor, whether he likes it or not, will be called to account in the other place for any appointments he makes. Similarly, I suspect the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, might also be, if some members of your Lordships' House do not particularly like certain appointments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-33_para18"></a>I can, therefore, see the strength of the argument that confirmatory hearings are introducing into constitution in this country, something which really does not fit with parliamentary democracy on the Westminster model. One can understand it in the divisions of power in the United States, but not here. So, I take the argument, but find it interesting that, whatever is decided upon in this matter, in this House or the other place, the Select Committee is going to have hearings, confirmatory or otherwise. I suspect it will put those involved through the hoops. We should, as a House, look at what role we might play in this important, new field, for which the Monetary Policy Committee is to have responsibility. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>diametrically opposed. I decided, however, that we would take them together because they are an attempt, which is easier to do here where we have agreed that nothing will be pressed to a Division, to tease out the relationship between the court and the Monetary Policy Committee, if there is one, which is the important thing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para1"></a>When I read the Bill, I understood, on reaching Clause 2(1), the position. It is very clear:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The court of directors of the Bank shall manage the Bank's affairs, other than the formulation of monetary policy". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para2"></a>That seemed fair enough. However, it seemed at variance with a letter which the Chancellor of the Exchequer wrote to the Governor on 6th May. At paragraph 13 of that letter he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The non-executive members will review the performance of the Bank as a whole, including the MPC". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para3"></a>So there we have, in the letter, the possibility of the court reviewing, yet in the legislation it states that the court shall not play any part in the formulation of monetary policy and the work of the Monetary Policy Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para4"></a>In Schedule 3, paragraph 14, it says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Committee [that is, the Monetary Policy Committee] shall submit a monthly report on its activities to the court of the directors of the Bank". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para5"></a>I have no problem with the Monetary Policy Committee submitting a monthly report, nor indeed with the court discussing these reports, including the decisions which the Monetary Policy Committee has reached regarding the state of the economy, the position on monetary policy it is pursuing and the need to raise, lower or leave interest rates as they are.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para6"></a>I wonder, however, and this is why I put down the second amendment in my name, whether there will be any flow of information in the other direction. Can the court say to the Monetary Policy Committee, "We have indeed"--in the words of the Chancellor's letter--"reviewed what you are up to. We have been looking at your monthly reports and I am afraid we disagree with your analysis. We do not agree with your analysis about the health of the economy and the way it is going, nor with your conclusions. We suggest"--if I may go one step further--"that at your next meeting you should lower, or increase, interest rates", or whatever it may be. In other words, will there be a flow of information in the opposite direction from the one laid out?
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para7"></a>That is why I have suggested in Amendment No. 4 in Clause 3(2)(a) that we add to the sentence,

<FONT SIZE=3>report from the Monetary Policy Committee. I hope I have explained why I have moved two such diametrically opposed amendments.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-34_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I am a bit lost. Is my copy of the Marshalled List a misprint? Amendment No. 35 is in the name of my noble friend Lord Montague.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-34_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am indeed sorry. That means that I have fallen into the trap of not really looking. I have been on my feet for an hour-and-a-half on every amendment that was mine. I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Montague. He can explain now why he has a diametrically opposed amendment to mine, and the Minister can remove that criticism from his speech.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-34_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Montague of Oxford: </B>   I am not sure that I am diametrically opposed, but I will explain what is in my mind and the way I am trying to flush out, as the noble Lord is trying to flush out, this relationship between the Monetary Policy Committee and the court.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para10"></a>It seems to me that in terms of the image that is attempting to be conveyed in the country by presenting this court of diversified experience as encompassing the wisdom one would hope to make available, the implication is that that will have some input into the policy decisions of the Monetary Policy Committee. As I read the Bill, what it is proposing is that the court will provide information: no views, just information.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para11"></a>I am suggesting that it should go a little further:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and shall provide advice to the Committee on monetary policy". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para12"></a>I would not object to that reading "shall be among those who provide advice to the Monetary Policy Committee". Providing information seems to me to be a little lacking, particularly until we get to that part of the Bill where we come to look at the composition of the Monetary Policy Committee. As we know, at the present time it consists almost exclusively of economists. I have heard those economists, and I will turn to having heard them in a moment. I am not sure that they have quite the rounded view of the economy that one might expect of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para13"></a>I said at Second Reading that I had noted in the minutes that it was recorded that it was believed that an increase in interest rates automatically led to a moderation in requests for wage increases. That has not been my practical experience from running factories up and down the land. The moment there is an interest rate rise, within seconds the unions have arrived saying that in order to meet the cost of increased mortgages they must immediately have an increase in wages.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para14"></a>I referred a moment ago to listening to the members of the Monetary Policy Committee, and I did. Some three weeks ago the members of the Monetary Policy Committee went before the Treasury Select Committee and were cross-examined. One heard those economists responding to everyday life as perhaps all of us in this room understand it. And they did it yet again--not this time about wages. This time it was about something called asset values--the inflationary effect of asset values and how we must keep asset values under control. I sat there thinking all the time that this must be housing, but it was not. When asked to clarify, it was <P>


<a name="column_CWH26"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH26</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>share values and the extraordinary inflationary effect of an increase in share values. I almost thought the economists were waiting for the collapse of the Stock Exchange to bring inflation under control. Once more, I had the feeling that they were a little out of touch. That is why, later on, I am among those who are suggesting that the composition of the Monetary Policy Committee be looked at more tightly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para15"></a>Perhaps I may say in passing that I was a little surprised that, when I asked for the minutes of this particular meeting of the Treasury Committee, I was told they would not be available for another three weeks. I am new to this House, and I find this House remarkably efficient, but it seems extraordinary that when these committees sit the minutes of their meetings are not available for some six weeks since last they met. This seems to be a deficiency which should be looked at elsewhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para16"></a>One other question was asked of the committee, which I draw to noble Lords' attention because it was a very interesting meeting. One member asked the Governor--and I was enormously impressed by the openness of the Governor--"Tell me, Governor, there are four representatives of the Bank of England. Are you always going to vote as a block?". And the Governor replied, "No, no way. It is absolutely inevitable that at some time we shall disagree". I thought that was quite interesting. If it might be argued that the Governor is the chairman of the court, and he is the chairman of the Monetary Policy Committee, and therefore he is conveying the view of the court on monetary policy, that does not really hold up if we have been told by the Governor that it is inevitable that the four representatives will at some time disagree. That is why I have put my amendment down.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-34_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Boardman: </B>   I am afraid I fail to understand the run of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Montague of Oxford. It suggests that the monetary committee should provide advice to the Committee on Monetary Policy--that the court of directors should keep the procedure followed by the monetary committee under review and provide advice to the Committee on Monetary Policy. The whole of this has isolated it: the Monetary Policy Committee has its own remit, not to be interfered with by the directors of the Bank, and nor is the Bank involved in the monetary policy. It is running completely contrary to that. I very strongly support the amendment by my noble friend, which puts the matter perfectly clearly, excluding from the directors of the Bank anything in relation to monetary policy. So I support this amendment, and I find it difficult to go along with the other one.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-34_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   First, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, on a bravura performance. The noble Lord spent a whole speech, like Houdini, extricating himself from the contradiction into which he had not actually fallen. I know that this will be recorded in Hansard but I think it should be engraved in stone--it is worthy of the greatest of all conjurers!

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para17"></a>Despite that, I have to say that the Bill is perfectly clear. The role of the court of directors vis-a-vis the Monetary Policy Committee is entirely clear. The job of a court of directors is to review the performance of the Bank in all of its functions, except monetary policy. That is laid down in Clause 2(1):
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The court of directors of the Bank shall manage the Bank's affairs, other than the formulation of monetary policy". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para18"></a>In every other respect, it is managing the Bank's affairs. The only way in which it relates to the Monetary Policy Committee is in its responsibility for reviewing the procedures of the Monetary Policy Committee, and that is laid down in Clause 16(1):
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The court of directors of the Bank shall keep the procedures followed by the Monetary Policy Committee under review". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para19"></a>The purpose of that is that it should be concerned, as the management body of the Bank, that the Monetary Policy Committee has had before it the regional, sectoral and other information necessary for the formulation of monetary policy. It is quite clear from the Bill that the court of directors is reviewing the Bank's performance in relation to objectives of strategy as determined by the court, but that does not in turn relate to monetary policy. The formulation of monetary policy is the statutory responsibility of the Monetary Policy Committee alone. Hence the formulation of monetary policy is already a matter excluded from the review of the sub-committee of non-executive directors of the Bank specified in this particular clause of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para20"></a>It is important that we should recognise that and that there should be no confusion, otherwise we would have two separate bodies making decisions in public about the monetary policy of this country and that would not be acceptable. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, would not overturn that because it is formed in such a way that his insert would be overruled by Clause 2(1). Therefore his amendment is strictly unnecessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-34_para21"></a>The amendment of my noble friend Lord Montague is rather different. It would undermine the autonomy of the Monetary Policy Committee by confusing responsibilities in the way I set out. The monetary policy framework gives the MPC operational autonomy. It has statutory responsibility and therefore it can be held to be properly accountable. The role which the wider court and non-executives have is enormously important, but it must not duplicate or conflict with the role of the Monetary Policy Committee. I invite the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, in the first instance to withdraw his amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80303-35_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for not making too much of the fact that I slightly misread this. I was a bit surprised myself when I read it and wondered why I had done it. I assume it is the new role in which I find myself as part of the Opposition. I need to make up amendments to Bills. I hope I do not get too used to it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-35_para0"></a>I wanted to explore the two-way relationship. I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Montague of Oxford, made some telling points about the relationship <P>


<a name="column_CWH28"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>flowing in the other direction from the court, widely drawn, to the Monetary Policy Committee. We will have an interesting debate when we come later to the composition of the Monetary Policy Committee and whether it is entirely right that its members should all be drawn from the narrow circle of Oxford, Cambridge and London. That debate is still to come.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-35_para1"></a>This debate has been useful. If I understand the Minister correctly, and I am sure I do, my amendment is not necessary because Clause 3 is governed by Clause 2, which makes it perfectly clear that the court,
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall manage the Bank's affairs, other than the formulation of monetary policy". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-35_para2"></a>My slight concern is that when I went on to read Clause 3(2)(a), it looked as if it perhaps had a wider role. I will read with some interest what the noble Lord, Lord Montague of Oxford, said. I may return to it because I may decide that a belt and braces exercise is needed. However, I understand the point that the noble Lord made. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="80303-35_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish </B>   moved Amendment No. 5:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 2, line 25, leave out ("Chancellor of the Exchequer") and insert ("Governor").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-35_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 5 refers to Clause 3 and to the subsection which tells me that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Chancellor of the Exchequer may designate one of the directors to chair the sub-committee". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-35_para5"></a>The question which I put down in the margin when I looked at the Bill initially was, "Why him?". One theme that has already run through the Committee is just how independent the Bank is; how independent the Monetary Policy Committee will be, and just how much control the Chancellor will really have.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-35_para6"></a>I notice that this particular wording uses the word "may" and that, by implication, I take to mean that he may not. If he decides not to, how is the director who chairs the sub-committee to be chosen? I notice the use of the word "chair" but I shall use "chairman", as chair is what we are all sitting on, and I do not suppose this director will be sat upon by anybody--at least I hope he will not. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer decides not to designate, will the Governor then have to do it, or will the chair, so to speak, be left empty?
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-35_para7"></a> I am not sure why the Government used the word "may" and not "shall" here. If they really mean "may", why cannot they accept that the Governor will appoint the chairman or--even better--the court will appoint the chairman? The Governor may perhaps suggest to the court who might chair this sub-committee, but surely the Governor and the court can be trusted to pick one of the directors of the Bank to do that job. After all, they are all perfectly satisfactory people, otherwise one would hope that they would not have been appointed. The Minister keeps telling me that the Chancellor and everybody else will be careful about appointing people to these positions and that they will all be perfectly sensible. Therefore, why cannot he take his hands off this appointment and allow the Governor to appoint? In any case--do I read this correctly?--is it possible that <P>


<a name="column_CWH29"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH29</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Chancellor may not appoint and that therefore the Governor will have to? I would be grateful for some clarification from the Minister. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-35_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Before my noble friend replies, perhaps I can say that I wrote a question mark beside this when I first read the Bill because I was completely mystified by this sentence. I tried to reflect on anything I knew about management theory that would tell me that this sentence had any use whatsoever. I came to the conclusion that, if the sentence were not there at all, it would make no difference to the way this sub-committee would operate. I would take it for granted that if a sub-committee was set up, it would appoint its chairman. Then I thought, "We are New Labour; we are very clever; we must have some brilliant idea about the management of sub-committees". However, I could not come up with any idea myself at all. Therefore, I say to the Minister that I am looking forward to his answer as to why we have any need to tell a sub-committee who ought to appoint its chairman. That is my helpful information.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-35_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   First, I have to be clear what I am answering. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay, put in another bravura performance in which he moved one amendment and spoke to two other amendments which he had not tabled. He moved an amendment which provides for the Governor to appoint the chair of the sub-committee of directors. He then spoke to an amendment which would have provided that the Governor, or the Chancellor, "shall" designate one of the directors--an amendment which he had not tabled--and then he spoke to a third amendment which is his idea that the court should appoint its own chairman. He must make up his mind which of the three alternatives to the Bill he wants to promote. I am restricted to the amendment he tabled.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-35_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   The Minister is giving me a "teach-in". It seems to me that all he is doing is suggesting ways in which I might have elongated the Committee proceedings by putting down three amendments. Indeed, I tabled the one about the Chancellor, and felt that I should throw in the "may" and "shall", I am sure the Minister can answer me. However, I will take his "teach-in" to heart.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-35_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Perhaps I may respond to that point. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay, as a Minister, used to do this all the time. It used to infuriate me when government Ministers would generally tell me that "may" really meant "shall", and I could never accept that from the Opposition Benches. Now the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, will have to accept it from the Opposition Benches.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-35_para8"></a>However, the possibility of the Chancellor not designating a member has been raised and the question has to be answered. And the answer is that if he does not designate somebody as chairman, then the sub-committee of the court itself will have to make that designation, because Clause 3(7) says that the sub-committee shall be responsible for its own procedures. I hope this answers that question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-35_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   That is a more substantial point and I certainly will answer, as I intended. This comes back to the issue of corporate governance with which we were concerned on an earlier amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay, and I both quoted the Hampel Report, and I would like to do so again, and also to quote the Cadbury Report. The Hampel Report said,
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80303-35_para11"></a>The point here is that you cannot pursue the analogy with private business too far because there are no shareholders other than the Chancellor. The Chancellor is, on behalf of the people in this country, the shareholder in the Bank of England, and that is why it is appropriate that he should appoint the chairman of this non-executive committee.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-35_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Boardman: </B>   The report does not say that the Chancellor, or anyone else, shall appoint the chairman. The implication is that the committee would, as indeed any committee, public or private, would appoint their own chairman in a circumstance such as this.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-35_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   That is one possibility, but this brings me back to a point to which I failed to respond when the noble Lord, Lord Boardman, spoke on an earlier amendment. He was suggesting that somebody other than the Chancellor should appoint the members of the Monetary Policy Committee at that time. I wondered when he said it who else he thought should. If it is not the Chancellor acting on behalf of an elected government, who else should it be? The only realistic alternative is a self-perpetuating oligarchy of members of the Monetary Policy Committee, and I am glad to have the opportunity of getting in that dig which I failed to make on the earlier amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-35_para12"></a>The answer here is that it is perfectly possible for the non-executive directors, who are a sub-committee of the court, to appoint their own chairman if the Chancellor decided not to designate a chairman. I do not feel very strongly about the matter. The word "may" is there and allows for that possibility, but it also provides for the Chancellor to make a designation.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80303-36_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   Before my noble friend sits down, what is coming through to me is how often committees like the Hampel Committee and the Cadbury Committee get it wrong. They often do, and have done so. I honestly cannot see it, and I have made the point; they do not need this sentence. If that sub-committee is set <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>up of members of a named body, one of them will be chosen as a chairman. I can see now why our legislation is as long as it is, because we put in unnecessary sentences. What is the point of having the criticism of this? I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, would not mind deleting the whole sentence. Why is it in here? Perhaps he can tell us.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-36_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Let me reflect on all three of the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, both the one he put down and the two that he did not put down but discussed. If there is anything to be said at a later stage I will come back.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-36_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Stewartby: </B>   I hope I "may" raise a question with the noble Lord, because I "shall". In reading this clause and looking at the composition of this committee, right at the top it says that this sub-committee should consist of the directors of the Bank, which is presumably all the directors, both executive and non-executive, although the root of the clause refers only to non-executive directors. I have looked elsewhere in the document and have been unable to find where it is stated that this is a sub-committee which is meant to be of non-executive directors, but I assume that it is pointless if it is a committee of the whole board.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-36_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   No, my Lords, Clause 1(2) states that the court consists of a governor, two deputy governors and 16 directors of the Bank; in other words, the executive committee of directors excludes the Governor and two deputy governors.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-36_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Stewartby: </B>   I read the same words as the noble Lord. The Governor and the two deputy governors are directors. Are they not directors? Clause 1(1) says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There shall continue to be a court of directors of the Bank", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<A NAME = "80303-36_para0"></a>and Clause 1(2) that:

<P>

<A NAME = "80303-36_para1"></a>That seems to me to make it clear that they are directors of the Bank.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-36_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   No, there are three groups which are mutually exclusive: there is one Governor, two deputy governors and 16 directors.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-36_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Stewartby: </B>   Will the noble Lord look at this at leisure? It seems to me that if one says that there should be a court of directors of the Bank and the court consists of different categories which include the Governor and the two deputy governors, I do not see how they can fail to be directors.

<P>
<A NAME="80303-36_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Stewartby: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for that explanation, but in that case it casts doubt on the wording of Clause 1(2). May I suggest that he has another look at that because I believe that it conveys the opposite meaning?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-36_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am always willing to have another look at things, but it does not cast doubt.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-36_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   For all that I put the wrong amendment down, or I should have put three amendments down, we have had quite an interesting little chat. I should have remembered the rule that if one is putting down amendments, every time one sees "may" one should put "shall" and every time one sees "shall" one should put "may", but I forgot about that; I was attempting to get to the heart of the matter rather than to put down all the amendments. I well remember the noble Lord and his noble friends putting down amendments to irritate me, as he said; perhaps I should be trying to irritate him!
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-36_para3"></a>May I say to the noble Lord that I see what he is saying: the 16 directors are, as explained in Clause 1(2), the non-executive members referred to in the margins of Clause 3. In truth, one has to work quite hard to come to that conclusion and perhaps the noble Lord could look at that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-36_para4"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord for saying that he will look at the whole debate we have just had. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, went a little further than mine. I indicated that I thought that the Governor could designate the chairman of the sub-committee, but I can see the argument for going one step further and mentioning the non-executive directors--which is what we are talking about, and they were all appointed by the Chancellor, so I cannot believe any of them will be that unsound as to be not fit to be chairman of this sub-committee. There is merit in the noble Lord having a look at this and I am grateful to him for that. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 3, line 1, at end insert--
<BR>
("(ia) the Bank's objectives and strategy as determined by the court under section 2(2),").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-36_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: Although Amendment No. 6 is an amendment to Clause 4, in my attempts to understand Clause 2(2) I wrote in the margin where it refers to the Bank's objectives--this is other than the Monetary Policy Committee--"what objectives?", and therefore what strategy? I was completely mystified by what the court was actually up to.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-36_para9"></a>It then seemed that a more sensible way to amend the Bill would be to add the wording that my noble friend and I have put into Clause 4. What we are anxious to do is to discover what the Bill has in mind by way of those objectives, what is meant by strategy, and then to do it in the way that says that the court will say, "These are our objectives. This is what we are trying to do <P>


<a name="column_CWH33"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH33</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>under this general heading. This is our strategy". In due course it will then say, "These were our objectives. This is what we were trying to do, this is how we were trying to do it and these were the outcomes". I hope my noble friend will respond sympathetically to this amendment. It does not change in any way the nature of this prospective legislation. It seems to be an example of what the Committee should be doing, which is to clarify the Bill and make it achieve what I assume the Government were hoping it would achieve. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-36_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Like the noble Lord, Lord Peston, I wrote in the margin of Clause 3(2)(a) "What are these?" beside "objectives and strategy". I shall be very interested to hear the Minister's explanation in response to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Peston, which would require the Bank to spell out its objectives and strategy in its annual report. I presume, because we have just had the debate, that monetary policy will not come into that at all. So what are these objectives and what is the strategy?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-36_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Montague of Oxford: </B>   All our minds have been working along similar lines. I telephoned the Bank to ask whether it was a fact that it possessed a mission statement, and it told me it did. I asked whether I could have a copy of it, but they said they were sorry but they could not make the mission statement public.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-36_spnew14"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I was congratulating myself on the fact that the Bill contained nothing like a mission statement--a particularly objectionable piece of management jargon, as far as I am concerned, and one to which I have objected for many years. I am sorry that they have a mission statement, and I am sorry they did not give my noble friend a copy of it. However, if he looks at the annual report of the Bank, of which I have pages 10 to 15 in front of me, he will see that this covers the Bank's core purposes, which sounds rather close to a mission statement to me, although it takes up a whole page. The report sets out the Bank's strategy, including monetary stability, monetary analysis, monetary operations, banking activities, financial stability, supervision and surveillance, financial structure, other areas, finance and personnel, and implementation. That is quite thorough. It sets forth the Bank's core purposes and strategy for the forthcoming year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-36_para10"></a>My noble friend's amendment would provide a statement of the objectives and strategy for the previous year, the year which is being reported on. I am not sure whether that is all he wants. I suspect he wants a statement which covers both years in comparable terms, which would seem the sensible way to proceed. It would be best if I say to him and to my noble friend Lord Barnett that we will take their amendments away, consider them, and come back at Report stage with suitable wording which would cover the point which I understand lies behind Amendments Nos. 6 and 7.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-36_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   Before my noble friend sits down, I wonder, when we come to Report stage, whether he will be able to obtain a copy of this mission statement. If it is different from what he has read out to us, I am <P>

I would like to debate with him whether "mission statement" is worse than "core objectives"--I find both equally loathsome.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 8 I shall be brief as it is pretty self-explanatory. The Bill as it stands says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Chancellor of the Exchequer shall lay copies of every report under this section before Parliament". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para3"></a>That, of course, can mean there may be a debate, if arrangements are made, or there may not. I have added the words,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and make a statement to Parliament on the contents of the report", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para4"></a>to take this one step forward, so that it is not just a matter of laying the report before Parliament. This could be a very important document, especially if we discover what the mission statement is, and this amendment could give both Houses the opportunity to discuss serious issues relating to the Bank. However, the problem, as I see it, is that laying copies before Parliament does not necessarily mean that there will be any kind of question and answer or debate, which is why I put in the words I have proposed. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-37_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I hope we can do better than that. The Chancellor said on 20th May last year that he would arrange for a debate in the Commons on the Bank's annual report. If I may speak to myself as a "usual channel", I shall encourage myself to see that a comparable debate is arranged in this House. The noble Lord will agree that a debate would be much better than a statement. A statement is a very limited thing which provides only for questions from principal Opposition spokesmen and then 20 minutes of Back-Bench contributions. We would much prefer to have a full debate and that is the intention.
<P>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>have asked for a debate. But I am delighted to hear that the Chancellor has given that indication to the other place, and that the Minister appreciates that this House would also like that opportunity. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-37_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Home </B>   moved Amendment No. 9:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 3, line 25, after ("with") insert (", and the payment of fees in lieu of such deposits to,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para9"></a>The noble Earl said: As we are now moving on to the financial arrangements and the payment of fees, perhaps it is appropriate that I should again declare an interest in that I am a director of a merchant bank, Morgan Grenfell. It is a British registered merchant bank and ultimately owned by the German Deutsche Bank.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para10"></a>Amendment No. 9 is prompted by a remark made by the Chief Secretary for the Treasury in Committee in another place, when he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We considered all the options--fees and charges--and came to the view that the cash ratio deposit system had worked quite well in the past and we are now putting it on a statutory basis". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para11"></a>That may well be, but the Bill more than halves the reasons for having them at all. The new look Bank will be so different from its former self that I seriously wonder whether CRDs are as appropriate as they were previously.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para12"></a>I wonder, therefore, whether the Minister can tell us why the Chief Secretary discarded fees and charges as an option, particularly at a time when there is a plethora of financial and other institutions which will escape paying anything towards the work of the Bank. Fees and charges seem to me to be becoming ever more appropriate as CRDs become less appropriate, just at a time when CRDs are being put on the statute book for the first time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para13"></a>I also believe that fees would give the Bank and the relevant institution much greater flexibility. There are institutions, for instance, which have a very small deposit base but a very large asset management business. The imposition of this scheme may put considerable strain on the banking book of an institution such as the one I describe, whereas the asset management side of the business could absorb equivalent costs comparatively easily. Indeed, there are all sorts of other types of institution which could be affected by the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para14"></a>I apologise to noble Lords, as I should have said at the beginning that I was also speaking to Amendment No. 14. Some of the institutions which could justifiably be involved are spelled out in Amendment No. 14. Other institutions may specialise in mergers, securitisation, insurance or leasing. There are many types. To carry out some of these specialisations, for prudential reasons the institutions will keep an appropriate level of capital, reserves and liquidity. From this, noble Lords will see that there are potential wide divergencies in the type of the eligible liability base of different institutions.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para15"></a>Paragraph 2 of Schedule 2 is misleading as it now reads. It refers to the aggregate of sterling and foreign currency liabilities. However paragraph 19 of the consultation paper on cash ratio deposits tells us that foreign currency liabilities are only foreign currency liabilities which back sterling assets. Not everything is quite as simple as it seems, and this is only one example of how very different the banks and financial institutions' balance sheets may turn out to be and how very different their eligible base may be.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para16"></a>The amendment is designed to give the Government and the Bank more flexibility in the way the Bank is funded, and as such I hope that the Government will take it seriously. To discard fees as an option, at least at this stage, would be extremely restrictive. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-37_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Stewartby: </B>   May I add a word in support of my noble friend Lord Home? I repeat the declaration of interest as a director of a bank and a building society which I made on Second Reading. I am also a director of one or two other companies which might be required to pay if these amendments were agreed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para17"></a>The point I want to make is that when cash ratio deposits were introduced, a very substantial part of the work of the Bank of England was in the supervision of deposit-taking institutions. Therefore, the requirement for such institutions to provide the bulk of the funding of the Bank was evident. However, now that the supervision is due to be transferred away from the Bank of England, the residual functions of the Bank of England which will remain are not nearly so closely focused in aggregate on the deposit-taking institutions as they were before, and there is a case for looking at spreading this charge more widely.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para18"></a>My only concern about this is how it could be defined in detail and made workable. You would have to have a de minimis  exemption; otherwise under the wording of Amendment No. 14, for example, which states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any institution authorised for the purposes of the Financial Services Act 1986", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para19"></a>it could cover a large number of bodies and it might not be practicable. Certainly, within the City of London there are many institutions which gain from the work of the Bank of England in the international market place in relation to sterling and other international matters. They will receive the services of the Bank for nothing, and the deposit-taking sector will be paying separately to the Financial Services Authority, but will also be left carrying the whole weight of the Bank of England in its revised form.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para20"></a>I believe there is merit behind the amendment of my noble friend Lord Home, although its actual implementation may require some further refinement.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-37_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The noble Earl, Lord Home, in moving the amendment asks the Government to take it seriously. I can assure him that we do. Let me set out the basis on which we have approached this problem and the rationale for our views on currency ratio deposits.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para21"></a>The CRD scheme is important because it puts this source of funding for the Bank on a statutory basis for the first time, and makes the income secure. The current <P>


<a name="column_CWH37"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH37</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>voluntary scheme applies only to banks authorised in the UK, and UK branches of European authorised institutions. The proposed statutory scheme will apply also to building societies, which have acquired many of the characteristics of banks in recent years. What distinguishes banks and building societies from other groups of financial institutions is that they typically borrow short and lend long--their balance sheets contain loans and other assets of long maturity and deposit liabilities, many of which can be called on at short (or no) notice. Other financial institutions, including securities firms and insurance companies, typically match the maturity of their assets and liabilities much more closely.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para22"></a> The amendment would widen the population of institutions that fund the Bank to include all institutions that are authorised under the Financial Services Act of 1986 and also insurance companies. Those are the ones which I described as matching the maturity of their assets and liabilities more closely.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para23"></a>It is appropriate for banks and building societies to place CRDs to provide income to the Bank, because they clearly benefit from the Bank's function as a provider of liquidity to the financial system. Only a few banks have accounts at the Bank of England to settle obligations with each other. But the other deposit-taking institutions manage their liquidity through deposits and credit facilities with the settlement banks, which in turn ultimately depend on their access to liquidity from the central bank. This in effect ensures deposit-taking institutions against the risk they run from having liabilities at call but assets that are less liquid.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-37_para24"></a>Therefore there is a clear dividing line between deposit-taking institutions which depend on access to central bank liquidity and other financial institutions which do not. When the noble Earl recommends a system of fees and charges which would widen the base, he forgets the fact that it is a very common central banking arrangement in many countries that cash-ratio deposits or their equivalent should be used as a way of approximating the benefit of liquidity. For those reasons we cannot support this amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80303-38_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Before my noble friend sits down, he raises an interesting piece of technical financial economics. Can my noble friend tell us whether there have been any studies done in the Bank which relate the benefits of the lender of last resort function and the availability of liquidity, to the loss of interest via cash-ratio deposits? If there have been any such studies I have never seen them published. I have always assumed that the Bank has an extraordinarily good deal in terms of cash-ratio deposits, and I would always advise, if asked, "Do not to go down the path of fees or anything like that; you will end up a good deal poorer than you are". I wonder whether he has additional information? In saying that, I support exactly what my noble friend said.
<P>

<A NAME="80303-38_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Home: </B>   I thank the Minister for that response and should like to make just a couple of comments. Indeed, I have read much of what he said in his remarks in the consultation document issued last November, but the fact is that the Bank of England, which we still cannot call the Bank of the United Kingdom, whilst a provider of liquidity to part of the system, is certainly not a member of last resort to any member of the banking system. The bank is under no obligation, legal or otherwise, to bail out any bank which might happen to have a temporary financial liquidity problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para0"></a>I have some sympathy for the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Peston, on this, and perhaps we can have it more appropriately answered under Amendment No. 10 which we will come on to in a minute. The noble Lord said that he would take this seriously. I am not saying here that I am substituting a fee and charging basis for cash ratio deposits; I am merely suggesting that the Government should add this as an extra element of flexibility.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para4"></a>The noble Earl said: This amendment carries on from the other and is particularly designed to ask the Government--who obviously do not like the use of fees and charges--to consider whether they have really explored all other options open for funding the operations of the Bank.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para5"></a>As we were saying, with the departure of the supervisory function, the relevance of the Bank to banks and building societies in particular has dropped dramatically. The main extra (albeit probably temporary) activity of the Bank--that of setting interest rates--could in a perverse way work against the interests of banks. That is because banks, especially those with large treasury departments, have more opportunities to make money at a time of high volatility in interest rates than they do during periods of stability.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para6"></a>We heard a great deal during the passage of this Bill about the requirement that the Monetary Policy Committee should attach high priority to monetary and price stability. If, therefore, it does its job properly, the effect would act against the interests of those institutions. Paradoxically, it may be a good reason for putting the CRDs on to a statutory basis, as building societies and banks may not now be such enthusiastic payers, perhaps, as they were.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para7"></a>I said also in relation to the last amendment that the Bank does not have to be a lender of last resort, which I believe to be another reason why the banks will now be less interested and reaction to the Bank somewhat <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>less relevant to the banking system than before. Can the noble Lord tell the Committee whether the Government really did explore the other ways and suggestions for funding this part of the Bank's exposure? Those were, I gather, put forward as a result of the consultation paper. One suggestion was based on turnover; other criteria for companies such as insurance companies or fund managers could be related to funds under management. For market makers and brokers, numbers of transactions might possibly be relevant criteria.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para8"></a>The Government seem to have rejected those and I would be grateful if the noble Lord could tell us whether they really did consider them and why they were rejected? I beg to move.

<A NAME="80303-38_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The short answer to the question of the noble Earl is that we did. We explored other sources. He read the consultation documents. As usual, it is difficult to publish the responses to consultation documents because one is never sure whether or not the people who make them wish their comments to be published. However, if there is any way in which we can make more information available to him as a result of the consultation process, I shall certainly undertake to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para9"></a>My answer to the previous amendment, which I would have preferred to have grouped with this one, indicates the careful consideration which has been given to alternative methods of funding, such as fees and charges. I should, however, remind the Committee that cash ratio deposits have been part of the framework for financing the Bank for a long time. The banks have accepted it on a voluntary basis and there is no indication that they are resisting the idea of continuing it on a statutory basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para10"></a>Let me also make clear that the Bank already has many other sources of income. That is not the only way in which the Bank is financed. It receives money from the Government for issuing banknotes, for managing the foreign exchange reserve and for providing gilt registration services. That is about &#163;75 million in 1997-98. It receives money from private clients for banking and settlement services and income from its own reserves.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para11"></a>We should therefore put cash ratio deposits into context. The noble Earl is entitled to ask for as much as we can give him about the consideration which has been given to this issue, but my conclusion must be that we have explored others and that this seems to be the best solution. I would urge him to withdraw the amendment.

I hope that throughout the early years of the experience of the Bank funding under this new provision, the Bank, in conjunction with the Treasury, will continue to look very hard to see whether this really is the most appropriate way to fund part of <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para12"></a>With those reassurances from the Minister that he has indeed looked at other options, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para13"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-38_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Home </B>   moved Amendment No. 11:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 20, line 11, at end insert ("and
<BR>
(d) an institution authorised to accept deposits under any other Act.") .
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para14"></a>The noble Earl said: Having previously spoken about cash ratio deposits, or the theory of them, it now seems that they are here to stay and will indeed be enshrined in the law. It seems to me to be only fair that we should explore whether paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 covers the right group of institutions. Paragraph 1 specifically categorises three types while paragraph 2 says that the Treasury may add anyone else it feels like. It seems to me that the first is too restrictive and the second is rather too wide.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para15"></a>If we look at those covered by paragraph 1 of Schedule 2, I do not believe that it is right to say that just because a bank or a building society takes a lot of deposits it will necessarily benefit from the actions of the Bank as envisaged, any more than any other institution. Any company will use the money markets if it has excess cash, and obviously anybody with liquid capital will make more money if rates are high. However, this does not apply exclusively to banks and building societies. They are certainly not unique in that they alone benefit from the Bank's provision of liquidity. Banks indeed must keep liquidity for other reasons, not least of which are prudential management reasons.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para16"></a>Another reason that I say that paragraph 1 is too restrictive is that through the increasing use of credit cards and other incentives, an increasing number of companies are offering credit and will often offer discounts on goods purchased if there is a credit balance on the customer's account. This credit is returnable if the customer closes his account. It is quite possible, if this proves popular, that it could become quite big business. Let us take supermarket chains as an example. In effect, they would be embarking on a type of banking service that would not necessarily come under the Banking Act 1987. While it may be necessary to regularise their activities by statute, it may not be desirable at that time to amend the Banking Act. A short new Bill may be a better way to achieve the objective.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para17"></a>That is just one example, but I am sure that other noble Lords can think of many others. Indeed, the Bill anticipates that there may be others by including sub-paragraph (2).
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para18"></a>Returning to that clause, that itself may go too far the other way. If anyone accepts a deposit which is, in effect, an earnest of a good intent by a potential purchaser, in the way this Bill is drafted, that could then be caught up within sub-paragraph (1).
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para19"></a>Taking that to an extreme, someone like a property developer could be caught in it if he accepts a deposit from a potential house owner but then has to return it, indeed plus interest. That is an extreme example and noble Lords may say it is going too far. But again, it is an example that it could go too far the other way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-38_para20"></a>It seems to me that an appropriate halfway house between these two extremes would be, if Parliament agreed that a deposit-taking activity should be regulated, that the institutions affected by an Act of Parliament should come under this clause.

<P>
<A NAME="80303-39_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I must confess that I am slightly puzzled by Amendment No. 11. I do not really know to which other Act of Parliament the noble Earl is referring, nor to what other institutions he is referring. With those difficulties, I find it difficult to respond.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-39_para0"></a>I refer the noble Earl back to my quite lengthy answer to Amendment No. 9, in which I set out in some detail the reasons why we believe it is appropriate that institutions which benefit from the provision of liquidity from the central bank--and that is fundamentally banks and building societies--should be those who contribute to the financing of the Bank. I have not heard an answer to that case which I put forward in such a way that encourages me to give any support to the amendments that the noble Earl is now proposing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-39_para1"></a>The noble Earl's second amendment would remove the Treasury's power by order to amend the definition of eligible institutions. Let me make it clear that although, on the face of it, this is a Henry VIII power, we do not envisage using it at the moment. However, it is sensible to have this degree of flexibility in order to respond to possible future changes in market and institutional structure. Since any such orders would have to be approved by both Houses, there are sufficient safeguards in place on the exercise of this power. The Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee has not raised any objection to the power proposed here.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-39_para2"></a>On that basis, the initial designation of institutions is a matter of deliberate policy, and has been carried out after a full exploration of alternatives. The Bill provides in paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 2 for flexibility in relation to any future changes. I hope the noble Earl will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-39_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Stewartby: </B>   Before my noble friend rises, may I ask whether this would be by affirmative resolution, when the noble Lord, the Minister, says that this would have to be approved by both Houses?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-39_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am grateful to be told that it is by affirmative resolution.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-39_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Home: </B>   The Minister said he could not envisage what sort of institutions I was thinking of. Surely, the fact that sub-paragraph (2) refers to people or institutions, or institutions unknown at this moment, answers his own question. He is anticipating that there may be other institutions which, at some time in the future, it may be appropriate to regulate. I took a stab at a couple, one of which I thought was too restrictive, and the other which I thought was too wide, and gave two, <P>


<a name="column_CWH42"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH42</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>albeit highly theoretical examples. Surely, if it is envisaged, as it is under Schedule 2, paragraph 1(2), that there may be other institutions which could appropriately be brought into this clause, then surely we should be able to define rather more precisely which institutions they might be.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-39_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Earl for giving way. Yes, I should have responded to his specific examples, but I believe he will agree, on reflection, that what he was talking about were loans rather than deposits. There is no maturity transformation problem with just granting loans. Maturity transformation can be a problem if you borrow to lend, which is what banks and building societies are doing, and that is what CRDs attempt to evaluate.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-39_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Home: </B>   I hear what the noble Lord has to say on this topic. I will now read his response carefully in Hansard. We may wish to return to this point at Report stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="80303-39_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Home </B>   moved Amendment No. 13:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 20, line 45, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) The total burden of cash ratio deposits levied under this Schedule shall not exceed that part of the Bank's expenditure which deals with public goods.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-39_para5"></a>The noble Earl said: The purpose of Amendment No. 13 is to explore the current position as far as quantifying the costs of the Bank which will be funded through the cash ratio deposit scheme. The consultation paper, to which we have already referred, quotes from the Bank's 1997 annual report which gives pre-tax profits of &#163;121 million and costs of resources of &#163;210 million. It further states that the cost of banking supervision is roughly &#163;50 million, including an overhead allowance. If this figure is deducted from the total costs, it would leave some &#163;160 million to be funded. As the Minister was saying earlier, this comes from various sources: agency services, payments for direct banking services, its own capital and reserves apart from CRDs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-39_para6"></a>It is, however, difficult to extract precise figures from the way that the Bank's annual report is drafted, and perhaps in the spirit of transparency the Government could clarify these figures for us. Figures produced by the British Bankers' Association put the cost of public goods functions at &#163;75.6 million, or 36 per cent., while the cost of supervision is estimated at &#163;31.5 million, or 15 per cent. What of course we do not know at present is what the on-going cost of the Monetary Policy Committee, which we have spent some time debating today, and the infrastructural back-up related to that committee is going to be, and therefore whether this will have any effect on the percentages that I have quoted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-39_para7"></a>However, what does seem to be equitable is that the cash ratio deposit system should not have to fund any part of the banking or market services, or indeed <P>


<a name="column_CWH43"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH43</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>banknote printing or registration services. Nor does it seem equitable that the profits of the Bank should come from this source either, given, as I have already said, that many other institutions will benefit from not having to make deposits of this nature.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-39_para8"></a>The current rate of eligible deposits is 0.35 per cent., which is at least three times that required to cover the &#163;75.6 million costs anticipated by the BBA. Given the anticipated increase in eligible liabilities anyway, further augmented by the advent of the building societies into the scheme, this rate could be reduced at least threefold, possibly down to 0.1 per cent. I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm that these figures are indeed approximately correct in their outcome, and it is the Government's intention to confine this scheme to the finance of the public group function. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-39_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   We are looking at Amendment No. 13 in which the expression "public goods" appears. I once wrote a book called Public Goods in the Public Sector. I wonder whether the noble Earl means the expression public goods to correspond to the technical definition of this as it appears in economics. If he does, am I to understand it is possible in the case of the Bank of England to quantify the extent to which it creates value in a public goods sense? He quoted some figures, but he was speaking so rapidly I could not keep up with him. I would be amazed if one could produce figures of that sort. I have no doubt that the Bank of England creates what we in economics call the public good, but I am somewhat taken aback that the noble Earl seemed to be saying that we could estimate that and therefore relate it to the Bank's income.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-39_para9"></a>I would certainly like to know how the estimate takes place. I would like to know the provenance of that estimate, and I would like to be in a position to check it myself. If I ask what public good the Bank creates, I would wave my hands in the air and say, "A lot"--and certainly my guess would be a lot more than the Bank of England costs us. I was a bit taken aback by that expression, but it may well be that the noble Earl is using the words "public goods" in a completely different sense from that in which we use it in academic economics.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-39_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Home: </B>   Perhaps I may clarify that point. I am quoting from the British Bankers' Association response to the consultative paper. Talking about the public good functions of the Bank as a percentage of resources, it refers to monetary analysis/policy at 6 per cent., monetary statistics 2 per cent., monetary operations 5 per cent., financial stability/structure 4 per cent., Centre for Central Banking 1 per cent., central overhead costs, including personnel, finance, audit and secretaries' department, 18 per cent. This adds up to a total of 36 per cent., which in turn equates to &#163;75.6 million.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-39_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   If the noble Earl will forgive me, as I am as anxious as anybody to get a move on, I am still not clear of what that 36 per cent. is a percentage. The numbers just astonish me in terms of the relevant body's ability to do them, but I suppose the answer is that, with <P>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH44</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>any luck, if they read in our Hansard our small debate here, they might send me their documentation so that I can persuade myself that it was meaningful. I have no idea what my noble friend is about to say, but my strong advice is not to fall into the trap of assuming that those figures have any weight at this moment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-39_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey </B>   I take my noble friend's warnings very seriously. In so far as the figures quoted come from the Bank of England annual report, I can confirm them. In so far as they come from calculations by the British Bankers' Association in its response, I will be considerably more cautious and leave it to my noble friend and the noble Earl to puzzle over.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-39_para10"></a>I can be a little less negative to the noble Earl than I was on previous amendments. The starting point must be that the Government have decided that deposit-taking institutions should continue to contribute to financing the Bank because of the benefits they get from access to central bank liquidity. But government are also mindful of the need to minimise the burden on these institutions. That is why we said explicitly that taking into account also the charges that the FSA intends to levy for banking supervision, it intends that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the total burden on credit institutions in aggregate should be no greater than it is today, and preferably lower". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-39_para11"></a>As to whether the burden from CRD should be limited to certain of the Bank's functions, we take that point seriously too, again with the warnings that my noble friend Lord Peston has given. We have received a number of representations asking for a clear link between the CRD rate and the Bank's expenditure on its monetary policy and financial stability functions. The Government are still considering the responses to the consultation process, but we are looking sympathetically at this approach and see advantages in terms of transparency and accountability, and we hope to announce our conclusions on the CRD consultation soon.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-39_para12"></a>Also, since the order setting the CRD bands and ratios will be subject to affirmative resolution by both Houses, your Lordships will have an opportunity of reviewing the Government's proposals in detail.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-39_para13"></a>As to the issue of what the CRD scheme will raise, in a response to the consultation the Treasury will set out fully the rationale for the level set and the transparency of the Bank's costs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-39_para14"></a>In the light of those assurances, I hope that the noble Earl, Lord Home, will feel it possible to withdraw his amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80303-40_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Home: </B>   I am most grateful to the Minister for his assurances. Perhaps the Government can be as transparent and produce all the figures from the Bank of England in words of one syllable that I can understand; possibly the noble Lord, Lord Peston, will be able to understand them if they are in words of two syllables. I should certainly welcome clarification, as I am sure would the various associations which have been struggling with these figures.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para0"></a> Perhaps I may make one last point in relation to that. I am grateful that these figures will be published and I urge that they be made clear as soon as possible. We <P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para5"></a>The noble Earl said: This is a small point, but it is quite an important one on timing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para6"></a>As currently drafted, the Bank has the ability to refuse to put something into its accounts which auditors might require of it. I have no particular quarrel with that in that the Bank might well feel that it is in the national interest not to disclose something, and it may well be right.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para7"></a>However, potentially it leaves the Bank's auditors in an invidious position. The auditors may not be in a position to judge whether or not the Bank is right, but at present they have no way of checking that. All they can do is refuse to either sign the accounts or qualify their opinion. All noble Lords will agree that neither of those options is satisfactory. If, however, the auditors knew that the Bank had received Treasury permission not to include something, that would give them a lot of assurance and they could then sign off the accounts with a clear conscience.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para8"></a>The possibility of the Bank being incorrect in refusing to publish some information is potentially anticipated by Clause 7(7). Under that subsection, the Treasury may require the Bank to publish the information that it excluded. Members of the Committee will note that the wording is "has excluded" and not "proposing to exclude". That subsection may be intended to cover the eventuality when it is inappropriate for the Bank to disclose information immediately but its publication may be desirable later. I believe that that subsection could be read either way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para9"></a>The main point of the amendment is for the benefit of the auditors, of which I hasten to add I am not one. On that basis, I beg to move.

<A NAME="80303-40_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Stewartby: </B>   Perhaps I may add a word of support to my noble friend Lord Home. This is quite an important point, though it is described by him as a small one. A unilateral decision by the Bank to disregard a Companies Act requirement is not something which the Bank--either alone without its auditors or without any other party in the public sector--ought to undertake. I do not know whether it is intended, but if the Bank disregards a requirement, it has to say that it is disregarding the Bank's requirement, just as public companies have to say whether they are disregarding elements of the Cadbury rules, for example, which are not imposed by statute but by Stock Exchange requirements.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para10"></a>As my noble friend Lord Home pointed out, if the Treasury requires the Bank to produce such information, or comment on it at a later stage, it would be more embarrassing for the process to happen in that order. It would be better for it to have been thought through in discussions between the two before it reached that point. I hope the Minister will be receptive to that fact.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-40_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am certainly receptive to the idea that, as far as possible, the Bank should keep to Companies Act requirements. That is the objective of Clause 7 and is expressed clearly. It is, however, not always possible. It is really a matter of timing, which is what this amendment comes down to.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para11"></a>Under the Bill as drafted the Bank can, in subsection (4), disregard a requirement to which it is subject under subsection (3). Under subsection (7), as the noble Earl rightly pointed out, the Treasury can require it to provide information which has been excluded. The requirement, therefore, comes after the exclusion, whereas the amendment of the noble Earl would require that the permission of the Treasury should be obtained before the requirement is disregarded.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para12"></a>The point about this is a matter of timing. Although the Bank tries to keep to the Companies Act, it cannot give full disclosure because of the continuing need to keep certain support operations secret, if only for a short period of time. We must therefore have the let-out that it can exclude certain material but we provide, in subsection (7), the provision that it can ultimately be released in accordance with the Companies Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para13"></a>The noble Earl raised the question of whether this was a problem for the auditors, to which the answer is, "No, it is not". It is essentially what the Bank does at the moment. Note 1 to the Bank account spells out departures from the Companies Act requirements and the auditors currently sign off the accounts on that basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para14"></a>And on that basis, I invite the noble Earl to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-40_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Stewartby: </B>   Before my noble friend withdraws his amendment, if that is what he is going to do, I should like to refer to the point about timing. It may not have quite the weight given to it by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. The account will be in retrospect for an elapsed period and companies regularly have to have discussions with auditors about the disclosures in their accounts. Although there are certain matters in principle, such as those operations described by the noble Lord which it is perfectly proper that they should not spell out, that will be something already known because it will relate to a past period.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para15"></a>My view remains that, although the Bank should have the ability to disregard the requirement, under appropriate circumstances--I do not question that point at all--it remains somewhat doubtful whether there is this great constraint of timing. When I was in the Treasury, important decisions could be made quickly when necessary. It would surely be possible in such a case.
<P>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>to be the main concern of the noble Earl. However, if the noble Lord, Lord Stewartby, is concerned with support operations, I have to advise him that some could be sensitive for a number of years. The Bank does disclose them when they cease to be sensitive, which may be later rather than sooner. It is not a question of how quickly the Treasury can respond, but rather of when it is appropriate to do so.

<A NAME = "80303-40_para16"></a>If support operations are, for example, a category where that is appropriate, it is quite reasonable for the Treasury to have discussed it with the Bank and agreed that that area need not be disclosed. Clause (7)(5) clearly could go very wide. It could raise issues, unlike support operations, which are not routine--or not relatively routine--and which therefore it would be better to resolve at the time rather than in retrospect.

<A NAME="80303-40_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I do not think so. The wide drafting of subsection (7) is deliberate because it is concerned with other matters than those which are referred to in subsection (4).

<P>
<A NAME="80303-40_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Home: </B>   While it is certainly true to say that the main thrust of my concern was in relation to the auditing point, I hope that the Bank will bear in mind that it could actually be abusing potential powers if it refused to publish something that in the normal course of events would be required either in the public interest or by auditors.

<A NAME = "80303-40_para17"></a>For the time being, we have been round this course enough and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="80303-40_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish </B>   moved Amendment No. 16:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 5, line 15, leave out ("subject to that,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para22"></a>The noble Lord said: We now move on to Part II of the Bill which is the part relating to the Monetary Policy Committee, about which I believe we shall have some interesting debates. When I first looked at Clause 11 I was minded to put down an amendment to delete subsection (b). But then I thought I would be accused of wanting an independent central bank and all sorts of suspicions might then have come to the surface about whether I agreed with my party's policy on the euro or whatever. Therefore I decided that that was not the way to explore exactly how the clause hangs together. I am glad that I did not because I am flattered to see that the noble Lords, Lord Peston and Lord Barnett, have added their names.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para23"></a>I then decided to try to explore what the clause actually means by removing the words "subject to that". There was some discussion in the other place about "subject to that" and there will be some discussion here <P>


<a name="column_CWH48"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH48</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because, as I shall explain, I do not believe that the Committee stage in the other place finished with everybody entirely convinced about exactly what "subject to that" meant. I believe I know what it means: it means this.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para24"></a>The Monetary Policy Committee can support the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government, including their objectives for growth and employment, so long as that support does not conflict with maintaining price stability. That is what I interpret "subject to that" to mean in this category.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para25"></a>Whatever the consequences for the Government's economic policy, for growth, for employment or the exchange rate--and we will come to that later--it does not matter. The main objective of the Bank is to maintain price stability. If, as is now happening in Scotland, unemployment starts to rise as a result of increasing interest rates, as far as the Monetary Policy Committee is concerned, so be it. That is an unfortunate consequence, but the principal objective, if I may call it that, is to maintain price stability. And if growth begins to fall away and even cease altogether, again as long as price stability has been maintained that lack of growth will just have to be an unfortunate consequence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para26"></a>At Second Reading, I quoted from Mr. Robert Chote's writings in a Social Market Foundation pamphlet. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"One danger is that the economy will suffer if the Bank uses its interest rate policy to pursue low inflation while the Government uses budgetary policy to pursue employment, growth and votes. This is a recipe for high interest rate, excessive Government borrowing and an over-valued pound". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para27"></a>I suppose I might be told that excessive government borrowing does not happen at the moment, but one could argue that we have high interest rates and we certainly have a high, if not overvalued, exchange rate. So there is a potential for conflict, which nobody denied at Second Reading, between subsection (a)--maintaining price stability--and subsection (b)--supporting the Government's economic policy, including their objectives for growth and employment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para28"></a>I drew attention to the fact that one of the members of the other place, Diane Abbott, made the point very strongly, I believe, when she said that the Government were handing over one of the most important levers of economic power to an unelected quango. That is certainly true. There is no doubt about that. I equally pointed out--and this was in advance of the unemployment figures in Scotland showing the first upward turn for many months--that Mr John McAllion, in a comment he made, pointed to the Bank of England raising interest rates five times since the Government gave it control over monetary policy. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is a macro-economic policy being pursued by the Government and the Bank of England which seeks to slow down the economy and that is the problem". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para29"></a>He was discussing it in relation to unemployed young people and about welfare-to-work. It was suggesting that a possible slow-down in the economy and economic growth may mean that the Government's New Deal for the young unemployed will not in fact come about because of policies being pursued by the Bank in order to maintain price stability.
<P>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH49</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para30"></a>I have a suspicion--I hope the Minister will put me right on this because I hate to be suspicious--that subsection (b) is in here subject to that, and that is the qualification, as a bit of a sop to the Government's own supporters, not only in the House of Commons but perhaps in your Lordships' House, and certainly in the country. If the Government's case is that an independent central bank, pursuing objectives of price stability, is likely to have a better record than governments have had pursuing that policy, then why do we have subsection (b) in at all, subject to that or not subject to that?
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para31"></a>The noble Lord will probably point to Germany, where the central bank indeed has a good record of success, but there is a chicken-and-egg situation in Germany. The German experience of hyper-inflation has led them to fear inflation much more than do most people in this country. Indeed, one of the more disturbing things is to meet intelligent people who say that a little bit of inflation would do us some good. It seems to me that economic history suggests that that is a pretty fallacious argument.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para32"></a>One wonders about Germany, for example, if it is the Bundesbank and the independence of the central bank which has caused the low inflation, or if in fact they have been able to ride piggy-back, so to speak, on the deep dislike of inflation which has been burned into the German soul because of the experience they have had. It seems to me that all these problems come together in looking at this clause. If the Monetary Policy Committee looks at subsection (b), and at growth and employment, and says, "My goodness me, we are not actually fulfilling the Government's objectives"--I presume the Government's objectives (every government's objective) is to reduce unemployment, get more employment and to get growth, though some succeed better than others at times--"We had better do something about it", to what extent can it do something about it? If it conflicts with subsection (a) "to maintain price stability", my reading of this is that it cannot do anything about it at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para33"></a>Indeed, I believe I quoted the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, because the monetary policy of the Bank will have a number of economists on it. One could reasonably say they are all economists currently on the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank. As the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, said in his evidence to the Treasury Select Committee:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"One group of theorists believe that there is no particular medium-term relationship between the level of unemployment and the rate of inflation. Another group believes that the key relationship runs from the level of unemployment to the rate of inflation, and from this group monetary policy is a means of controlling the level of output and so controlling inflation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para34"></a>I am not an economist and I am looking forward to some of the other contributions, but with some division in the world of economists as to which of these things gives rise to the other, I am a little worried about the "subject to that" being in there. If it means what I think it means, I am pretty clear that maintaining price stability will be the principal objective of the Bank. On Second Reading of the Bill in the other place on 11th November there was an interesting exchange on this very subject <P>


<a name="column_CWH50"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH50</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>between Mr. Alistair Darling, the Chief Secretary and Mr. Wigley, the Member for Caernarfon, who intervened and said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Bill gives overriding priority to maintaining price stability. Growth and employment are subject to that. That differs from the approach in the United States, where the Federal Reserve has inflation, growth and employment targets of equal importance. The Government should not make employment subsidiary to the control of inflation, which appears to be the god on all occasions". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para35"></a>The Chief Secretary replied:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The right hon. Gentleman is mistaken. Clause 11 shows that the Government's objectives are high levels of growth and employment". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para36"></a>Mr. Wigley said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Bill says, 'subject to that'". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para37"></a>The Chief Secretary replied:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The right hon. Gentleman is reading it the wrong way round".--[Official Report, Commons, 11/11/97; col. 712.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para38"></a>The question is, and this is really what I have come to, whether he is reading it the wrong way round. If he is reading it the wrong way round, then it should be written the other way round. It should say, "The objectives of the Bank of England shall be to support the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government, including their objectives for growth and employment, and, subject to that, to maintain price stability".
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para39"></a>I am confused. When that was raised in Committee, I have to say that Mrs. Liddell did not do any better than Mr. Darling at explaining what it is. If these two good Scots could not explain it simply enough for me to understand, I am conceited enough to think there is something of a problem. I know how I read that. I read that to mean that if I were a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, my top line and bottom line objectives would be to maintain price stability. The other two objectives, and any others, would be secondary. I am sure that the noble Lords, Lord Peston and Lord Barnett, will try to tease out similar points, perhaps in a more economic-minded way than I have done.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para40"></a>I should just like some kind of explanation from the Minister, to clarify what I think was the confusion left, at least in my mind, and also in the minds of many Members of the other place, on the subject of what exactly Clause 11 means and how I should read it if I were a member of the Monetary Policy Committee. I beg to move.

<A NAME="80303-40_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, I do not want to tease my noble friend. I know the noble Lord loves to do that, but I am not that bothered. He said he was flattered that my noble friend Lord Peston and I had added our names to his amendment. I should tell the noble Lord that I do not know who thought about it first, but he got there first. For similar, although not entirely the same, reasons, we reached the conclusion that the deletion of those words from the Bill would make some sense. The noble Lord said that he did not want to delete the whole thing, because it might conflict with his party's policy. I should make it clear at the outset that I very much want to conflict with the policy of the noble Lord's party, and that of some of his noble <P>


<a name="column_CWH51"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH51</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>friends and right honourable and honourable friends in another place. I am sure I speak also for my noble friend when I say that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para41"></a>I will say something about the European Central Bank in a moment, but I am sorry that the noble Lord did not want to upset some of his friends. I am sure he would like to but, for some reason, he does not want to put it on record that he disagrees with them. I cannot imagine why, because it will be a long time before he will have any opportunity to get back into government. He could have expressed some conflict with his Front Bench in another place, and I am sorry he did not.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para42"></a>Let us come to the amendment. The amendment makes a great deal of sense, which is why my noble friend and I put our names to the amendment, although the noble Lord got there first. We would have put the amendment down ourselves if we had been as swift of foot as he was. However, we do not have a huge volume of support to enable us to read the Bill and decide what kind of amendments to put down.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para43"></a>The noble Lord says he is not an economist, and I understand that. In his words he does not want to be in conflict with his own party. He assumed that under the Bill as it stood, and he is quite right in my view, price stability--that is, inflation--takes priority. It is quite clear to me, and I believe I referred to it in the House the other day.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para44"></a>Clause 11(b) states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"subject to that", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para45"></a>that is, price stability, the objectives shall be,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to support the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para46"></a>If it is subject to that, unless my noble friend can give me some better interpretation, I do not mind agreeing with the noble Lord, Lord Mackay. He is right about that. What else can it mean? If you are instructing the Bank and the Monetary Policy Committee to support only the Government's economic policy, subject to maintaining price stability, that is what it means. I do not know what those words mean if they do not mean that. If they do not mean that, then I assume that my noble friend can accept the amendment without any problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para47"></a>It seems such a simple little amendment but it is rather important. I am delighted that the Official Opposition have tabled such an amendment. I do not know whether the noble Lord took advice from some of his right honourable friends in another place. I assume he did, because he would not do anything to be in conflict with them. Therefore, they agree with this amendment and the attainment of Her Majesty's Government's objectives for growth and employment. That takes us to a later amendment. I assume that the noble Lord and his Shadow Cabinet, long may it so remain, agree with this amendment. I believe my noble friend and I were rather surprised at that. When we went into the Public Bill Office, we did not expect that the noble Lord would already have put down such an amendment. However, he has, and I was delighted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para48"></a>In my view the Bank would take account of the government's economic policy with or without this amendment. I should tell the Committee that when <P>


<a name="column_CWH52"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH52</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I took my Select Committee to Frankfurt last week, we met and were entertained very well indeed by the President of the Bundesbank, Professor Tietmeyer--a charming man, if I may say so. I listened with great interest to what the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, said about the reasons that lie behind the German need, as they saw it, for this kind of policy, because of their fear of past inflation. They therefore put inflation above anything else, including government's economic policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para49"></a>This is on the record so I can tell the Committee that Professor Tietmeyer told us that if he happened to be President of the European Central Bank--and I gather he has neither that wish nor expectation--he would take account of the policy of ECOFIN, the European finance ministers, and their economic policy when pursuing a price stability target. However, as the Bill stands, the price stability target would clearly take priority, as the noble Lord rightly said, over the Bank's consideration of the government's economic policy. That concerns me, and I know it concerns my noble friend.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para50"></a>Given that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, felt obliged constantly to reiterate the five increases in interest rates, if they had still been in government by some miracle, I assume that they would not have increased interest rates at all because that was entirely in the hands of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Presumably, they do not believe that increases in interest rates necessarily control the rate of inflation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para51"></a>Speaking for myself, and I believe I speak for my noble friend as well, I certainly would not have increased rates to the degree that they have been increased. I certainly would not increase them any more. I am delighted to hear that the Opposition agree with that. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay, must have consulted them because he never wants to be in conflict with Conservative Party policy, whether it be on Europe or anything else. He is smiling in agreement with something; I am not quite sure what it is. He did not nod or shake his head; I would like that put on the record so we know where we stand. He does not agree with the interest rate increases that we have had so far, and therefore he and his party do not believe that increases in interest rates necessarily control price stability. That appears to be what he is saying, so in that sense he agrees with my noble friend.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para52"></a>However, this amendment is clearly one of the most important that has been tabled. Without this amendment, the Bank could ignore the Government's economic policy even if unemployment was rising because of the Bank's policy. If it was rising substantially, it would not matter; the Bank's primary consideration under the terms of the Bill has to be the control of price stability.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para53"></a>We have discussed how directors can be appointed and how they can be dismissed and not be dismissed. I know the present Governor of the Bank and I am pleased that he has been reappointed for another five years; and I know some members of the Monetary Policy Committee and some of the present directors of the Bank of England. I would hope, like Professor Tietmeyer, that in the case of the European Central Bank they would take account of the Government's economic policy. I would be very disappointed if they did not.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para54"></a>If the Government want to see them take account of their own economic policy, then why oppose this amendment? It is a simple amendment. All they have to say is that the Bank has to maintain price stability under Clause 11(a), and
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"support the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government, including its objectives for growth and employment". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para55"></a>I would have thought that my noble friend could certainly go along with that. Just as the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, speaks for his Front Bench, I am sure my noble friend would speak for ours. He has a great deal of flexibility in his ability to respond to this amendment, and I know he would be happy to see the Bank of England and its Monetary Police Committee maintain price stability and support the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government. Why not? Why should they not do both?
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para56"></a>It is a short and very simple amendment, but a very important one. The Bank of England and its Monetary Policy Committee should not do anything that would damage the Government's own economic objectives. It is not asking much of the Bank of England or the Government to do something that would ensure that their own economic policy is supported. I hope my noble friend will be able to accept the arguments about the need to control both inflation and the Government's own policy. In that sense, I strongly support the amendment itself, if not every positive and detailed word of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish.

We did not even get around to putting our name to it at all. Perhaps I should claim even more meagre resources, but we certainly support the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para57"></a>In the currently drafted form of the clause, the phrase "subject to that" does, first, suggest that subsection (b) is a sop. Secondly, it encourages the Monetary Policy Committee, in our view, to ignore any objective other than price stability and, as a result, it opens the prospect of it acting in a slightly more macho way in respect of interest rates. The case might be different if the committee had to explain how it had taken into account both (a) and (b), when reaching its decisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-40_para58"></a>We have heard eloquent arguments in favour of deleting the words "subject to that", to which I will not add, except to say that we too believe this to be an important and straightforward decision, which the Government could now make to give greater balance to the thought processes of the Monetary Policy Committee.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80303-41_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Stewartby: </B>   I find myself, surprisingly, not 100 per cent. satisfied by the arguments so far deployed. If you were a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, you would not know what to do if these words were removed. If you have two objectives, one hopes that they may, most of the time, be consistent with each other. There could, however, well be times when the Bank or the Monetary Policy Committee, or <P>


<a name="column_CWH54"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH54</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Treasury, or the Government, or Parliament, considered that they were not consistent. Under those circumstances, I am not sure how the members of the Monetary Policy Committee could conduct their responsibilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-41_para0"></a>I had understood my noble friend Lord Mackay to be probing for clarity on the apparent confusion which has been created by Mr. Darling and Mrs. Liddell in another place. It is interesting to have a debate on the balance of these two considerations. I am sure that the Monetary Policy Committee ought always to take account of the economic policy of the government of the day, including their objectives for growth and employment. However, it could certainly arise that there was at least a perceived conflict. Under those circumstances, I do not see how the Monetary Policy Committee could function. I am, therefore, somewhat sceptical about this otherwise highly popular amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-41_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I shall start with some preliminary remarks. I have no difficulty with finding my name on the same amendment as the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish. Equally, I share his puzzlement over the statements of my honourable and right honourable friends in another place. Indeed, one reason for supporting this amendment is that what they said, taken literally--though I begin to think we are all naive to read anything literally--was simply impossible. My noble friend the Minister will tell us about that, but I certainly could not make sense of what they were saying.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-41_para1"></a>My third preliminary remark is that I am sorry that this amendment has not been grouped with the next three. Some of my comments, as do those of any other noble Lord, arise with regard to all those amendments. If I stray, I can only promise to say less when we come to those amendments. Let me explain the reasons for that immediately.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-41_para2"></a>In order for Clause 11 to make any sense, we must know what we mean by price stability. So far, the noble Lords who have spoken assume they know the meaning. However, we require Clause 12 for that, because it contains the statement that the Treasury will tell us what price stability is to consist of. That brings in the word "may", on which we shall have a deeply philosophical argument about grammar and semantics in due course.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-41_para3"></a>I can only say that I read price stability as meaning that the average level of prices is constant and therefore that the rate of inflation is zero, but until I discover what it means from my noble friend I may be wasting my time completely because the Treasury may define price stability not to mean that the rate of inflation is zero.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-41_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   I know that my noble friend is a distinguished economist, and he will not mind my saying so. Zero is not what most people in government or banks think of as price stability. I hate to quote Professor Tietmeyer again and Herr Duisenberg, the head of the European Monetary Institute. They both feel <P>


<a name="column_CWH55"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH55</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it is anywhere between zero and 2 per cent. That is their view. And one of them may be an economist, I am not sure.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-41_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I wonder whether my noble friend has ever heard the expression "weasel words". I have been lecturing on this subject now for 40 years and I can tell him that price stability means a zero rate of inflation. I am perfectly well aware that a great many people, not least politicians and bankers, are terrified of actually facing up to what they themselves are saying. Therefore they interpret price stability to mean a low rate of inflation. I can only say that that is a contradiction in terms. Price stability means a zero rate of inflation and I believe the Treasury is about to tell us exactly what my noble friend has said: that it means by price stability a low rate of inflation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-41_para4"></a>We then run into a quite serious difficulty: why that number and no other number? That is again a subject on which I have been lecturing for a great period of time. We cannot talk about how (a) and (b) relate to each other unless we know what price stability means. There is quite a lot of stuff written on this, and one possibility is to follow the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, and say that (a) could not be incompatible with (b). Many economists will say that if we have no inflation, then the economy works perfectly: we get the optimum rate of growth of the economy and we get full employment. Quite a few economic textbooks contain that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-41_para5"></a>I happen to think that that is complete balderdash and that such an optimistic, rosy view of the way the economy works is not persuasive theoretically and it certainly is not confirmed by experience. Therefore we cannot take that optimistic view.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-41_para6"></a>One may then say that perhaps we mean that some low rate of inflation is compatible, and so on. Our difficulty with that is, which low rate of inflation is compatible and which is not? We are not told anything about that, and until we get an answer in practice, we do not know. My view is that any serious interpretation of an inflation objective must have--to use the word used by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Arbrecknish--the potential for conflicting with the Government's economic policy. If that is the case, we have to ask what would happen then: what does the clause then mean?
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-41_para7"></a>Again, my reading of the clause as it stands--and this is our difficulty, and my noble friend Lord Barnett is aware of it--is that if there is possibility of conflict, the conflict is resolved by the Monetary Policy Committee, which may take notice, in the sense that it is aware of the Government's objectives for growth and employment, but it then has to say "I'm sorry, but the objective is price stability; we have noted that they are in conflict, but price stability is what we have to go for".
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-41_para8"></a>Let me say en passant that I hope noble Lords have noticed the use of the word "including". Since it says,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"including its objectives for growth and employment", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-41_para9"></a>I should like to know what other objectives the Government might have in mind. It does not say "growth and employment"; it says "including". What else might we have to think about?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-41_para10"></a>I believe that putting the amendment down is important, and it is particularly important to ask about the conflict resolution. Another possibility is that it is the Government who will adjust; that the Monetary Policy Committee goes for the inflation objective and then the Government adjust their objective for growth and employment to fit that. I read nothing in the debates in the other place to say that the Government accepted that worrying view.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-41_para11"></a>I have one other remark to make before concluding, and that is to ask my noble friend whether the word "maintain" has any meaning. By that I mean that it does not say "to achieve price stability"; it says "to maintain price stability". Presumably in order to maintain it, sticking to the correct use of English, we have to achieve it in the first place and then maintain it. We must, therefore, ask the question, have we achieved it at the moment? In other words, when the Bill becomes law, as it will fairly soon, does it then follow that we have achieved price stability, which I believe is 2.5 per cent. as the mean, plus or minus &#189; per cent. or some such thing. Whatever it is, if that is defined as price stability and we have achieved it, we then have to maintain it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-41_para12"></a>My difficulty with this is, what will the Treasury be doing in the future? For example, is the Treasury capable of announcing in a couple of years, "We now define price stability as meaning a mean of 4 per cent. plus or minus 1"? I do not know if that is possible. It is certainly possible if price stability does not mean what it should correctly mean, namely zero, but any number that anybody comes up with. One can therefore see that the whole thing is rather blurred.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-41_para13"></a>It happens that I have one other difficulty. My firm belief in economic policy is that it is not a bad thing to keep certain things blurred. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, has had the privilege, which I have not had, of being a Treasury Minister, and he must know that a certain blurring around the edges helps to make policy rather better. I have difficulty in constructing a theoretical model that demonstrates that, but all my experience and intuition tell me that. Therefore, in pressing my noble friend Lord McIntosh for some answers, in another way I would rather not have all of them, because once they are written out it means that we cannot wriggle out of them ourselves when the time comes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-41_para14"></a>To summarise, I would like to argue that the objective of the Government is the maintenance of full employment; subject to that, the maintenance of maximum growth; and, thirdly, if it is compatible, having as low a rate of inflation as possible. If I were writing this, I would still be repeating the economics of the 1950s, which I have been teaching non-stop for 40-odd years, and I never find any reason to change that, because nothing has happened to convince me of anything being erroneous. I entirely agree with my noble friend Lord McIntosh on Keynes's comment that one changes one's mind when evidence or theory tells one to. Equally, I take the view that, when evidence and theory do not tell us to but convenience tells us to, then do not do it.

<A NAME="80303-42_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   This has been a nice discursive debate and I am grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part. Let me first of all deal with one false impression which may be gained. I admit that we have tried to group these amendments rather aggressively, but they have now been ungrouped rather aggressively to such an extent that the debate, for example, on the funding of the Bank of England was ruined by aggressive ungrouping and could not be taken seriously. Now, this debate has become ruined. The fact that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, has his name on the same amendment as my noble friends Lord Peston and Lord Barnett does not mean that they agree. It is simply that we are dealing with one part of the argument, rather than with the argument as a whole. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay, made it quite clear that his objective in leaving out the words "subject to that" would be to leave out the reference to high levels of growth and employment altogether, whereas my noble friends would prefer to have growth and employment put in as having equal status with price stability.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-42_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I do not think I said that. I said that when I considered how to have a discussion on the relationship between subsections (a) and (b) I wondered whether it would be easiest to knock out (b) and then just ask the Minister why he wanted (b), and explore the matter in that way. However, I decided that that would be construed as a move in the direction I intended, and therefore I proposed the deletion of "subject to that". If you take out the other things, it would be like saying that the people who run your monetary policy are trying to do that like a golfer with only one club.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-42_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The noble Lord distances himself from the implications of his own argument, if I may put it that way, even if he did not say what I accused him of.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-42_para0"></a>Let me set out as clearly as I can what we mean by Clauses 11 and 12. As the Bill says, the monetary policy objective of the Government is to maintain price stability and, subject to that, to support the Government's objectives for growth in employment. But in turn high levels of growth in employment will also create the conditions for price stability on a sustainable basis. There really is no other way of promoting and maintaining high levels of growth and employment other than in circumstances of sustained price stability.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-42_para1"></a>In the long run there is no conflict. Price stability is a necessary condition to ensure sustainable growth and high employment. There is evidence to suggest that high and variable inflation can actually damage growth and productivity. The framework is designed to ensure that price stability is the long-term objective of monetary policy.

<A NAME = "80303-42_para2"></a>At Second Reading I quoted Alan Greenspan in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony last year. That sets out the position very clearly. He said:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Our objective has never been to contain inflation as an end in itself, but rather as a precondition for the highest possible long-run growth of output and income--the ultimate goal of macroeconomic policy". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<A NAME = "80303-42_para3"></a>The Bundesbank has very similar requirements, although they are expressed in rather different terms. The Bundesbank is required to

<P>

<A NAME = "80303-42_para4"></a>That is comparable to price stability. It is also required by law to
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"support the general economic policy of the Federal Government, but only insofar as it can do so without prejudice to the performance of its own function, safeguarding the currency". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-42_para5"></a>That is in the Bundesbank Act 1957.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-42_para6"></a>Price stability and high employment go hand in hand. Achieving price stability will help to achieve high employment, and achieving high employment will help to achieve price stability.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-42_para7"></a>If I may anticipate my noble friend's question, I am sure he will then ask me, as he did, quite reasonably, why we do not give them equal status. Why do we not say "price stability and the Government's economic objectives"? I think we do so, and I am surprised to be able to call in aid the noble Lord, Lord Stewartby, but he is right. If we are to give targets to the Bank of England, we have to give it targets which are explicit and which do not involve internal contradictions, otherwise they will simply be warm words. Somebody used the term "weasel words". If we started to bring in all sorts of other targets--a later amendment is a target on exchange rates--this would be a target on growth and employment. The members of the Monetary Policy Committee would scratch their heads and say, "We have a choice. We can either protect one or the other. Which should we do? The Government have not told us which we should do". What we are saying here is that, for the reasons I have given, we give priority to price stability and we recognise that, subject to that, there should be support for the Government's other economic objectives.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-42_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I hope my noble friend will forgive me for interrupting, because I know how irritating it is when you are in full flow. If what he says is to make sense, then it seems to me that he would be just as happy with a wording of the Bill which said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The objectives of the Bank of England shall be ... to support the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government, including its objectives for growth and employment, and subject to that, to maintain price stability". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-42_para8"></a>In other words, if the two are simply always compatible and price stability is a means to an end, it could be done the other way around. I take it that it is this way round for a reason.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-42_para9"></a>My noble friend was more or less saying that price stability has priority when there is any conflict. Clearly I will read my noble friend's words in great detail, but I do not think, listening to them at this moment, that <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>they stand up. If they were to stand up then reversing the clause would work just as well, and I am certain that he will not accept reversing the clause.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-42_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am certain they are not, because then we would find the Monetary Policy Committee scratching its head even more. If they say, "Our first priority is to encourage and support high levels of growth and employment", then how do we do it? The means available to the Monetary Policy Committee are the setting of short-term interest rates. It is the setting of short-term interest rates which has the most direct connection with price stability, and the other objectives of government economic policy, according to this model, follow from that. But we do not go out to the ultimate objectives--what I recognise as being the ultimate objectives and what Alan Greenspan calls the ultimate objectives--and then come back to the means by which they are achieved.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-42_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord again, but I thought I was quite clear in what I was saying. I did not take the interpretation as the noble Lord, Lord Peston, took it. I took it to mean quite clearly what I think it means, but I am still puzzled because that is at variance with what Mr. Darling said when he said it was being read the wrong way round. Subsection (b) seems to me to be subsidiary to subsection (a), but Mr. Darling said that it was being read the wrong way round. The Minister said what I believe "subject to that" means, which is that price stability is the principal objective. That is okay, and then you can worry about the other things. That is maybe too simple, but I think that is what he is saying.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-42_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   That is right, because that is most closely within the power of the body which has the control of short-term interest rates. I have to take the Bill as I find it. I have not read the quotes from the Chief Secretary, but I base my arguments on the way in which the Bill has been framed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-42_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   I am not concerned about what the Chief Secretary says. I took down the words my noble friend used, "Price stability is necessary to support the objectives for growth and unemployment. They go hand-in-hand". If that is the case we do not need the words there. We can have it as the amendment suggests. Either one takes priority over another or they go hand-in-hand. Which is it? Is he saying that they go hand-in-hand or is he saying that one takes priority over the other?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-42_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   We are in danger of becoming theological in this argument, quite honestly. When I say that they go hand-in-hand, I mean that achieving price stability helps to achieve high employment, and high employment helps to achieve price stability. But in terms of what the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee has to do, we have to pick on something and that is price stability, because that is the measure that is most closely related to the powers of the Bank of England. Short-term interest rates are the responsibility given to the Bank of England by the <P>


<a name="column_CWH60"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH60</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Treasury, and they are given the power to set short-term interest rates with the direct responsibility set by the Government of maintaining price stability.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-42_para10"></a>I do not doubt that in the economic lectures of my noble friend Lord Peston it is impossible to interpret price stability as being a low level of inflation, but I am sure that he is correct in terms of economic theory that price stability means stability; in other words, zero inflation. We are not using the words in that sense. In the Bill we are saying the Government take responsibility for setting the inflation target which they think is appropriate and consistent with price stability. We have set that inflation target at 2&#189; per cent., and we said that in the first instance the Bank has to explain when the inflation target varies from 2&#189; per cent. by 1 per cent. either way. There is an open-letter system whereby if it varies more than 1 per cent. either way, it has to go much further and explain itself and say what it is going to do to get itself back into line.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-42_para11"></a>I return to the difference between setting high levels of growth and employment as a target and setting price stability as a target. Price stability is deliberately set in terms of short-term interest rates. It is in the long term that the two go hand in hand.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-43_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Perhaps I might just interrupt my noble friend once more. I promise him that it is the last time on this amendment. I understand fully what he says. He is having no difficulty in arguing his point, but I wonder if he appreciates the consequences. Taking a specific example: it may well be that the Monetary Policy Committee this week interpreting price stability in the way it does will raise interest rates. The result, many of us would predict, will be dampening down in aggregate demand in the economy, a slow-down in the rate of increase of gross domestic product and possibly a rise in unemployment. My noble friend Lord McIntosh of Haringey would say that that is all short term. All I am asking him to appreciate is that presumably that is short term. At least in the short term, since the Government cannot possibly want an increase in unemployment, we are saying that what we mean by compatibility is that in the long term those people will be back to work.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-43_para0"></a>I will not go back to the old cliche again that in the long term we are all dead, but in the short term, I remind my noble friend Lord Mackay, that those people are actually unemployed. Whatever one says about the long term, they are the ones that bear the cost. As long as noble Lords appreciate what this means, then we have done our job and clarified what the policy-making involved here will do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-43_para1"></a>I have an ulterior motive. What this applies to will apply to the European Central Bank under EMU, where I am much more frightened of what might happen with this kind of approach, much as I am a strong supporter of EMU. My point in intervening was to make sure that my noble friend understands what it is he is committing himself to when he says, as he is about to, that he rejects this amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-43_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am not committing myself to anything other than to what the Bill clearly states. There is no difficulty about understanding it. <P>


<a name="column_CWH61"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH61</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>We are setting the proximate target and we are providing the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee with the means--the control--of short-term interest rates in order to achieve that target, it is accepted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-43_para2"></a>Price stability is the most important contribution which monetary policy can make to sustaining high and stable levels of growth and employment. Other policies may make other contributions, but it is monetary policy which is the subject of the Bill and with which we are concerned today. Our legislation ensures that price stability is the primary objective, but subject to this goal the Bank must also support the Government's other economic objectives. That is the basis on which this has been framed, and that is why the words "subject to that" are necessary in the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-43_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I think we have had an interesting debate. I hope the Minister has not minded the teasing out of this. It is complex and it is absolutely central to what the duties of the Monetary Policy Committee are going to be. The Minister has clearly said that my interpretation of the clause appears to be the correct one. I will therefore ignore what the Chief Secretary said in the other place and listen to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey. If you are on track for (a), yes, you can worry about (b) and see what you can do about that, but you must be on track for (a). I was interested in the quote--and I will read it in detail--from the Bundesbank, because it seemed that the Bundesbank was doing exactly the same thing but the other way around. It was, however, still making monetary policy its principal objective.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-43_para3"></a>So I am a little wiser and even better informed after this debate. If I may say so to the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, my colleagues down the corridor, interestingly, had this debate around replacing the word "support" with "pursuing"--"to pursue the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government", which was quite an interesting nuance on what we have just discussed. For the moment, we will all read rather carefully in Hansard what the Minister has said and we may well return to it. I rather suspect, however, that I am more cheered by listening to him than are his noble friends. With that, I withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "80303-43_para7"></a>I thought that a good place to look for some sensible words that the Minister might not disagree with! I am telling him where I took them from, in case he does disagree with them!
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-43_para8"></a>I am, of course, adding another objective, which I am doing because the exchange rate is extremely important. British manufacturing industry at the moment would perhaps say it is one of the most important things for them. They are probably more concerned about that than about the interest rate rises themselves or their consequences. I know that the pound was rising while I was still a Minister. My recollection is that I twice had to respond to my noble friend Lord Paul who drew this to my attention as something which was damaging British industry. He asked what was the policy of the then Government on exchange rates.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-43_para9"></a>Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, for the Liberal Democrats, was on to this particular subject on a number of occasions. I could go on and point out a quote from the Birmingham Post about manufacturing industry in that part of the world being concerned about exchange rates. Looking slightly further ahead, although it is not down here, it does say "including" and I presume it must include exchange rates.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-43_para10"></a>What happens as we get nearer to EMU, which I feel pretty certain we will be joining, as I said before? I make no observation about the policy, simply that if we are to join it, is the pound to float right up to the point of joining? Will we be shadowing? Will we be in the ERM? Will that influence the Bank? Will it have to take that into account when looking at its primary objective of price stability?
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-43_para11"></a>I know the Minister may well not wish to specify too many things here and I remember these arguments on a number of occasions. The danger is that if you specify too much, it is assumed that anything not specified was not meant to be included. There is always that danger, which I appreciate. However, the Government have specified growth and employment. I am wondering why they have not decided to specify exchange rate, which is very dependent on the decision made by the Bank on price stability. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-43_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My judgment is that this is an important amendment and, although I was acerbic earlier, I am sorry that we did not discuss it under the general rubric of the objectives of the Government. I am particularly concerned about it because there is an interesting article in the Financial Times today pointing out precisely the consequences of using interest rates, I assume, to maintain price stability. This is what the Monetary Policy Committee is about. It appears that simultaneously in the economy, the economy at large is booming, in the sense that there is too much demand, which is the whole point of the restrictive interest rate policy. On the other hand, the manufacturing sector is well into recession, at least according to this article, and we have a most peculiar state of the economy which simply derives from the nexus between the interest rate and the exchange rate. I add again that in my view, in so far as monetary policy affects price inflation, it certainly does not do it directly. The original monetarist's view seems to me to be theoretically <P>


<a name="column_CWH63"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH63</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>preposterous and totally refuted by the available data. It does it either via the exchange rate or by damping down aggregate demand in any event.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-43_para12"></a>Going back to the earlier debate, although I do not wish to go into it in full detail, this is as good an example of the conflict as one could possibly imagine. Let us assume that the Monetary Policy Committee claims it can see some signs that the inflation rate may well be going up and beyond the band. Therefore, it feels that it has to tighten interest rates. Someone present then puts up his hand and says, "What about the objectives for growth and employment?", to which reference is made in Clause 11(b), and that would be true if the Bill were already law. He says, "Ah, but the words 'subject to that' appear. Therefore we have looked at it but the 'subject to that' provision says that we must give priority to price stability. Therefore, if that means destroying another bit of UK manufacturing industry, so what?". My noble friend Lord McIntosh believes that, in the long run, manufacturing industry somehow revives itself, but all the evidence is that it does not. It is damaged once and for all. That is precisely why what we have been debating is so important.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-43_para13"></a>Clearly, the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, does not want this on the face of the Bill; at least that is how I interpret it. He wants to air this as an example of the kind of problem that arises here. I am glad he does that but the point of it is so that my noble friend the Minister and his honourable and right honourable friends can reflect further on what this means. When we come onto the monetary consequences of fiscal policies, we shall be making similar points.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-44_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am afraid my answer will be very similar to that which I have already given for the reason that the amendments should have been grouped together. The fundamental answer is that the more objectives are set for the Monetary Policy Committee, the more prospect there is of conflict and the more you are saying to it, "Make up your own mind as between these two and the inter-relationships between them". That may be a proper subject for academic debate in the Monetary Policy Committee but it has something different to do: it has to set short-term interest rates.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-44_para0"></a>There is an additional reason why it would be unsuitable to put this onto the face of the Bill. Of course, the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, is right because he is quoting from an entirely reliable source. We all want a stable and competitive exchange rate over the medium term. Unfortunately, however, the exchange rate does not just depend on UK monetary policy. It depends also on the economic monetary policy of other countries and other factors that are not within the direct control of the Government or the Bank.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-44_para1"></a>In the longer term, the exchange rate depends on the underlying productivity of the economy relative to others. Of course, as recent experience shows, the exchange rate can move in the short term for reasons unrelated either to monetary policy or economic fundamentals. So if that is set as an objective, it is very <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>hard to see how the monetary policy could give effect to that objective. I hope the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-44_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am not entirely sure the amendment would have been better grouped with Amendment No. 16, because this amendment deals with the question of what do you define as being included in the word "including". I am not entirely sure whether or not the Minister has signalled, in a sort of Pepper v. Hart way that, yes, the Monetary Policy Committee can have a look at other issues, and one of those other issues may be the rate of exchange. He has explained to me quite rightly that the rate of exchange can be quite detached from our own economic policy.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-44_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I hope there is no question of Pepper v. Hart because I am trying very hard not to say anything new. The wording of the Bill states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subject to that, to support the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government, including its objectives for growth and employment". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-44_para2"></a>Clearly, therefore, the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government can change from time to time other than in growth and employment, and stable and competitive exchange rates are not of themselves excluded from that further consideration.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-44_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   They are not excluded. I take the caveat that it may be something quite unrelated to what is going on in this country that causes the exchange rate to move up or down. At the moment it is a combination of events.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-44_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   It is something that the noble Lord may not like, but, subject to our being outside of EMU, is a factor in what is happening to the exchange rate, not just interest rates.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-44_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I accept that. As I have said, there are those outside events and undoubtedly our decision on EMU seems to make our currency more attractive at the moment to some people. Whether that means that our decision not to be in is the right one or not, I do not know. Well, I do know: it is the right one. But whether that is the reason that it is the right one is another matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-44_para3"></a>The noble Lord wants to ask his noble friend a question. I had better let him because I am about to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-44_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   I just wanted to ask my noble friend whether I am correct in taking what he said as meaning that the reason the Bill is drafted as it is is to give the Monetary Policy Committee a simple objective, namely price stability, and for it not to be troubled about the Government's economic policy, exchange or anything else. My noble friend may correct himself, but he told us that he does not want to confuse the Monetary Policy Committee; he wants to give it a simple objective, namely price stability. Nothing else.

<P>
<A NAME="80303-44_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Peston </B>   moved Amendment No. 18:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 5, line 17, leave out ("may") and insert ("must").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-44_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: In introducing the amendment, let me say to my noble friend that he is being a little modest, which is uncharacteristic of him. Whether it is anything new or not, as far as I am concerned, as a student of these matters, he has thrown an enormous amount of light on a Bill with which I was having great difficulty. I do not want to commit him to any Pepper v. Hart interpretation, but I now understand quite a lot of the Bill that I did not understand before and certainly could not get from the debates in the other place. It is up to him whether he regards that as flattery on my part or, as the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, said, undermining his future career. I am sure that the former is the correct interpretation, again on Pepper v. Hart terms.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-44_para10"></a>Here is an amendment which I hope my noble friend will accept. He has already referred earlier to the "may"/"must" problem, let alone the "shall" problem. In the nearly dozen years that I spent on the Opposition Front Bench--rather less than my noble friend did--this sort of thing used to drive me completely potty. Someone once said to me, "You are a legislator, you ought to understand these things". I replied, "I am not a legislator, I am an economist". However, it appears that I am a legislator simply by agreeing to come to this place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-44_para11"></a>If I am a legislator, I believe that words ought to mean what they say, and I interpret "may" to mean "may not", I cannot think of the English language if "may" does not imply that the other possibility is "may not". That is why the word "must" is introduced into the language, to <P>


<a name="column_CWH66"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH66</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>differ from "may". And yet when I raised it before--and although I do not believe I have raised it with the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, I have certainly raised it with one or two of his noble ministerial friends--they kept saying, "That shows what an idiot you are. 'May' does not mean 'may', it means 'must', and then I would say, "Why then does it not say 'must'?", and then I would get some argument that I never understood.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-44_para12"></a>My view--and this follows very much from what my noble friend has already said--is that the Monetary Policy Committee cannot operate unless the Treasury gives it the answers to the questions in Clause 12. Therefore "may" has to mean "must". Can you imagine the Monetary Policy Committee saying, "Oh dear, Treasury, what does price stability consist of?". "We are not going to tell you. If you don't know we will not tell you", which is the way one sometimes treats one's children. Therefore, the Treasury must, by notice in writing, do these things. It then makes sense that the word "shall" appears a few lines later.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-44_para13"></a>It may well be that the genius of a parliamentary draftsman yet again has written something for my noble friend which he will read out, and we will all nod sagely and pretend we understand it. I can only say that I understand it, within the limits of the language on which this country has based its history, and I think the word should be "must". I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-44_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I shall be brief. I fully accept that I may have erred on this issue before, and it drove me to despair as a Minister. Clarity is everything. I have always thought I knew what "may" meant, and I do not think it means "must". Interestingly enough, subsection (3) reads,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where the Treasury give notice". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-44_para14"></a>Now that implies that there may be circumstances where it does not give notice. I am with the noble Lord, Lord Peston, on this one, and I do not wish my previous convictions to be taken into account.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-44_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   This is one of those occasions where I think I understand it, and if I understand it, then it seems to me anybody can understand it. Now it is a question of whether I can explain it. It does indeed say "may" in Clause 12(1), but Clause 12(2) requires,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Treasury shall specify ... both of the matters", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-44_para15"></a>at least once a year,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"before the end of the period of 7 days beginning with the day on which this Act comes into force, and at least once in every period of 12 months"; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-44_para16"></a>thereafter, in effect. So there is a requirement on the Treasury to do that once a year. There is a power in Clause 12(1) for the Treasury to do it more often if it wants to, and that is why the Bill says "may". The objective of my noble friend in putting down this amendment is achieved by Clause 12(2).<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-45_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I must congratulate my noble friend. That is masterly! I have to tell him I have always thought of myself as a Smart Alec, but it never occurred <P>


<a name="column_CWH67"></a>

<B>3 Mar 1998 : Column CWH67</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to me that Clause 12(1) meant several times, and Clause 12(2) then said at least once a year. If that is what it is meant to mean, I could write a clause which said that in those terms and did not require the genius of my noble friend to explain it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-45_para0"></a>Before withdrawing the amendment, could I ask my noble friend whether that is a Pepper v. Hart intervention?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-45_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   Could I ask my noble friend the Minister--and I entirely take his point--in that case, why can he not accept the amendment?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-45_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey:  </B>   Because it is unnecessary, and because it achieves something which would not necessarily be achieved by "must".
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-45_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   Would it do any harm?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-45_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Yes. Unnecessary amendments do harm.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-45_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I am sorry to pursue this, but on my noble friend's interpretation it is not an unnecessary amendment, assuming he accepts that he has now placed in the proceedings of your Lordships' House the definitive interpretation of this clause. I ask him again, in terms, whether the definitive interpretation of this clause is that "may" means several times and "shall" means at least once.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-45_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   No. "May" does not mean several times; it opens up the possibility of more than once, but it does not mean several times.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-45_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   "May" means the possibility of several times, and "shall" means at least once. Can I ask for confirmation of that and then I shall sit down?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-45_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Clause 12(2) means once a year and it is quite explicit. As to "other occasions", that possibility is opened up by Clause 12(1).
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-45_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Perhaps I may intervene. I absolutely accept that, but it would be a great deal easier if subsection (2) were first. That is the normal procedure: once a year, this has to be done, and then subsections (1) and (3) which is "and other times". It is just a drafting point, but I understand how the draftsmen work.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-45_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am happy to seek the draftsmen's opinion on that point.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-45_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I am truly indebted to my noble friend Lord McIntosh of Haringey for those answers which makes the whole day's proceedings seem so worthwhile. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(c) what the monetary consequences of its fiscal policies are likely to be.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80303-45_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: It is clear what I am asking here. When the Treasury gives its notice in writing, of what is price stability to be taken to consist and what is taken to be the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government? I would add a third paragraph, if there are to be three paragraphs: what are the monetary consequences of the Government's fiscal policy likely to be? That would be an indication to the Bank and to the Monetary Policy Committee how they ought to look at their conduct of monetary policy. I could go on a bit longer, but that is sufficient for the Minister to give me an indication of this additional point in the letter that the Treasury will send to the Bank. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303-45_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   What a pity! I was prepared to make a very long speech in response to this extremely important and complicated amendment, but now I shall not be able to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-45_para3"></a>Monetary and fiscal policy together affect the level and distribution of demand. The separation of monetary policy from fiscal policy is a discipline against excessive expansion. It is the discipline which Government impose on themselves against excessive expansion and against rising interest and exchange rates. The important point to be recognised is that neither the Governor, nor the Bank, is responsible for setting goals for both monetary and fiscal policy: monetary policy through the specification of the inflation targets, and fiscal policy through its own normal actions. There is no intention of making the two inconsistent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80303-45_para4"></a>The Government intend to pursue both a prudent fiscal policy and the goal of price stability in order to achieve the goal of overall stability in the economy. The Government are not intending to do the Bank's job, which would be the implication of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish.

On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

250,000 of whom owned or rented a second home in Great Britain in 1996-97. This figure excludes second homes owned or rented in Great Britain by people living abroad or in Northern Ireland. The information is from the Survey of English Housing and the ONS Omnibus Survey.

<P>

<A NAME = "80303w02_para2"></a>During 1996-97, 61 per cent. of households in Great Britain lived in accommodation which had three or more bedrooms. For this same year, among families in Great Britain with two or more dependent children, 13 per cent. of these families lived in accommodation with fewer than three bedrooms.

<A NAME = "80303w02_para3"></a>These statistics are taken from the 1996 General Household Survey for Great Britain. Equivalent data are not compiled for the United Kingdom.

<P>
<UL>In view of the latest figures published by the Treasury on 12 February on the compensation paid to the 600,000 people who were mis-sold personal pensions and the warning by the Economic Secretary that in some cases they still leave much to be desired, what further progress has been made in this matter.[HL670]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303w02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The Government's objective is to see that all those investors who were mis-sold a personal pension receive prompt redress. To this end, the Government have since June 1997 collected and published each month figures from the firms with most cases to review, showing the progress each has made. The latest figures, covering the period to the end of January 1998, were published on 12 February.

<FONT SIZE=3>These show that progress continues to be made, with 60 per cent. of their cases requiring review resolved. Most of the firms concerned have now resolved over half the cases identified for priority review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80303w02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Only services performed in the course of the construction of a building are zero-rated. The services of architects and surveyors are not regarded as being directly connected to the actual construction of a building and are therefore excluded from zero-rating.
