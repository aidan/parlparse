<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether, in the light of financial hardship being experienced by medical and dental students, they will make available to them enhanced loans during their clinical training.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment   (Lord Henley): </B>  My Lords, the Government have no plans to increase student loans for medical students. An extra allowance is payable, as part of the mandatory award, to students who attend their courses for longer in the academic year than normal. We know of no compelling reasons why medical and dental students should be treated more favourably than other students on long courses.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may couple my thanks to the Minister for that Answer with congratulations to him on his new appointment, as expressed yesterday by the noble Lord, Lord Quirk. However, I find the Minister's Answer disappointing. I hope that he will be able to think again in the light of the fact that medical, dental and veterinary students work long hours for 48 to 50 weeks a year in their clinical courses and therefore have no opportunity to supplement their grants by part-time employment. Is the Minister aware that although graduates in the medical and dental professions cannot aspire to the levels of income now being commanded by certain captains of industry, it is nevertheless unlikely that they would have any difficulty in repaying an enhanced loan?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the second part of the noble Lord's question. Such students would obviously have no problems in repaying any loan, but there would still be a cost to Her Majesty's Government and such costs have to be taken into consideration by my right honourable friend when she allocates resources in the department. Quite frankly, my right honourable friend does not see this as a priority. On the first part of the noble Lord's question, I can assure him that, as I made clear in my original Answer, an extra allowance is payable to students whose courses last for more than 30 weeks a year. In the case of a student whose course lasts for 45 or 46 weeks of the year and who studies in London and away from home, that could amount to an extra &#163;1,650 a year. That is a not inconsiderable sum on top of the other grants and loans that are available.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Robson of Kiddington: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister explain the reasoning behind the fact that in the first and second years of clinical studies a student is entitled to &#163;1,375 as a loan but in the third year, for some inconceivable reason, that sum is reduced to &#163;1,005? What is the reasoning behind that reduction?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, the reasoning is that for the first two or however many years, the loan covers the whole year, whereas in the final year it does not cover the whole year, but only nine months.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, I begin by welcoming my noble friend to his new position and congratulating him on it. However, is he aware that from November 1994 the chairman of the British Medical Association, Dr. Macara, was repeatedly urging the former Under-Secretary of State, my honourable friend Mr. Tim Boswell, to recognise the special needs and urgent problems of medical students but that his proposal that the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary of State should meet the representatives of medical students was refused and that nothing was done to address their problem? Does my noble friend further agree that, given the serious drop-out rate for medical students and the consequent need to employ foreign doctors, it is both unacceptable and unwise to refuse to listen to such legitimate concerns? May we have an assurance that the Government will listen now and act?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I appreciate my noble friend's concern but these matters were pretty fully explored in correspondence between my right honourable friend and my honourable friend the former Minister for Further and Higher Education and I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by a subsequent meeting. If my noble friend wishes, I can place that correspondence in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Lockwood: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister recollect that when the Select Committee on Science and Technology reported to this House on priorities in the National Health Service, it was concerned about the withdrawal of funding for intercalated Bachelor of Science degrees for medical students? Can the Minister say whether the Government have reinstated some of the bursaries for such degrees? If they have not done so, do they accept that that is one of the important reasons why medical students should be treated differently from university students on ordinary three or four-year courses?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, where the intercalated year is an integral part of the medical degree course, it forms part of the course for awards purposes and payments made under the appropriate regulations. Where it is optional, students have instead to seek discretionary support, principally from the Medical Research Council but also from their own local education authorities. Therefore, it is a matter for their LEAs. Discretionary support for an intercalated year will not affect a student's entitlement to mandatory support for other periods of study on his medical course.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Morris of Castle Morris: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may join the chorus of those who congratulate the Minister on his new appointment and wish him well in it. Will he tell the House exactly what legislative action would be required to give power to the Student Loan Company to increase by agreed amounts loans available to medical, dental and veterinary students? Would it not be&#151;to use a famous phrase&#151;a price worth paying to achieve parity for that valuable category of students?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, we are not talking about achieving parity. Medical and dental students are treated now in the same way as other students. I made it clear that we do not see their needs as being more pressing than those of others, and so we do not see a case for devoting extra resources to them. Nor do we see a case for expanding, at considerable cost, the level of grants to all students on long courses.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Morris of Castle Morris: </B>   My Lords, since we might have a minute, while I thank the Minister for that reply, will he answer the question that I asked and tell us what legislative action would be required to give powers to the Student Loan Company to increase its grants?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I shall have to write to the noble Lord as to whether we need primary or secondary legislation or whether it is something within the gift of my right honourable friend. The simple point I was making&#151;clearly, I thought&#151;was that we do not see a case for extending grants to that one class of students or, for that matter, any students doing long courses.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that in some parts of the country there is a serious shortage of dentists and that some of those who are practising have very long waiting lists? Therefore, in giving further thought to the matter will he ensure that enough dental students are forthcoming?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I shall look at that case, which goes somewhat wide of my responsibilities. I do not believe that arrangements for grants and loans to medical and dental students have led to more drop-outs of medical and dental students. It is not the fault of the grant system that there are not enough dental or medical students.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spnew14"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, may I, as one whose concern with student hardship is well known to the Minister, ask him to accept that this is an altogether different and more serious case? Most students now spend as long in the labour market as they do in their studies. These cannot; they are therefore much more hard up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I appreciate that in their clinical years medical students cannot take time off to find other jobs. They therefore qualify for an extra allowance which, as I made clear, in the case of London students staying away from home can amount to an extra &#163;1,650 a year, which is a not inconsiderable sum in addition to the loans and grants of which they are already in receipt.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spopq1"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they have figures for discards by the British fishing fleet of (a) undersized fish and (b) fish banned from being caught.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office   (The Earl of Lindsay): </B>  My Lords, the marine laboratory at Aberdeen has collected discard data from the mid-1970s. The data are published in aggregate form through the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea and guide its advisory committee on fishery management when reporting to the European Commission and others. Its advice allows total allowable catches to be set after due allowance has been made for fish mortality and discarding.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199495/ldhansrd/vo950711/text/50711-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, I asked how much the percentages were and not who published the figures. Will my noble friend please tell me what are the figures?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, the figures are necessarily complex because they deal with different types of fish from different parts of the sea. Therefore, while the original data go straight to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, as I said, so that its advisory committee can analyse them, the data which are more useful for everyone probably relate to the broad percentages of discards of different types of fish.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, what are the percentages?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, in haddock and whiting fisheries, discards amount to some one third of those catches but, for instance, in cod discards the percentage is very much lower.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister accept that he is having a difficult baptism on his first appearance at the Dispatch Box in charge of fisheries and agriculture? Perhaps I may welcome him to the Dispatch Box. In order to make an early name for himself, will he introduce legislation to ensure that all the undersized fish do not go to the chip shop where I buy my fish and chips?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his kind thoughts. Any fish which cannot be landed legally in this country are, on the whole, not landed. So the undersized fish that he might get in his fish and chip shop may come from another source.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Caldecote: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the size of fishing net mesh is a most important factor in the control of fish stocks? Does he believe that enough emphasis is given to the enforcement of the size of fishing net mesh?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend has raised a very important point. Since 1992 we have been conducting initiatives on the different configurations of mesh. For instance, the UK pioneered the square mesh panels in nets which have had considerable benefits. The <P>


<a name="column_1467"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1467</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>European Union last revived the technical conservation rules in 1992. The Commission has agreed to re-examine the rules, including the mesh sizes used in western waters, in time for the Council to reach decisions by the end of December 1995.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   My Lords, I too congratulate the Minister on his new appointment. Of course, we have met before when discussing other matters.
<P>

<a name="50711-02_para0"></a>This is a difficult problem and the fact that fish are thrown back and are of no use to anyone except a number of sea birds almost defies common sense. The average person has great difficulty in understanding what it is all about. Do Her Majesty's Government still reject the abolition of discards on the ground of cost? Will the Minister seek a fresh opinion as regards the recently established common fisheries policy advisory group, assuming that the group will continue its work following the changes that have taken place in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food? I am sure that all noble Lords will find difficulty in understanding why we are throwing good fish back.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his kind thoughts. We certainly have met previously in discussions on a number of different matters. It is generally impossible, in particular in the North Sea mixed fisheries, to have totally clean catches of a single species or size of fish. That is because the different species such as cod, haddock and whiting of all ages and sizes often shoal together and are therefore caught together. Fishermen discard fish either to comply with fisheries regulations relating to quota uptake or the minimum landing size or because poor markets exist for fish of certain species, sizes or quality.
<P>

<a name="50711-02_para1"></a>Our reluctance to ban discarding has nothing whatever to do with cost. If one were to ban discarding, in particular in the North Sea where the catches are mixed, one could not penalise fishermen for landing undersized fish or fish of a stock for which the quota has been exhausted. The review of the CFP, which is undertaken by a special group, is continuing. We are drawing into the group the expertise of the industry and its recommendation will be put forward to the Commission in due course.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew10"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that outside the plaice box in the North Sea the amount of fish discarded from the trawlers which wait for the fish to come out to them is up to 90 per cent.? Is my noble friend further aware that some estimates put the total discard of fish at up 50 per cent? If that is the case, is it not a crazy way to run a conservation policy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew11"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I can only reiterate that within the North Sea it is impossible to avoid discards. Even discards have some place in the marine eco-system. It has been estimated, for instance, that up to 1 million sea birds in the North Sea survive on discards.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister not agree that the discarding of undersized fish <P>


<a name="column_1468"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1468</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>does nothing for the conservation of fish stocks? Will the Government consider expanding the decommissioning scheme, thereby reducing the effort?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew13"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, there have been two decommissioning schemes to date and we have recently announced a third. The Council of Ministers has asked the Commission to bring forward proposals to address the problem of discarding. However, as regards these waters, we have already taken measures to prevent discarding. MAFF is funding trials into the use of, for instance, separated trawls. All those measures should produce the required percentage of discards.

<A NAME="50711-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they are prepared to reconsider their view of the proposed sinking of the "Brent Spar" in the Atlantic in view of European and worldwide reaction.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Fraser of Carmyllie): </B>  My Lords, Shell UK announced on 20th June that it would not be proceeding with deep-sea disposal of the "Brent Spar".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the Minister on his new appointment. Is he aware that when I raised the matter on 12th June 1995 (Hansard, cols. 1537 to 1538) the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, answered on behalf of the Government and listed a number of conventions which the Government are pledged to uphold? They are being amalgamated into the OSPAR Convention, which will cover the whole issue. Will the Minister give an undertaking that when the convention is signed it will be honoured in order to maintain a rationale on the disposal of such drilling apparatus? Will each case be decided by the Government on its merits?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Dean, for his welcome. It is correct that the United Kingdom's decision was fully consistent with the requirements of international law and, in particular, the provisions of the London and Oslo conventions of 1972. Furthermore, it was in line with the provisions of the Oslo convention's guidelines on the disposal of offshore installations. We shall certainly adhere to those conventions and, as indicated, we shall treat each case on its merits.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that there are two worrying aspects to the "Brent Spar" episode? First, there was the sudden decision by Shell, an independent company, to change its policy purely as a result of pressure from people who are becoming increasingly irresponsible in their demonstrations, contrary to what it believed to be the right policy and with the complicity of the German Government. The second and more worrying aspect is that offshore rigs have operated in the North Sea for more than 30 years <P>


<a name="column_1469"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1469</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and there are more than 100 in European waters and thousands around the world. Is there an agreed policy within the international community for the inevitable disposal of those rigs?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, as regards the first issue, it remains the view of the Government that in the case of "Brent Spar" a deep-water disposal was the best option. I believe that Shell still adheres to that view. However, the European companies of the Royal Dutch Shell Group found themselves in a difficult position. I understand that for that reason a reversal of the original decision was made and that Shell is taking some time to reconsider the options.
<P>

<a name="50711-02_para2"></a>It is difficult to assess how many rigs might be appropriately disposed of in deep water. As I indicated, our policy is that it is correct to do so on a case-by-case basis. However, an Answer given in another place yesterday indicated that of approximately 32 fixed offshore installations in United Kingdom waters 19 are in water less than 75 metres deep and therefore will have to be entirely removed. It should not be assumed that all of them will be appropriately disposed of in deep water. It is more likely that they will be returned to the shore for breaking up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister answer the question? Is there an agreed international policy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-02_spnew19"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Order, order!
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199495/ldhansrd/vo950711/text/50711-03.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, is it not a fact that the polluting effects of the "Brent Spar" would have been negligible compared with those of a large number of ships which have sunk in the same waters? Is it not ironical that the Germans of all people should be making trouble about the issue when one recalls that U-boats littered these waters with sunken ships?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, there is more metal at the bottom of the Atlantic than in the "Brent Spar" installation. Certainly, the North Atlantic is not to be regarded as a garbage dump of infinite capacity. However, on a case-by-case basis, some rigs may be suitable for disposal. Perhaps the noble Lord noticed with interest, as did I, that Nature magazine of 29th June indicated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Far from finding heavy metal residues lethal or mildly unappetising, the bacteria on the ocean floor would have greeted the arrival of the Brent Spar as if all their Christmases had come at once".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-03_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, is the short answer to the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, to say that two wrongs do not make a right?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, I am not aware of any scientific evidence or argument which indicates that the decision taken by the United Kingdom following the application by Shell was wrong. While there have been a number of reactions from Europe, so far as I am aware no one has come forward with a serious scientific basis on which to reject the proposal to which the United Kingdom agreed.

<P>
<A NAME="50711-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos: </B>   My Lords, in view of the global implication placed before us so effectively by the Minister, to what extent is the matter now being discussed by the United Nations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, the decision that we took was in accordance with international law and the conventions to which we are signatories. They apply on a global basis. The noble Lord may be aware that recently a number of European countries suggested that there might be a moratorium on the disposal of such installations in deep water. Those who proposed it did not have offshore installations. Both the United Kingdom and Norway, which clearly have to deal with a difficult problem often in complicated circumstances, declined to reach that decision. There is a set of guidance notes in which we are indicating that as we review the matter we shall act in accordance with the International Maritime Organisation guidelines which apply on a worldwide basis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend confirm that "Brent Spar" is not a rig or a platform but is unusual in that it is a loading container buoy? Its disposal on land will produce more environmental problems. Has he noted the reported comments of a technically qualified member of the Advisory Committee on the Protection of the Sea, which has international membership and which I chaired for four years, to the effect that to aim for publicity only at the expense of facts and sensible decisions is a disservice to the whole environmental movement?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, I strongly endorse that. My understanding is that it may be six times more dangerous to try to dispose of "Brent Spar" on land. It is of such a size that it cannot be brought into United Kingdom coastal waters in a vertical position. If it is to be disposed of on land, a clever engineering solution will have to be found to the problem of getting it onto a horizontal plane.

That exceeds the target we set a year ago and will have a major impact by enabling large numbers of women and men in developing countries to choose if and when to have children; to protect themselves from HIV and other sexually transmitted infections; and by reducing the risks associated with childbirth.

As distinct from all the other Ministers who have been congratulated on their new posts, perhaps I may say that some of us are extremely relieved to find that the noble Baroness retains her portfolio.

Does she accept that the figures that she has just given show a remarkable increase&#151;something like a doubling in support over five years?

<A NAME="50711-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Viscount and your Lordships' House for the rather welcome endorsement of my remaining in place. Of course, the issue is still urgent because 254,000 children are born each day; that is, 176 each minute. That means that our current world population of 5.6 billion will increase by 1,000 million in the next decade and then increase further. Therefore, in the next century, the world population may triple. That is why the matter is so urgent.
<P>

<a name="50711-03_para0"></a>We are doing more than we had expected and I am glad that it will not be at the expense of other projects in the social field but will be from savings made and money diverted to that very important task. I shall continue to enthuse as many people as I can wherever I go because the world food stocks simply will not meet even the current needs of the population in overcrowded countries. As those numbers increase, the situation, pressure and perhaps person-to-person violence will get worse unless we take real action on family planning.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that it is generally understood that the education of women is probably the most important single item in improving the population situation? What are the literacy rates for women in India, Pakistan and sub-Saharan Africa? How much money is earmarked for that purpose in the aid programme?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I should love to be able to give those figures to the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, but I do not have them in my population and family planning file. I do not wish to misinform her. I shall write to her and put a copy of the letter in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Flather: </B>   My Lords, the Minister is going to the Beijing conference. We know that there is a lot of pressure there to turn around the agenda from the Cairo conference. I believe that at the preliminary conference certain issues are to be taken up and earmarked to be debated which we thought had been accepted by everybody because they were the main issues accepted at the Cairo conference. Will my noble friend explain what would happen if the worst came about and some of those matters were turned around and not accepted at the conference in Beijing?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-03_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, the main purpose of the Cairo conference was to promote sustainable development and slow population growth through strategies for better reproductive healthcare, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>including access to family planning. It is essential that all the gains that we have made at the Cairo conference are carried forward in Beijing. I have every confidence that people around the world will be sufficiently sensible to see that that happens.
<P>

<a name="50711-03_para1"></a>I understand the anxiety shared by a number of noble Lords that some aspects of the Cairo conference may be slightly endangered. However, I can fairly say to my noble friend that there are enough people around who know the score. I shall not speculate about a negative possibility when I am working flat out for a positive outcome because that is what the women and men of the world want. They want access to family planning help and for women to be treated on a par with men. That is what we hope the conference at Beijing will deliver.

<P>

<a name="50711-03_para2"></a>Perhaps I may say one or two things in general about this Bill on the subject of this Motion before we consider the Commons Amendments in full, as the list is fairly compendious.
<P>

<a name="50711-03_para3"></a>I stand here with a certain amount of temerity. Some of your Lordships have had cause to be deeply involved with the Bill in its earlier stages. That has not been my good fortune so far, as I have been involved with other matters. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, will avoid the temptation of treading all over the "new boy" and inadvertently thereby over the Government as well. The noble Lord is a kindly person and I am sure that that would be far from his mind. But in case it did enter the inner recesses of his mind, I hope that he will exorcise it forthwith.
<P>

<a name="50711-03_para4"></a>The list of amendments is pretty formidable. However, a very large proportion of them meet concerns which were expressed by your Lordships before. As a listening, caring government, we listened to your Lordships and took the opportunity of the Bill's passage in another place to table amendments to meet the concerns of your Lordships. I hope in that respect at least that we shall receive some brownie points.
<P>

<a name="50711-03_para5"></a>Air pollution was an issue on which many of your Lordships felt strongly. The noble Lords, Lord Lewis of Newnham and Lord Nathan, and my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding, among others, all spoke with much conviction. We have now brought forward important new clauses introducing an air quality strategy.
<P>

<a name="50711-03_para6"></a>We have also introduced a new clause and substantial schedules on old minerals planning permissions, which I hope will meet the concerns expressed by my noble friends Lord Addison, Lord Glenarthur and Lord Campbell of Croy.
<P>

<a name="50711-03_para7"></a>The contaminated land provisions have been substantially amended, and I think improved, in the light of comments and concerns which were raised by your Lordships. In particular, we have removed the separate <P>


<a name="column_1473"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>identification and handling of closed landfills, as was suggested by my noble friends Lord Lucas of Chilworth, Lord Crickhowell and Lord Mills.
<P>

<a name="50711-03_para8"></a>We have introduced arrangements for consultation and negotiation on remediation requirements, as was suggested by my noble friend Lord Coleraine; and we have refined the provisions relating to liabilities, which were the subject of amendments moved by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, and my noble friend Lord Kinnoull.
<P>

<a name="50711-03_para9"></a>Other amendments address matters which were raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, on water conservation; by the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, on spray irrigation; by the noble Lord, Lord Moran, on fish gratings, and by my noble friend Lord Wade on combined heat and power.
<P>

<a name="50711-03_para10"></a>Having considered some of the points which were made by my noble friends Lord Crickhowell and Lord Mills, we have also made some amendments to the agency provisions. The Government have also accepted one of the two amendments on which your Lordships voted when the Bill was laid before your Lordships earlier, even though it was against the Government's preference. We have made further amendments in order to clarify the amendment which was originally tabled by my noble friend Lord Stanley and which was accepted by your Lordships, and also to bring the Scottish provisions into line with it.
<P>

<a name="50711-03_para11"></a>In discussing these amendments, I hope that your Lordships will feel that the Government have come a long way to meet many of the desires of your Lordships and that the Bill will be much improved as a result.
<P>

<a name="50711-03_para12"></a>I apologise for the list of amendments, which I am sure that many of your Lordships, as I did, found mildly daunting. But many of them are connected and we shall be able to speak to a great many at a time, according to the way in which they are grouped, if that is to the convenience of your Lordships. I point out that those are the reasons why the list is as long as it is.

We have had many debates and I am sure that the noble Earl in his new capacity has read through all of them with the greatest of interest.

<P>

<a name="50711-03_para14"></a>However, I find 337 amendments coming before your Lordships this afternoon rather a heavy menu. Your Lordships may remember at Second Reading I described this Bill as a curate's egg&#151;good in parts and bad in others. The putative curate&#151;I cast the noble Earl in that role&#151;may now be satisfied with the Bill he is putting before us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hilton of Eggardon: </B>   My Lords, this is indeed a long list of technical amendments, but there is one in particular which I wish to bring to the attention of the House and to ask the Minister to explain in slightly greater detail. I refer to Amendment No. 13, which appears to give very wide-ranging and extensive powers to Ministers. It appears to suggest that a Minister may order the agency to do anything he chooses
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"under this section or any other enactment".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-04_para3"></a>That is an extraordinarily wide power and grants to a Minister, who may find some obscure and irrelevant piece of legislation unrelated to the agency's functions, the power to direct the agency to act on it.
<P>

<a name="50711-04_para4"></a>In this arena we are back to the problem of the agency not being given an overriding, overarching purpose which would confine the actions which a Minister might wish to take under this particular measure. We had long debates at earlier stages of the Bill that the agency is given no specific purpose in existing at all. Indeed, its purpose, as laid down by the Bill, is to carry out the <P>


<a name="column_1475"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1475</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>functions transferred or assigned to it under the Bill. We have spent many hours arguing that it should have some specific role to protect or enhance the environment. It is this defect in the Bill&#151;the fact that the agency has no specific function&#151;which makes the extension of this particular section so odd. As far as I can see, it enables a Minister to require the agency to do almost anything. I should be grateful if the Minister could enlighten us as to why Ministers need this extraordinarily wide-ranging power to direct the agency and whether there are any restraints or confinements on what a Minister may do under this section, as it has been suggested it should be amended.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-04_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that there is anything too much for the noble Baroness to be unduly concerned about. Amendment No. 13 says that the new agencies are to comply with directions given to them by Ministers. It removes any doubt that that is so. Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 were tabled because the European Commission has questioned the absence of a similar provision in Section 5(5) of the Water Resources Act 1991 and indicated that it would seek to challenge directions which are made without that sort of provision. We are confident of having an answer to such a challenge. We thought however that it would be a waste of time and money to try to fight such a case in the European Court of Justice. Part of the reason for the amended Clause 38 is to have available the means to implement European Community obligations by direction and to ensure that this provision satisfies the requirements of European Community law. Therefore, we consider that it is appropriate to put in those provisions in order to avoid any misunderstanding.

<P>

<a name="50711-04_para6"></a>During our Committee and Report stages my noble friend Lord Crickhowell moved amendments for the introduction of an anti-pollution notice procedure into the powers available to the environment agency under the Water Resources Act. Amendment No. 287, which stems from these proposals, enhances the powers of the agency to prevent water pollution and to ensure that clean-up works are carried out where such pollution has occurred. The NRA already has a power under Section 161 of the Water Resources Act 1991 to carry out anti-pollution works itself and then seek to recover costs from a polluter or a potential polluter.
<P>

<a name="50711-04_para7"></a>Amendment No. 287 introduces new Sections 161A, 161B and 161C to the 1991 Act. Section 161A will enable the agency to serve a notice which will require a polluter or a potential polluter to carry out anti-pollution works. We envisage that this power will be of particular value in preventing pollution incidents from occurring. The notice, which is called a "works" notice, will be <P>

<P>
<A NAME="50711-04_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 4 and 5. With these amendments I should like to speak to Amendments Nos. 162, 223 to 228, 313 to 315 and 322. These amendments are for two purposes. First, they strengthen fisheries enforcement in the River Esk. Secondly, they introduce new requirements regarding the fitting of screens at fish farms.
<P>

<a name="50711-04_para11"></a>The first set of amendments, Nos. 4, 5 and part of No. 227, relate to fisheries enforcement on the River Esk. Although the NRA is responsible for managing and enforcing fisheries throughout the whole of the River Esk, in Scotland it does not have the power to carry out its duty effectively. These amendments will enable the new environment agency's water bailiffs to pursue individuals suspected of fisheries offences committed on the River Esk or its tributaries to be apprehended throughout the entire catchment of the River Esk, including that part which lies in Scotland. At the moment their authority is restricted to the river with its banks and tributary streams in Scotland, whereas they apply throughout the whole of the English part of the catchment. The amendments will mean that poachers in the Scottish part of the catchment will no longer have a better chance of escape and enforcement will be improved throughout the river system. If it proves necessary for a bailiff to search property in Scotland, he will need a search warrant from the sheriff or from a Scottish JP in the same way as a Scottish water bailiff does.
<P>

<a name="50711-04_para12"></a>I now turn to the amendments relating to screens. During our Committee and Report stages the noble Lord, Lord Moran, tabled amendments which would, in effect, require gratings to be fitted to fish farm intakes in order to protect wild fish. The Government agreed to consider that proposal and, if appropriate, to bring forward amendments in another place. That is the effect of the remaining amendments in this group. They have two main purposes&#151;to prevent salmon and migratory trout from becoming trapped in fish farm intakes and outfalls and to prevent farmed fish from escaping into the wild. This latter point reflects a particular concern expressed by my noble friend Lord Mills.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-04_para13"></a>Amendment No. 223 will replace Section 14 of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975. This section currently requires certain water and canal undertakings and mills to fit gratings&#151;the design of which must be approved by Ministers&#151;to water intakes and outfalls in rivers. The new provision extends the requirement to fit gratings (now referred to as "screens") to fish farms and provides that these must be capable of preventing the ingress of wild fish and the escape of farmed fish. It also removes the requirement for ministerial approval. Instead, more general requirements similar to those enshrined in recent Scottish legislation will apply to the placing and nature of screens and will allow for the use of devices other than gratings to prevent the passage of fish.
<P>

<a name="50711-04_para14"></a>Amendment No. 224 replaces references to "gratings" in Section 15 of the 1975 Act with the term "screens" to bring it into line with Section 14. Amendments Nos. 225, 226, part of 227, 228, 313 to 315 and 322 make consequential amendments to Schedules 12, 19 and 20 to the Bill. Amendment No. 162 makes a minor technical amendment to Clause 88&#151;which introduces Schedule 12&#151;to bring the wording into line with the heading of that schedule.

<A NAME="50711-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   My Lords, I believe that in general these provisions are an advance on what we had before. I agree with the amendments, but there was one point that puzzled me as regards water bailiffs. When we discussed the Salmon Bill in this House we had a serious discussion as regards the powers of water bailiffs. The Scottish water bailiffs, as far as I remember, do not require a search warrant to break open the boot of a car. I remember discussing this point with the noble Lord, Lord Burton. A water bailiff, if appointed by the riparian owners in an area, has the power, without a search warrant, to break in. If we are to follow the English practice and require search warrants, I believe that that is an advance. If the Minister cannot find the answer to that question at the moment among his mass of papers, perhaps he will inform me of it in writing.

<A NAME="50711-05_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I shall write to the noble Lord.

<P>

<a name="50711-05_para1"></a>Amendments Nos. 6, 7, 191 and 194 to 201 remove the requirement for Treasury consent to payments made to members of the agency, SEPA or their various committees. Amendments Nos. 14, 15 and 16 respond to concerns expressed by my noble friend Lord Lucas of Chilworth in this House at Committee and Report stages that subsistence charges in relation to waste management licences should not be levied until works have commenced at the site. Amendments Nos. 18, 286 and 329 are minor and technical amendments which provide a more straightforward approach to the agencies' powers to charge for incidental functions.
<P>

<a name="50711-05_para2"></a>The underlying purpose of Amendment No. 19 is essentially technical. It would enable the return to the Consolidated Fund of receipts, other than surpluses which, in line with the normal rules of government accounting, ought to be returned to the Exchequer. An example would be windfall receipts relating to products developed by the agency following research or development work funded by central government grant. The amendment is necessarily drafted in wide terms. But I can assure your Lordships that there is no expectation that the power will apply new provisions to any of the sources of income inherited by the agency from its predecessor bodies. If it ever did, any income returned to the Consolidated Fund because of a technical reclassification would, under standard procedures, be offset by matching additional public expenditure provision.
<P>

<a name="50711-05_para3"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove, both spoke during our Committee stage about SEPA's borrowing limits. Having reflected on what they said during that debate, the Government brought forward Amendments Nos. 22 and 23. Amendment No. 22 would increase SEPA's borrowing limit from &#163;2 million to &#163;5 million. Amendment No. 23 would further enable my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland to increase this limit by order up to &#163;10 million.
<P>

<a name="50711-05_para4"></a>The purpose of Amendments Nos. 5, 27 and 30 is to extend the definition of "environmental licence" in Clause 53 of the Bill to include the registration of an activity exempted from waste management licensing under paragraph 45(1) or (2) of Schedule 3 to the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994 (as amended).

I am very pleased that on more mature consideration after the Bill left your Lordships' House the Government and the other place were able to accept a number of suggestions that I and other noble Lords made during the long passage of the Bill earlier this year. I am grateful for that further consideration.
<P>

<a name="50711-05_para8"></a>In order to save your Lordships' time, I shall address the same remarks to the amendments to Clause 15(4), starting with Amendment No. 30, dealing with contaminated land. I and those in the industry who are involved in these matters are grateful that upon more mature consideration our suggestions have borne fruit, as we see in the amendments before us this afternoon.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, I wonder why, if it is now to be dropped, the provision for Treasury consent was originally included in the Bill. It is very unusual to find a government amendment supporting the removal of the necessity for Treasury consent. As an old Treasury hand I look on that with a certain lack of sympathy. I believe that we should be told what was the argument for including the necessity for Treasury consent which moved the Government to put it into the Bill and to keep it in the Bill up to this stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-05_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, first, I should like to thank my noble friend Lord Lucas of Chilworth for the gratitude he expressed not only for Amendments Nos. 14 to 16 but also for others to be dealt with later.
<P>

<a name="50711-05_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, and my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter asked why the Treasury had changed its mind. The Treasury always has to keep a tight rein on how money is spent. That is perfectly right. Some people curse the Treasury because it keeps too tight a rein and regard that as intolerable. Now, when the Treasury releases that control, the noble Lord, Lord Williams, and my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter seem to think that that is a retrograde step. There is nothing particularly bad about it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, I did not say that it was a retrograde step. I asked what was the argument for the inclusion of the provision in the Bill originally.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-05_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I asked exactly the same question. Why did the Bill come to us in this House with Treasury approval? I am neutral on the subject. And why, when the Bill went to the other place, was the need for Treasury approval removed? I do not understand that. I echo the remark of the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, and I repeat my question. Will the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>noble Earl please explain why the Bill came to us in the first place with Treasury approval and then went to another place and now returns to us with that provision removed?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-05_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, what was in the Bill originally is now part of history. The Bill has been magnificently improved by the Government, at the behest of your Lordships. I should have thought that we could rejoice in the present situation in which the Treasury is relieved of one of its many obligations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-05_spnew10"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am deeply grateful to my noble friend, who always makes penetrating and sensible observations.
<P>

<a name="50711-05_para10"></a>I was in the process of trying to explain the matter to the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, but he gets so impatient. It is part of the Treasury tradition to have these matters in Bills because it has to keep a tight rein on expenditure. However, on giving further consideration to the matter Treasury Ministers decided that this was not necessary. That decision reflects a relaxation, with which I should have thought my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter would have been delighted. Indeed, he said that he was delighted.
<P>

<a name="50711-05_para11"></a>Nevertheless, the payments and conditions concerned are still subject to the approval of the relevant Secretary of State or Minister. In other words, there has been only a marginal change. One does not need to obtain Treasury consent, but these matters are subject to the approval of the relevant Secretary of State or Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-05_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Hughes: </B>   My Lords, I can understand my noble friend wishing to have information about this rather unusual provision. However, I suggest to him that we should not look a gift horse in the mouth.

COMMONS AMENDMENT
<br>
 8After Clause 24, insert the following clause:&#151;
<center><b>Assessing flood risk</B></center><br>
'.&#151;(1) Without prejudice to section 92 of the Agriculture Act 1970 (provision of flood warning systems), SEPA shall have the function of assessing, as far as it considers it appropriate, the risk of flooding in any area of Scotland.
<br>
(2) If requested by a planning authority to do so, SEPA shall, on the basis of such information as it holds with respect to the risk of flooding in any part of the authority's area, provide the authority with advice as to such risk.'.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-06_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 8. It may be helpful to your Lordships if I speak also to Amendments Nos. 10, 11, 235 to 238 and 310.
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para0"></a>During the Committee stage the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove, urged us to give SEPA a stronger role in relation to flooding. Amendment No. 8 will give SEPA such a stronger role by conferring upon it a function to assess, as far as it considers appropriate, the risk of flooding in any area of Scotland. It will also require the agency to provide a planning authority with advice on flood risk, on request, based on all information available to it. Placing such a duty on SEPA to provide advice will ensure that sound advice is available to planning authorities.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para1"></a>The amendment, taken together with existing statutory provisions, will ensure that councils can take well-informed decisions on flooding matters which will reflect local concerns and the general public interest.
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para2"></a>In Committee the noble Lord also expressed concern about an unnecessary burden which would be placed on SNH under Clause 33 of the Bill. The provision in question would have required SNH to give its reasons for considering that an area of land might be affected by the activities of SEPA. We had originally considered this to be a sensible measure since it would ensure that SEPA would know why SNH thought in the first instance that SEPA's activities might adversely affect an area of land. We still believe that it would be useful for SEPA to have that information but accept that that can be done without it being written on the face of the Bill. Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 therefore remove that duty.
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para3"></a>Amendments Nos. 235, 236, 237 and 310 provide for the application of Scottish water and sewerage legislation to the Crown. Crown immunity is being progressively reduced as legislative opportunities arise. The proposals are consistent with our Citizen's Charter initiative and will ensure the same level of statutory protection for consumers of Crown water and sewerage services north and south of the Border.
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para4"></a>Amendment No. 238 is a minor drafting amendment to Section 18(1) of the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Act 1951 which will ensure that all remaining references to the river purification authorities are converted to references to SEPA.
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para5"></a>Moved, That the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 8.&#151;(The Earl of Lindsay.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister comment on the lack of enforcement powers for SEPA? In speaking to the amendments before your Lordships the Minister made specific reference to the advisory role of SEPA in relation to flood prevention. There can be no doubt that, for example, one of the reasons for the floods in Perth some two years ago was the land use policies of the hydro-electricity companies, which operate at a fairly high level above the city of Perth and its low-lying environs round Bridge of Earn and various other villages. I know that we are too late to amend the provision now, but unless SEPA has enforcement rather than advisory powers, it is my guess&#151;I hope I am wrong&#151;that those flood catastrophes will continue to occur. SEPA is under an obligation only to give advice to local authorities if the local authorities request such advice. In my view it would have been far more progressive to give SEPA the powers to give advice whether or not the local authority sought that advice. After all, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency has been created in order to try to prevent some of the pollution and flooding problems that we have had in the past.
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para6"></a>Perhaps I may turn briefly to the question of Crown immunity. I welcome the strengthening of the Bill regarding SEPA's advisory role (although I would have liked to see it with an enforcement role) and Crown immunity. However, there is an interesting passage in <P>


<a name="column_1482"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1482</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the amendments coming from another place. If the Secretary of State&#151;I assume that to mean the Secretary of State for Scotland&#151;decides that a building is in the national interest, the water and the sewerage Acts would not apply to that building. For the life of me, I cannot think of a building throughout the length and breadth of Scotland that would be so much in the national interest that the provisions of the water and sewerage Acts would be disapplied to it. For goodness sake, I hope that we shall not be told by the Secretary of State that, for example, Barlinnie Prison, Peterhead Prison or Saughton Prison is in the national interest and therefore the provisions of the water and sewerage Acts should be disapplied. That would be an absolute disaster.
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para7"></a>Against that background, perhaps the Minister will give an example of the type of building that the Secretary of State could designate as being in the national interest and to which the provisions of the water and sewerage Acts would be disapplied. I would have hoped that the part relating to Crown immunity could be omitted from the amendment. However, so long as that provision is among the powers given to the Secretary of State, then the whole question of Crown immunity still prevails. With that qualification I still welcome the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-06_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   My Lords, before my noble friend replies to the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, perhaps this is a case where a building could be entirely covered by private water and sewerage facilities. It is an issue that I raised during debate on the Bill. Perhaps I may say that I have a vested interest. On my estate there is a private supply to 43 households. In addition, in a number of cases the sewerage could not possibly be maintained or cleaned out by the new water or sewerage authorities in Scotland. I have to deal with that responsibility.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-06_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, a number of interesting points have been made by my noble friend Lord Balfour and the noble Lord, Lord Ewing. The first point made by the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, related to SEPA's ability to advise local authorities on flooding. We looked at the matter carefully in drafting the Bill. I make this essential point. We believe that the lead in all planning matters must be unambiguous. Local authorities already have all the powers they need to tackle flooding and to take any precautionary measures against the threat of flooding. Local authorities must retain unambiguously that responsibility to prevent flooding. Similarly, with its undoubted role in planning, we believe that it is much better that an elected council makes the final decision as to where development can or cannot take place, having taken all factors into account.
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para8"></a>Underlying the noble Lord's concern is the assumption that SEPA may have assessed a threat of flooding&#151;it can do so without having been so solicited&#151;but then a local authority refuses to request formally that advice. In no way do we see that gulf between SEPA and local authorities. We anticipate the level of communication between the SEPA main board and CoSLA, and between the regional SEPA boards and the regional local authorities, as being quite close. We anticipate local authority figures serving on some of the <P>


<a name="column_1483"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1483</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>regional boards. We know that there will be extensive communication between the planning arm of the local authorities and the SEPA regulatory arm. Therefore, although technically the noble Lord may have defined a situation which concerns him, I think in practice it will not arise.
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para9"></a>On the noble Lord's second point, my short and simple answer is this. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State, I believe, cannot suddenly define "national interest" in such a way that it scoops up another basket of structures and parts of the built heritage. It is done largely by precedent. If I have misled him on that point, I shall write to him.

 9After Clause 25, insert the following clause:&#151;
<center><b>Power of SEPA to obtain information about land</B></center><br>
'.&#151;(1) Where, with a view to performing a function conferred on it by any enactment, SEPA considers that it ought to have information connected with any land, it may serve on one or more of the persons mentioned in subsection (2) below a notice&#151;
<br>
(a) specifying the land, the function and the enactment; and

(b) requiring the recipient of the notice to furnish to SEPA, within such period of not less than 14 days from the date of service of the notice as is specified in the notice&#151;

These all make minor improvements to the provisions relating to the new agencies.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para11"></a>Amendments Nos. 9 and 260 are intended to ensure that the agencies will be able to require the owner, tenant or occupier of a particular piece of land, and any other person with an interest in that land, to provide information as to which persons have an interest in that land. The power is needed by the agencies in order to enable them to carry out their pollution control and prevention functions.
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para12"></a>Amendment No. 175 inserts a new clause which puts beyond doubt the ability of Ministers, the new agencies and local enforcing authorities to exchange information which will help them in carrying out their environmental functions. It makes clear that they can disclose such information to each other without risk of civil or criminal liability.
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para13"></a>Amendments Nos. 262, 278, 289 and 323 are consequential on the new clause. They amend the disclosure of information provisions in other environmental legislation to ensure that they are consistent with its provisions.
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para14"></a>My noble friend Lord Mills spoke to an amendment in Committee in this House, tabled in his name and that of my noble friend Lord Crickhowell, which would have extended the agency's powers to institute civil proceedings. At the time my noble friend Lord Ullswater said that he did not think the amendment was necessary. The Government have, however, decided that it would be desirable for the agency to have express powers to take proceedings in the High Court to secure compliance with an enforcement notice in cases where it considers that prosecution would be ineffectual.
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para15"></a>We have therefore brought forward Amendments Nos. 258 and 281 which give both the agencies additional powers to make sure that holders of water discharge consents cannot ignore the conditions in their licences. Amendment No. 305 makes a similar provision in respect of registrations to keep radioactive materials or to accumulate or dispose of radioactive waste.
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para16"></a>The provisions are modelled closely on powers already available to HMIP and HMIPI in respect of authorised IPC processes.
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para17"></a>Amendment No. 266 seeks to deal with a concern about Section 4 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Under Section 4(4) my right honourable friend the Secretary of State has the power to direct that HMIP or HMIPI regulate an industrial process which would ordinarily be regulated by a local authority. Under Section 4(8) such a direction must be advertised. However, one of the reasons he may see fit to issue such a direction is that the operation of the process has implications for national security. In such cases it is clearly not desirable that there is an obligation to advertise.
<P>

<a name="50711-06_para18"></a>This amendment would ensure that national security, which the Secretary of State is trying to protect in issuing the direction, will not be compromised by an obligation to advertise. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="50711-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, I wish to refer to Amendment No. 175 on pages 45 to 47 in the list of Commons Amendments. I have tabled two amendments to the new clause which look rather technical, but they attempt to cure a defect in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50711-07_para0"></a>I hope that your Lordships will bear with me if I try to explain it. Subsection (3) of the new clause provides for the exclusion of confidential information from the public registers in relation to contaminated land. The subsection is designed to ensure that the enforcing authorities respect the confidentiality of information which they obtain in the course of carrying out their pollution control functions.
<P>

<a name="50711-07_para1"></a>I have tabled Amendment No. 175A and with it, as a subsidiary amendment, Amendment No. 175B. Without my amendments, there would be a serious imbalance in the Bill. On the one hand, the authorities would be forbidden to place confidential information on the registers and, on the other hand, they would be at liberty to release that same information to anyone who requested it under entirely separate statutory provision; namely, the environmental information regulations. We are up against a conflict in the law.
<P>

<a name="50711-07_para2"></a>If confidential information could be revealed in that way, industry and owners of property would inevitably be much less willing to share their information voluntarily with the regulatory authorities. If that were so, it would result in a much less healthy relationship between regulators and regulated. It would inhibit the Government's wise policy of encouraging voluntary reductions in pollution and a voluntary regeneration of contaminated or derelict land.
<P>

<a name="50711-07_para3"></a>The amendment plugs the loophole. I am advised by a Queen's Counsel who is in practice&#151;it is not an opinion which I first formed as a rusty old lawyer&#151;that we must be careful. Disclosure of information may assist in the discharging authorities' environmental functions and therefore be expressly permitted by Section 111 of the Local Government Act 1972.
<P>

<a name="50711-07_para4"></a>There is a further conflict between what will become an Act of Parliament when we pass the Bill and what is an Act of Parliament, the Local Government Act 1972. So we must be careful. From various points of view it seems to be in the public interest, first, to ensure the voluntary disclosure of as much information as is relevant; and, secondly, to ensure that we get our duty as legislators right.
<P>

<a name="50711-07_para5"></a>Your Lordships may think it strange that I have to discuss the amendments which arise late on the Marshalled List of Commons Amendments, but I do so because of the groupings. If my noble friends on the Front Bench would prefer not to give an answer now because my amendments are starred, then I am quite willing to raise them later today when we reach Amendment No. 175. I do not believe it is appropriate for me to move my amendments now; I shall do so in due course. Meanwhile, I hope that your Lordships will forgive me for necessarily anticipating the situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-07_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I had thought that it might be for the convenience of the House if the noble Earl responded first. However, since I am on my feet, I wish to make a short point on Commons Amendment <P>


<a name="column_1486"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1486</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>No. 175 to which the Minister spoke. It enables the new agencies to provide information. In other words, it is a discretion for the new agencies, it is not mandatory. I understand the need for a statutory provision to enable a new agency to provide information and although it will be able to do that, it may also say: "No, we refuse to do so". It will be interesting to the House to know whether the Minister can confirm that the agency has those powers. I imagine that if the agency were to take that stand on too many occasions and refuse to provide Ministers with information, then the Ministers would exercise their ability as appointors of members of a quango and would dis-appoint those members. Perhaps the Minister can clarify that being able to provide information does not mean that the agency will be required to provide information.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-07_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, as to my noble friend's Amendments Nos. 175A and 175B to which we shall come formally later on, I shall answer now. The issue of commercial confidentiality has been discussed on a number of occasions during the consideration of this Bill. I recognise that this is an important concern both to businesses which do not wish their commercial interest to be put at risk and to those seeking environmental information who wish to ensure maximum freedom of access.
<P>

<a name="50711-07_para6"></a>As I understand it, my noble friend is concerned that, while the Government have made provision for commercially confidential information to be excluded from registers, there appears to be no general restriction in the Bill on release of information obtained by an enforcing authority in the carrying out of its functions. Under the access to environmental information regulations of 1992, whereas information affecting matters to which any commercial or industrial confidentiality attaches must not be released if it is the subject of statutory restrictions on disclosure, where there are no such statutory restrictions there is discretion as to whether it should be withheld. My noble friend therefore appears to be concerned that information which is acknowledged by the authorities to be commercially confidential, and to be withheld from the registers, could nevertheless be released in response to an inquiry under the environmental information regulations.
<P>

<a name="50711-07_para7"></a>This matter has been considered carefully in the light of representations made to the department, including legal opinion. I cannot accept the proposed amendments which the Government continue to believe are unnecessary. Confidential information obtained in exercise of statutory powers for a particular purpose may only be used by them for that purpose. This general principle explains the need for, and is reinforced in the context of this Bill by, the terms of the Government's new clause making explicit provision for the disclosure of such information between enforcing authorities and Ministers. The environmental information regulations of 1992 require environmental information to be disclosed on request in certain circumstances. There is no obligation under those regulations to disclose environmental information which is commercially confidential. It follows that any regulatory authority would be most unwise to release environmental <P>


<a name="column_1487"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1487</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information obtained in exercise of statutory powers for a particular purpose and which it accepts is genuinely commercially confidential.
<P>

<a name="50711-07_para8"></a>In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, an agency can refuse but we do not expect it to do so in any circumstances other than exceptional ones.
<P>

<a name="50711-07_para9"></a>I finish by saying that safeguards are built into the Bill on the disclosure of information. Nothing in the provisions will authorise the agencies to disclose to local enforcing authorities any information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to the interests of national security or employment census information obtained under the Statistics of Trade Act 1947. Nor is a local enforcing authority which is in possession of any such information authorised to pass it to any other local enforcing authority.
<P>

<a name="50711-07_para10"></a>Moreover, no information disclosed by virtue of this provision which is commercially confidential or which relates to issues of national security may be disclosed to anyone else. A general legal presumption to the effect that information may be used only for the statutory purpose for which it is collected, or in this case disclosed, will also apply. I hope that I have laid to rest the anxieties of my noble friend and the noble Baroness.

<A NAME="50711-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may have the leave of the House to reply briefly, instead of raising the matter later. I feel bound to point out that, according to advice that I have received from an experienced practising Queen's Counsel, there is no authority for the proposition that my noble friend has put forward. Statutory powers may generally be exercised for more than one statutory purpose. Disclosure of information may assist in the main statutory purpose, and therefore be in accordance with it.
<P>

<a name="50711-07_para11"></a>Disclosure of information may also assist in the discharge of the authorities' environmental functions and therefore be permitted expressly by the Local Government Act, as I said. It is very regrettable that the department is not prepared to accept this offer of help to remove what is a defect in the Bill. I do not suppose in view of what I believe is the wrong advice that my noble friend received, that much can be done about it now. I merely express my regret.

<FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="50711-08_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 18A as an amendment to Commons Amendment No. 18.
<P>

<a name="50711-08_para1"></a>My Amendment No. 18A on the Marshalled List seeks to provide that the charges that the agency can recover are "reasonable" charges. This clause relates to charging for services and facilities provided by the agency in the course of carrying out its functions.
<P>

<a name="50711-08_para2"></a>At earlier stages of the Bill there was a good deal of discussion about the level of charging by some of the present authorities. I was criticised for referring to an occasion when the National Rivers Authority had, I believe, charged &#163;100 for a sheet of information. I was told that this was not merely a copying charge but that it reflected the research that had gone into preparing the <P>


<a name="column_1489"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1489</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>fact sheet. Without going into the merits of that particular charge, I believe that it points very clearly to the need to have some sort of limit on charging. These are public bodies. Although their function is not to work for private individuals&#151;for developers, and so on&#151;it is nevertheless entirely right that the information that they hold should be made available to the public on a basis which allows the public real access, not access only if they can afford a substantial charge. This is a freedom of information point. It is for that reason that I seek to amend Commons Amendment No. 18 by providing that the charges that can be made shall be no more than are reasonable.
<P>

<a name="50711-08_para3"></a>Moved, That Amendment No. 18A, as an amendment to Commons Amendment No. 18, be agreed to.&#151;(Baroness Hamwee.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-08_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness may be misguided in her attempt to amend the legislation in this way. However, I quite understand that she is concerned about the provision of information. My noble friends Lord Ullswater and Lord Lindsay gave fairly specific reassurances in Committee about both the provision of information and the agencies' powers to charge reasonable fees for providing specific information. I understand the concern that those fees should be reasonable. However, I think it would be unreasonable to consider that those fees would not be reasonable.
<P>

<a name="50711-08_para4"></a>As regards provision of information by the agencies, the noble Baroness may be stretching the point a little. Both Commons Amendment No. 18 and her Amendment No. 18A are about the environment agencies' ability to charge for carrying out their functions. Clearly they ought to be able to charge; and clearly it would be quite intolerable if the agencies were not reasonable in the charges that they made. I do not believe that the noble Baroness's amendment to Commons Amendment No. 18 would be suitable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I cannot pretend to be entirely happy with that answer, although I am not surprised either. Perhaps the best that we can do is rely on the good faith of Ministers who appoint members of the agencies in ensuring that, if the agencies are out of line in their charging policy and are making charges that are not appropriate in the eyes of the public, as the appointing Ministers, they bring that to the attention of the agencies and lean on them to behave reasonably. I beg leave to withdraw my Amendment No. 18A.

<A NAME="50711-08_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hilton of Eggardon: </B>   My Lords, I ask one question for clarification in relation to Amendment No. 42. New Sections 78B and 78C require that where the agency and the local authorities cannot agree that land must be designated as special, the matter must be referred to the Secretary of State. But there is no time limit laid down by which the Secretary of State must make a decision. That could in fact just provide a recipe for prolonged delay. I wonder whether the Minister could advise the House on what would seem to be a reasonable length of time in which the Secretary of State should be required to make some decision on the designation of sites as special.

<a name="50711-09_para1"></a>Many of the amendments in this group make minor or technical changes to the provisions. But they also address a number of specific issues, which I think it only proper to draw to the attention of your Lordships.
<P>

<a name="50711-09_para2"></a>Amendments Nos. 59 to 62 deal with the question of appeals against remediation notices. At first instance appeals of this kind go to the magistrates' court where the notice has been served by a local authority and to the Secretary of State where it has been served by the appropriate agency. Without specific further provision, appeals against decisions of the magistrates' court would only be available on points of law to the High <P>


<a name="column_1492"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1492</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Court. In the light of the complex legal issues and technical evidence which may be involved in some of the cases, we feel that it is appropriate that in some circumstances there should be a wider right to appeal against a decision of the magistrates' court. These amendments will allow regulations to be made providing for appeals to any specified court or tribunal.
<P>

<a name="50711-09_para3"></a>Proceedings for the offence of non-compliance with a remediation notice will also be brought in the magistrates' court; or in Scotland, the sheriff court. The penalty in either case would be a fine. Amendment No. 66 enables an enforcing authority, if it is of the opinion that such proceedings would afford an insufficient remedy, to take proceedings in the High Court, or in Scotland in any court of competent jurisdiction, to ensure compliance with a remediation notice. That power, which matches equivalent powers already in place under the statutory nuisance regime and proposed elsewhere in the Bill for other pollution control regimes, will give enforcing authorities the ability to seek injunctive relief where that is appropriate.
<P>

<a name="50711-09_para4"></a>Amendments Nos. 76 to 81 make changes to the provisions relating to the remediation registers to be maintained under this regime. At Committee stage, my noble friend Lord Ullswater, in response to an amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, undertook to consider the question of the inclusion of information about actual remediation which is carried out on the land. Amendment No. 78 provides for the person who carries out the remediation, or the owner or occupier of the land, to provide such information for inclusion on the register. The Government do not believe that it would be appropriate for the enforcing authority to guarantee that information or to provide any "certificate of compliance". The amendment therefore makes clear that the authority maintaining the register is not responsible for the accuracy or otherwise of the information which is provided in it.
<P>

<a name="50711-09_para5"></a>Amendment No. 81 provides for the exclusion of information from the remediation registers where questions of commercial confidentiality or national security are involved. These provisions broadly reflect their equivalents elsewhere in the Environmental Protection Act 1990 which deal with other registers of regulatory actions. But for the purposes of these remediation registers, commercial interests which relate only to the value of the contaminated land in question, or otherwise to the ownership or occupation of the land, are to be disregarded for the purposes of considering whether information should be regarded as commercially confidential.
<P>

<a name="50711-09_para6"></a>Amendment No. 84 makes significant changes to the provision providing an exemption from personal liability for insolvency practitioners. The noble Earl, Lord Lytton, expressed concern in our earlier debates that receivers appointed under the Law of Property Act 1925 should be included within this exemption. I am happy to confirm that the definition of those persons "acting in a relevant capacity" who will benefit from the exemption includes all such receivers. The amendment also clarifies what the exemption covers. Insolvency practitioners and receivers will not be personally liable <P>


<a name="column_1493"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1493</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to bear any of the costs of remediation, nor can they be guilty of an offence of non-compliance with a remediation notice. However, the effect of this amendment is not intended to be the creation of a polluter's charter for insolvency practitioners. They will lose the benefits of the exemption with respect to any remediation which may be made necessary as a result of the presence of contaminants which are there in consequence of the acts or omissions of the insolvency practitioners which are unreasonable for a person who is acting in their capacity to do.
<P>

<a name="50711-09_para7"></a>Amendment No. 86 achieves two purposes. First, it relocates provisions relating to the interaction of this contaminated land regime with other environmental regimes. That includes the provision relating to illegal deposits of waste and fly tipping which was introduced at Third Reading in response to an amendment by my noble friend Lord Stanley of Alderley. Secondly, the amendment provides for regulations to apply the contaminated land regime to radioactive contamination. The new Section 78T follows closely the model provided by Section 78 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 which dealt with the application of the waste management licensing regime to radioactive waste. The White Paper on radioactive waste policy published on 4th July confirms that the Government intend to use this regulation-making power and to bring in a regime for radioactive contamination soon after the main provisions come into force.
<P>

<a name="50711-09_para8"></a>Amendment No. 273 reworks the provision in Schedule 18 which removes the potential overlap between this contaminated land regime and the existing statutory nuisance regime in Part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. At Report stage my noble friend Lord Ullswater, in response to an amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Hilton of Eggardon, promised that the Government would look further at this issue. Having done so, we have revised the formulation in order to ensure that, so far as is possible, there is neither an overlap between the two regimes nor a lacuna between them.

<P>

<a name="50711-09_para10"></a>First, I should like to thank the Government for accepting in principle many of the concerns on contaminated land raised by your Lordships and in particular, as my noble friend said, by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne. I hope that my noble friend will not accuse me of looking a gift horse in the mouth when I say that it is a pity that a great deal is being left until we see the guidance and regulations. I wonder whether my noble friend can give me any idea of the how, why and when of them. Can he say who will be consulted on the guidance notes and regulations? However, I thank noble Lords and my noble friend for many of the amendments.

<P>
<A NAME="50711-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, I should like to make two brief points. First, I understood my noble friend to say just now that there would be no guarantee of the accuracy of the contents of a register which was managed by an agency. What is the point of being so coy about it? What is the point of having a register at all unless someone who needs to consult it has a reasonable chance of being able to rely upon its accuracy?
<P>

<a name="50711-09_para11"></a>Secondly, in support of my noble friend Lord Stanley of Alderley, I should like to comment on the guidance. Again and again we are faced with long and complicated Bills. There are many clauses in the present Bill which do not yield up their meaning to casual inspection. They need to be studied with very great care before any meaning can be discovered with accuracy or some feeling of confidence.
<P>

<a name="50711-09_para12"></a>An awful lot is left to guidance. I do not feel that that should go without some mild protest on the part of your Lordships to say to the Government that they should endeavour to make their purposes clear at the time of legislating. They should not leave it until after the event, when there is no one to argue with them and, so far as I can see, they are entirely free to say, "This is what we meant and this is our advice to those who are affected by the Act". I hope my noble friend will take the point seriously. It is one which is of great concern.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, I echo what was said by my noble friend Lord Stanley of Alderley regarding the Government recognising many of the anxieties voiced while the Bill was passing through this House. The number of pages devoted to the Commons amendments on contaminated land is evidence of the substantial changes made when the Bill was in another place.
<P>

<a name="50711-09_para13"></a>The specific aspect about which I should like confirmation relates to the role of lenders; that is, bankers, building societies and so forth. It was raised at every stage of the Bill in this House and again in another place. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State, Mr. Gummer, was good enough, when meeting a delegation of lenders, to make it absolutely clear that in the Government's mind there was no intention whatever that lenders per se should become liable to have remediation notices served and to all the consequences that would flow from that.
<P>

<a name="50711-09_para14"></a>I am informed that some provisions have been made in the Bill&#151;it is a little difficult to identify them in the many pages we have&#151;which have gone part of the way to reflect that undertaking. What was said in another place by my right honourable friend Mr. Atkins was that this would be made abundantly clear in the guidance. While I understand the anxieties of my noble friend Lord Peyton in relation to guidance, can my noble friend Lord Ferrers give an unequivocal assurance to the House today that when the guidance is published it will include a clear statement that lenders per se are not to be the subject of contaminated land proceedings by way of notice of remediation? The interests outside this House were given to understand that that is the Government's intention, but they would like to see it in the report of this debate and in the guidance when it is published.

<P>
<A NAME="50711-10_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, first, I take any point made by my noble friend Lord Peyton seriously, not least his comment that these "technical" Bills, as he put it, do not yield up their meaning easily on casual inspection. I could not more heartily agree with him on that. But that often happens in legal matters. When matters become legal and technical they are difficult to understand. I cannot apologise to my noble friend for the Bill's complexity or for it being relatively difficult to understand; that is the nature of the beast.
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para0"></a>My noble friend Lord Peyton was concerned that the register was not accurate. He asked what the point was of putting something into the Bill and then saying that its accuracy could not be guaranteed. The point is that Amendment No. 78 provides for the person carrying out the remediation to provide such information as he can to be placed on the register. We believe that that is absolutely right. However, it is not right that the agency which runs the register should be held responsible for the accuracy of the information it contains. One assumes that it will be accurate, and I hope that it will be. But technically it is not possible to give a once-and-for-all guarantee that a site is no longer contaminated. The physical circumstances of the site can change over time and contamination may occur or containment works which have been undertaken may fail. It is appropriate that the register should say that such-and-such happened, that such-and-such has been done, and for the correct conclusion to be drawn from that.
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para1"></a>My noble friend Lord Stanley expressed an appreciation for the way in which some of the points have been met, and I am grateful to him for that. He asked when the guidance would be made: how, when and who would be consulted. The best that I can tell him is that consultation will probably be carried out at the end of the year and is expected to be very wide.
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para2"></a>My noble friend Lord Jenkin referred to the lenders. That is an important matter. However, it may be more appropriate to deal with it when we come to the next group of amendments, if my noble friend is happy for me to answer him at that time.

In many cases these amendments make changes which answer anxieties expressed by your Lordships in our earlier debates. We have introduced the important requirement for <P>


<a name="column_1496"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1496</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consultation to precede the service of any remediation notice, except in cases of urgency. My noble friend Lord Coleraine moved an amendment on this subject at Report stage.
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para5"></a>Following on from this consultation, enforcing authorities will be precluded from serving a remediation notice if they are satisfied that appropriate remediation is or will be taking place without one. In such cases, a remediation statement will be included on the remediation registers to ensure that information about the site is not lost.
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para6"></a>Amendment No. 67 strengthens the powers of enforcing authorities to undertake remediation themselves in appropriate circumstances. In particular, they will be specifically empowered to act in emergencies, where they have the agreement of the persons who would otherwise receive a remediation notice or where they cannot find any "appropriate person" on whom to serve a remediation notice. In such circumstances, the authorities would not serve a notice. They would, however, publish a remediation statement, which would go on the register.
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para7"></a>Another important circumstance in which an authority would be precluded from serving a remediation notice would be where it considered that hardship would result from the service of a notice. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, and my noble friend Lord Kinnoull moved amendments on this question of hardship at Report stage. Under the original provisions of the Bill, hardship would have been considered only in circumstances where the enforcing authority was actually seeking to recover costs incurred in undertaking remediation where the recipient of a notice had failed to comply with the requirements set out in that notice. In other words, a notice would have been served&#151;and not complied with&#151;before the question of hardship was considered. Under the terms of the new Sections 78EA and 78HH, however, if the authority decides that it would not seek to recover all of its costs were it to act itself, it is precluded from serving a remediation notice. This means that hardship must be considered before any notice is served.
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para8"></a>Amendments Nos. 68 and 69 introduce a requirement that authorities should have regard to guidance from the Secretary of State in making decisions on questions relating to cost recovery and hardship. Amendment No. 56 is a substantial amendment and virtually re-writes the section which defines who is the "appropriate person" to be responsible for any remediation.
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para9"></a>My noble friend Lord Jenkin was concerned that the provisions still seek to implement the "polluter pays" principle, with liability falling on any person who,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"caused or knowingly permitted the substances ... by reason of which the contaminated land ... is such land to be in, on or under that land".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para10"></a>My noble friend Lord Coleraine expressed concerns about the meaning of the second element of this test&#151;"knowingly permitted". He moved an amendment on Report. Concerns have also been raised by, among others, my noble friend Lord Jenkin, claiming that banks could be held liable as polluters by the act of lending money to polluting companies.
<P>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1497</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para11"></a>We have considered the matter again since the Bill left the House. As your Lordships may be aware, the test of "causing or knowingly permitting" has been used in environmental legislation for more than 100 years and during that time there have been no cases where a bank lending money to a polluter has been held liable to be a "causer" or a "knowing permitter". I can also confirm that the National Rivers Authority has not brought such a case against a provider of finance under its current powers in the Water Resources Act 1991 which are based on "causing or knowingly permitting".
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para12"></a>The test of "causing" requires some active participation in the operation or chain of operations resulting in the pollution. This has been well established in leading cases, including by the House of Lords in Alphacell Ltd. v. Woodward and by the Court of Appeal in Attorney-General's Reference (No. 1 of 1994). Accordingly, whether a lender could be held to have caused substances to be in, on or under the land will depend on whether it took some active participation in the operation or chain of operations resulting in those substances being in, on or under the land. The act of lending per se does not amount to such active participation.
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para13"></a>The test of "knowingly permitting" would require both knowledge that the substances in question were in, on or under the land and the possession of the power to prevent such a substance being there. I am advised that there is no judicial decision which supports the contention that a lender, by virtue of the act of lending the money only, could be said to have "knowingly permitted" the substances to be in, on or under the land such that it is contaminated land. This would be the case if for no other reason than that the lender, irrespective of any covenants it may have required from the polluter as to its environmental behaviour, would have no permissive rights over the land in question to prevent contamination occurring or continuing.
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para14"></a>Amendment No. 56 revises the definition of the "appropriate person", as regards polluters, in two important respects. First, we have introduced a limiting condition that any "polluter" can only be required to carry out any remediation which is to any extent referable to the substances for which he is responsible. He is, therefore, not liable for dealing with unrelated problems. This, I hope, will remove some of the concerns surrounding the issue of joint liability. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, and my noble friend Lord Kinnoull moved an amendment on this matter at Report stage.
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para15"></a>Secondly, we have clarified the provisions relating to the question of joint liability, confirming that two or more persons can be required jointly to do the same things by way of remediation, with the costs of so doing being apportioned between them by the enforcing authority in accordance with the guidance to be issued by the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 63 gives a specific defence against any prosecution for non-compliance with a remediation notice where the sole reason for non-compliance was the refusal or inability of another person to comply who was expected to bear a proportion of the costs.
<P>


<a name="column_1498"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1498</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para16"></a>Where no "polluter" can be found, after reasonable inquiry, the owner or occupier of the land in question becomes the "appropriate person". In this, the contaminated land provisions follow directly the equivalent arrangements in the statutory nuisance regime in Part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. However, as my noble friend Lord Ullswater promised in our Third Reading debate, the Government have looked again at the operation of this provision with respect to liabilities for water pollution. Amendment No. 56 ensures that a person who is identified as an "appropriate person" solely by virtue of his ownership or occupation of land cannot be held liable for any remediation needed to deal solely with water pollution. This reflects the fact that there is no liability in respect of water pollution falling on owners or occupiers per se under Section 161 of the Water Resources Act 1991.
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para17"></a>Amendment No. 56 also addresses the question of the potential overlap between these provisions and the provisions in the Water Resources Act dealing with water pollution from abandoned mines. Concerns in this area lay behind a number of amendments moved by the noble Earl, Lord Kintore, at Report stage. We have resolved those by copying into these provisions the exemption from liability which applies with respect to water from abandoned mines under the Water Resources Act.
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para18"></a>Amendment No. 56 removes entirely two means by which liability might have fallen on owners or occupiers of land under the original provisions of the Bill. The first of these concerns "transfers of liability". The provision which would have allowed for polluters to have transferred their liabilities to new owners or occupiers of land&#151;which the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, and my noble friend Lord Kinnoull sought to amend at Report stage&#151;has been deleted. Having looked closely at the matter, the Government have concluded that it would be more practical to leave this question to be dealt with through the normal contractual means of guarantees and indemnities rather than to attempt to make detailed statutory provisions.
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para19"></a>The other issue concerns the circumstances in which a person is required to do things by way of remediation with respect to particular contaminated land notwithstanding that he may not be entitled to do them. In order to resolve this problem, under the original provisions of the Bill the consent of the occupier of the land was needed before any remediation notice could be served. Any refusal on the part of the occupier to give such consent would have made the owner or the occupier of the land himself liable for the remediation.
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para20"></a>These provisions have now been substantially restructured. There is now a requirement that, except in cases of urgency, any person whose consent might be required to enable remediation to be carried out should be consulted before a remediation notice is served concerning any rights which he might be required to grant. That person is then required to grant, or join in granting, the necessary rights of access. But any person required to grant rights in this way will be entitled to apply for compensation from the "appropriate person". <P>


<a name="column_1499"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1499</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Regulations will prescribe the procedures for applying for compensation and the manner in which the amount of any compensation will be determined.
<P>

<a name="50711-10_para21"></a>I hope that these improvements will make the contaminated land problems a great deal easier to deal with and that the contaminated land regime will operate better in practice, both in terms of the mechanics of the regime and the equity and fairness of the arrangement relating to liabilities. I apologise for the length of my speech but this is an important matter and one about which many of your Lordships were concerned. I thought it appropriate to try to point out in the best and clearest way possible and in some detail how we have sought to meet the concerns expressed by your Lordships.

<P>
<A NAME="50711-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hilton of Eggardon: </B>   My Lords, I have one specific question which the Minister may feel reluctant to answer. It concerns "reasonable time". I realise that he was reluctant to commit a Secretary of State to what might be a reasonable time for making a decision but this is in relation to the enforcing authority. Where an owner intends to take appropriate remediation measures he must prepare and publish a remediation statement. Where he fails to do so in a reasonable time the enforcing authority may do so itself and recover the costs of so doing. I wonder whether the noble Earl might venture an opinion as to what is a reasonable time in this respect. As he is not committing a Secretary of State on this occasion, I hope we can get some kind of answer as to whether six months, a year, two years or five years might be considered a reasonable time.
<P>

<a name="50711-11_para0"></a>A more general and perhaps more important point relates to the costs to local authorities due to the introduction of these very welcome measures for dealing with contaminated land. For the first time local authorities will have an explicit duty to inspect their areas in order to identify contaminated land. The existing provisions, which are much more vague and tenuous, require only that they identify nuisances. The contaminated land test is set at a much lower level than the test for nuisance and therefore no doubt local authorities will be identifying far more contaminated land within their area. Moreover, this will require a much greater proportion of the land to be acted on.
<P>

<a name="50711-11_para1"></a>Local authorities are also required to determine whether these contaminated sites should be identified as special sites. Contaminated land will also include closed and abandoned mines. Following identification, local authorities must also consult with owners, occupiers and all others with an interest in the land before serving a remediation notice or accepting proposals from an owner for a remediation programme.
<P>

<a name="50711-11_para2"></a>All of those are considerable, time-consuming matters which will require additional staff and which may ultimately require additional capital investment. It has been estimated by the district councils that the formal inspection of land and the setting up of registers could mean that an additional one-and-a-half officers per district council are needed at an average cost of &#163;30,000 per annum. Is it intended that that additional cost to <P>


<a name="column_1500"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1500</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>local authorities will be funded from central funds? As we know, local authorities are already gravely overstretched through a number of other duties being imposed on them. The additional burden will make the welcome provisions of this legislation unworkable unless additional finance is provided for local authorities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, I know that I speak for a number of my noble friends when I say how immensely grateful I am for the long statement which my noble friend the Minister has made about the position of lenders. Without wishing in any way to appear ungrateful, when my noble friend replies to this brief debate will he say whether that statement about lenders will be made quite clear in the guidance when it is issued?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, I should like briefly to offer my warm congratulations to my noble friend on the skill with which he steered his way through the not always limpid clear waters of the amendments that we are now discussing.
<P>

<a name="50711-11_para3"></a>However, I wonder whether my noble friend could say just a word or two more about "appropriate person". Amendment No. 35 does not do a great deal to help me. Indeed, I suspect that not all of your Lordships will feel deeply grateful for the explanation that it contains. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'appropriate person' means any person who is an appropriate person".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-11_para4"></a>That does not take me much further. It then states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"determined in accordance with section 78E below, to bear responsibility for any thing which is to be done by way of remediation in any particular case".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-11_para5"></a>Perhaps that particular piece of language should be enshrined in Hansard as an example of what ought to be avoided if at all possible. We are told by way of explanation that that implies that there can be more than one appropriate person in relation to any particular site. I am bound to say that that explanation and enlightenment succeeds in one thing: it adds to my confusion, but that may well be my fault and no one else's. I should be grateful if my noble friend could say a word or two about "appropriate person" because it might be important.

<P>
<A NAME="50711-11_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I apologise again for the lengthy introduction to this group of amendments. I apologise also for the fact that it might have been a little tedious for your Lordships. But, as my noble friend Lord Jenkin realised, this is of considerable importance to many people.
<P>

<a name="50711-11_para6"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hilton, was keen to find out what I think "reasonable" means. I am afraid that I cannot give much of an answer because the "reasonableness" depends on the problem. Perhaps we can remove ourselves for a moment from consideration of the Bill. If the noble Baroness had left her handbag on a chair upon which I wanted to sit and I asked her to remove it, I might think that it was unreasonable if she took an hour to do so. On the other hand, if she was occupying my house and I asked her to move out of the <P>


<a name="column_1501"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1501</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>house, it might be unreasonable to expect her to do so in under six months. A definition of "reasonableness" depends on the situation about which one is expected to be "reasonable". The question of how long is "reasonable" will have to be considered by local authorities, but I should have thought that it was likely to be a question of months rather than longer.
<P>

<a name="50711-11_para7"></a>The noble Baroness was also concerned about remediation. As I have said, the time period depends very much on the problems. The noble Baroness also referred to costs and asked whether local authorities would receive more funding. The Department of the Environment already runs a contaminated land survey and a supplementary credit approval programme to provide capital resources to local authorities for such work. Since 1990, some &#163;40 million has been spent under the programme on investigation and remediation works at over 800 sites. The size of the programme is reviewed annually in the public expenditure survey. I have no doubt that that will continue and that local authorities will be affected accordingly.
<P>

<a name="50711-11_para8"></a>My noble friend Lord Jenkin asked whether the statement would appear in the guidance. I do not think that guidance can seek to construe primary legislation. There is a danger that if we seek to remove any doubt about the meaning of the term "cause or knowingly permit" in the context of this legislation, it could create the opposite effect in other legislation. I think that we ought to leave the statement as it is, knowing the way in which it will be taken.
<P>

<a name="50711-11_para9"></a>My noble friend Lord Peyton referred to the "appropriate person" and said that such expressions should be enshrined in Hansard. I can understand my noble friend feeling that. Indeed, he reminded me of another Bill and a Committee debate about somebody being over the age of 16. The Bill said that a person would be deemed to be over the age of 16 if he was not under the age of 16. I thought that that was fairly explicit. The definition of who is an "appropriate person" will appear in Section 78E and anyone who does not fall within the definition will not be an appropriate person. My noble friend now knows exactly where he is. I should have thought that it was pretty obvious really.
<P>

<a name="50711-11_para10"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hilton, was also concerned about the contaminated land regime which identifies land as contaminated only if it gives rise to significant harm or water pollution. That will not impose much greater burdens on local authorities than the existing statutory nuisance regime which identifies contaminated land which is prejudicial to health. I hope that I have responded to most of your Lordships' concerns and that your Lordships' will consider that this group of amendments should be approved.

<A NAME="50711-12_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House to agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 87 to 125. I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 229 to 233, 255 and 256.
<P>

<a name="50711-12_para0"></a>The Government's intention, in moving the bulk of the amendments was to ensure that the provisions for pre-notification of the abandonment of mines, and for the removal of the defence and exemption in respect of mines abandoned after the end of 1999, should work as intended. The amendments also serve to make the legislation as clear as possible to the mine operators and owners affected.
<P>

<a name="50711-12_para1"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 97. The noble Lords, Lord Ezra, Lord Beaumont of Whitley and Lord Moran, proposed an amendment which would have required a mine operator who served notice of abandonment on the agency to publish the notice in local newspapers as well. A similar amendment was also tabled in another place.
<P>

<a name="50711-12_para2"></a>Having considered further the points raised on this proposal, the Government tabled Amendment No. 97 to meet substantially those points. It requires anyone serving a notice of abandonment on the agency to publish particulars of, or relating to, that notice in one or more newspapers circulating in the locality of the mine. Amendment No. 111 has the same effect in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="50711-12_para3"></a>Amendments Nos. 118 and 123 amend the provisions in Clause 57 which refer to the removal of the defence against prosecution and the exemption from cost recovery from the owners and operators of mines abandoned after the end of 1999.
<P>

<a name="50711-12_para4"></a>Your Lordships may recall that the removal of the defence and exemption was subject to amendments moved by my noble friend Lord Stanley of Alderley, which he regrettably put to a Division, and the Government lost. The Government have now agreed to accept the amendments. We have tabled further amendments (Amendments Nos. 229, 231 and 256) which will bring the law in Scotland into line with that approach. However, we were concerned that one aspect of the wording was unclear. It refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the owner or operator of any mine or part of a mine if the mine of the part in question became abandoned after 31st December 1999".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-12_para5"></a>We believe that that could be confusing as any abandoned mine is, by definition, not being operated. That will please my noble friend Lord Peyton: an abandoned mine is an abandoned mine&#151;it is one that <P>


<a name="column_1521"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1521</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has been abandoned. The amendments therefore change the wording so that it refers to the "former operator", which clarifies what is meant.
<P>

<a name="50711-12_para6"></a>With regard to Amendments Nos. 88, 91, 93, 94, 97, 103, 106, 108 and 111, we have had to have regard to the fact that sometimes the act of abandonment will accompany or follow the insolvency of the operator. We have had to look carefully at the position of office holders in liquidations and bankruptcies who would be prevented from notifying the abandonment of a mine promptly. Private sector office holders, of course, are allowed to review the cases they are offered, and have the right to refuse an appointment. The Official Receiver, on the other hand, when acting in the capacities listed in the amendments, has no choice. He cannot refuse to act. He might therefore be placed in a position of being compelled to continue some mining operations when there are no assets in the company to fund this, or face prosecution for a criminal offence. That would not of course be acceptable. These amendments, therefore, ensure that the Official Receiver, when acting in those capacities, does not commit an offence if he abandons a mine or part of a mine without giving six months' notice, providing he notifies the agency as soon as is practicable.
<P>

<a name="50711-12_para7"></a>These are all complicated provisions, but they are designed to enhance the agency's ability to address mine water pollution. The amendments have all been framed to ensure that the provisions will work in practice and address the events preceding and following the abandonment of mines in such a manner as is most appropriate.

<P>
<A NAME="50711-13_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hilton of Eggardon: </B>   My Lords, the whole question of pollution from abandoned mines exercised us at great length at earlier stages of the Bill. We regret profoundly that the Government have not imposed a statutory duty on the Coal Authority to deal with minewater pollution. One cannot expect of course at this late stage to amend the Bill to include that, but we would be grateful if a clear statement could be made as to what action the Coal Authority is expected to take in relation to minewater pollution.
<P>

<a name="50711-13_para0"></a>As recently as April this year, the chief executive of the Coal Authority, Neville Washington, said that the Coal Authority was not responsible for water that emerges from the pits. Nevertheless, during its passage through this House and the other place, we were given assurances by the then Ministers that the Coal Authority would be expected to go beyond the minimum standards of environmental responsibility which are set by its legal duties. That was a vague statement which was not wholly reassuring at the time, but it did at least suggest that the Coal Authority had some responsibility for pollution of water from mines that were already closed. In view of the chief executive's recent statement, the extent to which we were reassured has now been considerably undermined.
<P>

<a name="50711-13_para1"></a>Another member of the Coal Authority, the director of contracts, Albert Schofield, said in May&#151;even more recently&#151;that the Bill was not clear in assigning <P>


<a name="column_1522"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1522</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>responsibility for minewater pollution from abandoned coalmines to the Coal Authority. We would be grateful if the Minister could clarify whether the Coal Authority is responsible; who will deal with polluted water that arises from mines that have been closed; and who is responsible for continuing the pumping of mines that have been closed.
<P>

<a name="50711-13_para2"></a>This a serious matter. There are rivers in the north east which are already seeing pollution from many of the coalmines which have been abandoned or closed there. Unless there is a clear assignment of responsibility, public concern will continue to grow and we will continue to see rivers which are affected by heavy metal and other poisons seeping out of closed coalmines. I should be grateful if the Minister could reassure us further as to what are the responsibilities of the Coal Authority or whether the Government will be picking up the tag if the Coal Authority is not responsible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Beaumont of Whitley: </B>   My Lords, I join with the noble Baroness in asking for some clarification in this area. We have already spent a great deal of time on this issue and it seems to be an area where the Government have fudged the issue to a great degree. It is far from clear where the responsibility lies. There are dangers that there will be great pollution into the future, and it will be difficult to find out how to cope with it. I add the thanks of myself, my noble friend Lord Ezra and other noble Lords who put forward the amendment relating to advertising in local newspapers. That was worthwhile. I am grateful to them for doing so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Stanley of Alderley: </B>   My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who supported the amendment that I had the privilege of moving. I include the noble Lord, Lord Williams, who I think suspected me of being half-hearted on the second part of it, regarding the date of 1999 but I was not. I thank the Government for graciously accepting your Lordships' wishes and for adding the small technical amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-13_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Stanley of Alderley for having been good enough to express his thanks that we should have accepted the amendment which your Lordships passed, and which we have considered and thought appropriate to address, and adjust so as to improve it. It is an example of how, when your Lordships feel that something is important your Lordships do, on occasions&#151;as some say&#151;put the bit between your Lordships' teeth and pass an amendment which is sometimes not the wish of the Government. On consideration, it is often shown that your Lordships are correct. On this occasion your Lordships were correct, and we were able to amend the amendment to make it more appropriate to the Bill as a whole.
<P>

<a name="50711-13_para3"></a>I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, thought that we had fudged the issue. I do not think that we did fudge it. Of course it is not an easy issue with which to deal. I believe that we have come to the right conclusion. Time alone will show whether that is so. I am grateful to him for his appreciation of the amendment with regard to advertising in local <P>

<P>

<a name="50711-13_para4"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hilton, was worried about the Coal Authority, abandoned coalmines, and so forth. We have to realise that we must put in place arrangements to deal with the essential pollution prevention work which was formerly carried out by British Coal, particularly pumping at certain sites in Durham, notwithstanding that there was no statutory requirement for that work. We must then initiate a dialogue between the authority and the water regulators on the priorities for any other such work by the authority. In general, the authority is the owner of the abandoned coal mines throughout Great Britain. It has the responsibility which goes with that ownership. That responsibility will continue and it will be that of the Coal Authority.

<P>
<A NAME="50711-13_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 126 to 128 en bloc. Much has been said in this House and in another place about the second national park purpose and what it means for the future management of the parks. I understand the importance which has been attached to the concept of the national parks as places to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Indeed, we recognised their importance in this respect in our 1992 policy statement on the future of the parks.
<P>

<a name="50711-13_para7"></a>I know that our policy statement indicated a willingness to consider the term "quiet enjoyment". However, in drafting the clauses which were to be introduced as part of this Bill, we gave long and careful consideration to the meaning of this phrase and the consequences of its use for all those, and especially the national park authorities, who would need to interpret it on a daily basis. We became convinced that to enshrine this phrase in statute would raise more difficulties than it would solve. Most of the issues that have been raised during the passage of this Bill with regard to "quiet enjoyment" became obvious to us during the drafting process. Your Lordships considered that "quiet enjoyment" was a better and more appropriate phrase than "enjoyment" and in Committee your Lordships moved that the word "quiet" should be included in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50711-13_para8"></a>We have now had time to consider the matter in detail. While I understand the reasons for including the word "quiet", it is considered to be almost impossible <P>


<a name="column_1524"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1524</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to enforce in a court of law. One would ask&#151;and I can see my noble friend Lord Peyton enjoying doing so&#151;"What is quiet and what is noisy? Is sailing to be permitted but not power boat sailing? If power boat sailing is noisy, is an outboard motor noisy?". The difficulty of interpretation would be almost endless.
<P>

<a name="50711-13_para9"></a>Some supporters of "quiet enjoyment" have put forward the view that the Bill, as your Lordships amended it, does no more than ensure that there is an emphasis on promoting opportunities for "quiet enjoyment". They claim that the inclusion of the word "quiet" could not be used to justify the exclusion of other activities which may be noisy. They also say that national park authorities will not be prevented from continuing to promote opportunities for activities which are not "quiet". Very many, who have made their position clear to Ministers, dispute these propositions. They claim the reverse; that the inclusion of the word "quiet" must imply a presumption against a whole range of recreational activities, many of which have traditionally been carried on in the parks and, indeed, can often be seen as part of the local culture and character but may not be quiet.
<P>

<a name="50711-13_para10"></a>After a great deal of thought and deliberation, we have concluded that the term "quiet enjoyment" could be more serious and potentially detrimental to the future of the parks than the supporters of the phrase realise. Furthermore, your Lordships will be aware that the Government considered such an amendment in another place. My noble friend Lord Barber and the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, also introduced amendments but none of them commanded universal support. Nor did we believe that any of them solved the difficulties which arise with "quiet enjoyment". We do not believe that the second national park purpose can be resolved by further clarificatory amendments. We have therefore concluded, and another place has agreed, that it would be preferable to return to the wording which the Government introduced in the Bill. That wording was drafted after very careful consideration.
<P>

<a name="50711-13_para11"></a>In returning the second national park purpose to its original form, we shall make clear in revised draft guidelines that there is a variety of ways in which the parks can be enjoyed and that the national park authorities should continue to promote the widest range of opportunities for recreation. I want to make it clear that we continue fully to respect the conservation values which the parks represent and which have led to so many appreciating the qualities which they seek to reflect in the phrase "quiet enjoyment". It will certainly not be appropriate for all forms of recreation to take place in every part of the parks. Large areas of the parks will, and should, continue to be quietly enjoyed for much of the time.
<P>

<a name="50711-13_para12"></a>It will be the responsibility of the national park authorities to strike a balance between the legitimate demands to use all the opportunities which the parks afford for recreation and the equally legitimate desires of those who wish to enjoy only their beauty and tranquillity. National park authorities will continue to be able to promote activities which are most appropriate to the particular circumstances of their parks. I do not doubt that they will wish to place emphasis on "quiet" <P>


<a name="column_1525"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1525</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>activities; but they must also ensure that the parks continue to accommodate a wide range of recreational opportunities.
<P>

<a name="50711-13_para13"></a>In striking this balance, the national parks will, in those rare cases where there is a conflict between the conservation and recreation purposes of the parks which cannot be reconciled, be guided by the Sandford principle that the first purpose takes precedence. That is now set out in Clause 59 of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50711-13_para14"></a>I hope that despite and even because of all the discussions on this difficult subject your Lordships will agree that the new wording of the Bill as agreed by another place should be incorporated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, it will come as no surprise to the noble Earl that we do not agree with the Commons in their amendment to the amendment passed on Division in your Lordships' House. The principle of quiet enjoyment has been strongly supported by all parties. Indeed, it was strongly supported on all sides of the Chamber when the noble Lord, Lord Norrie, moved his amendment. We supported attempts to clarify what "quiet enjoyment" meant in the context of national parks. However, in the end we decided that there was no substitute for case law when it came to interpreting what Parliament had decided.
<P>

<a name="50711-14_para0"></a>After the publication of the Edwards Report, the Government made a commitment to the principle of park authorities promoting quiet enjoyment. That was the Government's response to the Edwards Report. It appears from what the Minister said that nothing has happened to detract from that principle. I understand that the Government remain committed to their response to the Edwards Report.
<P>

<a name="50711-14_para1"></a>In another place during Committee, Members of all parties supported the principle. On Report, my right honourable and honourable friends tried to move an amendment, given that the Government were not happy with what your Lordships had approved on a Division. They fought hard for the retention of the words. Indeed, they were supported by many representations from all kinds of organisations and private individuals. Finally, it came down to whether there was a definition that was acceptable in statute as opposed to a phrase which would be interpreted in case law.
<P>

<a name="50711-14_para2"></a>The Government wish to have in statute every conceivable dot and comma. Yet, we now have the position in which the Government, having accepted the Edwards Report and its conclusions on "quiet enjoyment", propose to put the measures into guidelines or guidance. I am wholly unclear&#151;and during the course of the afternoon other noble Lords have raised the problem&#151;as to what is the status of guidance or guidelines. Can they be challenged in either House of Parliament or in the courts? What is their status? If there are to be guidelines, I should prefer to have a simple phrase in the Bill such as "quiet enjoyment" and then to have that interpreted by the Government as to what they think it means. Indeed, in the light of Pepper v. Hart, <P>


<a name="column_1526"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1526</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as the noble Earl knows, the Government are entitled to put their gloss on what the expression means. The courts will then interpret it on a case by case basis.
<P>

<a name="50711-14_para3"></a>I cannot see, and nor can noble friends more learned than I, any case against that. At this last 11th hour and 59th minute, I ask the noble Earl to put on the record a very clear statement that the Government support the Edwards concept of quiet enjoyment&#151;that even though there may be different words in the Bill, those words should be interpreted by the courts as an endorsement of the principle of "quiet enjoyment" as expressed by Edwards. If the noble Earl can do that, I am prepared to be satisfied.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, I should find it of considerable interest if my noble friend could tell me whether the expression "quiet enjoyment" appears in any other statute and, if so, which one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Norrie: </B>   My Lords, I very much endorse what the noble Lord, Lord Williams, said. However, perhaps I may return to what happened when we debated the Bill earlier this year. I was concerned that it did not reflect adequately the findings of the Edwards Committee because it did not clarify the forms of enjoyment which national park authorities should promote. Therefore, in Committee I moved an amendment to make it absolutely clear what should be the second purpose of national parks. To my delight, the amendment was accepted.
<P>

<a name="50711-14_para4"></a>The amendment was based on the recommendations of the Edwards report and the subsequent policy statement by the Government to which my noble friend alluded. I wanted to ensure that the principle of park authorities promoting the quiet enjoyment of areas was set out clearly in statute. Since then, as the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Williams, have said, much debate has centred around the need for a definition of "quiet enjoyment". Although I am aware that technically a definition is not strictly necessary, I have supported the efforts of Ministers both in this House and another place to secure a definition so that there can be no misinterpretation of the recreational purpose of the parks. I was naturally disappointed that my amendment was reversed in another place due to difficulties in agreeing a suitable definition of "quiet enjoyment". I understand that that was due to reasons of technical drafting and does not represent a change of policy.
<P>

<a name="50711-14_para5"></a>Therefore, I welcome warmly the Minister's commitment to include in detailed guidance how the Bill is to be interpreted. That should illustrate the kind of activities which national park authorities will be expected to promote. Although numerous organisations, and I myself, would be much happier to have the words "quiet enjoyment" on the face of the Bill, I hope that the Minister's words will reassure the House and those who live, work and take their recreation within the parks.
<P>

<a name="50711-14_para6"></a>Last week I wrote to the Minister and requested him to reassure the House today that quiet enjoyment will remain a principle of national parks, as it has been since their creation almost 50 years ago. I hope that he will be able to reassure me that peacefulness and tranquillity are key special qualities of all national parks and that the types of activity which park authorities would be expected to promote should be only those which do not <P>


<a name="column_1527"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1527</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>put in jeopardy those special qualities. I hope that my noble friend will confirm that, as a principle, quiet enjoyment remains as relevant as it always has been. I ask him to indicate that that principle would be made absolutely clear in the guidance which is to accompany the Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="50711-14_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Nicol: </B>   My Lords, I support the requests made by my noble friend on the Front Bench and the noble Lord, Lord Norrie. I am worried that the whole exercise of including the words "quiet enjoyment" and then taking them out again will have an unfortunate effect. Publicity has been given to the fact that those words have been removed and I am worried that that may give the wrong impression to many people about what is now to be permitted in national parks, more so than if the argument had not taken place at all.
<P>

<a name="50711-14_para7"></a>There has been a kind of minor hysteria in the other place about the effect of the word "quiet", leaving aside for the moment the legal difficulties, which I believe have been overemphasised. The clause that we are talking about is concerned with what the authorities are actively required to promote. Therefore, it does not give them power to close down any existing activity as far as I can see. Therefore, a great deal of the fuss that has been made about putting an end to activities which now take place in the parks appears to me to be quite unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="50711-14_para8"></a>As the Bill went through in its earlier stages, we dealt with the composition of the authorities. That composition will be very important in relation to the interpretation of what is now proposed by the Government. Later this evening we shall be discussing the proposed changes to the composition of those authorities. It seems to me that those changes will give us additional cause for concern when we look at them in the context of the removal of that phrase. I very much regret what has happened and hope that the Minister will reassure us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Brabazon of Tara: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the removal of the word "quiet" from the Bill because it has caused a great deal of anxiety for a number of legitimate organisations which promote activities within the national parks.
<P>

<a name="50711-14_para9"></a>I am a member of the Public Policy Committee of the RAC and I am concerned in particular about the RAC rally. Rallying and motor sports in general are very popular and in this country, we are extremely good at them. Indeed, those sports produce a great deal of revenue for the Exchequer, which I am sure will be welcomed by all noble Lords. But the fact is that two-thirds of the RAC rally takes place in national park areas and has done for many years, long before they were so designated in fact. To impose a duty on park authorities to promote quiet activity could put in serious doubt the continuation of the RAC rally, among other things.
<P>

<a name="50711-14_para10"></a>It is all very well for noble Lords and others to say that the national park authorities have no intention of stopping the RAC rally. But others&#151;what I might call the environmental puritans or zealots&#151;may take the <P>


<a name="column_1528"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1528</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>national park authorities to court for allowing something like the RAC rally to take place because it would not be promoting quiet enjoyment. The RAC rally is enjoyed by many thousands of people, but by no stretch of the imagination could it be described as quiet. The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, may not enjoy it. I believe that the environmental zealots would wish to remove the word "enjoyment" from national parks legislation because, on the whole, they seem to want to stop anybody enjoying anything at all.
<P>

<a name="50711-14_para11"></a>The same applies to sailing. Anxieties have been expressed by sailing interests. Sailing is a quiet activity, but if there is to be competitive dinghy racing on a lake in a park, there must be a motorised safety boat. There are those who wish to ban all motor boats from lakes in national parks. If the word "quiet" is included in the Bill, they could probably attempt to do so.
<P>

<a name="50711-14_para12"></a>There are a great number of other activities which legitimately take place in the national parks which could not be described as quiet. I believe that the Bill as currently drafted is a great deal better.

<P>
<A NAME="50711-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Beaumont of Whitley: </B>   My Lords, I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, is repeating arguments which I thought had been thoroughly dealt with at a previous stage. The fact that we want quiet enjoyment of the parks does not automatically mean, or even imply, any kind of a ban on specific sports. To go as far as he did and say that people in the national parks are not in favour of anyone enjoying themselves suggests a total misunderstanding of what the national parks are for. The mere fact that the national parks are there means that people who use them are enjoying themselves and take great pleasure from that.
<P>

<a name="50711-15_para0"></a>My purpose in rising to my feet is not to repeat the arguments which have been put forward by the noble Lords, Lord Williams and Lord Norrie, but to say that the previous desire to have quiet enjoyment was supported in all parts of the House and that certainly includes noble Lords on these Benches. Although we understand why that provision has been taken out, we are sorry. We look to the Government to produce the greatest possible reassurance in the guidance that will be given.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Stanley of Alderley: </B>   My Lords, I am informed that the words "quiet enjoyment" could curtail work, particularly agricultural work, in the national parks. I am aware that agricultural activities are often not quiet and certainly they are not peaceful. If there are to be guidelines, I hope that my noble friend can assure me that the "work activities", if I may call them that, will not be affected. I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, will support such a view as will the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Chorley: </B>   My Lords, I support the remarks made by the previous speakers, with the particular exception of the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, with whom I totally disagree. There was very wide support from all sides of the House when the noble Lord, Lord Norrie, moved his successful amendment. I accept that the Government tried both then, and subsequently in another place, to come up with a definition. It may be that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, is right that that was not <P>


<a name="column_1529"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1529</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>necessary and it could be done the other way round by case law. However, I believe that the Government tried but they have not come up with a suitable definition. The route by way of guidance is probably the best we can expect at this stage.
<P>

<a name="50711-15_para1"></a>I would like to see particular attention paid to the remarks contained in the Edwards report. It states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"While we do not support their"&#151;</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-15_para2"></a>by "their" it is speaking about such activities as those referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, including motor cycle scrambling, rally driving and so forth&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"total prohibition in national parks, they should only take place on those rare sites where they do not cause undue annoyance to other park users or damage to the fabric of the parks themselves".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-15_para3"></a>The report says that in most cases other places can be found to carry out those activities.
<P>

<a name="50711-15_para4"></a>The point about the Edwards report is that it took the view that there are particular national parks where things can be done which should not be done in other parks. It is that kind of sentiment that one needs to get into the guidance. I do not know how these things are done, but when the Government draw up their guidelines I hope that they will consult with the relevant organisations like the NGOs and the National Trust, because we have a great deal of ownership in national parks. That would be important.
<P>

<a name="50711-15_para5"></a>What is most important of all&#151;and here I am taking up a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol&#151;is that it would be deplorable if this Bill were to reach the statute book with any suggestion that the Government had in any way departed from the principle of quiet enjoyment as a special quality to be promoted and protected in our national parks.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may add my disappointment to that already expressed by noble Lords on both sides of the House that the Government have been unable to produce an appropriate definition. In a way, I am rather surprised that they have not been able to do so. It is disappointing because it was a crucial part of the Edwards report that quiet enjoyment should be part of the policy towards the national parks.
<P>

<a name="50711-15_para6"></a>I believe that most of us know what was intended. I recognise that it would be possible for ill-intentioned people to try to challenge perfectly legitimate activities. As regards what my noble friend Lord Stanley of Alderley said, I find it very hard to believe that anyone would contemplate challenging agricultural activities. That seems to be dicta ad absurdum as an argument.
<P>

<a name="50711-15_para7"></a>However, there is a need for tranquillity which is growing in this age. Things that may have been acceptable a while ago are not going to be acceptable. I wonder whether my noble friend Lord Brabazon is right in saying that activities such as rallies would be acceptable forever. Recently I heard of someone with a business&#151;and there is nothing immoral about it&#151;taking people around national parks by helicopter. It is not right that in the future people's enjoyment of national parks should be spoilt by one or two persons being taken around by helicopter.

<a name="50711-15_para8"></a>It is an unsatisfactory legislative process that we cannot define the problem and yet we are told that there will be guidance. At the very least the Government should have provided&#151;and have had time to provide&#151;some draft guidance so that we see the kind of things that they have in mind. I do not cast any aspersions on the Government's intentions. I take at face value their earlier commitment to the principle of quiet enjoyment, which was contained in the Edwards report. But we need to be given more detail of the kind of thing that would be in the guidance. I agree with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, that we must have a clearer idea of the vires of what the guidance would be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-15_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Lytton: </B>   My Lords, at the risk of prolonging this discussion, I would like to say from this Bench that I support what the Government have been doing. With so many voices saying that the term "quiet" should precede "enjoyment", in throwing my hat into the ring I would like to bring some of my own experiences to bear on this matter.
<P>

<a name="50711-15_para9"></a>The Minister has quite rightly pointed out the difficulties of definition. I considered that myself in the light of some knowledge of commercial landlord and tenant where the term "quiet enjoyment" is a commonplace piece of terminology. But outside that rarified world of commercial activity, it clearly means different things to different people. Noble Lords will perhaps remember that I moved an amendment late in the proceedings in this House before the matter left for another place. It was evident to me, as it must have been to many others, that there was no consensus as to what that term meant. That is a very dangerous precedent and message to send out attached to an Act of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="50711-15_para10"></a>I accept that the national parks authorities should not be in the business of encouraging noisy activities, but acoustic matters are only one part of the equation. It is possible to be a hostage to fortune because of the lack of interpretation and definition. The provision is being treated by local authorities as "a duty to prevent". I say that with a degree of certainty, having recently been in a national park local planning inquiry where I was obliged to challenge a reference to commercial shooting. There were other references to other things about quiet enjoyment, but that was the particular matter about which I was concerned. I must explain why that was the case. I run a shoot commercially. It probably makes the difference between the estate balancing its books as against making a thumping loss. It also gives rise to a managed activity which enables investment to be made in things which could not otherwise be afforded.
<P>

<a name="50711-15_para11"></a>I am satisfied in my own mind that that national park authority and other local authorities will latch on to the principle of quiet enjoyment, like it or not, as a facility to decline consent for planning permission for anything that might be associated with a certain amount of noise. It is not just a matter of a particular class of activity; it is a question of quantum and of intensity of use. That brings in considerations of frequency and timing. These are the critical factors and they are matters of management. They are not a matter of absolutes whereby someone says that motoring is inherently noisy and walking is inherently quiet. If a large number of people walk along a footpath past someone's farmstead&#151;I had <P>


<a name="column_1531"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1531</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reason to see the result of this when I took a potential purchaser round a farm last year which had a coastal footpath running next to it&#151;it can create disamenity. This matter depends on one's point of view, on one's standpoint and on the position of the recipient of the acoustic or other disamenity. It is important that we get that straight.
<P>

<a name="50711-15_para12"></a>Therefore I do not believe that it is just a question of clarifying what national park authorities should promote. As I said, I tried to get that clear at a late stage in this Bill. However, what is more to the point is what it is that they should reject. That is, if I may put it this way, the hidden agenda that people in the countryside are so worried about; that there is this unstated raft of activities which for whatever reason are considered inappropriate. As someone who farms and owns land in a national park I cannot accept that.
<P>

<a name="50711-15_para13"></a>It has nothing to do with my activities, but I have been brought up with the concept of multi-use and multi-activity. I do not believe we should say that national parks are not appropriate places for the activities of the motorist or the power boat user. There ought to be the concept of national parks being used as the lungs of the nation, if you like, for all, and none, as the case may be. I have been brought up with that concept ever since I have managed my particular part of Exmoor.
<P>

<a name="50711-15_para14"></a>I finish by supporting what the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, mentioned. I wish to reassure him that the citation of the Exmoor national park&#151;noble Lords may recall that each national park has a citation attached to it&#151;refers to it as fine country for motoring.

<A NAME="50711-15_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I did not think that this group of amendments would be what one might call an easy ride, not only because your Lordships have discussed this matter frequently before and hold strong views on it, but also because you passed an amendment to insert the words "quiet enjoyment" into the Bill and another place has taken them out. I would not have expected your Lordships to change your views on that. This is a difficult matter. My noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter asked me whether "quiet enjoyment" appear in any other statute. As far as I know, the words do not.

<P>
<A NAME="50711-16_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is telling me that the words appear in landlord and tenant legislation. In that case he has the advantage of me. I have no doubt that if he says that it is correct, in which case he has answered the question of the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter. He might have intervened to tell him that, had he wanted to.

<P>
<A NAME="50711-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I could formally intervene. The noble Earl alas, was not Minister at the time. There was a debate, as the noble Earl has read, in which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, pointed out that the words "quiet enjoyment" occurred in landlord and tenant legislation.

<P>
<A NAME="50711-16_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for answering the question of the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend give way? I remember clearly an extremely powerful speech by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, in which he said that in that landlord and tenant legislation the words "quiet enjoyment" meant something totally different from what we have been talking about in this debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-16_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I have never known the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, make a speech which was not powerful. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Jenkin for correcting the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel. We must be careful not to be&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to the noble Earl but the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, did not correct me; it was a matter of fact. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, quite rightly said that the words had a completely different meaning. The question of the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, was, "Do these words occur in any other legislation"? The answer is yes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-16_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter&#151;as is the House&#151;is now far more fully aware of the problems than we all were before.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-16_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, if these words appear in a totally different sense, as is suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, is not that a relevant consideration as to whether it is sensible to use them in this Act?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-16_spnew9"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter, like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, makes another pungent point, as he always does. It is perfectly true that if they have different meanings in different Acts it may be desirable not to include them in this Bill. That is why we thought it best not to do so.
<P>

<a name="50711-16_para0"></a>To return to the real problem, I do not think that there is too much between anyone here as regards what we are trying to do. The question is whether this provision should be put into a statute. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, said he thought that the best thing to do would be to insert a simple phrase into the Bill and then the Government can say what they think the phrase means. I do not think that that would be the right thing to do because eventually the courts would have to come to a conclusion as to what "quiet enjoyment" means. The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, said that he wanted to know what the Government feel about the guidance, and he asked whether we accepted the Edwards recommendations. We continue to accept the concept which underlines the report's recommendations on quiet enjoyment. The guidance will make this clear, and it will be available to the national parks authorities and to others. It certainly will not be statutory, but we would obviously expect the authorities and others to take full account of it.
<P>

<a name="50711-16_para1"></a>Then the noble Lord, Lord Williams, asked whether the guidelines could be challenged. Guidelines are an explanation of government policy stating what should <P>


<a name="column_1533"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1533</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be done. However, if a national park were taken to court, the fact that it had not followed the guidelines could be held against it. The noble Lord, Lord Chorley, asked whether the guidelines would be subject to consultation. The answer is that they are subject to consultation. My noble friend Lord Marlesford said that he had not yet seen the guidance. The draft guidance was published in January of this year. We intend to revise the guidance in the light of the debates in both Houses. We shall then consult widely on the revised draft later this year. I believe that that is the right way to do it. If one puts these words into a Bill, the only way one will know what they mean is when someone takes the matter to court.
<P>

<a name="50711-16_para2"></a>It is all very fine my noble friend Lord Marlesford saying&#151;I think it was a momentary slip of intellectual superiority&#151;that we all know what we mean by "quiet enjoyment", but the fact is that we do not all know what is meant. My noble friend Lord Stanley said that the provision might curtail agriculture. It might do so. What happens when chain-saws are making the most appalling noise? Has anyone listened to a farmer preparing silage for three days on end? The buzzing is worse than a thousand drones of bees and it is constant. No one could say that that adds to quiet enjoyment.
<P>

<a name="50711-16_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, swatted my noble friend Lord Brabazon of Tara rather like a fly in saying that he raised issues that had been dealt with at an earlier stage. My noble friend Lord Brabazon was quite right. He raised issues which were considered at an earlier stage but which have not been resolved. They would not have been resolved with the incorporation of the words "quiet enjoyment".
<P>

<a name="50711-16_para4"></a>If the words "quiet enjoyment" are included, a great many activities are put at risk. They also create considerable uncertainty. Some parks have speed boats; some have jet-skis; some have motor-bike rallies; some have soldiers. The noble Earl, Lord Lytton, said that he was all for national parks being for everyone. If one includes "quiet enjoyment", does that mean that one excludes the jet-skis, the speed boats, the motor-bike rallies and the soldiers? What is quiet enjoyment? Is it when you are sitting down in a national park having a cup of tea? If all of a sudden a man whose face is covered in black leaps out of a bush at you, being a soldier on an exercise, you could well say, "That's not quiet enjoyment. It disturbed my afternoon."
<P>

<a name="50711-16_para5"></a>Once we put that into statute we run into trouble. I believe that another place was correct to say that we should not put it in statute but include it in the guidance. I can tell your Lordships that the first draft of the guidance has already gone out. We intend to revise the guidance in the light of what has been said in both Houses. Then it will be open to wide consultation. I believe that that is the best approach. I hope that your Lordships will agree.
<P>

<a name="50711-16_para6"></a>I do not believe that it is possible to have one simple answer for all the national parks and the different parts of the national parks. That is why national park authorities are set up to conduct the parks as best they can and in the way they think fit in accordance with the guidance. As I said, the guidance will be very full.

<A NAME="50711-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, as I understand it, Amendment No. 129 introduces a new subject. Perhaps the noble Earl may wish to expand on the subject that it introduces before the Question is put to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-17_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, is enormously helpful. I am deeply grateful. I am afraid that in the excitement of the last amendments my papers became a little confused and I thought that we were dealing with a different amendment. I am grateful to the noble Lord for having pulled me back on to the track.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para0"></a>In moving Amendment No. 129 perhaps I may speak also to Amendments Nos. 186 to 188, 214 to 219, 318, 320, 321, 327 and 335. All of these amendments are minor or technical amendments, other than Amendments Nos. 129 and 188. They are required to validate payments of national parks supplementary grant which have been made by my department and the Welsh Office to county and metropolitan district councils since 1990.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para1"></a>The Secretary of State must lay a report annually before another place. This should specify both the determinations relating to the amount of grant to be paid to country councils which run the national parks and the considerations leading the Secretary of State to make such determinations. The report should be approved by affirmative resolution by another place.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para2"></a>Regrettably both my department and the Welsh Office have failed to lay such reports before another place since 1990. The legislation permits the payments to be made. The payments were made. They were properly audited in the same way as other local authority expenditure is audited. However, regrettably, the necessary reporting procedure to Parliament was omitted. This problem has only recently come to light and we thought it important that the legality of the payments which have been made to local authorities should be put beyond doubt. That would be achieved by Amendments Nos. 129 and 188. I commend the amendments to the House.

Not only do we have retrospective validation of payments which were apparently made illegally, but we also have an admission by the Minister that his department and the Welsh Office did not lay the appropriate reports for the payments in question.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para3"></a>This is an important issue. Can the noble Earl explain to this House what inquiries have been made in his department and in the Welsh Office to find out why such <P>


<a name="column_1536"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1536</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reports were not laid before the other place, as was their duty? What sanctions have been taken against those who were responsible? Which Ministers were involved, and what sanctions have been taken against those Ministers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-17_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I have no hesitation in saying that this is a regrettable occurrence. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, is quite right. Rather than brush the matter aside, we thought it appropriate that it should be put right. It should be made clear that the payments were not made illegally. Legislation permitted the payments to be made and the payments have been properly audited.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para4"></a>Where we went wrong was in omitting the reporting procedure to Parliament. That was due to an oversight. It is clearly something which should not have happened. Both departments regret that it has happened. The failure appears to be associated largely with the major changes in the regime for local government finance which were introduced in 1990. Both my department and the Welsh Office faced a major task in introducing the new arrangements. In focusing on those they regrettably lost sight of the fact that approval for those grants continued under the previous arrangements. That is the position. It is a regrettable one and we thought it right to correct it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl said that the payments were not made illegally. If they were not made illegally, why do they have to be validated? I understood the expression "validated" to mean that payments which were made contrary to certain provisions, rather than merely not being reported&#151;payments made by mistake&#151;are validated retrospectively by both Houses of Parliament. That is the meaning of the word "validation" as I understand it. If that is not the case perhaps the noble Earl will explain that I am wrong. I believe that I am right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-17_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, much as the noble Lord would like me to, I shall not enter into the semantics of the definition of the word "validate". I tried to point out to him that these payments were made perfectly correctly. There was legislation which permitted those payments. It is not a question of payments being made which should not have been made. However, there should have been a report to Parliament, as he says, validating the payments. That is why we seek to amend the Bill now.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para5"></a>I tried to make clear that that should have been done. Parliament should have known about it. It was an error. However, the payments themselves were covered by legislation which permitted them. In addition, the receipt of the payments was audited.

<A NAME="50711-17_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 134. Perhaps I may speak also to Amendments Nos. 135 to 145, 169, 172 to 174, 181 to 184, 220, 261, 265, 267, 301 and 336.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para9"></a>The group of amendments introduces an important new part into the Bill which would provide a new framework for assessing and managing air quality in the United Kingdom. This new part provides for a national air quality strategy and for revised powers and duties on local authorities, the Secretary of State, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and others.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para10"></a>The amendments implement the government policy as was expressed in Improving Air Quality and Air Quality: Meeting the Challenge. Air Quality: Meeting the Challenge was published only in January of this year when the Bill was already before Parliament. I realise that it is a substantial group of amendments for your Lordships to digest at this stage. I hope that it will be seen to constitute a full and constructive response to the amendments tabled in the House by the noble Lords, Lord Lewis and Lord Nathan, and by my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para11"></a>In summary, the amendments introduce a national air quality strategy which will contain government policies on the assessment and management of air quality. They will introduce by regulation-making powers the means to prescribe air quality standards and objectives, and to enable other steps to be taken to meet them; and they will place new duties on local authorities to conduct reviews on local air quality, to designate air quality management areas and to prepare action plans to use their powers to address problems in those areas.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para12"></a>Amendment No. 134 allows for there to be a national air quality strategy. That will be a statement of government policies on the topic. As well as dealing with the United Kingdom's aims, the strategy will be a means of implementing some of the important air quality provisions of European Community directives and international agreements to which this country is a party. It will set out general standards and objectives on air quality, and will include measures which the Government are looking to local authorities and others to take in pursuit of the strategy's objectives.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para13"></a>By means of Amendment No. 135, we intend to ensure that the new agencies&#151;the Environment Agency for England and Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency&#151;have regard to the strategy in discharging their pollution control functions.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para14"></a>In Amendment No. 136, we require local authorities to carry out reviews in their areas of the present and likely future quality of air. The next step, described in Amendment No. 137, will be to require local authorities to designate local air quality management areas for all or part of their areas which are affected by air quality which is below the prescribed standards or objectives.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para15"></a>Where local authorities have designated air quality management areas, Amendment No. 138 will require them to revise or prepare assessments and to prepare action plans for those areas with timetables for the measures which they intend to take to address the problem. District and county councils will be required to work together in preparing the action plan in areas where both types of councils operate.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para16"></a>Amendment No. 139 deals with the reserve powers of the Secretary of State, or, in Scotland, of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, acting with the approval of the Secretary of State. In substance, the Secretary of State and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency are given wide powers to make directions to local authorities over the steps which they must take on local air quality.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para17"></a>Amendment No. 140 seeks to ensure that both district and county councils will be properly involved at all important stages of assessing and managing local air quality. Amendment No. 141 contains wide regulation-making powers and has a number of features which perhaps I may draw to your Lordships' attention. Regulations will be made for the purposes of implementing the strategy, implementing European Community or other international obligations, or otherwise for the assessment or management of the quality of air.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para18"></a>Perhaps most importantly, "air quality standards" and "air quality objectives" are defined in the section, Interpretation of Part (Air Quality), as those prescribed under regulations made under that section. It is therefore those standards and objectives which will trigger most of the provisions of that new part. I should make it clear that regulations could deal with standards and objectives which stand as long-term goals and those which act as alert levels or indicators of episodes.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para19"></a>Regulations will also deal with local authorities' powers and duties prohibiting or restricting prescribed activities, provision to the public of information on air quality, offences and appeals, fixed penalty schemes for offences under the regulations, and other aspects of new local air quality management systems.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para20"></a>These are wide powers for a number of reasons. As many of your Lordships will know, my department and the Scottish and Welsh Offices are involved in very active discussions with local authorities about their role in respect of air quality issues. Rather than try to anticipate in this Bill every detail of what may be needed, we have sought to reflect the strong view of many local authorities that powers within the Bill should be wide enough and flexible enough to be able to give effect to the outcome of those discussions. We understand that view and I think that we have gone a long way to meet it.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para21"></a>We may well need to consider implementation of European Community obligations through the medium of those regulations. One example might well be the air quality framework directive which is being concluded.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para22"></a>I should also like to address the safeguards that we have introduced in order to balance the regulation making powers. We have introduced provisions to ensure that there is consultation before the powers are used. Importantly, we propose that they should be <P>


<a name="column_1540"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1540</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>subject to the affirmative resolution procedure but with additional provision to the effect that provision for particular cases will not be treated as making the regulations hybrid. That last provision is necessary because the orders may relate to specific local authorities but will be made in pursuance of a national air quality strategy.
<P>

<a name="50711-17_para23"></a>Amendment No. 142 allows for guidance to be given by the Secretary of State which can cover the exercise by local authorities of their powers under this Part. Amendment No. 143 applies the national air quality strategy to the Isles of Scilly. Amendment No. 144 introduces a new schedule for this part. The other amendments are, I think, fairly straightforward. I commend the amendment.

<A NAME="50711-18_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hilton of Eggardon: </B>   My Lords, no doubt the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and I will make the same points about the anticipated costs to local authorities.
<P>

<a name="50711-18_para0"></a>The overall strategy for dealing with air quality is extremely welcome. We are delighted that it appears on the face of the Bill. However, the provision imposes specific new duties on local authorities; and costs could be considerable in terms of capital outlay. It has been estimated that purchasing or leasing the equipment to monitor a station to the appropriate standard could be as much as &#163;0.25 million per authority. In addition, there would be annual running costs of anywhere between&#151;-

<P>
<A NAME="50711-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, I have two amendments which are grouped with Amendment No. 134. I start by warmly welcoming the speed with which the Government have brought the primary legislation <P>


<a name="column_1541"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1541</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>before Parliament. We should bear in mind that the White Paper appeared only in January, yet within a few days it will now be embodied in primary legislation, and that is something for which the Government are entitled to great credit.
<P>

<a name="50711-18_para1"></a>I wish to speak to the new regulation-making power, to which my noble friend referred in Commons Amendment No. 141. That provision will give the local authorities power to tackle poor air quality and in particular to undertake the testing of vehicles at the roadside which are recognised as contributing substantially to atmospheric pollution in the cities. It is interesting that since the matter was discussed in your Lordships' House in Committee and on Report, public anxiety about the consequences of vehicle pollution in cities has greatly increased. During periods of still air and bright sunshine, the health consequences of pollution have been very much underlined. We must all from time to time, either in our families or among our friends, meet people who find that during the middle of the day in the cities it is almost impossible for them to go out because of the impact of conditions on their breathing.
<P>

<a name="50711-18_para2"></a>The clinical connection with asthma is the subject of a major study which has yet to be resolved, but no one can seriously doubt that adverse air quality from vehicles is now a serious matter. The Bill gives local authorities the power to join the Department of Transport in enforcing the construction and use regulations by testing vehicles at the roadside. That is a matter which we have pressed and it is now covered in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50711-18_para3"></a>I remind the House that the London Local Authorities Bill contains a power for that, but it is confined to the London boroughs. Subject to one point, this Bill probably makes it unnecessary for the authorities to proceed with that part of the local authorities Bill.
<P>

<a name="50711-18_para4"></a>I feel it is a little unfair that when one has been given a bowl nearly full of cherries, one should still ask for the bowl to be filled. However, there is one issue which I believe it is right for us to consider: the power of stopping. Everyone agrees that it is only police constables in uniform in general who should have the power to stop vehicles. I know that my right honourable friend is strongly of that view. After all, he spent a long time at the Home Office. It was asserted again in another place and is now to be found in Amendment No. 141, the long clause, subsection (5A) on page 39 of the Commons Amendments. Near the bottom of the page we see the explicit injunction that nothing in the clause would allow anyone other than a police officer to stop a vehicle.
<P>

<a name="50711-18_para5"></a>However, there is a great difficulty. If there is no power to stop vehicles, how will the local authorities be able to carry out their testing functions? It is mostly when a vehicle is on the move that one can see that it may well be guilty of emissions beyond the permitted limits. Therefore the London Bill originally included the power to stop vehicles.
<P>

<a name="50711-18_para6"></a>The more the matter is considered by the local authorities concerned, the more they believe that without the power to stop, the power to test will become largely <P>


<a name="column_1542"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1542</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ineffective. My amendments, Amendments Nos. 141A and 261A, give the Government power, but no obligation, to allow traffic wardens in uniform to undertake the stopping, in order that the local authorities may carry out testing. Traffic wardens are not local authority officials, they come under the police authorities. They carry out part of the police functions. It has become increasingly the practice over recent years since their introduction for traffic wardens to take over a number of functions which used regularly to be carried out by police, such as traffic direction, as well as their primary purpose of enforcing parking regulations and so on.
<P>

<a name="50711-18_para7"></a>It has, therefore, been suggested, that it is a perfectly legitimate extension of the existing role of traffic wardens that they should be permitted, under police control and direction&#151;and that is what it would be&#151;to engage in the stopping of vehicles so that the local authority testers can carry out tests.
<P>

<a name="50711-18_para8"></a>I entirely understand the difficulties of the Home Office and my right honourable friend in another place, Mr. Atkins, made it perfectly clear that he was having considerable arguments with his opposite numbers in the Home Office. I had the advantage of a brief discussion with the Home Secretary. Policemen and the police service do not regard it as a proper use of police time to stop vehicles for emission. They have more important things to do. Noble Lords will remember that I made that point firmly in earlier stages of the Bill. Policemen have plenty to do preventing crime and apprehending criminals. It is not realistic to expect them to stop vehicles for emission.
<P>

<a name="50711-18_para9"></a>Perhaps I may take the example of the 33 London boroughs. They hope to be able to have at least one team of testers per borough in action for most of the week. It is only one team covering the whole of a London borough with a population of 250,000 to 350,000 people, so that it is not a substantial exercise. However, in terms of 33 full-time policemen employed throughout London on that purpose, one begins to see why the commissioner and the Home Office are reluctant to commit police manpower to it. It is not just a question of money&#151;no doubt it could be paid for&#151;but trained policemen are expensive and they are specifically trained for certain purposes.
<P>

<a name="50711-18_para10"></a>Why should not local authorities be allowed to authorise and supervise where necessary traffic wardens carrying out the stopping of vehicles? My amendment would not automatically provide for that; all it does is to write into the Bill the power for the Government to make regulations which would authorise traffic wardens to carry out those functions.
<P>

<a name="50711-18_para11"></a>The Government may be right that the power to test will be a sufficient measure and deterrent. It may well be used on vehicles which have already been stopped and that action will, to an extent, have the effect of cleaning up the atmosphere. But a large number of people outside this House have the gravest doubt. If the power which the Government have now taken is to be made effective, I believe that as a precaution they should extend the power to allowing traffic wardens to stop vehicles. The wardens will be in uniform, instantly recognisable. Drivers are increasingly used to traffic wardens directing traffic, particularly when there are <P>


<a name="column_1543"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1543</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>emergencies. Traffic wardens will frequently divert vehicles to another street, where necessary. We have all become used to that. Therefore, my amendment would be a perfectly permissible extension. I recognise the difficulty that if we were to accept my amendments, the Bill would have to be returned to the other place with the amendments. Nevertheless it seems to me that, since the Government have gone most of the way to meet the strongly expressed views in this House and elsewhere that the power to test vehicles should now be put into primary legislation, it would be a pity if the legislation was ineffective because of failure to provide for an adequate stopping power. My amendments are a solution and I hope that, having heard the argument, my noble friend will be prepared to smile on them.

<P>
<A NAME="50711-19_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 134A as an amendment to Commons Amendment No. 134.
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para0"></a>I am as confused as everyone else over this procedure. I hope that I may, without adding to the confusion, also speak to Amendment No. 134D, which is grouped with this one and which makes the same point.
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para1"></a>These amendments are my attempts to draw to your Lordships' attention the importance of interdepartmental and cross-authority working. I hope that the Minister can reassure me that the references that I have suggested are not in fact necessary either as a matter of practice or indeed as a matter of legislation. I hope he can assure me that in the provisions as they will be set out on the face of the Bill, what I seek will be covered, and not simply as a matter of good will.
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para2"></a>I very much welcome Amendment No. 134. However, in welcoming it I must express regret that it is necessary, and indeed that it has come to be seen as more necessary during the difficult weather that we have experienced since this Bill started its passage through Parliament.
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para3"></a>My amendments refer not only to measures that are to be taken by local authorities but to measures to be taken by the Secretary of State (that is, the Secretary of State for the Environment), and more particularly the Secretary of State for Transport. I seek to include that reference in subsection (5) (c) and as a new paragraph in subsection (6).
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para4"></a>The contribution to air quality&#151;or perhaps I should say the detraction from air quality&#151;brought about by transport is increasingly understood and is a matter of increasing concern. Subsection (5) (c) refers to measures <P>


<a name="column_1544"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1544</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be taken by local authorities. Indeed, they will be in a position to do certain things to assist in improving air quality. They are very much at the sharp end. The Secretary of State for Transport may, for instance, have a policy whose effect is to increase road traffic, and perhaps in particular heavy traffic, rather than moving as much to rail as may be possible, or he may, for instance, not support the use of buses as much as may be practicable. Then it will be impossible for local authorities to take local steps which can do more than ameliorate at the very margins what is going on.
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para5"></a>I am sure that the new Secretary of State for Transport recognises very well that he inherits a huge responsibility in this area. As I say, I hope that the Minister can reassure me that that responsibility is recognised, not only as a matter of good will and general discussion between the departments, but actually in the words of the Bill. I cannot see it, but then I may not be reading the words quite correctly. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="50711-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness has a very good point of substance, but her way of dealing with it is contrary to our usual legislative practice. Unfortunately, the term "Secretary of State" is deemed to include all Secretaries of State. Now that we have a First Secretary of State, I think it would even include him. Therefore, although the noble Baroness clearly made a point that is worthy of consideration by the Government, I do not think the Government would feel themselves very much at ease in dealing with it in that way; and, alas, it is probably too late to find another way of drafting it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-19_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am glad that we got ourselves back on the technically correct rails, even though it was confusing not only to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, but also to others. She moved her amendment, and technically the debate is taking place on that amendment.
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para7"></a>Perhaps I may answer first the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hilton, on the substance of my amendment. She was concerned about local authority monitoring costs and thought that they would be very large. Not all authorities will need expensive monitoring equipment. Some will already have bought some equipment. We are expanding our networks and will be directing our resources at the priority areas. We shall discuss the cost fully with the local authorities, and we shall deal with all these matters in the course of the consultation which is bound to go on with the local authorities.
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para8"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, very kindly hoped that I should be able to tell her that her amendments were unnecessary. That is precisely what I was about to do, though in a more felicitous way. Her Amendment No. 134A is unnecessary because the strategy will set out the Government's policies on air quality, including the steps which they will take to address air quality problems. These will include policies <P>


<a name="column_1545"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1545</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that will be contributed to by a number of different government departments. It is unnecessary to specify individual Secretaries of State.
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para9"></a>In regard to Amendment No. 134D, my noble friend Lord Renton, as usual, hit the nail completely on the head when he said that, although the noble Baroness wants to consult the Secretary of State for Transport, it is not necessary to state that specifically in the Bill because the Secretary of State for Transport is included in the generic term "Secretary of State". He will of course be fully consulted and will be a major contributor to the national air quality strategy.
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para10"></a>I am surprised, however, that in sitting down my noble friend said that it was too late to do anything about it even if we wanted to, having said that it was not necessary in the first place. If we did put in the amendment that the noble Baroness wanted, we should be requiring the Secretary of State to consult himself. As my noble friend Lord Peyton would say, that would be a very odd thing to do. So that is not necessary. The point that the noble Baroness wanted covered is in fact covered by the use of "Secretary of State" as a generic term. He will be fully consulted on the national air quality strategy.
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para11"></a>Amendments Nos. 141A and 261A, to which my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding referred, would enable the regulations, as my noble friend said, to extend the power to stop vehicles to traffic wardens. At the moment that power is confined to policemen.
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para12"></a>I can quite understand the reasons behind this proposal. However, I am bound to tell my noble friend that I do not believe that regulations about air quality discussed in the closing stages of the Environment Bill are the right place for a review of the functions of traffic wardens.
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para13"></a>There are strong arguments either way on this matter. I understand the need to ensure that scarce police resources are used to best effect. But conferring powers to stop vehicles is a very significant step indeed, as I know from the days when I was privileged to occupy a position in the Home Office. A number of organisations have expressed very strong concerns that only the police should have powers to stop vehicles. We also noted the views expressed on all sides of the Committee in another place.
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para14"></a>It is true that the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 contains the means to transfer some powers to traffic wardens; but important questions would remain. The provisions of the 1984 Act apply to the transfer of "appropriate functions". It is by no means clear that the functions of stopping vehicles would necessarily come into the realm of being an appropriate function for a traffic warden. For example, what would happen if drivers refused to stop? What happens then? How would the traffic warden react? Should he run after the driver? Should he send for a policeman? What happens? These matters are important. We shall have to consider what would happen if these people, having been stopped by a traffic warden, proved unwilling to co-operate. The police have powers to deal with such contingencies but traffic wardens do not.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para15"></a>I understand the argument of my noble friend. This a perfectly terrible situation. But if this change is to be brought about, or something of that nature, it ought to be done in the context of a wider review of the powers and duties of the police and traffic wardens, where the Home Office can ensure that all those who should be fully consulted are fully consulted. That would include all those organisations which represent the police and the motorists' organisations and even women's groups, which have expressed concern about these matters.
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para16"></a>My noble friend has a point but I do not feel that this is the appropriate place or indeed the appropriate time to incorporate it into the Bill.

<P>

However, aiming to table a couple of amendments before the weekend&#151;like other noble Lords, I have had some difficulty in dealing with the bulk of this work and apologise for the lateness of my amendments&#151;I thought it was probably better to get the amendment onto the Marshalled List rather than wait and achieve perfect wording. I recognised also that at this stage it was unlikely that your Lordships would wish to return the Bill to another place on such a matter.
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para17"></a>I thank the noble Earl for what he said on the issue of transport and the consultation which will take place. I am not sure that I entirely agree with him that Secretaries of State should not be required to consult with themselves. Sometimes procedural delay requiring them to stop and think might not be a bad thing.
<P>

<a name="50711-19_para18"></a>As I am on my feet, perhaps I may take the opportunity to regret that the Minister gave such a reply to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. My name is also to his amendment and I warmly support it. I think that it was entirely the right place in which to try to move the issue forward and ensure that the steps proposed can be put into effect. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<A NAME="50711-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, Amendment No. 134B seeks reassurance from the Minister, if he can give it. Otherwise it seeks inclusion in the Bill of a provision for local authorities to take, when required, temporary measures to deal with air quality standards.
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para0"></a>I raised the matter following debate in another place on an amendment moved by my honourable friend the Member for Truro, who drew the attention of the other place to the need for any strategy to allow for temporary measures. Your Lordships will be well aware from recent personal experience how quickly air quality can deteriorate. But we have a weather prediction system&#151;that description might glorify it a little but the science is there&#151;which can predict when pollution levels will climb rapidly. Once air quality standards have been set, it ought to be possible to forecast over a three or <P>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1547</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>four-day timescale when those standards may be breached because of weather conditions in conjunction with other events.
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para1"></a>If so, the Government, working with local authorities, could take steps to ensure that air quality standards would not be breached. Perhaps I may give two examples. First, one might impose for a short period speed limits on motorways. We know that at high speeds vehicles are far more polluting than if speeds are controlled. My second example entails the closure of certain streets in city centres. After all, is it right to say to those who suffer from respiratory illnesses, "Pollution levels tomorrow and the day after will be very high and we suggest you stay at home"? The message should rather be: "Pollution levels will be very high and car drivers should leave their cars at home", so that those with respiratory illnesses should not have to stay at home and suffer. Those are just two examples of short-term but very urgent steps that might be taken.
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para2"></a>When the matter was discussed in another place, it was suggested by the then Minister that such powers do in fact exist. He was not able to give chapter and verse. More recently in a Question to the then Secretary of State, my honourable friend the Member for North Cornwall asked the Secretary of State to confirm that he had such powers. He asked him to explain how he intended to use them and to tell the other place what opportunities he would offer to local authorities to use such powers as well. The answer from the Secretary of State for Transport was:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I think the honourable gentleman is referring to road safety regulations".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para3"></a>My honourable friends have not yet been able to obtain further clarity on the matter.
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para4"></a>Therefore, I raise the issue today in the hope that the Minister will be able to reassure your Lordships that the powers in local authorities do exist. If he cannot do so, perhaps he will assist me and the House by saying how, within this strategy, temporary measures, which are quite often very urgent and important measures, can be achieved. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para5"></a>Moved, That Amendment No. 134B, as an amendment to Commons Amendment No. 134, be agreed to.&#151;(Baroness Hamwee.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, the amendment moved by the noble Baroness has to be regarded in the light of what comes earlier in subsection (5) of the new clause proposed by Commons Amendment No. 134. Subsection (5) (a) refers to:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"standards relating to the quality of air".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para6"></a>The noble Baroness's amendment says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in the event that air quality standards appear likely to be exceeded".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para7"></a>That looks like quality standards better than those required.
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para8"></a>I should have thought&#151;if the Government wanted this amendment, they could accept a manuscript amendment to it&#151;that rather than the words "likely to be exceeded", the noble Baroness has in mind the words "unlikely to be reached".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-20_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is quite right to draw attention to this matter. Air pollution is a terrible thing and so is the pollution by vehicles. Indeed, in the past 24 hours or so, we have seen a certain amount of pollution occurring.
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para9"></a>I can help her with her concern. The prime aim of a strategy for managing air quality has to be to reduce air pollution in general. If that is done, one avoids the risk of what the professionals call "episodes". An episode is a period of high pollution. We recognise that the risk of such episodes is bound to remain. One cannot remove them wholly. That is why the publications Improving Air Quality and Air Quality: Meeting the Challenge stated quite clearly that appropriate action in these episodes must also be part of the new system. In other words, it is right to address the totality in order to reduce air pollution in general, but when a period of high pollution occurs, appropriate action must be taken.
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para10"></a>In line with that, amendments to the Bill have been carefully framed so as to cover long-term goals as well as more immediate action. The amendment will allow response measures to be developed for both the long and the short term. I can assure the noble Baroness that developing sensible and effective action during pollution episodes, or when periods of high pollution can be accurately forecast, will be an integral part of implementing the air quality provisions of the Bill. It is not necessary therefore to single out those episodes on the face of the Bill. In fact, that may produce an adverse effect. I know the noble Baroness did not table the amendment with that intention, but it may suggest that less attention should be paid to the planned long-term measures which would help us to avoid the short-term problems.
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said that she found it difficult to know where the provisions occur in the Bill. Perhaps I can draw her attention to Amendment No. 261, which amends Sections 1 and 6 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 which allows traffic regulation orders to be made for the same purposes as those for which regulations may be made under Part IV relating to air quality. Of course, we must take careful account of a number of other considerations before those powers are used, but the amendment also amends Section 122 of the 1984 Act to the effect that local authorities with traffic and parking responsibilities under that section would be required to have regard, so far as practicable, to the national air quality strategy.
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para12"></a>I hope that I have been able to satisfy the anxieties of the noble Baroness with that explanation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-20_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, that is extremely helpful. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-20_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 134C as an amendment to Commons Amendment No. 134.
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para15"></a>I am taking up a lot of your Lordships' time and shall endeavour to be brief. The noble Baroness, Lady Hilton, referred, quite rightly, to anxieties felt by local authorities in regard to the likely cost of proceeding with the strategy. That is not to say that there is a reluctance to do so, but inevitably the question arises whether local authorities will be able to finance the process. I recognise that there may be a question of privilege if I were to seek to include an amendment calling for a higher level of public expenditure. I hope therefore that Amendment No. 134C, in drawing your Lordships' attention to the issue, will achieve the appropriate response from the Minister.
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para16"></a>Local authorities will be under a duty to review air quality; to declare the whole or part of their area as an air quality management area and, in relation to those air quality management areas, under a duty to produce action plans. That will clearly mean that new costs will be incurred. The Minister indicated earlier that the costs may not be very high. However, monitoring will not be a paper exercise and in some areas continuous monitoring will be required.
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para17"></a>In London we now have an established monitoring system&#151;the London Air Quality Network&#151;which was commended by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution in its recent report on transport. That network will need to be augmented to ensure that all local authority areas are covered for all the target pollutants. Areas outside of London which do not currently monitor air quality are likely to be faced with substantial extra costs.
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para18"></a>I therefore tabled an amendment to add, at the end of subsection (5) (c), that the way in which the Secretary of State draws up his strategy should include an assessment of the likely costs to local authorities for carrying out their reviews and implementing action plans. There should also be a statement by the Secretary of State of his proposals for making a contribution to those costs. I tabled that amendment in order to require the Secretary of State, as part of the whole exercise, to make clear what the costs are likely to be and what proposals there may be for meeting them. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="50711-20_para19"></a>Moved, That Amendment No. 134C, as an amendment to Commons Amendment No. 134, be agreed to.&#151;(Baroness Hamwee.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, Amendment No. 134C raises important issues. It is interesting that Amendment No. 134, the new clause, introduces something which I have not seen in statute before; namely, a requirement upon the Government to prepare and publish a statement to be referred to as "the strategy". That is a fine concept.
<P>

<a name="50711-21_para0"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, is fully entitled to ask, as she did, whether, as part of that strategy, the extra costs to be borne by local authorities&#151;that is <P>


<a name="column_1550"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1550</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>inevitable&#151;should be a stated part of the strategy. My noble friend Lord Ferrers may say that the amendment is not necessary because the clause as it stands is quite far-reaching and, in any event, the Secretary of State is obliged to publish a draft of the strategy before it becomes effective.
<P>

<a name="50711-21_para1"></a>The noble Baroness has performed a useful service by asking the Government to consider this matter and I shall be interested to hear what my noble friend says.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-21_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Renton is correct when he said that I may say that the amendment is not necessary. That is what I do say.
<P>

<a name="50711-21_para2"></a>Costs are always a problem. First we say that there is terrible pollution and that we must do something about it; then we produce a Bill to say what must be done, and certain responsibilities are placed upon local authorities. Then everyone screams that local authorities do not have any money and the Government must provide it. But of course the Government are always trying to curtail their expenditure. We tend therefore to go around the houses.
<P>

<a name="50711-21_para3"></a>If we are not prepared to take action, then nothing will ever happen. We must settle down to the business of saying who will provide the service and where the resources will come from. We recognise that the new system of air quality management is bound to have cost implications for local authorities. It is the Government's aim to obtain the best possible estimate of those costs and of the potential cost to others&#151;for instance, industry. It is difficult to be able to say what the costs will be. We want to obtain as reasonable an estimate as we can. We are already in extensive discussions with local government and are setting up a formal liaison group to take forward the implementation of the new provisions. Costs will be an important topic for discussion as we prepare the draft strategy for consultation.
<P>

<a name="50711-21_para4"></a>We must accept that it will not be possible to provide accurate figures which may be implied by a statutory requirement at the outset of a new and complex system and one which must not only be set up, but also be able to adapt itself. We shall therefore be working closely with local government at all stages of the implementation. We shall be revising and refining the cost estimates&#151;for example, as we prepare the regulations. Those estimates will be taken into account when we consider local authority resources in the normal way.
<P>

<a name="50711-21_para5"></a>We shall be directing central government activity towards implementation of the new system. We shall encourage councils to make use of the extensive local and national data already available and many will be able to rely largely on that for their national reviews of air quality. We are expanding the networks&#151;the new government stations&#151;and we are funding the integration of some existing local authority equipment so that it can operate to national standards. We are paying for detailed emissions inventories for some of the largest conurbations. Those are an essential tool in an air quality management system. We will be looking to what else should be developed nationally as the system comes into operation.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-21_para6"></a>These are fairly large undertakings. The system is in the process of being put into place. Costs are important. We cannot give a guarantee as to exactly what they will be but the noble Baroness can be assured that we shall do this in close consultation with the local authorities. I hope she will consider that, if nothing else, her amendment has provided me with the opportunity to say what the Government are doing. I rather fancy that that was the purpose of her amendment in the first place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-21_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, the purpose of my amendment was to make it clear that the Government, while producing one sort of bill, recognise that there is another sort of bill and that there is a responsibility to meet the costs. I do not make an apology for drawing this matter to your Lordships' attention. Inevitably, this is an issue where immediate costs will fall on one set of shoulders and the long-term savings, quite apart from personal savings, may well be in another area. I refer to expenditure on health. After all, that is a lot of what this is about.
<P>

<a name="50711-21_para7"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. I am pleased to hear what the Government are doing and I shall be pleased over the next few months and years to hear more. It is an important area. However, it is also important to recognise that there are savings to be made over a longer period and that those will require an investment in the shorter period. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

My amendment is what your Lordships may think is a knee-jerk reaction to my reading of this new provision. Subsection (7) of the Commons amendment states:

I recognise that we discussed this amendment at some length&#151;or at least I did&#151;during discussion of the previous amendment. I move it merely to ask my noble friend a question. Amendment No. 261 amends the Road Traffic Regulation Act. My noble friend referred to that as being the proper context in which to discuss a shift of duty between the police and traffic wardens. The question of what is appropriate is clearly one that would require some argument&#151;he will recollect that he said that&#151;but, the police having done a great deal over recent years to civilianise many of their functions, to their considerable advantage, is there a proposal to review the balance of duties between the police and traffic wardens which might encompass the possibility of traffic wardens being given the power to supplement the power of local authorities to test vehicles? If he can answer that question to my satisfaction, I shall be very happy to withdraw my amendment.
<P>

<A NAME="50711-24_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I should be delighted to answer that question to my noble friend's satisfaction but I am afraid that I am unable to do so. What I can tell him&#151;I know this from the days when I had the advantage of being at the Home Office&#151;is that these are matters of great importance and great sensitivity. In many respects the police are anxious not to give up their powers. Many people do not want the police to give up their powers, because they find&#151;I referred to this earlier on&#151;that many women's groups are worried at the <P>


<a name="column_1560"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1560</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>possibility of other people stopping cars. My noble friend said that he spoke to the amendment at some length. I thought that I spoke at some length, too. I rather hoped that I had been able to answer some of the questions he put. The fact is that if one is going to give these powers to others one has to say what will happen when people do not comply with the power to stop vehicles that the traffic warden has had given to him. What will happen when someone does not allow his vehicle to be inspected and tested? Those are the kinds of difficulties that may be involved. If my noble friend asks, as he does on the spur of the moment, whether considerations about this are going on at present, I am bound to tell him that I cannot provide the answer. But I have no doubt that, in the immortal words of the government service, these matters are always under active consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, I have used that phrase so many times myself that I know precisely what it means. I hope that this can be given active consideration. If one asked the question, "If women's organisations really want to see atmospheric pollution and traffic pollution reduced, would they be prepared to see traffic wardens having the power to stop?", I think that the Government might get a realistic answer. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

There is already provision in the clauses for the registration of exemption schemes, and the suggestion was that this should be extended to those who choose to take the individual compliance route. Although it has always been the Government's intention to ensure the lightest touch possible in the producer responsibility legislation, we saw the likelihood of there being considerable benefit in some cases in individual registration. Amendments Nos. 147 to 150 and Amendment No. 153 are a series of amendments to enable individual registration which were moved in another place at Report stage.
<P>

<a name="50711-24_para6"></a>Amendment No. 151 merely corrects a grammatical error.
<P>

<a name="50711-24_para7"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 152. In considering the producer responsibility clauses further, it became apparent that in order to construct an adequate database for a particular waste stream, including the level of re-use, recovery and recycling, we would need to collect data both from individual firms and from exemption schemes. Most obviously, data will be needed to monitor progress in meeting targets and, more immediately, in the case of packaging waste, to demonstrate to the European Commission evidence of compliance with the targets set by the EC Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste. An amendment to allow data to be collected from individual firms and from exemption schemes was therefore promoted in another place. We shall, of course, take the necessary steps to ensure that commercial confidentiality is maintained and in setting up systems we shall also endeavour to observe the principles of deregulation and minimising burdens on business. I commend the amendments to the House.

<P>
<A NAME="50711-25_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 154. In speaking to this amendment, I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 221, 222, 242, 264, 319 and 324.
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para0"></a>During Report stage, my noble friends Lord Addison and Lord Campbell of Croy moved various amendments to provide for the reform of old mineral permissions. My noble friend Lord Ullswater undertook that the Government would bring forward their own amendments in another place.
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para1"></a>Since our debate, my noble friend Lord Ullswater has had helpful discussions with my noble friend Lord Addision and with representatives of the industry and local authorities. The new clause inserted by Amendment No. 154 and the two new schedules set out in Amendments Nos. 221 and 222 give effect to the policy proposals which my noble friend outlined at Report stage.
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para2"></a>With regard to the updating of old mineral sites, the first new schedule, which is set out in Amendment No. 221, provides for an initial review and updating of mineral sites where the predominant planning permission for the winning and working of minerals or the depositing of mineral waste was granted before 22nd February 1982.
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para3"></a>The schedule makes a distinction between active and dormant sites. Work cannot restart on dormant sites&#151;that is, sites where no mineral working or depositing of mineral waste has taken place to any substantial extent between 22nd February 1982 and 6th June 1995&#151;until a new scheme of full modern operating and restoration conditions has been approved by the planning authority. That is an important proposal. It will ensure that sites where working has not taken place for some years cannot be reactivated without warning on outdated terms and conditions.
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para4"></a>For active sites landowners of relevant minerals must submit new schemes of operating and restoration conditions for the planning authority's approval by a date specified by the authority. If no scheme is submitted, the planning permissions will cease to have any effect. That will get active sites up to standard.
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para5"></a>To spread the workload, reviews of active sites will take place in two consecutive phases, each of three years. Phase I will deal with sites where the predominant permission, or permissions, was granted before 31st March 1969, or 7th December 1969 in Scotland. Phase II will deal with sites where the predominant permission was granted after that date but before 22nd February 1982. Sites wholly or partly within national parks, sites <P>


<a name="column_1565"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1565</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of special scientific interest, areas of outstanding natural beauty, (and national scenic areas and natural heritage areas in Scotland), will all be treated as Phase I sites.
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para6"></a>Where my noble friend Lord Ullswater outlined these proposals at Report stage, he indicated that he intended that they should broadly follow the approach we adopted for the review and updating of interim development orders or such permissions introduced in the Planning and Compensation Act 1991. However, he made it clear that he would give consideration to the possibility of incorporating in statute the principles of the statement made by my right honourable friend Sir George Young when he was a Minister at the Department of the Environment before he was catapulted into new spheres. That we have done.
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para7"></a>There will be no compensation for the cost of complying with conditions imposed on dormant sites. For active sites there will be no compensation for new restoration and aftercare conditions, nor for conditions which do not restrict working rights. For conditions which do restrict working rights, compensation will be payable only if, in the opinion of the planning authority, the effect of the restriction would be such as to prejudice to an unreasonable degree either the economic viability of the operation or the asset value of the site.
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para8"></a>These amendments will ensure that in a relatively short period old mineral permissions will be brought up to acceptable standards and that dormant sites cannot be reactivated without warning or proper conditions.
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para9"></a>Having got the older permissions up to standard, we need to ensure that all mineral permissions keep pace with changing standards in the future. The second new schedule, which is set out in Amendment No. 222, therefore provides for the periodic review of all mining sites with planning permission for the winning and working of minerals or the depositing of mineral waste.
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para10"></a>Your Lordships will be glad to know that the remaining amendments in this group are technical and consequential. I commend them to the House.
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para11"></a>Moved, That the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 154.&#151;(Earl Ferrers.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, as my noble friend said, I raised this subject in Committee and moved an amendment at Report stage, concentrating particularly on old mineral permissions relating to ironstone. My noble friend Lord Ullswater gave an undertaking then and I am grateful to the Government for having introduced these amendments in the other place in accordance with that undertaking. We now have a whole new clause and two schedules on a subject which was not originally in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para12"></a>Although I am grateful for that, I should like to raise two points relating to ironstone. Ironstone is different from other mineral workings. I shall not repeat my previous speeches, but ironstone has not been needed since 1979, although permissions for its mining continue to run for many years still and limestone is being worked at the sites instead. That was not the purpose for which the permissions were originally intended. They were granted after World War II by central government. It was not left to local government. Ironstone was then <P>


<a name="column_1566"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1566</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>vital for our steel industry. All transport was to be by rail. Now all the limestone is conveyed by large and heavy lorries and there is damage and disturbance to the rural communities in the districts concerned. Access and transport conditions need to be considered and, where necessary, regulated in the new system.
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para13"></a>My first inquiry: can we be certain that the guidance which is foreseen in the Bill and which is due to be issued will include transport and access when the Bill has been enacted? Will it cover active as well as dormant sites? Will it arrange for access and transport conditions to be regulated in the present circumstances, which are different from those of 40 years ago?
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para14"></a>My second point is that many ironstone permissions for individual sites are large. Some of them are over 1,000 acres for a single permission. But in those areas only a small part is being worked. In some cases they are physically separated from the larger, dormant parts. It seems that the amendments, as drafted, require the whole area to be treated as active, because originally all the areas were in a single permission. Is there a way in which those large areas can now be divided into small, active sites and large, dormant ones? That would make sense under present conditions and would give mineral planning authorities better control.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-25_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Nicol: </B>   My Lords, I understand that the Government define sites as dormant if they were dormant on 6th June, which is when the amendments were published in the other place, but the noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, announced the arrival of the amendments back in March. I understand that during that intervening period a number of operators have started up work on what were previously dormant sites in order to be able to claim compensation. Is the Minister aware of that? Can he give us any idea of whether the practice is widespread, and whether, if it is, there is any way that it can be proved that the sites are dormant and not therefore subject to compensation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-25_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Addison: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may say, first, how much I value the efforts of my noble friend Lord Ullswater in securing the government amendments tabled in the other place to tackle the environmental problems created by old mineral planning permissions.
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para15"></a>I have just two outstanding concerns. The first is on the compensation. It appears at subsection (3) (b) half-way down page 77 of the Marshalled List. Will my noble friend explain what constitutes "prejudice adversely" and "unreasonable degree" with regard to the economic viability of the operational site? I hope that we can have some clarification on that point.
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para16"></a>The second point, relating to dormant sites, has already been mentioned. The Government have defined sites as dormant if they were dormant on 6th June, so I do not need to repeat what has been said. That causes concern. We have found that work has been restarted within the three months between my noble friend's announcement and 6th June. It is important that we get the wording right to ensure that people do not receive compensation if that is the case. One example relates to a major, long dormant limestone quarry in a prominent <P>


<a name="column_1567"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1567</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>location within the Peak District National Park where work has recently recommenced for no other discernible reason. It is therefore crucial that we secure clarification on the definition of dormancy.
<P>

<a name="50711-25_para17"></a>The government amendments provide that a site will be considered active only if it has been worked to a substantial degree. There is no explanation of what that constitutes. The draft guidance issued on the provisions does not provide sufficient explanation. That definition will be crucial in determining whether a site which has had only a few wheelbarrow loads removed is active or not. We hope therefore that the final guidance will provide a full explanation of what constitutes:

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the amendments&#151;as I do my noble friend to his new department. Also, I thank my noble friend Lord Ullswater for the time that he and his department have taken in listening to the views of the aggregates industry and for the courtesy which he always showed to those concerned. I must of course again declare an interest as an employee of Hanson, which owns ARC, which is a fairly prominent member of the aggregates industry, although I am not aware of any cases in which it might have been guilty of any activity described by the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol.
<P>

<a name="50711-26_para0"></a>The industry recognises that the issue of old planning permissions is an emotive one. I recognise the difficulty in striking a balance between the environmental pressures which were described by my noble friend Lord Addison, on the one hand, and the industry's desire for fair treatment on the other. Although the industry did not achieve all that it wanted, the result embodied in this series of complex amendments is a fair one which will prove its worth in the future.
<P>

<a name="50711-26_para1"></a>As my noble friend described, the main change, and the one about which I spoke mostly at an earlier stage of the Bill, relates to compensation. It is right that compensation should be reflected in the way that it now is, and, should conditions be imposed which would seriously affect the asset value of a site, that compensation should be enshrined in statute, as it now is. That is a great step forward from the original IDO legislation which left the industry with no greater protection except through a statement of intent, as my noble friend the Minister described it, made by a Minister in another place.
<P>

<a name="50711-26_para2"></a>Important though the amendment is, it should not be regarded as any great concession to the industry. The new clause does not give the industry a new right to compensation. It does not even enhance the right already held. In fact it marks a significant reduction in the compensation regime to which it was previously entitled. Nevertheless, the position is now clarified and protected. I am grateful to all those in the department for the effort which has been put into finding a solution.
<P>

<a name="50711-26_para3"></a>It is important in this case, as well as in many others, to find a balance. That balance has been found. Those who take a different point of view should understand that there are difficulties in trying to strike that balance. While people may have legitimate objections to the activities of an industry&#151;mineral working can have a <P>


<a name="column_1568"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1568</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>significant effect on the landscape and on people's lives&#151;the industry itself is aware of all that, and it does whatever it can to ensure that it lives up to its responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="50711-26_para4"></a>We must always bear in mind that the industry is a crucial element in the economy. Again, I thank my noble friend for all that he and my noble friend Lord Ullswater were able to do. The industry will of course maintain its vigilance as the legislation develops and will be consulted on the mineral planning guidance which will go with it. I am extremely grateful for and welcome the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-26_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Glenarthur for the gratitude he expressed, which goes not to me but to my noble friend Lord Ullswater and many others, including possibly the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, who is smiling away. I am grateful to my noble friend because a great deal of work has been done on the minerals front which is always a technical subject. It is not always easy to understand it, and nor is it an easy matter on which to legislate.
<P>

<a name="50711-26_para5"></a>My noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy referred to the ironstone permissions. As my noble friend Lord Ullswater made clear on Report, the Government believe that it is wrong in principle to revoke consents without compensation. That does not mean that the existing position will be allowed to remain as it is. We shall issue guidance to deal with both active and dormant sites. I hope that that will cover the points referred to by my noble friend Lord Addison. We would expect the industry to bring forward schemes which deal satisfactorily with the questions of access and transport and, where appropriate, the provision of buffer zones between workings and residential property. My noble friend asked whether large areas will be divided into small active sites and large dormant sites. If I may, I must take advice on that matter and write to him.
<P>

<a name="50711-26_para6"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, referred to sites which have started operating, as did my noble friend Lord Addison. It is regrettable that that has happened and where it has happened. Fortunately, I do not believe that the practice is widespread. I hope that operators will see it as their duty to bring forward full modern planning conditions. Sites cannot start working until those have been approved. My noble friend Lord Addison wanted us to define "prejudice" and "unreasonable degree". That will be covered in the guidance and we will do our best to flesh it out. In the end, common sense is required by all parties.
<P>

<a name="50711-26_para7"></a>I hope that with that explanation your Lordships will agree with the Commons amendment.
<P>

<a name="50711-26_para8"></a>On Question, Motion agreed to.

<A NAME="50711-27_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Nicol: </B>   My Lords, I wanted simply to welcome the amendments and to ask one question. During the passage of the Bill in this House we had a great deal of discussion about what constitutes an "important hedgerow". Has any progress been made in that regard? Are the Government any nearer a definition of what constitutes an important hedgerow? That information would be helpful to some of us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Stanley of Alderley: </B>   My Lords, it goes without saying that I am concerned that yet another bureaucratic regulation is being imposed on farmers because they must notify a local authority if they wish to remove one of their hedgerows. In line with the remarks made by the noble Baroness, I should like to know what is a hedgerow and whether that will be spelt out clearly in the regulations.
<P>

<a name="50711-27_para0"></a>Moreover and perhaps more important, if a farmer goes to a local authority to say that he wishes to remove a hedgerow, will the Minister ensure that there is a time limit in the regulations which provides that an answer is given within 28 days and that if he is not given an answer within that time limit, the permission will be granted automatically.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-27_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the welcome which the noble Baroness has given to the amendments. The noble Baroness wants to know, as does my noble friend, what is meant by an "important hedgerow". I can understand the anxieties expressed by my noble friend because it is important that there is not too much bureaucracy in relation to the countryside or anything else. However, there are occasions when it is necessary to try to protect important hedgerows. Research is in hand to investigate what should properly be regarded as important hedgerows and to establish a system for assessing their quality.

<a name="50711-27_para1"></a>We have made clear our intention to focus protection on those hedgerows which are of particular historic interest or which make a particularly valuable contribution to the wildlife or landscape of an area. The kind of hedgerows which we have in mind are those which are long-standing and which form part of the natural countryside. If my noble friend planted a hedge 10 years ago, I do not believe that he would be refused permission to remove it because we place particular importance on those hedgerows which have been in place for a long time. My noble friend asked whether we could have a time limit of 28 days. That is rather like the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, asking earlier what "reasonable" meant. Now my noble friend tries to put me on the spot in asking for 28 days. This is a matter which is part of the regulations. We shall settle what is the appropriate time after we have had wide-ranging public consultations.

<P>

<a name="50711-27_para5"></a>During Committee my noble friend Lord Crickhowell moved an amendment to enable the new agencies to exercise their powers of entry in respect of their functions under this Bill. Very few of the agencies' functions are in fact conferred or imposed by this Bill, rather than by existing legislation. The Government were therefore not persuaded at that time by my noble friend's arguments.
<P>

<a name="50711-27_para6"></a>Following the grounding of the MV "Braer" off the coast of Shetland in January 1993, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland set up an ecological steering group on the oil spill in the Shetlands. One of the problems identified by that group was that of access to private land in order to carry out environmental assessments following that incident. The agencies have duties under Clauses 5(3) and 31(3) of the Bill to make assessments of the environment and of environmental pollution, and to prepare reports for Ministers.
<P>

<a name="50711-27_para7"></a>Amendments Nos. 163 to 168 will enable them to exercise their powers of entry when carrying out those specific duties. The powers of entry provided by these amendments will be available only in connection with a serious pollution incident of the sort which I have described, and not for assessments of a more routine nature.

<P>
<A NAME="50711-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, these are important amendments. I understand from what the noble Earl has said that the Government are trying to take powers to amend previous legislation and orders. These are regarded as consequential powers. I do not think that we should let these matters proceed without further explanation from the noble Earl as to why the Government wish to take the powers and what parliamentary approval will be available for the powers which the Government may wish to exercise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-28_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord has said, it is perfectly true that these are important amendments. Perhaps I can try to put him out of his misery and to tell him a little more as to what they are about. I gather from the noble Lord that he is not miserable, so that makes the two of us. Amendment No. 185 widens the power in Clause 102 to make minor consequential amendments by regulations. It provides that the amendments which can be made to other enactments are not limited to those which are not mentioned in Schedule 18. This will ensure that any missed consequentials which are noted after the Bill has been brought into force can be corrected by regulation.
<P>

<a name="50711-28_para5"></a>Amendment No. 189 inserts two new subsections into Clause 107 of the Bill. The first subsection extends the power for an appointed day order to make transitional provisions and savings in connection with the bringing into force of any of the provisions in the Bill. The second subsection will allow provisions corresponding to Clause 81 of the Bill to be made in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="50711-28_para6"></a>The negative resolution procedure is being provided on this occasion because the substance of the amendment has already been debated in this House and in another place. We are seeking to use scarce parliamentary time efficiently and effectively by providing for the Order in Council making provision in Northern Ireland to be subject to negative resolution, and so avoid going over ground which has already been the subject of debate in the House.

<A NAME="50711-28_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Earl sits down, will he enlarge on that? Has the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee of this House had a look at this particular provision? So far as I am aware, there is no mechanism for it to do so. I believe that this is a matter that should be brought to that Committee because it allows, as a Commons amendment, which your Lordships are now being asked to accept, amendment by order of primary legislation. Is not that something that we have discussed in this House on many, many occasions? Is it not something that we ought to take more seriously than I think the noble Earl does at the moment? Should we not just note on the record that the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee ought also to look at Commons amendments <P>

<A NAME="50711-28_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I can understand the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, wanting to know whether the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee has looked at this. What the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee does is to look at all Bills which are proposed to go before Parliament to see what delegated powers are being given by virtue of the Bills. However, what it cannot do is to look at amendments which have been made in another place before they come before your Lordships. That has not been done up to now and one of the reasons for that is simply because the timescale does not provide for it. That has not been part of the practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-28_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl. I think we would both agree that, if the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee has power given by this House to look at Bills coming before this House which give powers to Secretaries of State to amend primary legislation by regulation, it ought also to be able to look at Commons amendments. After all, that is the privilege of this House; to look at Commons amendments or indeed look at Bills in any form. I will leave it there on the record in the hope that those who may be attending to our proceedings can report them to the appropriate authorities. The Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee, and the House, ought to be advised that it should have the right to look at Commons amendments and not just at the Bill when it first comes to us.

<br>
("to represent the national interest in the statutory purposes of National Parks.").
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Norrie: </B>   My Lords, I disagree with Commons Amendments Nos. 203 to 209 and I believe that my Amendment No. 203A in lieu would be totally consistent with the Edwards Report and ensure that the Secretary of State appoints members to the national parks authorities in order to represent the national interest. I think the Government got it right the first time, as the Bill closely reflected the report's recommendations. The authorities which run national parks must reflect the broad range of interests in the parks themselves. The Edwards Report recommended that the membership of the park authorities should be split three ways. One-third should represent national interests, one-third the park in its regional context, and one-third local interests. The beauty of this formula is that it achieves a balance.
<P>

<a name="50711-29_para4"></a>Local interests are extremely important and I fully appreciate that. In the words of the Government, they are "living and working landscapes", and the people who live in the parks should, quite rightly, have an important say in how they will be run. The Edwards structure also reflects the fact that the parks are of national significance in both environmental terms and for the opportunities that they afford for outdoor recreation. They are national assets, part of the "critical natural capital" of England and Wales. They must therefore be managed in this broader context in order to ensure that they remain a resource for the whole country.
<P>

<a name="50711-29_para5"></a>The new proposals for membership of the English park authorities upset this balance. A new category of membership is created&#151;parish representatives&#151;at the expense of both members representing the national interest and those appointed by local authorities. Parish members will be expected to represent all parishes that fall within the park boundaries. In the Peak District there are over 120 parish councils. I remain to be convinced that four or five parish council members, appointed by the Secretary of State, will be able adequately to represent the interests of all those parishes. In fact I suspect that the proposals may lead to new problems, particularly in trying to meet the aspirations of those parishes which do not have members sitting on the new authorities.
<P>

<a name="50711-29_para6"></a>I am particularly worried about the whittling away of the proportion of members representing the national interest on the parks. My amendment would make it clear beyond doubt that the Secretary of State should appoint members in order to represent the national interest in the statutory purposes of national parks. This is an extremely important safeguard.
<P>

<a name="50711-29_para7"></a>The Edwards panel examined the membership arrangements for the new authorities in detail. It examined the idea of appointing parish representatives to park authorities and rejected this. The panel concluded that the best way to ensure that local interests were taken <P>


<a name="column_1580"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1580</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>into account by the authorities was through increasing the proportion of district council representatives. As originally drafted, the Bill did this by increasing district council membership from one-seventh to one-third, and requiring that wherever possible local authority members should represent wards within the park. Furthermore, the Bill already requires park authorities formally to liaise with the parish councils in their areas. This will best be done through the parish fora. I believe it is the best way of ensuring that national park authorities are in touch with the views of the local community.
<P>

<a name="50711-29_para8"></a>I had hoped that the Government would have been able to stick to the formula recommended by Edwards. That formula was carefully debated in the context of my Private Member's Bill, whose provisions were in turn reflected in the drafting of this Bill. I am therefore most disappointed that the Government have brought forward changes which could diminish the national and regional interest in the parks and which appear to undermine the role of the district councils. I hope that, when responding to my amendments, my noble friend the Minister will, even if he cannot accept them, be able to offer some reassurance on the following points. First, will he assure the House that when any appointments are made by the Secretary of State to a national park authority, the individuals appointed will be carefully selected in order to reflect the best possible mix of interests relevant to a national park?
<P>

<a name="50711-29_para9"></a>Secondly, will he confirm that the "non-parish" Secretary of State appointees will be chosen specifically to represent the national interest in the statutory purposes of the national parks, and that they will have the relevant expertise? Thirdly, will he undertake to ensure that all appointees will be fully informed as to the purposes for which the parks were originally designated? I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="50711-29_para10"></a>Moved, that the House do disagree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 203 but do propose Amendment No. 203A in lieu thereof.&#151;(Lord Norrie.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-29_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Nicol: </B>   My Lords, I share the worries of the noble Lord, Lord Norrie, and I wish to add one or two of my own. I understand that these changes were made quite suddenly and with little consultation. Among the few people who were consulted, there was considerable opposition to the Government's proposals.
<P>

<a name="50711-29_para11"></a>What worries me most is that there seems to be no limit to the length of time a parish representative appointed by the Secretary of State may serve. It is considered by one or two of those who know about these matters that the Secretary of State may find that he cannot end that appointment, so that the authority will become a quango, but a quango without an end because the Secretary of State cannot end what he has begun. It would be helpful if the Minister could at least clarify that point. At present the Secretary of State's appointees representing the national interest must serve a minimum of one year and a maximum of three. It seems unreasonable to replace them with open-ended appointments.
<P>

<a name="50711-29_para12"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Norrie, explained the main anxiety concerning losing sight of the national interest. I hope that the Minister will be able to demonstrate that that has not been lost sight of in all the pressure that has been <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>put on the Government to represent local interests perhaps beyond what is reasonable in the context of the national parks.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Beaumont of Whitley: </B>   My Lords, the Edwards formula was arrived at after a great deal of consultation. It is well known. It was agreed by all the organisations with an interest in the national parks. It strikes a balance between three different but complementary interests&#151;national, regional and local&#151;and it underlines the national importance of the parks. The new proposals do not. They provide a formula which appears to have been cobbled together at very short notice. It is difficult to understand, and it is questionable whether it will achieve what the Government intend.
<P>

<a name="50711-29_para13"></a>The proposals have been opposed totally by organisations with an interest in the parks, with the exception of the parish councils which benefit directly, and even some of those have reservations about them.
<P>

<a name="50711-29_para14"></a>This is a retrograde step on the part of the Government. It is certainly not an improvement. I hope that at this late stage at the very least the noble Earl will be able to answer satisfactorily the questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Norrie, and the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-30_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Lytton: </B>   My Lords, I appreciate that the Government responded to general disquiet about the lack of a local democratic base in national parks. As someone who has business interests as a landowner and employer in a national park, I feel that acutely. There are important reasons why that issue needed to be addressed which were perhaps not so apparent at the time of the Edwards Report. Increasingly, we are moving towards all-purpose national park authorities. They are taking on board planning powers. As they take on those planning powers they acquire an enormously important role which is crucial to the economic well-being and the lives of those who live and work in national parks.
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para0"></a>An example was quoted to me by a neighbouring landowner of mine in Exmoor some time ago in relation to the problems resulting from the breaching of the shingle beach at Porlock Bay. The nearest member of the national park authority had to come from Bridgwater to attend a meeting. That was the only person who was available. That simply will not do. It is not acceptable that on matters which affect national parks&#151;which admittedly affect the national interest&#151;the legitimate aspirations of those who live and work and have an investment in the long-term future of national parks (and also have to take responsibility for that investment) should be represented only indirectly. One hopes that as a result of the Bill the situation will improve, but appointees from local authorities are not directly responsible to an electorate with an interest in the national park.
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para1"></a>The problem was brought into sharper focus by a recent experience of mine. I referred earlier today to having been involved in the Exmoor National Park local plan inquiry. The Exmoor National Park authority made it clear to me that it was not the organisation responsible for economic development. It was also not the housing authority. When I looked at the draft local plan for the West Somerset district, part of which is also in the Exmoor National Park, I found that the area covered by that document excluded <P>


<a name="column_1582"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1582</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>all of the part of the district within the national park boundary. In other words, there is a policy void. There is one local authority in the national park which says that it is not its business to do various things&#151;and I accept that up to a point&#151;and another authority says that the area is not within the footprint of its local plan.
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para2"></a>There are serious problems which need to be addressed. They cannot be addressed simply by having appointees from outside who can allow the policy void to pass from one authority to the other. It is very important that parish councils, which are probably the closest to people in the sparsely populated rural areas, have a role to play. The response which the Government have sought to put in place here is right and proper. I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Norrie, on that point.
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para3"></a>According to the responses that I saw to the consultation document, views were sought only from county and district authorities and none was sought from anyone else. That is regrettable.
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para4"></a>I support the Commons amendment. I believe that giving parishes a say in the manner proposed is extremely helpful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-30_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, I should like to support the noble Lord, Lord Norrie, and my noble friend Lady Nicol. It seems to me that the representation which was proposed in the Bill was very fair. District councils should be able to represent the views of local people. There must be a district councillor who represents the area. The unfairness of what is proposed is manifest in the representations that we have received.
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para5"></a>I should like to ask the Minister why this change was made at this very late stage. I cannot understand why it should have been because the matter was agreed at earlier stages of the Bill. It has been widely discussed. It seems to me an extraordinary thing to have happened. I hope that we can have a clear explanation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wise: </B>   My Lords, I too share the concern of my noble friend Lord Norrie regarding the change in the membership arrangements. I am not at all certain that the change in the membership arrangements of the authorities is the best way to increase local representation on the park authorities. I agree entirely with the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, that it is important that the parish councils are consulted, but the Bill already provides for greater parish representation as it requires formal mechanisms in each park for consulting every parish council. That is vitally important.
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para6"></a>In addition, there is a danger that in the race to increase local representation the Government may have neglected to put on record the importance of the other categories of membership. It would be helpful if my noble friend the Minister could assure the House that the national parks are still considered to be of national and regional importance and that the arrangements for appointing members to represent the national interest will reflect that importance. I support the amendment of my noble friend Lord Norrie.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, I find the amendments which the noble Lord, Lord Norrie, opposes very surprising. We discussed in great detail the membership of park authorities when the Bill was before <P>


<a name="column_1583"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1583</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>your Lordships and before it went to another place. We now find that another place has produced an amendment which does not apply to Welsh national parks. In Wales we do not have parish councils because the Church in Wales was disestablished in 1921 and parish councils became community councils. Therefore the provision applies only to England.
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para7"></a>As regards the Government's proposals, there is a clear difference between what is happening in England and what is happening in Wales. In Wales we shall have the Bill exactly as drafted before it went to another place. The English are being asked to accept parish councillors.
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para8"></a>No other planning authority that I can think of has representation from parish councils&#151;neither county councils nor district councils. So far as I can understand, this is the first time in the history of planning legislation in England that there will be appointments by the Secretary of State on the basis that someone is a member of a parish council.
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para9"></a>First, if noble Lords will be good enough to consider Amendment No. 205, they might have great difficulty in understanding it. Amendment No. 205 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A person shall not be appointed as a parish member of an English National Park authority unless he is (a) a member of the parish council for a parish the whole or any part of which is comprised in the relevant Park; or (b) the chairman of the parish meeting of a parish",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para10"></a>and so on. The amendment defines what a chairman is and what happens if a chairman gives up his authority as a chairman of a parish council during a period of office when he is appointed to an English national park authority.
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para11"></a>It is a most obscure piece of drafting. I am sure that the noble Earl knows better than I do how parish councils work in England. I understand that the reason for the provision is for local people to be on national park authorities. How anyone can rely on any of this provision for a proper representation defies me.
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para12"></a>Secondly, district councils which will be represented on national park authorities in Wales and England are comprised of people who are on parish councils. Therefore anyone who is on a parish council and a district council may well have dual authority. That seems to me to be very odd.
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para13"></a>Thirdly, what about the interests of other people who should be represented? Millions of people who live in urban areas like to go to national parks. These are national parks. The regional context of the park is important, as is the national interest. Why does the Secretary of State&#151;the reference is to the Secretary of State for the Environment, not to the Secretary of State for Wales&#151;select someone who just happens to be on a parish council to serve on a national park authority which is a national asset and is defined as such?
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para14"></a>Until the Government can give us better justification for what they propose I am afraid that I have to support the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Norrie.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Walpole: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister responds, perhaps I may make one point. I differ from my noble friend Lord Lytton, and I think that it is probably because of our experiences. The Minister will know the Broads Authority as well as I do. There does not appear to be a problem of consultation. So far as I am aware no <P>


<a name="column_1584"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1584</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>parish councillor other than one who happens to serve on a district council has ever served on the Broads Authority. I have always believed that the Broads Authority was a shining example of how a national park authority should be run.
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para15"></a>Because consultation regarding the Broads Authority in the past has been good, and that in Exmoor has been bad, I believe that some bad legislation is being brought in.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-30_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend Lord Wise that national parks have both a national and regional interest and membership should reflect that. What I find difficult to understand is the great feeling that parish councillors should not be part of that involvement.
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para16"></a>I was glad when the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, disagreed with the amendment of my noble friend Lord Norrie. I felt that he and I were on the same track because I disagree with it too. I believe that my noble friend's concern was that our amendments to the membership of the new national park authorities will weaken the role of those members who are appointed by the Secretary of State to represent the wider national interest in the park. I can understand the concern of my noble friend Lord Norrie. Bringing the wider national viewpoint into the deliberations of the new authorities remains a vital element in the continued care and protection of the parks. However, I do not think that the revised membership which we now propose will weaken that.
<P>

<a name="50711-30_para17"></a>It is no surprise that the way in which local people influence the management of national parks should have taken up a large proportion of the time we spent discussing Part III of the Bill. We have always emphasised the importance of giving local people the opportunity to make their views known and to have a real input in park affairs. They are national parks and I cannot understand the noble Lord, Lord Williams, asking, "Why should these people in the locality be taken as more representative than everyone else when it comes to national parks?"

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the noble Earl will allow me to intervene. The local people&#151;a rather dismissive term&#151;have a perfect right to elect their representatives on district councils which, in the original Edwards formula, are part of a national park authority. But it is not a question of parish councils.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-31_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord states that it is not a question of parish councils; I suggest that it is. We suggest that parish councils should have an involvement in the matter. We believe that those aims are best and most practically achieved by the proposals which are given effect to by Amendments Nos. 203 to 209 which my noble friend Lord Norrie does not care for. I believe that these amendments will enable a proper balance to be achieved between the local authorities with the wider national interest, and the particular concerns of those who actually live and work in the parks.
<P>

<a name="50711-31_para0"></a>In making his appointments, the Secretary of State will continue to select individuals for their personal qualities and experience and not as representatives of specific groups or organisations. While he expects his members to have regard to the interests of all who are concerned with a specific park, his primary concern is that they should <P>


<a name="column_1585"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1585</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bring to the authorities' deliberations the wider national viewpoint. Candidates already come from a wide range of backgrounds and interests. They are made up of farmers, business people, conservationists and representatives of a wide variety of leisure activities as well as those with a more general interest in the countryside and national parks in particular.
<P>

<a name="50711-31_para1"></a>The Secretaries of State will continue to be advised on those national appointments by the Countryside Commission and the Countryside Council for Wales which provide an independent input to the selection process and whose advice has always been valuable. We also make clear that parish members are to be appointed to represent the wider park view and not just the interests of their own parish. I do not think that these proposals reduce the importance of local authority members on the new authorities. I can assure your Lordships that these amendments do not change the principles enshrined in the Bill either that every principal council with land in the parks will be entitled to have at least one member on the new authorities, or that they will continue to have a majority of the membership.
<P>

<a name="50711-31_para2"></a>I do not think that the role of the Secretary of State's "own" appointees will be diluted. My noble friend Lord Norrie was concerned that familiarity with the purposes of the national parks and the interests of those whom they represent might not be adequate. We would encourage the countryside agencies, in consultation with the national park authorities, to ensure that all new members are familiar with the workings of the national parks and their purposes.
<P>

<a name="50711-31_para3"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, was concerned that there was no limit to the number of parish member appointments. Amendment No. 205 limits the term of parish member appointments to the term of their appointment as parish councillors.
<P>

<a name="50711-31_para4"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Lytton, was worried that the consultation exercise was restricted to local authorities. The exercise followed the normal procedure for such exercises. There was no hesitation in the willingness of other bodies to respond. The noble Baroness, Lady David, asked why the amendments had been produced so late. The issue of local representation has been raised at every stage of the Bill. It was the intention, which was announced at Second Reading in another place, to introduce amendments and the arguments were introduced at the first opportunity after the consultation exercise was completed.
<P>

<a name="50711-31_para5"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, was concerned about the Welsh national park authorities. Because of commitments which have already been made in respect of the membership of the national park boards being established under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 and the circular letters which had already been issued for consultations about establishing Welsh national park authorities, the Secretary of State for Wales proposes to leave unchanged the provisions for membership of the national park authorities as they apply to Wales.
<P>

<a name="50711-31_para6"></a>It is no surprise that the way in which local people influence the management of national parks should have taken up a large proportion of the time which has been spent in discussing Part III of the Bill. We have always <P>

There were months and months of consultation after the Edwards Report and the membership was not questioned until, as the noble Earl said, it was mentioned at Second Reading in another place. It seems to me that we need an explanation of why there should have been such a big change at this late moment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-31_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that it was a late moment.

It happened after due consideration.

He was a single issue man and this debate has broadened the discussion. As a result, the law will be much better.

I hope that he agrees that this debate has at least been useful to remind ourselves of the three components of the national park authorities' membership. I shall study his reply tomorrow. However, I wonder whether he could clarify one more point. Will the draft guidance covering membership arrangements be produced? Will there be an opportunity to comment on the arrangements before the draft is finalised? I shall wait for the reply, if the Minister is in a position to answer, before saying what I shall do.

<a name="50711-31_para8"></a>In moving the amendment, I ask your Lordships to consider the question of democracy. The proposal for the election of parish councillors&#151;that is elections by the electorate from among parish councillors&#151;is not the first choice of myself or these Benches for the appropriate way to appoint or constitute the national park authorities. The amendment is an attempt to inject an element of democracy rather than extending "quangodom" and failing notably to enhance accountability.
<P>

<a name="50711-31_para9"></a>The parish councillors will be appointed, as the Government propose, as other members of quangos, even though no doubt they will have their own priorities. The Government's proposals do not improve democratic accountability to any significant extent. The number of elected members&#151;the number of members who can serve with a mandate because they have been elected by the local community&#151;is cut; and the parish councillors will owe their places to the Secretary of State. I accept that this would not be the first choice of approach, but at this late stage my amendment attempts at least to include an element of democracy. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="50711-31_para10"></a>Moved, That Amendment No. 203B, as an amendment to Commons Amendment No. 203, be agreed to.&#151;(Baroness Hamwee.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-31_spnew9"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I can understand the noble Baroness's desire to introduce an element of democracy into all this. I am surprised that she did not try to import a bit of proportional representation, too, while she was about it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-31_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I sometimes recognise defeat before it comes and hits me in the face.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-31_spnew11"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, in that case, there is not much point in my answering the noble Baroness's amendment. However, it would be discourteous of me not to do so. I understand her desire to try to introduce some form of democracy. She wants to introduce a requirement that parishes wholly or partly within the parks should form one voting body for the purposes of electing parish members to the new authorities.
<P>

<a name="50711-31_para11"></a>In arriving at our own proposals in Amendments Nos. 203 to 209, we considered the option that parish members for each national park authority should be identified through some form of electoral process rather than be appointed by the Secretary of State. I can understand the noble Baroness's view. We are together in that. However, in the end we felt that it would be impossible to impose on parishes the requirement to hold elections in order to identify the parish members in the absence of any existing mechanisms that could be adapted for the purpose.
<P>

<a name="50711-31_para12"></a>We are aware that some parks have parish fora which might be responsible for running elections in their parks. In other parks, however, there may be no agreed organisation which could undertake the task of running an election; nor might the parishes agree on the process to be adopted or on when elections should be held. We therefore concluded that amending the Bill to require parish members to be elected could not be done without also drawing up a complete new set of provisions governing the conduct of those elections. We came to the conclusion that to try to amend the Bill at this stage <P>


<a name="column_1588"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1588</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to make such a provision would have been a very complex task. Instead, we opted for the simpler, more practical, route of appointment by the Secretary of State. We have made it perfectly clear, however, that we should be more than content for parishes in each park to decide collectively the nominations to be put before my right honourable friend.
<P>

<a name="50711-31_para13"></a>Nor will the Secretary of State have discretion over the terms of their appointments. Amendment No. 205 provides for parish members to hold office from the time of their appointment until they cease to be members of their parish councils. If they are re-elected to their parish councils, they will also be eligible for reappointment to the national park authorities, provided their names are again put before the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="50711-31_para14"></a>I understand the intention that underlies the noble Baroness's amendment, but I do not believe that at this stage in the Bill's progress it would be suitable. As I have tried to explain, we have done the best we can without proposing a whole new set of regulations to say how elections should be conducted. We decided to use a system that will make sure that parish councillors are appointed but will ensure that people in the parishes have the right and the duty to put before the Secretary of State those whom they believe will be most suitable for appointment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-32_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I wish that I had proposed election by proportional representation, by single transferable vote. It would have answered most of the points that the Minister used to defend the Government's failure to bite the bullet&#151;a bullet that they seem to accept as a real one&#151;and to incorporate a provision for election. I am surprised. It has not seemed to me that on other occasions it has been beyond the wit of the Government to impose the sort of arrangements that would be necessary to provide for such an election.
<P>

<a name="50711-32_para0"></a>My amendment would have met a point that was made in the previous debate by providing a period of years during which the elected councillors might serve. It is very unhealthy for democracy to allow the position to arise whereby an individual can continue to hold an appointed office for years and years. I have no doubt that many parish councillors do hold their offices for many years. If that is allowed to happen, one gets sucked into the system. Periodically putting oneself up for re-election and having one's position validated is, frankly, a very good thing indeed. However, sadly, at this point in the Bill I fear that we shall make no further progress. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

At the same time I shall speak also to Commons Amendments Nos. 254, 282, 295, 296, 297 and 337, as well as to Amendments Nos. 295A, as an amendment to Commons Amendment No. 295, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee.

<a name="column_1632"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1632</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-33_para0"></a>Amendments Nos. 248, 295, 297 and 337 introduce powers for the Secretary of State to direct the NRA and, in future, the agency, and for the Secretary of State for Scotland to direct SEPA, to undertake reviews of particular descriptions of consents for the purpose of making proposals to us for modifications to those consents.
<P>

<a name="50711-33_para1"></a>Having considered those proposals, the Secretary of State could then give them effect through a direction; in other words, modification of a number of consents could be achieved by direction. We consider that these powers offer a useful means for the Secretary of State to deal more expeditiously with changes to consents where an issue of general policy arises that affects a number of consents. In our view that would offer substantial advantages in terms of facilitating any changes that might be required to consents where an issue of general policy has been shown to arise. I know that the NRA has also said that it welcomes the introduction of such a power. I should, however, also make clear that we envisage that exercise of this power would not be frequent and that modifications to individual consents would continue to be dealt with on a bilateral basis between the discharger and the regulator.
<P>

<a name="50711-33_para2"></a>I want now to say something about our intentions in using these powers of direction. There are, of course, two powers: one to require the NRA to undertake a review of consents and then to come forward with proposals for modifications; the second to implement any changes to consents that may have been proposed.
<P>

<a name="50711-33_para3"></a>As regards the first direction, we have previously demonstrated our acceptance in principle of the development of general clauses to be included in consents. However, experience has also shown that such conditions need very careful consideration. We need to discuss a number of issues with the NRA but, subject to those discussions, our intention would be to make use of the power to issue a direction. We intend that the powers in Amendment No. 295 should be commenced two months after Royal Assent.
<P>

<a name="50711-33_para4"></a>As regards the second direction&#151;to implement any proposals made by the NRA&#151;we cannot, of course, be expected to prejudge the outcome of such a review. We shall need, among other things, to hear the views of dischargers. And as I indicated, the Secretary of State must retain the right to modify the proposals that are brought forward.
<P>

<a name="50711-33_para5"></a>Amendment No. 296 has a simple purpose. It is intended to ensure that in future, as under the existing legislation, the requirement for advertising of an application for a discharge consent can be waived if the agency considers such advertising to be unnecessary in the case of a particular application.
<P>

<a name="50711-33_para6"></a>Amendments Nos. 282 and 249 provide a refinement of the deregulatory measures already in the Bill affecting discharge consent appeals. As originally drafted, the Bill provided that where an agency decides to revoke a consent, the revocation should not take effect until any appeal has been determined. It did not make the same provision for cases where an agency decides to modify a consent or impose conditions on a <P>


<a name="column_1633"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1633</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>previously unconditional consent. On further consideration, however, we concluded that that was not the correct approach.
<P>

<a name="50711-33_para7"></a>These amendments therefore bring decisions by the agencies to modify a discharge consent and to impose conditions on a previously unconditional consent into line with revocations so that the effect of such decisions will also be suspended pending determination or withdrawal of an appeal. We recognised, however, that there will be situations where it is necessary for revocations, modifications and conditions to come into force immediately. The amendments therefore allow the agencies to require the discharger to comply immediately with the effect of a decision where they consider this to be necessary to prevent or minimise pollution of controlled waters or harm to human health. We consider that these amendments offer a sensible way forward, providing a balance between the interests of dischargers and the need for changes to have immediate effect where there is a pressing environmental or health requirement for them to do so.
<P>

<a name="50711-33_para8"></a>Amendments Nos. 244 to 247 and 250 amend the Control of Pollution Act 1974 and are designed to increase the operational flexibility of the water pollution control regime in Scotland. I beg to move.

<A NAME="50711-34_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanwell: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Earl spoke to Commons Amendment No. 295 and perhaps anticipated what I might say in moving Amendment No. 295A, it may be convenient for me to place on record the anxieties that underlie my amendment. When we come to it, it may not be necessary for me to move it, but it is appropriate that my concerns are on record.
<P>

<a name="50711-34_para0"></a>Following a serious pollution incident, discharge consents, setting limits on the amount of certain named substances allowed into rivers and coastal waters, have recently been reviewed as to their content. It had been understood that discharge consents only authorised the discharge of substances that could reasonably be expected to be present in the specific effluent, and that the consent would not provide a defence if pollution was caused by other substances not mentioned in the consent. As I say, the efficacy of that system recently came into doubt. It is not just a matter of action by the NRA or, as it will be, of the environment agency. There is concern that there would be difficulty for people who are affected to pursue damage claims in the civil courts in that situation.
<P>

<a name="50711-34_para1"></a>To clarify the position I was concerned to ensure that Ministers used their powers of direction to restore adequate environmental protection and give your Lordships and those concerned outside this place clear assurance that the issue will be progressed satisfactorily and river quality restored. I believe that that adequately puts on record the concerns that underlie my amendment.

<P>

<a name="50711-36_para0"></a>Amendments Nos. 269 to 272 deal with an issue that was raised by the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, and my noble friend Lord Stanley during our Committee and Report stages and concern the requirement for landowners, and others with an interest in land, to grant rights under Section 35(4) of the Environmental Protection Act. Section 35(4) provides that where a waste management licence holder requires rights over land in order to comply with a condition in his licence, any person whose consent would be required must grant him the rights to enable him to comply with those conditions. Section 35(4) makes no provision for consulting those who might have to grant such rights when the licence condition is imposed or for compensating them for any loss or damage caused. We have carried out a consultation with interested parties and it confirmed the view that Section 35(4) provides inadequate safeguards for those required to grant rights under its provisions. Hence Amendments Nos. 269 to 272.
<P>

<a name="50711-36_para1"></a>Amendment No. 269 makes provision for the payment of compensation by the holder of the relevant waste management licence to anyone who is required to grant rights under Section 35(4) of the 1990 Act. Compensation is payable for loss or damage, but the detailed arrangements for determining the amount of compensation, including provision for resolving any disputes, are to be prescribed by regulations.

<a name="50711-36_para2"></a>Amendment No. 270 would modify the operation of Section 36 of the 1990 Act by placing a duty on waste regulation authorities&#151;in future the agency&#151;to notify those likely to be required to grant rights under Section 35(4) as a result of a condition which they propose imposing on a waste management licence when the licence is first issued.
<P>

<a name="50711-36_para3"></a>Amendment No. 271 makes similar provision in relation to the modification of licence conditions under Section 37 of the 1990 Act, but with the additional safeguard that where the licence is being modified in an emergency, the waste regulation authority would be able to postpone the consultation.

<P>

<a name="50711-37_para0"></a>During our consideration of this Bill, a number of amendments were moved that would place a duty on water undertakers to promote the efficient use of water by their customers. My noble friend Lord Ullswater was sympathetic to this intention, and the Government undertook to consider such provisions during the passage of the Bill through Parliament.
<P>

<a name="50711-37_para1"></a>The first part of Amendment No. 276 places a duty on water undertakers to promote the efficient use of water by their customers. Some water undertakers already consider this part of their customer care service; others could do more. The duty is backed up by a discretionary power for the Director General of Water Services to set standards of performance, where necessary, after taking account of the water resource situation in the undertaker's area and after consultation with the undertaker. The standards that the director general sets, and the undertaker's performance in meeting them will be made available to customers.
<P>


<a name="column_1651"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1651</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-37_para2"></a>We expect those standards to include the offering to customers of facilities, such as a low-cost voluntary metering scheme, and information on water use, which will enable them to make informed choices about how to use water efficiently. But there will be no compulsion on customers. The tone is one of encouragement. There is a dearth of information about the efficient use of water available to customers. Inefficient use of water will lead to requirements for new resources to be developed, the construction of new or expanded water treatment and waste water treatment plant and a consequent increase in customers' bills to pay for all that capital expenditure. I believe that the proposals here will help to inform customers and lead to a reduction in water use.
<P>

<a name="50711-37_para3"></a>The second part of Amendment No. 276 will make easier the provision of first-time connection to mains sewerage of existing premises. It puts a new requirement on a sewerage undertaker to provide public sewers to be used for the drainage for domestic purposes of premises in any locality in its area where there are adverse effects to the environment or amenity arising from the existing system, and where this is the most cost-effective solution.
<P>

<a name="50711-37_para4"></a>In the event of any dispute there is provision for a right to apply to the new Environment Agency to rule on whether there is a case for extending the mains sewerage network. These powers relate only to existing properties and do not cover future development. My department will issue guidance to the undertakers and the agency on the relevant issues to be taken into account in assessing the cost-effectiveness of the various solutions.
<P>

<a name="50711-37_para5"></a>Amendment No. 279 is a technical amendment. In Committee my noble friend Lord Crickhowell moved an amendment very similar to Amendment No. 280 to enable the agency to issue drought permits under certain circumstances on application by water undertakers, which we agreed to consider. Amendment No. 280 allows the agency to issue drought permits which would have the same effect as drought orders. The new power is to be parallel to the existing drought order powers. The power of the agency to issue such permits is to be exercisable in the same circumstances as the present power to make drought orders. I commend the amendments to the House.

<A NAME="50711-38_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Nicol: </B>   My Lords, I welcome Amendment No. 276, which fulfils the aims of an amendment that I put forward at an earlier stage. I particularly welcome the noble Earl's interpretation of the provisions which will mean that water metering will not be compulsorily imposed on customers.
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para0"></a>However, I have one niggle. All the emphasis is placed on the efficient use of water by customers. Why should we not include the efficient use of water by water companies? The mains which supply water to customers have been leaking with a 25 per cent. loss throughout the time that I have discussed the subject as a Member of your Lordships' House. Despite the work they have done recently, I understand that that figure is still <P>


<a name="column_1652"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1652</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>roughly the same. It seems to me that the water companies should be included in the need to make efficient use of water, but, apart from that, I welcome the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-38_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, I wish to make some comments and ask the Minister some questions about Amendments Nos. 276 and 277. I have given the Minister notice, and I am grateful to him for outlining the contents of Amendment No. 276 so that I do not have to explain how my queries fit into that in any great detail.
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para1"></a>I welcome the duty now proposed to be laid upon the undertakers to provide new sewerage systems, in effect, for residential premises in their area, but it is not clear in practice what the local authorities' role will now be in requisitioning new or extended sewerage schemes in rural areas. I would be grateful if the Minister could explain how, in practice, he envisages the new system working with the old.
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para2"></a>There has been a marked decline in the number of new sewerage systems in recent years, although I think that I was mistaken in the note I sent the Minister when I said that that was especially since the Water Industry Act 1991. I do not believe that that was true. Given the undertakers' reluctance, acting under the present legislation, does the Minister anticipate that more rural sewerage schemes will be built as a result of the Bill, as amended by this schedule, coming into force? Such improved drainage is still urgently required in many rural areas, even though everyone will recognise that not every house can reasonably be expected to be connected to a main sewerage scheme.
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para3"></a>A further point relates to what considerations should be taken into account when determining whether it is appropriate for the new sewerage scheme to be provided. That comes under new Section 101A(3). As I understand it, local authorities retain their duty to ensure that private drainage systems do not pollute groundwater or damage local amenities. Will the undertakers be able to defend themselves from a request for a new or extended sewerage scheme by saying that the local authority should exercise those powers rather than attempt to requisition a new scheme? Is that what is intended by new Section 101A(3) (e)?
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para4"></a>I move now to new Section 101A(4) which relates to the guidance which will be issued by the Secretary of State. It can often be cheaper, and yet environmentally acceptable, to build small local treatment plants to provide main sewerage to a village community; that is to say, to do that rather than connect such communities to distant existing schemes. Yet a sewerage undertaker can frustrate a scheme by imposing engineering proposals to make the scheme financially unviable to the district council or to the residents, whomsoever is the requisitioner. Will the Government guidance indicate when the option of local treatment schemes will be acceptable?
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para5"></a>The powers of the environment agency to determine disputes between property owners, occupiers and the undertakers, on matters other than cost (new Section 101A(7)) are welcome, but will those powers enable also such small local schemes to be put in place where they are environmentally acceptable?

<a name="50711-38_para6"></a>On the matter of the settling of disputes, it is my understanding that in disputes between a requisitioning local authority and an undertaker, the local authority can seek arbitration only on matters of cost. That, at any rate, seems to be the current interpretation of Section 99(6) of the Water Industry Act 1991. Is it possible for the Government, through their guidance, to extend the scope of that arbitration to cover whether the undertaker has proposed a means of providing sewerage in the most economical or cost-effective way?
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para7"></a>That brings me to my final point, which is related to Amendment No. 277. Part of the amendment proposes the repeal of Section 151 of the 1991 Act; that is the discontinuance of the government grant to support local authorities' repayments to the undertakers. I am sure that I do not need to explain that at present the requisitioning local authority proposes that the undertaker does the work and then the local authority pays the amount back over a 12-year period. Let us suppose that the Government still see a role for local authorities in requisitioning sewerage schemes. Will the Minister consider extending the repayment period beyond the existing 12 years to a period which more closely reflects the life of the asset created by the new or extended scheme? Such an amendment or guidance would be some compensation to local authorities for their loss of grant.
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para8"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for enabling me to ask those questions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-38_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wise: </B>   My Lords, I am somewhat dismayed by the fact that Amendment No. 317 abolishes the government grants being paid to farmers towards first-time connections to the mains water supply and sewerage. I appreciate that much progress has been made during the past few years but, nevertheless, there are cases in which the continued availability of grants would provide a valuable incentive for farmers to connect to the mains. For example, that may be desirable in cases in which tougher environmental standards dictate that mains connection is desirable in substitution for private supplies and also the means of disposal. I am saddened that the grants will be removed. They are a great incentive and I would like to see them remain.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-38_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, for her welcome of Amendment No. 276 because it met the points about which she was anxious. She said that she was glad that the meters would not be compulsory. I must say that I have a sneaking sympathy in sharing that view too. There is a forceful argument about meters. The fact is that if supplies are metered people use less and that if people use more one must pay for the construction of reservoirs, filtering plants and heaven knows what else. All of these are expensive and so up go the water rates. Therefore, there is a sound argument for saying that people should pay for what they use and they should be encouraged not to waste water.
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said that it was fine to say that customers should not waste water but what about the companies which waste water all over the place&#151;

<P>
<A NAME="50711-38_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt the Minister. He appeared to imply that he was sympathetic to the idea of compulsory water metering. I hope that even at this late stage he will reiterate his personal view and the view of the Government; that they are against compulsory water metering.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711-38_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, it is too late to be put on the spot by the noble Lord, Lord Williams. I was merely trying to explain to the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, that I too had a certain amount of sympathy with her view. However, there is the other side to the issue. It is a question of, on the one hand, this and, on the other hand, that. I thought that I was travelling a narrow course. I was saying that there are arguments for compulsory metering but that compulsory metering is not on the menu at the moment.
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para10"></a>The noble Baroness was concerned about the fact that consumers appear to be encouraged to save water but not the companies. Section 37 places a duty on water companies to provide an efficient and economic system of water supply. They would not do that if they wasted their water in an unsatisfactory way.
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para11"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, was kind enough to give me notice of some of the questions which she asked and I am deeply grateful to her for that.
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para12"></a>She referred to the continuing role of local authorities in requisitioning. I can assure the noble Baroness that they will continue to be able to requisition the provision of sewers in rural areas. The second part of Amendment No. 276 imposes a new duty on sewerage undertakers to provide public sewers where there are environmental problems and public sewers are the most appropriate solution in all the circumstances.
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para13"></a>She was concerned about whether there would be more rural sewerage schemes as a result of this Bill. It is possible that, overall, there will be more rural sewerage schemes since the new arrangements will have to provide sewers where there are environmental problems which cannot be dealt with satisfactorily by existing systems such as cesspits and septic tanks.
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para14"></a>She asked whether sewerage undertakers would try to avoid their obligations by suggesting that local authorities should instead use their powers. It is not intended that Section 101A(3) (e) should be used to allow a sewerage undertaker to pass the responsibility to the local authority to deal with environmental problems. Each case for connection under the new duty will be looked at on its merits. Section 101A(3) (e) is intended to allow consideration of the practicality of alternatives to public sewerage such as the maintenance or repair of existing cesspits or septic tanks and to decide on which is the most cost effective solution.
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para15"></a>She was concerned also about small local treatment plants. Once it has been agreed or determined under the new arrangements that the undertaker has a duty to provide a public sewer, it will be for the undertaker to decide which method of disposal and treatment should be used to carry out its existing duty under Section 94 of the Water Industry Act to make the necessary provision for the disposal of sewage. The guidance under the new provisions will not deal with specific options for sewage disposal.
<P>


<a name="column_1655"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1995 : Column 1655</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para16"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether the agency would be able to determine that small local schemes should be used. Again, where it has been agreed or determined under the new provisions that it is appropriate to provide a public sewer&#151;in other words, where there are environmental problems and that is the best solution in all the circumstances&#151;the decision on the type of system will be for the undertaker. The agency will be able to make non-binding recommendations about that.
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para17"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether the Government would extend the scope of arbitration under the requisitioning provisions and would consider extending the existing 12-year repayment period for those who requisition, for example, local authorities. Both those matters concern the requisitioning provisions in Section 99 of the Act which are not the subject of the amendments which we are considering this evening. Those amendments introduce a new duty to provide sewers where there are environmental problems and mains sewerage is the most appropriate solution.
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para18"></a>My noble friend Lord Wise said that he is sorry that grants to farmers are being stopped and that it was better for farmers to be connected to the mains rather than using private supplies. I understand his feelings in that regard but we feel that grants have outlived their usefulness. The number of properties not connected to the mains has reduced significantly since grants were first introduced and a more practical solution for the remaining properties is now required. If a householder's sewerage is causing problems, that can be rectified without the need for it to be connected to the mains, such as by renewing the cesspit, and that is the most cost-effective solution. It is considered that the taxpayer's money should not be used to meet those costs.
<P>

<a name="50711-38_para19"></a>I hope that your Lordships are satisfied with regard to the points that have been raised and I commend the amendments.

(a) that levy is issued by that board at a time after an order has been made under section 60 of this Act by virtue of section 61(1) of this Act designating a date in relation to that board; and
<br>
(b) the designated date is a date falling after the beginning, but before the end, of that year.
<br>
(5) In a case where this sub-paragraph applies, the levy in question or any levy substituted for that levy&#151;
<br>
(a) shall have effect or, as the case may be, continue to have effect; and
<br>
(b) in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (a) above, shall be paid or, as the case may be, continue to be paid,
<br>
as if the body corporate constituted as that board was not to, or had not, so become the National Park authority for the National Park in question (but was to continue, or had continued, to be the National Park planning board for that Park for the whole of that year).
<br>
(6) Where a body corporate constituted as a Welsh National Park planning board has or is to become the National Park authority for the National Park in question by virtue of an order made under section 60 of this Act by virtue of section 61(1) of this Act, nothing in this paragraph authorises that body corporate to issue for any year both a levy under section 74 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 and a levy by virtue of section 68 of this Act.
<br>
(7) In this paragraph&#151;
<br>
"the designated date" has the same meaning as in section 61 of this Act;
<br>
"National Park planning board" has the meaning given by section 61(9) of this Act;
<br>
"Welsh National Park planning board" means a National Park planning board for the area of a National Park in Wales;
<br>
"year" means a period of 12 months beginning with 1st April;
<br>
and any reference to the issue of a levy under section 74 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 by a Welsh National Park planning board is a reference to the issue of a levy under that section by such a board by virtue of subsection (7) of that section.'.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711w01_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Kennet </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they consider the interpretation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty embodied in the Presidents' joint statement permits either the United States or the Soviet Union to set up what they describe as "theatre ballistic missiles" in such a way as to have a "strategic" effect (such as nullifying the deterrent role of Britain's Trident missiles).
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Chalker of Wallasey): </B>  It is not for us to comment on the detail of a statement reflecting discussions between the Presidents of the United States and Russia. The Trident System will provide the United Kingdom with a credible minimum deterrent against all foreseeable developments well into the next century.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711w01_wqn1"></A><B> Lord Kennet </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether it is their understanding that the "transparency" referred to in the joint statement issued after the summit meeting between Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton on 10 May 1995 is to apply between themselves, or between themselves and the international community, including the US' NATO Allies and OSCE Associates.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711w01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   The statement issued by Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin was the result of bilateral contacts between the United States and the Russian Federation. It did not refer to any wider multilateral agreement.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711w01_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Kennet </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What meaning they attach to that part of the Clinton-Yeltsin joint statement where it is said that "tactical missile defence systems shall not be developed by Russia and the United States to use them against each other"; what the implications of this are for the deployment of such systems against the UK, France or China; and what "the development of bilateral co-operation in the development and use of efficient tactical missile defence systems" implies for other states.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50711w01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   The passages quoted by the noble Lord refer to proposals for confidence-building measures in the context of a bilateral treaty, to which the United Kingdom is not party. We continue to monitor these developments and are in close touch with the United States. But it would not be appropriate for us to seek to interpret these statements or to comment publicly on their possible implications for third parties.
