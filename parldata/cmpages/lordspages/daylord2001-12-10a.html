<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What advice they are giving to doctors regarding antibiotic use in the event of exposure to the anthrax bacillus.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  My Lords, advice to doctors on the treatment of those with anthrax symptoms and those potentially exposed to spores is available through the Public Health Laboratory Service. Specific guidance is available on the PHLS website, including on the use of antibiotics. Arrangements have also been made to draw the attention of GPs and other clinical staff to the guidance as appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. It is encouraging. The Public Health Laboratory Service guidelines suggest that penicillin is used as a prophylactic and even in therapy. However, the strain of anthrax that has been disseminated in the United States and a number of strains in the wild are also producers of penicillinase, and hence can lead to resistance. Will the Minister assure the House that the guidelines are updated to take account of the abilities of these organisms?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, antibiotic-resistant anthrax is a known phenomenon. Tests in the US indicate that the strains of anthrax identified there were susceptible to penicillin and to ciprofloxacin and doxicyclin. In the UK, the antibiotic of choice is ciprofloxacin, which is considered to be the most effective antibiotic in these circumstances.
<P>

<a name="11210-01_para0"></a>In any incident, it is clearly important to test the anthrax for antibiotic resistance, as that cannot be predicted. Such testing will continue as the incident unfolds in case more than one strain of anthrax is used. This will then confirm the treatment. Laboratories, including the PHLS, are well able to undertake such tests as a matter of routine.
<P>

<a name="11210-01_para1"></a>In relation to the guidance, I have checked with advisers and have been informed that it is consistent with the relevant information that is now available. I should be happy to discuss the matter further with the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, the Question was also directed towards the prophylactic use of <P>


<a name="column_1132"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1132</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>antiobiotics against anthrax. What action is the department taking to prevent such use or to discourage it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, the guidance issued by the PHLS recommends, at page 8, prophylaxis after exposure. In that case, ciprofloxacin is recommended as the antibiotic of choice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   My Lords, the cascade of information from the Government to NHS trusts and GPs has been very effective. However, the difficulty remains of diagnosing the first index case. What measures are in place to ensure a continuous cascade of information so that it does not fall from the front line of the minds of those clinicians who might be faced with seeing the index case and who would be key in diagnosing it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, the guidance was originally available on the PHLS website on 11th October. GPs and other clinicians had their attention drawn to that advice in a letter from the Deputy Chief Medical Officer on 11th and 15th October. More detailed guidance was issued on 17th October to all health authorities. I very much take the point that the noble Baroness has raised. I can assure her that the PHLS will update guidance as appropriate. We have an effective way of then ensuring that that reaches front-line clinicians.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, as the Minister indicated, strains of anthrax can vary in their susceptibility to antibiotics. In view of that, what are the Government doing to ensure that rapid methods are available to detect antibiotic resistance in a strain of anthrax and, therefore, to give rapid advice when it is needed?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, as I believe I said in my answer to the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, tests are undertaken and it is very important to carry those out as quickly as possible. Testing continues to take place in relation to specific incidents in case more than one strain of anthrax has been used. Therefore, the purpose of testing is to confirm whether anthrax has been involved and, if so, which strain. Tests are then carried out to determine whether that strain of anthrax is resistant to a particular antibiotic. Therefore, a hierarchy of responses ensures quick and continuous testing and, if anthrax is confirmed, it identifies whether the strain would be resistant to a particular antibiotic.

<a name="column_1133"></a>

<UL><FONT SIZE=3>and that parents are consulted about inter-faith education when new religious schools are proposed in the state sector.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills   (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </B>  My Lords, we shall require promoters of new faith schools to have local support and to demonstrate how they will be inclusive and work in partnership with other schools. We consider that approach to be more appropriate than directly copying Northern Ireland's integrated school system. Promoters of new schools must carry out detailed consultation with the local community and interested parties.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her reply. Will she note that I was not suggesting a direct copy of Northern Ireland? Would she be prepared to consult her ministerial colleague there on this whole matter, and does she agree that inter-religious schooling in England is highly desirable?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, indeed, we consult colleagues in all departments on issues that are appropriate and relevant. We acknowledge that there are 20 or so existing Roman Catholic and Church of England schools in England, as referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. The noble Lord is right to draw attention to existing joint-faith schools which bring together children of Christian faith. It is worth noting that a key aspect of the success of these schools is their ability to work together on shared aims through mutual respect in order to secure the best education for their children.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that one of the lessons of Northern Ireland is that educating children separately has a damaging effect on community relations and on the attitude of one religion towards another? Does she accept that the concerns in relation to a move to faith schools are that such schools would not easily be inclusive and that they might lead to increased segregation in this country without necessarily following any Northern Ireland model?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, as my noble friend Lord Dubs knows well, at present 4 per cent of Northern Ireland's pupil population attends integrated schools. The general policy in Northern Ireland is that children should be educated in accordance with their parents' wishes. That is reflected in the different schools which exist in Northern Ireland, including maintained, controlled, integrated and Irish medium schools. All schools, regardless of whether they have a particular religious designation, should further understanding of the diversity of national, religious and ethnic identities in the UK and the need for mutual respect and tolerance. That is exactly how we would approach this issue in England.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spnew12"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Southwark: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister acknowledge that there is a long tradition of <P>


<a name="column_1134"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Church schools in England, which serve the whole local community and not only the children of practising Christians?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the right reverend Prelate that there is, indeed, a long-standing and widely accepted tradition of faith schools in this country. Christian faith schools have a significant history as part of the state education system and play an important role in its diversity. We consider that it would be wrong to deny members of other faiths access to schools of their faith.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Dearing: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as the chair of the committee of the Church of England that recommended an increase in the number of that Church's secondary schools. Is the Minister aware that at a meeting of the General Synod of that Church last month a resolution was passed which welcomed an ecumenical approach to those additional schools? The resolution stated that the schools should serve the whole nation and should be open to children from the diverse communities that they serve.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-01_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of the work of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and of the resolutions that were passed by the General Synod. The Government welcome the emphasis that the noble Lord gave in his report to the Archbishops' Council to the principles of social and religious inclusiveness. We were delighted to see that that was reinforced in a resolution of the General Synod on 14th November which noted that Church schools should be open to the diverse communities that they serve. That is an important part of education in this country.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the situation in Northern Ireland is diametrically opposed to that which obtains in England; namely, it has de facto religious education with a very small integrated school element? Here, by and large, we have a large integrated school element and relatively few faith schools. Does she agree that the experience of Northern Ireland, as outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, suggests that we should be very wary about the development of faith schools in this country?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I ask noble Lords to be cautious in suggesting that somehow faith schools are a cause of other things. We should be careful about heaping on to the heads of schools responsibility for other aspects of segregation. Many socio-economic factors lead to tensions in our community. We need to be clear that faith schools should play an important role in their communities in terms of working in partnership with schools of faith and of none. That is something that we would be keen to see and to promote.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Massey of Darwen: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend the Minister has spoken about community <P>


<a name="column_1135"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>involvement and community consultation. Can she explain what will be the role of school governors in the new schools?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness will know from being a school governor, school governors play an important and vital role in all schools. We would expect them to be mindful of the ethos of the school and of the way in which we expect those schools to participate in their local communities. It is a longstanding tradition for schools of all kinds to be part of their community. We expect school governors to ensure that their school participates in the community with schools of other faiths, that the teaching of citizenship is fully carried out within the school and that the ethos of tolerance is part of how every school develops.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-02_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, as one who arrived at Eton having never knowingly met a Conservative, does the Minister agree that segregation of any kind makes the life of schoolchildren harder than it need be?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl puts his question extremely well. It is important to be clear about what we mean by segregation and to understand that children need to grow up with traditions, understanding and tolerance. But they do so from a background of history, tradition and culture. For many children, that includes a religious background. Therefore, we need to ensure that they meet as equals; that all our children are educated and are able to be educated without fear in the school system; and that we have respect for the diversity of education in this country.

<P>
<UL>
<a name="11210-02_para0"></a>When they expect the asylum system in the United Kingdom to be working effectively.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="11210-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Lord Rooker): </B>  My Lords, this Government are committed to delivering an effective asylum system and we have made significant progress towards achieving this since coming to office. In the past financial year the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) at the Home Office made 132,840 initial decisions on asylum applications and there were 8,930 removals. The backlog of undecided asylum applications stood at 43,000 at the end of September this year.
<P>

<a name="11210-02_para1"></a>Measures to increase the effectiveness of the system were announced by the Home Secretary in another place on 29th October. Further details will have to await the publication of the White Paper, which we expect to be in late January.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. The Home Secretary recently <P>


<a name="column_1136"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1136</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>admitted that the asylum system was not working, and the latest figures show that of the 30,000 failed applicants due to be removed by March, only about 5,000 have been removed. Therefore, what progress is being made in identifying quickly both genuine refugees and potential terrorists?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may say to the noble Lord that we do not necessarily associate asylum seekers with terrorism in a global fashion, as implied in the question. The process needs to be speeded-up. Our target is to achieve 60 per cent of initial decisions in two months. At present, we are achieving about 50 per cent, so we are not too far off. We come closer each month to reaching our target.
<P>

<a name="11210-02_para2"></a>The removals programme is a large one. To remove 30,000 people a year would mean removing 2,500 per month. We expect to reach 2,500 per month by the spring of next year. To do that sensitively and carefully without causing disturbance in communities requires enormous planning. That is taking place at present. It also requires an extension of the detention estate. We need to be able to detain prior to removal to make that effective.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the Government's latest press release, which talks about new categories of work permits to boost the UK economy. Does the Minister consider that skilled asylum seekers already in this country could benefit from this radical reform of the existing approach to migration?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, we are not planning that. One of the reasons for that is because the belief that asylum seekers with English language can work here is such a pull factor for the people traffickers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, I refer to a debate we had in your Lordships' House one month ago. Will the Minister give some thought to the introduction of an American-style green card system and the opportunity, therefore, for at least some of those who come to this country for economic reasons to stay here for licit and legal purposes? Can he tell the House what monitoring of the dispersal system is taking place and how many of those dispersed to other parts of the country return to London within the first six months or so of dispersal?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I shall first answer the latter part of the noble Lord's question. Once we have dispersed some 30,000 people in about 18 months under the National Asylum Support Service, some pressure will be taken off the South East, and Kent in particular. Once the initial decisions are given or people enter the appeal process and come off support&#151;they may be given exceptional leave to remain&#151;we do not track people. We shall not know how many have returned to the South East. However, there is anecdotal evidence, which I have picked up in the East Midlands, in particular, that many people do not necessarily return.
<P>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-02_para3"></a>As regards the first part of the noble Lord's question, the White Paper will set out proposals for managed migration; that is, through more than one scheme. People will have an opportunity to come to this country to work. In some cases that may lead to settlement, and in other cases that will be for temporary purposes. The objective will be partly met&#151;it will not be fully met. Those who wish to come to the country to work, as opposed to using the asylum system to seek to do that, will have an open and transparent means of doing so. We shall thereby remove the pull factor from the people traffickers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend tell the House who pays for the cost of travel; that is, of getting 2,500 people out of this country to wherever they are going? I do not imagine such people have the money to do that. Do the Government pay or someone else, such as the carriers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the cost of removing people from the country is funded by my department. At present the figure is about 200 per week, some 800 per month. We are some way short of reaching the target. Such removal is done in many ways. Sometimes we charter aircraft because it is the cheapest way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   My Lords, last week I met a lady from the Congo who came to this country eight years ago to apply for asylum. She, her husband and her children, two of whom were born in this country and have no other home to go to, have still not had an initial decision. The Home Office wrote to her last February stating that still she would have to wait. At the same time I met several other people who have been here for several years. Would it not be sensible for the Government to clear the backlog of people who have been here several years by giving them an amnesty and leave to stay in this country? To remove them in such circumstances would be utterly inhumane.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I do not necessarily agree with the last point raised by the noble Lord. I regret that former constituents of mine, who have been in this country longer than the lady in the example given by the noble Lord, have not had a satisfactory decision. I agree that such cases are difficult and complex, given the phenomenal increase in the past few years. It is clear that we are targeting those on whom it is easier to make a decision. The easiest ones to remove will be those who have been here for a short time. That is self-evident. If the noble Lord writes to me with details of the case he mentions, I shall have it looked at. We regret the present situation, which is due to the lack of investment in the past. We have doubled the number of staff in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate to speed up decisions. The system was chaotic and had been so for several years. That is why people such as those in the example given by the noble Lord have fallen through the net.

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>terrorists arose from reports that some of the atrocities that had been committed abroad had been planned by people in this country, some having come here as refugees?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, of course that applies to some. I did not want the question and answer to pass without qualification because I believe that it would send the wrong signals to those outside. That is one of the reasons why we take fingerprints and check identities as far as possible. We are calling people into the reporting centres in a more rigorous, systematic and better managed way than we have ever done before. Part of the argument heard in this House in the past few days touches on the motives that people have for being here and the deeds they are planning abroad. That is one of the reasons for the anti-terrorism Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="11210-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Yes, my Lords. Work is being done in that respect. There is little evidence of people being brought into this country for sexual exploitation in respect of children. There is some evidence that they are brought to this country for onward transfer to other European countries, which I shall not name. There is a good deal of active work being done at present, together with our partners in Europe and elsewhere.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  My Lords, the Government's policy is to attack organised crime in a systematic way and to promote community policing in Northern Ireland.

 Our policy is to support, in every possible way, the Northern Ireland Policing Board and the Police Service of Northern Ireland in order to deliver effective community policing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-03_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord for his reply. In view of the serious problem, and the fact that a large number of senior police officers have taken advantage of early retirement and that absenteeism in the force is unacceptably high, can he give an assurance that the phasing out of the reserve force will not take place while the terrorist threat and the high level of intimidation and organised crime remain? Further, can he assure the House that the Government <P>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1139</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will do everything they can to enhance the effectiveness of the Special Branch in carrying out its anti-terrorist operations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, certainly the Chief Constable is very alert to the management of the reduction of officers at senior ranks. Plainly, we take a good deal of advice from and we pay a good deal of attention to the Chief Constable. In my experience it is extremely difficult to contemplate an effective fight against terrorism without using all intelligence capacity, which includes Special Branch.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, do the Government have any evidence that there is any connection between organised crime and terrorist groups in Northern Ireland?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, there is a good deal of evidence to show that that is precisely the situation. The line between organised crime and alleged political activity is thin to the point of disappearance on many occasions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord agree with the Northern Ireland Organised Crime Task Force that more than half the groups involved in drug dealing in the Province have paramilitary affiliations? Further, does he agree that the police in Northern Ireland must continue vigorously to pursue all paramilitary groups, whether they claim to be on ceasefire or not, if Northern Ireland's drug problem is to be arrested?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, not for the first time, I am in substantial agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Rogan. There is no justification for trying to draw a distinction between politically motivated crime in Northern Ireland at the present time and crime which is motivated by the usual criminal motive, which is greed. As I said in a previous answer, it is not possible to draw the line. We do the community a disservice by pretending differently.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord referred to the success achieved by the task force in just over a year of its operation.

In particular, with regard to community policing, how is it endeavouring to deal with the kind of violent demonstrations that occurred yesterday in both Belfast and south Armagh?

It will be a longer haul to get cross-community acceptance that the new Police Service of <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, can the noble and learned Lord tell the House whether, in the context of community policing, we can be assured that there will be no giving way to Sinn Fein's demand that former paramilitaries should be allowed to represent the community in the new DPPs, the local community police organisations? It has been widely reported that that is what it wants. But that does not coincide in any way with the recommendations of the Patten report which specifically said that it would not recommend that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I know of the recommendation in the Patten report. I do not know of any plans to deviate from its conclusions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Harrison: </B>   My Lords, will my noble and learned friend say what preparations the Government are making to prevent organised crime from using the new euro notes and coins for nefarious purposes? Further, does he agree that if the euro is useful for criminals, why cannot the rest of us use it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, we shall adopt exactly the same stratagems and policies to deal with euro-crime in Northern Ireland as in the rest of the United Kingdom. Many commercial organisations in this country are quite happy to use the euro following 1st January. If the noble Lord has any francs left, he needs to change them before 17th January.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord agree that the historic reasons for disaffection and disengagement from the institutions in Northern Ireland&#151;not least from the Royal Ulster Constabulary but also from the civic institutions&#151;and the motives for boycott and disengagement have been removed by the creation of these new policing arrangements and civic institutions? We need to be far more proactive in promoting, especially within the nationalist community, reasons for engagement and involvement.
<P>

<a name="11210-03_para0"></a>Further, can the noble and learned Lord tell us what is being done to encourage young nationalists to think about a career in the Northern Ireland Police Service?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, that is an extremely important point. It is gratifying that the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church has positively encouraged members of that faith community to come forward. The SDLP has done the same. It is legitimate for us to say, XWhere are you?" to Sinn Fein. The recent intake, as the noble Lord will know, will be 50 per cent from the Roman Catholic community and 50 per cent from the non-Roman Catholic community. They should be trained and fully operational by early next year.

<FONT SIZE=3>States. I went with a senior group of police officers from Northern Ireland and members of the new policing board to look at community policing. Does the Minister agree that community policing is a sexy term? Everywhere we went community policing was put forward as being the answer to problems. Yet we never heard exactly what was meant by community policing. I prefer to call it community-orientated policing because in Northern Ireland Xcommunity policing" meant the soft side of policing. If this becomes part of the Government's policy I am fearful that policing will not be seen in real terms.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-03_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure that community-orientated policing is any more or less sexy than other community policing. If one has a description for any form of activity, the more often it is used the more it tends to become jargon. There are many models in England and Wales where community policing has been extremely effective. I take the point of the noble Baroness, Lady Blood, that one cannot just take two words&#151;community policing&#151;and regard those as a panacea for all ills. As I said earlier in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Smith, it will be a very long haul in Northern Ireland to overcome many generations of fear and suspicion.

<a name="11210-04_para5"></a>Clause 111 [Implementation of the third pillar]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean </B>   moved Amendment No. 77ZA: 
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 66, line 5, at beginning insert XAt any time before 1st July 2002,"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-04_para6"></a><P>

<a name="11210-04_para7"></a> The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in Committee, I undertook on behalf of the Government further to consider the serious concern raised by many of your Lordships about the justice and home affairs enabling power set out in Clauses 111 and 112. It was clear to the Government that the power had raised a genuine and deeply felt concern&#151;mainly over the scope of the third pillar measures that could, in theory, be implemented through secondary legislation under such a power.
<P>

<a name="11210-04_para8"></a>For example, the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, was concerned that legislation on racism and xenophobia could be adopted in that way. No measures in the European Union's terrorism road map adopted on 20th September contain provisions against xenophobia. As the noble Lord pointed out, such provisions might arise in relation to third pillar legislation, but not under the powers in the amendments.
<P>

<a name="11210-04_para9"></a>Other noble Lords, especially the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, whom I do not see in his place, were concerned that the enabling power could be used to enact the European arrest warrant, which is due to be agreed at the Laeken European Council this week. The House will be aware that several issues are to be negotiated before the European arrest warrant can be adopted, but the Government have made absolutely clear that we have no intention of implementing it through the enabling power.
<P>

<a name="11210-04_para10"></a>The Government remain of the view that it is right to seek that power. Measures agreed by the JHA Council of the European Union make a significant contribution to the fight against terrorism. We must be able to implement them swiftly. We remain of the view that it is right to introduce such measures, which are, after all, binding agreements made at European level through secondary legislation. But we recognise that the power would be a new method of dealing with business in that area, which must be considered seriously. We have also carefully considered the views expressed by your Lordships.
<P>

<a name="11210-04_para11"></a>We therefore propose two key amendments to address the concerns that have been raised. The first is Amendment No. 77ZA. That ensures that the power will run for six months only, until the end of June. That period will allow us to implement the key measures contained in the European Union's anti-terrorism road map. However, I want to be absolutely clear to the House that we will look for a suitable legislative vehicle before that period is complete by which to return to the issue.
<P>

<a name="11210-04_para12"></a>The second key change is contained in Amendment No. 78, which sets out in absolutely clear and precise terms what we intend to use the power to implement. I hope that that will allay your Lordships' fears and enable all&#151;or most&#151;of your Lordships to support the measures. The measures covered by the amendment <P>


<a name="column_1143"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1143</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are part of the European Union's road map on terrorism, agreed by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 20th September and endorsed by the European Council on 21st September. We should be absolutely clear that that constitutes Europe's response to the terrorism outrages of 11th September.
<P>

<a name="11210-04_para13"></a>The measures include, first, the framework decision on asset freezing. For a specified list of offences, including terrorism, that measure allows orders to be enforced in the minimum possible time. The rapid execution of freezing orders could be vital in securing terrorist assets that might otherwise be dissipated or destroyed. It may therefore make the difference between, on the one hand, securing a conviction or freezing terrorist assets and, on the other, allowing terrorists and their money to go free.
<P>

<a name="11210-04_para14"></a>The second measure is the European Union framework decision on combating terrorism. That will introduce common definitions of terrorism offences and minimum penalties across the EU. That framework decision constitutes progress, but let us be under no illusion that it is sufficient on its own. More needs to be done.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-04_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for giving way. She could materially assist her case were she able to give the House one further assurance: that the Government have no plans to introduce between now and 1st July 2002 the proposal in the White Paper on House of Lords reform that this House should lose the power to reject statutory instruments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-04_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl will not be surprised to know that I cannot give an assurance of that nature. If I may finish the points that I wish to make, the noble Earl may find that I can give the House many assurances. I recognise his point&#151;it was made when your Lordships last discussed the matter&#151;but I cannot give that specific assurance now.
<P>

<a name="11210-04_para15"></a>To return to the second measure, the European framework decision on combating terrorism, I said that we felt that more needs to be done on the matter.
<P>

<a name="11210-04_para16"></a>The third measure is the European framework decision on setting up joint investigative teams to fight organised crime, especially terrorism, drug trafficking and trafficking in human beings. That will provide the framework for police officers across Europe to work together against terrorism and organised crime. The power will also be used to implement the 1995 and 1996 conventions related to extradition between member states.
<P>

<a name="11210-04_para17"></a>I hope that that will allay fears that the Government will use the power to implement measures that have nothing to do with terrorism&#151;one point that exercised many of your Lordships when we discussed the matter last week. One thing that we have learnt since 11th September is that we still have a great deal more to do&#151;often in areas that do not immediately and obviously appear to do with combating terrorism. We need to be able to break down the barriers behind <P>


<a name="column_1144"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1144</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which terrorists hide: bureaucratic delays in executing court orders; procedural barriers that stop effective police co-operation; and bureaucratic delays that mean that by moving around Europe, a terrorist can always keep one step ahead of the law; nor can we allow ourselves to fall into the trap of tackling terrorism in isolation from the crimes off which it feeds. Drugs trafficking, arms dealing and the miserable trade in human beings, of which we are all too well aware, are all crimes that are inextricably linked to terrorism.
<P>

<a name="11210-04_para18"></a>So the power will not be used for measures against racism and xenophobia&#151;important though such measures may be; nor will it be used to implement the European arrest warrant&#151;essential though that is. These government amendments make no attempt at what has been described as Christmas tree anti-terrorism legislation; nor will the power remain on the statute book indefinitely; rather, it will be used for a strictly limited period to implement a strictly limited&#151;series of measures. We believe that it will be of great use in tackling terrorism across Europe.
<P>

<a name="11210-04_para19"></a>I turn to the two amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt the Minister. Before she moves on, I had the impression&#151;which was shared by several of my noble friends&#151;that she mentioned Amendment No. 78, which is tabled in my name. I should be interested to know whether she was actually referring to that amendment, and if so, what she said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-04_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, forgive me if I misspoke, but the amendment that I meant to mention was Amendment No. 78A standing in the name of my noble friend Lord Rooker.
<P>

<a name="11210-04_para20"></a>I shall now address Amendments Nos. 77BB and 77CB standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. I assure your Lordships that we shall not between Royal Assent and the date of the sunset clause&#151;30th June&#151;specified in Amendment No. 77ZA introduce measures further to those listed in subsection (1A) by any means other than primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="11210-04_para21"></a>I hope that I have been able to put some substance behind the arguments that I put to your Lordships last week. We are not trying, as I think that one of your Lordships put it last week, to Xsmuggle through" additional provisions that might not have a direct relationship to terrorism over and above the ones that we feel that we need. I hope that I have been clear in saying that we shall have to return to the issue. Nevertheless, we feel that the Government have listened very carefully to what has been said in your Lordships' House, and that we have now introduced amendments that I hope and believe will address the very substantial issues that we discussed last week. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Baroness for setting out this latest group of amendments, which we on this side of the House have examined with very great interest and care. I should say straightaway, in answer to her more general remarks, that we are united with the Government in seeking enactment of effective legislation against terrorism. We are not, however, united or enthusiastic when it comes to measures and powers that we believe have very little or nothing to do with terrorism. We are even less enthusiastic when it comes to measures in relation to which there would be completely inadequate or almost non-existent parliamentary accountability. That is our starting point in considering the amendments.
<P>

<a name="11210-05_para0"></a>I confess that it was with a modest amount of relief that I watched the amendments coming out of my fax machine late on Friday night, which was perhaps a little late in the day. The amendments did, however, envisage a change of heart to some degree by the Government. Nevertheless, we on these Benches would like to probe a little further, to gain the reassurance that the Government mean what they say.
<P>

<a name="11210-05_para1"></a>The proposal on a six-month cut-off date seems to be clear enough. As for the issues in Amendment No. 78A, however, we must yet again seek assurances. I have heard everything that the noble Baroness has said, and we welcome what I understand to be a firm undertaking that the European arrest warrants project will be dealt with in future, proper primary legislation&#151;possibly in an extradition Bill, if there is one, although it does not seem to be having a very happy start. If there is such legislation, it will be handled in that manner. Whether such an arrangement would be adequate parliamentary involvement is for another debate at another time&#151;personally, I do not think that it would be&#151;but at least it is not being proposed that such provision should be pushed through by this Bill's provisions and the move to secondary legislation. None the less, may we be assured beyond peradventure that that matter will be dealt with in that manner, and that we shall not find in a few months that the position has changed?
<P>

<a name="11210-05_para2"></a>If these new amendments are now the Government's proposals, we would like to be reassured that paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) in Amendment No. 78A will be the only proposals in the pipeline between now and next June and that no other matters or framework decisions will suddenly appear from nowhere. We would like an assurance that we are dealing only with these two matters and with the framework decision on,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xthe execution in the European Union of orders freezing property or evidence, on joint investigation teams, or on combating terrorism".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-05_para3"></a>
Although that provision sounds a little broad, may we be assured that it will not be a holdall or a loophole for a whole lot of other measures?
<P>

<a name="11210-05_para4"></a> We seek those key assurances, which I think that we have already been given by the noble Baroness. However, I would like her to confirm them in her reply, after my noble friends and other noble Lords have spoken to this group of amendments.
<P>


<a name="column_1146"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1146</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-05_para5"></a>I confess that we are still left with considerable unease about this whole episode. Moreover, as the old saw goes, nothing lasts like the provisional: this legislation is provisional, but how long will it last, and what will be the arguments next June? We also face the forthcoming debate on EU arrest warrants. I note that it is now being proposed that, if Italy will not play ball, that proposal should be achieved by the process of enhanced co-operation, as authorised in the not-yet-ratified Treaty of Nice. I do not know how that process will work, but we shall have to debate it later.
<P>

<a name="11210-05_para6"></a>It would still not be entirely satisfactory even if these truly sensitive matters of policing and criminal justice were dealt with in future, after June, in primary legislation. As my noble friend Lord Kingsland said in last week's debates, and as the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Select Committee suggests in its superb report, regardless of whether those decisions are made in primary or secondary legislation, they are reached virtually irrevocably by a type of prerogative treaty process.
<P>

<a name="11210-05_para7"></a>In theory, this Parliament decides yes or no on those matters, and, as the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, said, if it is primary legislation, there can also be small changes to them. In practice, however, the whole thing is dumped on our Parliament. The process is inconsistent with the aim that Ministers and the Prime Minister have repeatedly stated, that we need to bring national parliaments more closely into the process not only of legislation, but of pre-legislation and decision making. I think that it was the noble Lord, Lord Garel-Jones, who, last week in Committee, said that inter-governmental third pillar measures should be decided by parliaments. That is not happening. It is not really happening even in relation to primary legislation, and it is certainly not happening in relation to secondary legislation.
<P>

<a name="11210-05_para8"></a>Let us hope that my interpretation of the Government's proposals is the correct one. We shall need absolutely firm reassurances from the noble Baroness&#151;perhaps the Attorney-General should give us these cast-iron assurances&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-05_spnew1"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   No!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   Perhaps I shall be lucky. I am very glad to see the Attorney-General on the Bench; it gives me some reassurance. We shall need those cast-iron reassurances. When we have heard them we shall be able to take a final position on how we view the Government's amendments and how we view our own amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches have two major concerns about Clause 111, the first of which is on scope, and the second on timing. This terrorism legislation is being pushed through as an emergency measure. We wish therefore to insist that it does deal only with terrorism and that it is limited to the immediate emergency. It seems that the amendments that the Government have now offered meet those concerns.
<P>


<a name="column_1147"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1147</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-05_para9"></a>We were also concerned that the Government should not attempt at any later stage to expand for any reason whatsoever the interpretation of the narrow scope that is now spelled out in the amendments. That was the purpose of Amendments Nos. 77BB and 77CB tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. Consequently, we shall not be moving those amendments, nor Amendments Nos. 77A, 77B and 77C.
<P>

<a name="11210-05_para10"></a> We thank the Government for those concessions and for Friday's negotiations. That seemed to us a model way to use our time to consider the Bill in Committee and on Report. The purpose of the Committee stage is indeed to examine and discuss each clause in detail, and the purpose of the Report stage is to consider what concessions the Government are willing to make, and if necessary to vote.
<P>

<a name="11210-05_para11"></a>That is the proper role of Parliament and it does not help if some among the Government describe the proper role of this House in terms of sabotage by naive, silly, aristocratic people. Some of us do not think that we are particularly aristocratic when it comes to it. We need reasoned debate on Bills of this complexity in which we ask the Government to justify their proposals and we do our job in holding up their proposals to careful scrutiny. Sadly, on this occasion, the other place failed to fulfil that role and it has therefore fallen to this Chamber to fulfil much more of it in its turn. When it comes to discussing further the reform of the House of Lords, it is clear that we shall have to discuss the reform of the House of Commons, too.
<P>

<a name="11210-05_para12"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, referred to the Prime Minister's declared intention to increase the role of national parliaments, which he has repeated on a number of occasions. As originally proposed, the amendment would have decreased the role of national parliaments. We on these Benches have much to be unhappy about in respect of the third pillar. Much of what is now under the third pillar we would be happier to move into the first pillar, because apart from anything else it provides a proper lengthy process through which proposed legislation moves.
<P>

<a name="11210-05_para13"></a>When I was chairman of Sub-Committee F there were a number of occasions on which third pillar proposals moved remarkably rapidly from initial proposal through to acceptance because no careful block clauses occurred under the first pillar. The position was made a good deal more obscure by the British Government's declared opting out from the Schengen convention and subsequent opting in to a great many of the clauses under it. That may confuse the Daily Mail and it certainly confuses many of us within this House.
<P>

<a name="11210-05_para14"></a>Having said that, however, we accept this useful clarification. We accept the careful, further assurances which the Minister gave in her opening speech on the meaning and intent of the clause. Therefore, we do not wish to move our amendments and will accept the clause.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-05_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Bledisloe: </B>   My Lords, at this and earlier stages I have tabled amendments to delete Clauses 111 and 112 in their entirety. I want to welcome with perhaps greater warmth and enthusiasm than the noble Lord, Lord Howell, could express, the care and trouble the Government have taken to meet our concerns in their amendments. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, that that is a most satisfactory conclusion to the proceedings of this House.
<P>

<a name="11210-05_para15"></a>I want to ask only two questions. First, is it entirely clear from what the Minister said that the power will be used only to implement those measures which are already contained in the European Union road map on terrorism? Secondly, I want to ask the Government a little more about the European arrest warrant. I gather that last week the passage of that was defeated or delayed by the intervention or participation of the Italians. Without in any way making any form of racist remark, it is perhaps a sorry day that the British people have to look for the protection of their liberties to the Italian Government and not to their own Government.
<P>

<a name="11210-05_para16"></a>Notwithstanding that defeat, why are the Government so keen to press ahead so quickly with a measure which is still under scrutiny by the Select Committees of both Houses of Parliament and has not been released and on which this House has already expressed its enormous concerns? It has nothing to do with the fight against terrorism and would be much better considered at proper length and with proper care. Why can that not wait?

<P>
<A NAME="11210-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Alexander of Weedon: </B>   My Lords, my interest in the amendment is as chair of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform. It had immense reservations about the original proposals; in fact, reservations as strong as it had on any issue in the almost seven years during which I have chaired it. I welcome the amendments, particularly in so far as they limit considerably the scope of the application to introduce third pillar measures by secondary legislation and have a tight sunset clause.
<P>

<a name="11210-06_para0"></a>However, in welcoming them, perhaps I may say a few words about the principles. They are important and they will be important when the issue is considered again, as the Minister has said it will be, in a comparatively short time-scale. Furthermore, the committee was, as always, assisted by the careful and open memorandum put forward by the Government and their response to our report. That enables me to say with some confidence that with the help of the memorandum I hope that there is total agreement that the third pillar powers are potentially wide-ranging enabling powers, many of which have still to be exercised in ways of which we in the House are totally uncertain.
<P>

<a name="11210-06_para1"></a> Secondly, they cover the extremely sensitive areas of policing and criminal justice. They create the potential for new offences to be introduced into our domestic law by agreement at ministerial level and punishable by very significant terms of imprisonment. That would <P>


<a name="column_1149"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1149</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be a novelty in our law where serious criminal offences have always been introduced by primary legislation. The Government memorandum very fairly makes clear that such regulations to implement third pillar measures would often require the amendment of existing primary legislation. In other words, there would be frequent use of Henry VIII powers across a potentially broad front. If at some stage in the future we adopted what we were initially invited to adopt, the only limit would be that we were accepting whatever fell within the broad perimeters of the third pillar.
<P>

<a name="11210-06_para2"></a>The Government's justification, which they set out for us, was the principal one; that the European Communities Act 1972 provided a similar method of legislation in regard to directives introduced within what was then the European Community. It was, in other words, by secondary legislation. The Select Committee's report pointed out that there were very significant points of difference. The first was that the 1972 Act considered social and economic measures. It did not concern itself with policing and criminal justice which are often critically concerned with the liberties of individuals.
<P>

<a name="11210-06_para3"></a>The second point of difference was that the European Communities Act deliberately limited itself to permitting the introduction of offences in the areas in which it was operating punishable by imprisonment of up to two years. Not so the scope of the present proposals, which provide for a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment.
<P>

<a name="11210-06_para4"></a>The third point of distinction is that there is less democratic control over third pillar measures. European Union measures under the first pillar go to the European Parliament, with co-decision powers with the Council of Ministers, and so have a measure of democratic control. By contrast, the third pillar is simply an agreement between Ministers and there is no such control.
<P>

<a name="11210-06_para5"></a>The Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform recognised that some measures introduced under the third pillar might be of less importance than others. We suggested that in properly drafted legislation there would be included a schedule of those measures, principally procedurally, which could be incorporated into our law by secondary legislation, and a clear exclusion of other more important measures. In his response to the Committee's report the Minister fairly recognised that point. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XThe Government is satisfied, therefore, that the enabling power can be justified as part of the Government's emergency proposals. We recognise that it will be used to implement important measures and that if the Government was bringing them forward as purely national measures this would be effected by primary legislation. These measures are not, however, purely national measures. Third Pillar measures are EU level measures that are binding on the UK and have to be implemented".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-06_para6"></a><P>

<a name="11210-06_para7"></a>That appeared to be the case in principle for implementation by secondary legislation. I do not follow that. If such matters are important enough to require parliamentary scrutiny, surely they are <P>


<a name="column_1150"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1150</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>important enough to require the same level of parliamentary scrutiny as is given to other important measures in our domestic law.
<P>

<a name="11210-06_para8"></a> I accept that this point will not call for further discussion on the amendment before us today, but as we shall have to return to it at a later stage, I alert the Government and the House to what I believe will be fundamental issues of principle. I would like to see pre-legislative scrutiny so that the measures can be thought through properly.
<P>

<a name="11210-06_para9"></a>With that comment on the original proposals and hoping to be constructive for the future, I welcome the way in which the Government have responded to the Committee's report and the concerns of the House, and the way in which they have brought forward these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, I am glad that the Government have gone a considerable way towards meeting the concerns expressed by so many noble Lords. My noble friend Lord Alexander of Weedon referred to the fact that the European Communities Act 1972 allowed the creation of new offences, but new offences that carry a term of imprisonment of not more than two years. Noble Lords were concerned that Clause 111 or Clause 112 allowed the creation of offences carrying unlimited terms of imprisonment.
<P>

<a name="11210-06_para10"></a>I would like elucidation on one outstanding matter.
 Amendment No. 78A (1A)(c) makes reference to measures Xcombating terrorism". Even after the Government's amendments and after the considerable distance that they have gone to meet the concerns expressed, Amendment No. 78A would still allow, in theory, the creation by secondary legislation of new offences that would carry unlimited terms of imprisonment. If that is so, will my fears be allayed by the Government telling me that, although that is the case under Amendment No. 78A, there is nothing in the roadmap that will result in the creation of new offences carrying unlimited terms of imprisonment before next June?
<P>

<a name="11210-06_para11"></a>It is extremely important that that matter is cleared up. If this amendment allows, and if the roadmap still allows, the creation of offences carrying unlimited terms of imprisonment, the point made by my noble friend Lord Alexander of Weedon is underlined. We are treading on dangerous territory and creating dangerous precedents&#151;we may say that we have moved on from the 1972 Act&#151;if we now seriously consider that it is correct for a government to create new offences that carry unlimited terms of imprisonment by delegated legislation. I believe that that would be a serious departure from the way in which we have always made law in this Parliament.

<P>
<A NAME="11210-06_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, I genuinely thank the Government for moving a long way towards understanding the concerns raised by noble Lords on all sides of the House. I know that it was a hard decision for Mr Blunkett. He made noises about an <P>


<a name="column_1151"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1151</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unelected House and he was especially rude about people like myself whom he has recently allowed to continue to be Members of this House.
<P>

<a name="11210-06_para12"></a>What offences do the Government have in mind to bring in under these powers? We produced a terrorism Act after Omagh; we produced a terrorism Act in 2000 and we are dashing through a terrorism Act now. Against our will we are giving the Government powers to bring in new offences under the European aegis. What offences do the Government intend to introduce? Can the House be given some indication what new offences will be produced under this plan?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-06_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the Minister can clarify a point about which I have asked a question before. I welcome the concession of a sunset clause that allows us to review our position in six months' time, but what will be the status of whatever we agree at Laeken. Suppose at Laeken we say, XWe agree with this, but we would like to think about it again in six months' time", but the EU says, XNo, this is an EU decision that is reached jointly and it cannot be rescinded". My understanding is that we cannot rescind EU legislation once it has been agreed.
<P>

<a name="11210-06_para13"></a>I refer the Minister to Clause 18(4) which allows the Secretary of State not to disclose information to a public authority abroad. He is restricted in his powers to this extent:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XA direction under this section shall not have the effect of prohibiting . . . the making of any disclosure in pursuance of a Community obligation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-06_para14"></a>
Shall we be undertaking obligations which cannot be rescinded even though, after six months' experience, we decide we do not want to go along with them? I cannot believe that we are free to make a community decision and to go back on it six months later. I shall be delighted to be reassured that my concerns are baseless.
<P>

<a name="11210-06_para15"></a>Can the Minister also tell the House whether methods of combating terrorism, as listed by the noble Baroness, include the proposals for Europol, about which I have inquired several times?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Brennan: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that I speak for many noble Lords on this side of the House in welcoming these amendments put forward by the Minister. They seek to meet a genuine concern, which is a simple one to express. Our tradition of democracy in this country is that serious criminal law is enacted by the people's elected representatives through primary legislation. Clauses 110 and 111, as they were, sought to introduce on their face an apparent extension of government powers at the cost of that tradition. I say Xapparent" because it is clear from the government amendments tabled today that they recognise the concern and have chosen to act to remedy it. The concern will not go away. As the noble Lord, Lord Alexander of Weedon, made clear, this is a constitutional matter of great importance on which I can reflect simply.
<P>

<a name="11210-06_para16"></a>A decision by the Council of Ministers on serious criminal law affecting the Community may be the result of unanimity. That is numerically impressive but <P>


<a name="column_1152"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1152</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it is not thereby endowed with democratic virtue. The virtue of criminal law enacted by the people's representatives is that it commands the respect of the people. I am sure we shall return to that debate; today is not the occasion for it.
<P>

<a name="11210-06_para17"></a>I welcome the refocusing of this use of European law to combat terrorism in its four objectives. I said at Second Reading that the freezing of assets was a critically important method of combating terrorism. Secondly, the framework decision which the Council of Ministers has been agreeing seeks to implement that to which we as a nation have already committed ourselves, in spirit if not in letter, in the various conventions of the United Nations to combat terrorism. Thirdly, on extradition, it is, to put it mildly, totally unsatisfactory that an extradition hearing in our country can drag on for three or four years before the person is extradited. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, there is the need to have the investigative forces liaising in this campaign.
<P>

<a name="11210-06_para18"></a>My congratulations on the good sense of these amendments are coupled with a practical question. We have debated the constitutional significance of these clauses. We were told that they were being implemented because action was necessary. With regard to each of those four objectives, when can we expect secondary legislation&#151;I am sure we shall readily endorse it&#151;to aid in the fight against terrorism?
<P>

<a name="11210-06_para19"></a>I close by noting again&#151;I did so at Second Reading&#151;the good sense of the opinion expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, that the passing of legislation of this kind in an emergency meets the objective of the security of the people but must also meet the objective of protecting democracy. The public will forget quickly the political spats about these amendments. What they will want to remember is whether Parliament passed legislation that commanded the confidence of the country. It is by accepting concerns and putting forward these amendments that they command that confidence. I heartily endorse the amendments.

<A NAME="11210-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, I wish briefly to welcome the amendments brought forward by the Government. I am not sure whether they go far enough. But I am certain of this. They have already altered the climate in which we discuss important issues, and that makes a major difference. I echo the points made by my noble friend Lady Park of Monmouth. What is the standing and worth of decisions which will now be made under these powers and before the sun sets on them? I have been concerned throughout the debates by the apparent tendency&#151;I accept what the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said at Second Reading&#151;to ignore the powerful opinions and advice offered by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. The opinions of that committee do not seem to have been fully digested by Ministers in another place. That committee commands huge respect. I am sure that I speak for the whole House when I say how grateful I feel to my noble friend Lord Alexander of Weedon for what he has <P>


<a name="column_1153"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1153</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>done in the past and for what he said today. His contribution has been important in bringing about an improved climate.
<P>

<a name="11210-07_para0"></a>I find puzzling and disappointing some of the remarks the Home Secretary is reported to have made during the passage of the Bill. I have great respect for the Home Secretary. He seems to be one of those people, rather rare in our time, who says what he thinks and means without bothering about a disagreeable, odious veneer of political respectability. However, there seem to be times when he goes dangerously far. I wonder whether some his colleagues who are Ministers in your Lordships' House might play a small part in persuading the Home Secretary that the large and massive votes of last Thursday were not brought about by energetic powerful whipping. That is a somewhat self-defeating exercise in your Lordships' House and it certainly did not have any effect on the results of the Divisions last Thursday. Nor was it the result of any forgetfulness of the horror of the events of September 11th. No one in your Lordships' House does not have those events fresh in his or her memory; nor would he or she be influenced into forgetting the appalling shock which those events gave to the whole civilised world.
<P>

<a name="11210-07_para1"></a>I add only one comment and do so with some caution. The Home Secretary should not attribute those massive majorities on Thursday to any sudden uprush of love and admiration between the various Opposition parties in your Lordships' House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-07_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Howell has been accused of not being perhaps 100 per cent enthusiastic about all the government amendments to this part of the Bill. My experience is that governments are at their trickiest when they have just discovered that they are wrong. On this part of the Bill, I believe that they were most wrong of all.
<P>

<a name="11210-07_para2"></a>We welcome very much what the Government have done. Watching a television programme yesterday lunchtime I was lost in admiration for the endurance and enthusiasm of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker. He did extremely well, busily convincing the public that the Government were doing the most wonderful thing. They have done a lot, but we shall have to wait for six months to decide how third pillar business will be implemented in this country. My noble friend Lord Alexander of Weedon&#151;he is chairman of the Select Committee and I am a member&#151;identified again the issues for your Lordships. However, in six months' time we shall have to decide in Parliament the difference between matters coming under the third pillar which are extremely urgent because of counter-terrorism activity and what the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, described, in a most remarkable speech, as serious law.
<P>

<a name="11210-07_para3"></a>I wonder whether it would be possible on each occasion for Parliament to decide on a Motion whether or not business could be treated in secondary legislation. It may be that the kind of schedule the Minister foresaw will do the trick, but it will be very <P>


<a name="column_1154"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1154</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>difficult to decide. As she has said, the line between that which is purely a terrorist matter and that which is not is very thin indeed. It may be that there is a more solid way than simply a schedule that may or may not stand the pace over the years. We are grateful, however, for what the Minister has done.
<P>

<a name="11210-07_para4"></a>My noble friend Lord Peyton is a little unkind when he says that the Minister took a long time to say that he would do something. He did say it right at the beginning in this House and, to be fair to the Government, because of the timing the House of Commons did not have a chance to look at the committee's report when they discussed the matter. They have responded as best they can. Had they not been in such a rush, they could have done it all now and not in six months. Nevertheless, I welcome what they have said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, the reputation of this House will not in the end depend on what people, however distinguished, say about it from outside, nor indeed what we say about ourselves today. It will depend on the work we do today and the result which it produces.
<P>

<a name="11210-07_para5"></a>Unlike my noble friend Lady Park, I believe that the purpose of the amendment is to allow the Minister to make regulations which will be permanent for six months. They will remain permanent, and the temporary nature relates merely to the window of time in which he can make changes. The statutory instruments that come before us in the next six months will therefore be of critical importance. I am relieved to see that they are at least under the affirmative procedure, so that we shall have to consider each as it comes through. They may come rather thick and fast, because the Government have only a little time in which to act. It is reassuring, however, because it means that afterthoughts cannot be dragged in after the six months are up.
<P>

<a name="11210-07_para6"></a> The second limb of the amendment limits not the time but the scope to the three things listed in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). My eye has fallen with some alarm, as it did with my noble friends Lord Howell and Lord Waddington, on the very last words of the very last paragraph, Xor on combating terrorism". It strikes me as a very extensive catch-all phrase, particularly as the Government have said countless times that one cannot distinguish between terrorist crime and other crime. Given the definition used for this subject, those words embrace almost any form of criminal activity, provided it is within the third pillar.
<P>

<a name="11210-07_para7"></a>There is some odd terminology before us. There is something called a road map, which I understand is a list of the things being considered under the third pillar at present and which may be brought forward. I shall listen with very great care to what the noble Baroness says in reply to my both of my noble friends, to her explanation of what is caught by this phrase, and what the Government will therefore be enabled to enact by secondary legislation.
<P>


<a name="column_1155"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1155</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-07_para8"></a>Secondary legislation cannot be amended. To throw it out would be a very drastic move, and we will not be able to temper what the Government propose by secondary legislation if we think it goes too far. We will only be able to refuse it or accept it. This definition is therefore of considerable importance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, I would prefer that Clauses 111 and 112 were not in the Bill at all. Having said that, however, I appreciate that the Government have come a long way in meeting the concerns which were rightly expressed in Committee in this House.
<P>

<a name="11210-07_para9"></a>What concerns me most is that, had this House not had the time and the ability to scrutinise it, the legislation would have gone through. It is a matter of concern that a Bill containing 126 clauses should be sent to this House without most of them having been properly considered. It is no good the Home Secretary or any other Cabinet Minister complaining about this House, when it has done its job&#151;a job which should have been done by the House of Commons in the first place, it having been elected to do so. It is entirely reprehensible that an elected House of Commons should have less concern than this House for the freedoms and the rights of the people of this country.
<P>

<a name="11210-07_para10"></a>I believe that Mr Blunkett is doing a good job, is speaking his mind, guiding people along a road of less political correctness. However, he has to understand that, unless the House of Commons does its job, this House has to spend a great deal more time on the Bill&#151;more than three times as much&#151;and has to do the job for it.
<P>

<a name="11210-07_para11"></a>I think that I speak for most members when I say that we would prefer to be at home in our beds than sitting here at one or two o'clock in the morning, doing a job for which the other people along the corridor are properly paid.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may press the Minister to confirm beyond doubt that any provisions arising from the exercise of Article 31 will require unanimity in Brussels. I say that because Article 31, as it stands in Title VI of the Treaty and on its own, contains no reference to whether the provisions under it will be reached by unanimity or qualified majority voting.
<P>

<a name="11210-07_para12"></a>The article is controlled by Article 24 of the TEU, which the Government now wisely wish to leave out of the Bill, but Article 24 is itself amended by the Treaty of Nice from unanimity to qualified majority voting, if that treaty is to be ratified.
<P>

<a name="11210-07_para13"></a>Article 34 is clearer and does appear to come under unanimity. Article 31, standing on its own as it now does, is silent on the matter and it would be very helpful to have confirmation from the noble Baroness that these new provisions will require unanimity in Brussels before they are brought here by regulations.

<a name="column_1156"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1156</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>say probably not quite so united in enthusiasm for the amendments which Her Majesty's Government have brought forward.
<P>

<a name="11210-08_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, said that the six months sunset clause was clear, and I hope that is clearly set out in Amendment No. 77ZA. Although I am not a lawyer, I believe that I am in a position to assure the noble Lord that the European arrest warrant legislation will not be brought under this Bill. Indeed, we have made it clear that it never would be. It now cannot be brought under this Bill, because of Amendment No. 78A. Even if we had wanted to&#151;which we did not&#151;we now cannot. I hope that that has closed off a line of argument which perhaps has occupied your Lordships rather more than it should have done. It will be dealt with through separate primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="11210-08_para1"></a>I turn to the points raised in regard to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) set out in Amendment No. 78A. The noble Lord asked whether any further proposals were in the pipeline. I should say that I do not know what will happen over the coming six months; that is, whether we shall see a further terrorist outrage or an incident that might prompt further emergency legislation. Sadly, we live in such times. However, I have given a specific assurance in relation to the Liberal Democrat amendment that Her Majesty's Government would not seek to bring forward through secondary legislation any further baubles, so to speak, to add to the Christmas tree following the passage of the Bill through this House. I hope that that point is clear. Any further action that needed to be taken would be dealt with through primary legislation, excepting those matters covered by subsection (1A), which we have already discussed in relation to the Liberal Democrat amendment.
<P>

<a name="11210-08_para2"></a>I was grateful for what was said by the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe. I believe that the Government have listened carefully to the exchanges in Committee. That stage is for the purpose of detailed and reasonable discussion. On this occasion, I believe that the House discharged that function in an exemplary manner.
<P>

<a name="11210-08_para3"></a>Perhaps I may move on to the second point raised by the noble Viscount in relation to the Italian position. It is a fact that Her Majesty's Government disagree with the position adopted last week by the Italian Government. I should tell the noble Viscount that every other member state also disagrees. We shall need to discuss this further at Laeken where we very much hope to reach agreement.
<P>

<a name="11210-08_para4"></a>Italy's position has made clear a very important point; namely, that decisions are taken by member states not, as many noble Lords fear from time to time, by the Commission or by the European Parliament. It is important that such decisions ultimately rest with member states themselves.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Baroness leaves the matter of the European arrest warrant, when primary legislation is brought before this Parliament, can she tell the House whether <P>


<a name="column_1157"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1157</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we will be able to amend what may have been agreed at Laeken or wherever? Alternatively, is it the case that once Ministers have agreed the new European arrest warrant in Laeken or Brussels, our powers to amend it will be negligible?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-08_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I cannot say that we shall be able to amend the powers of the European arrest warrant. As is the case when discussing other European treaty matters, I believe that we shall need to look at a treaty and consider whether noble Lords feel able to agree with it and, similarly, whether another place feels able to agree. The legislation will be dealt with in a way that is familiar to noble Lords.
<P>

<a name="11210-08_para5"></a>Perhaps I may move on. The noble Lord, Lord Waddington, raised a number of points relating to the two-year cut-off point for offences. Given our amendments, the reference to creating offences with a penalty of more than two years only in practice will apply to the framework decision on combating terrorism. Even in that case it is unlikely that we shall need to impose a cut-off point of more than two years because in most cases UK law will already have in place severe penalties for terrorism. We shall do the minimum required to implement the framework decision. We are looking in particular at the need to impose sentences over two years in relation to offences committed abroad which may not be covered by existing UK law. I hope, at least to some extent, that the position has been clarified for the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="11210-08_para6"></a>I was very grateful for the contribution made by the noble Lord, Lord Alexander of Weedon. I hope that the noble Lord will recognise that my noble friend Lord Rooker and I have asserted from the beginning that we recognise the well-argued reservations of the Delegated Powers Committee. My noble friend made that point clear in the debate on Second Reading and I hope that I did the same in Committee. I am also grateful to the noble Lord for alerting Her Majesty's Government to the fundamental matters of principle which were laid out in the report of the Delegated Powers Committee. I can assure the noble Lord that we wish to discuss this matter again with the committee before any further legislation is brought forward. I believe that one of the strengths of your Lordships' House is its capacity to undertake such tasks. We are grateful for the wisdom that the noble Lord's committee is able to bring to bear on such issues.
<P>

<a name="11210-08_para7"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, asked what we had in mind to bring forward under Amendment No. 78A. The 1995 and 1996 extradition conventions will simplify the extradition procedures between EU member states. The noble Earl may be interested to know that the United Kingdom is one of only five member states not to have implemented those conventions. That will have to be achieved through what I believe a noble Lord described as the Xwindow of opportunity" we shall have over the coming six <P>


<a name="column_1158"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>months. Indeed, secondary legislation on the extradition conventions will be brought forward next week.

<P>

<A NAME="11210-08_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, I believe that we are in danger of getting into a serious muddle. As I understand it, over the coming six months we shall have new primary extradition legislation. We have said that we shall not have the European-wide extradition warrant. Now we are saying that, yes, there will be a certain amount of extradition law introduced under this arrangement. Can the noble Baroness tell the House exactly what that will be? I am in a serious muddle over this and I hope that I am not unique.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-08_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the extradition conventions were agreed in 1995 and 1996 by the then Conservative Government. We have an obligation to bring forward those conventions by the end of this year. That may be seen as stepping through the window of opportunity created by the legislation over the coming six months. We have an obligation in respect of those two conventions to complete the process before the end of the year.
<P>

<a name="11210-08_para8"></a> The point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Park, concerned whether we would then be in a position to retreat from the legislation. It is the opportunity for taking such secondary legislation which would then close down as a result of the sunset clause, as was kindly pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Elton. However, the secondary legislation so created will not die with the sunset clause. I hope that that answers the point made by the noble Baroness and endorses the issue spotted by the noble Lord, Lord Elton. Furthermore, I hope that that answers the point put forward by the noble Earl.
<P>

<a name="11210-08_para9"></a>I turn now to the convention on mutual legal assistance which will enable us to provide video evidence. That will prove extremely useful if a witness is unwilling to travel or if we do not want such a witness to travel. It offers a clear advantage as regards expediting proceedings against terrorists either here or abroad. Furthermore, there are other issues as regards the framework decision on asset freezing. I hope that those three bundles of issues at least give the noble Earl an idea of the kinds of matters that we shall be bringing forward.
<P>

<a name="11210-08_para10"></a>I hope that I have responded to the points put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Park, in relation to the sunset clauses. They provide an opportunity to bring forward the secondary legislation that will close on 1st July of next year. Thereafter we would introduce further legislation. We would not turn our backs on secondary legislation that, it is hoped, will be created during the period between now and 1st July of next year.
<P>

<a name="11210-08_para11"></a>The noble Baroness also raised a point with regard to Europol. I have asked Home Office Ministers to write to the noble Baroness in answer to her question. Again, I shall return to the attack on behalf of the noble Baroness.

<a name="11210-08_para12"></a>I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, for the compliment she paid to my noble friend who, perhaps I may say, richly deserved it. As I indicated in response to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Alexander of Weedon, we shall consider carefully the robust points that were put forward in the report of the Delegated Powers Committee. I hope that we shall have an opportunity to discuss them.
<P>

<a name="11210-08_para13"></a>I hope that I have answered the substance of most of the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Elton. He went on to ask what constituted an act of terrorism. We have covered this ground in the past few weeks. Amendment No. 78A is specific on the sorts of issues that are covered, such as decisions on,

<P>

for acts of terrorism with which we are becoming all too dismally familiar. It is important, for example, that the placing of bombs&#151;sadly seen so recently&#151;is specifically covered as an act of terrorism.

<P>
<A NAME="11210-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   The phrase, Xcombating terrorism" at the end of proposed new subsection (1A)(c) continues to create a little unease. Can the Minister assure us that the enabling powers brought forward during this limited period will be confined to terrorism, or are the Government still mired in the difficulty that they cannot define where terrorism ends and other forms of crime begin, so that they cannot give undertakings on the matter?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   To some extent the noble Lord is right. We are talking about freezing property, evidence and other matters closely related to terrorism. That brings us back to the discussion we have been having in the past few days. Her Majesty's Government thought that it was right to have a broader definition so that we would not get into legalistic arguments. Your Lordships said that that was not satisfactory and would prefer something that was related to terrorism. So the Government sought to meet that point. The reference is to the Council framework declaration; that is all that the amendment is intended to be. The measure has been more narrowly drawn, as your Lordships wanted, but I freely acknowledge that there are a number of ways in which it could be interpreted. That is the crux of the argument we have been having in our debates.
<P>

<a name="11210-09_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, who is now in his place, raised another point. All the measures listed in Amendment No. 78A will be decided under Article 34, so they are subject to unanimity. I hope that that is a satisfactory answer.
<P>

<a name="11210-09_para1"></a> I appreciated the remarks of the noble Lords, Lord Peyton of Yeovil and Lord Stoddart of Swindon.

<FONT SIZE=3>threats involving dangerous substances. It offers as a penalty a maximum prison sentence of six months, a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or both on a summary conviction, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years, a fine, or both, on conviction on indictment. Clause 114 creates a new statutory offence in relation to hoaxes involving noxious substances, with equal penalties.
<P>

<a name="11210-09_para22"></a>These are suitable subjects to be included within the framework of legislation when dealing with modern terrorism. Presumably they are seen as providing strength to the statutory law of the United Kingdom. The problem for Scotland is that these activities are all capable of being regulated under the common law, and in this case under a charge of fraud or breach of the peace. The penalty for being found guilty under this offence is a maximum of life imprisonment or an unlimited fine.
<P>

<a name="11210-09_para23"></a>The common law is a far greater deterrent, and unless the Government feel that terrorists in Scotland should be dealt with more leniently than at present, I submit that these amendments are required. The other irony of the situation may be that statistically one might find a larger number of people angling to be charged as terrorists after a rowdy night out in Scotland because they feel assured that there is a fairly low penalty if they are found guilty. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-09_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   The Law Society of Scotland is probably right. I imagine that the drafting needs some attention as I think that there needs to be a consequential amendment to Clause 126. I hope that the Government will accept the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-09_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   During the devolution debates, I stressed the value of devolution in giving Scots law, and Scots criminal law in particular, its own Parliament. I am therefore inclined to support the amendments proposed by the noble Duke, as this type of legislation would be better dealt with by the Scottish Parliament. Both offences can be classed as breaches of the peace and the almost unrestricted punishments would be more effective.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-09_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the Scottish Parliament debated and agreed the way forward proposed in the Bill on 15th November. To remove Scotland from the Bill in the way proposed would cause problems. The whole of the United Kingdom will be affected by those who use noxious substances to cause serious harm. The effects would be felt in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff as equally as they would be in London. Bearing in mind that the Scottish Executive has agreed the policy, which was agreed by the Scottish Parliament after the debate on 15th November, I hope that noble Lords will think twice about pressing the amendments.

It is obvious that such cases must and should be caught by the offence. Amendment No. 82 seeks to clarify this by providing that the action need be only Xlikely" to have the effect.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="11210-10_para15"></a> The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 92A, which stands in the name of my noble friend Lord Rooker, I shall speak also to the other amendments in the group which relate to Part 5 of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="11210-10_para16"></a>The effect of Amendments Nos. 93 to 98 would be to remove a substantial part of Part 5 from the Bill. I shall recap, first, why the Government sought to introduce Part 5, recognising as I do so that, by not moving Amendments Nos. 91 and 92, it is accepted in the House that at least part of what the Government have done is acceptable.
<P>

<a name="11210-10_para17"></a>Some noble Lords previously suggested that Part 5 had nothing to do with 11th September and that it was not a measure in response to those events. But we cannot and should not forget that ordinary people in our streets face hatred and harassment because others hold misguided prejudices about their beliefs. At the weekend, the Guardian outlined some individual cases: the Muslim schoolteacher, in a headscarf, who was asked on a Manchester train, XDo you think you will live until 9 o'clock tonight?"; graffiti on a wall reading, XAvenge USA&#151;Kill a Muslim Now!"; a child in Cambridge attacked because his mother was wearing hijab; leaflets posted through letter-boxes across the country claiming that Islam stands for intolerance, slaughter, looting, arson and the molestation of women. It is a sad indictment of our society, but it is also the reality that faces many people today.
<P>

<a name="11210-10_para18"></a>There is a weakness in our law because it deals with racial groups, not religious groups. As I have previously noted, some religious groups&#151;Jews and <P>


<a name="column_1164"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1164</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Sikhs&#151;can also be considered as racial or ethnic groups, and, as a result, are protected by the additional safeguards of the Public Order Act 1986 and the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The current situation is anomalous. On a website run by a disreputable and hateful organisation, there could be the same message about three different groups&#151;the Sikhs and the Jews, which would be prosecutable as incitement, and the Muslims, which would not be. That is an anomaly which needs to be resolved, and the events of 11th September require that resolution quickly. That is why these provisions were included in the Bill and that is why they should remain in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="11210-10_para19"></a>Let me identify some of the support that there has been for these provisions being in the Bill. The Muslim Council of Britain, the leading Muslim representative organisation, issued a statement confirming its support in principle for both incitement to religious hatred and religiously aggravated offences. The Board of Deputies of British Jews&#151;although, as I have indicated, the Jewish people are considered a racial group&#151;also supports the extension of the law to religious groups. It noted that in the month after 11th September the number of anti-Semitic incidents recorded by the Jewish community in Britain doubled. Justice, in its paper to the Home Affairs Select Committee in another place, stated that it broadly supports the extension of incitement to racial hatred to cover religious hatred. It said that this will act as an important measure to protect vulnerable minority communities. The Law Society paper to the Select Committee on Home Affairs welcomed in principle the proposal to create an offence of religious hatred. The second report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights stated at paragraph 58:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XThere would be little difficulty in establishing a pressing social need for action".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-10_para20"></a><P>

<a name="11210-10_para21"></a>The United Nations Human Rights Committee, in its concluding observations earlier this month on the United Kingdom's latest periodic report, noted the recent upsurge in religious harassment and attack and urged the UK, among other things, to extend its criminal legislation to cover offences motivated by religious hatred.
<P>

<a name="11210-10_para22"></a>In Committee, the proposal received support from the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark, who is in his place today, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Blackburn. I hope that we shall hear at least from the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark today.
<P>

<a name="11210-10_para23"></a> The second general point raised by noble Lords and others is that Part 5 will limit freedom of expression and will stop criticism of religions and hinder religious discussion and debate. My noble friend the Minister and I have sought to explain existing law and the safeguards in the Bill. I shall trespass on your Lordships' indulgence and mention them again and then return to Amendment No. 92A.
<P>

<a name="11210-10_para24"></a>The first of the six safeguards is that the law requires that before an offence has been committed, a person must use threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour. Secondly, there must be a mental element&#151;an intention to incite religious hatred or a likelihood that <P>


<a name="column_1165"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1165</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the conduct or words will do so, coupled in that case with an intention that the words should be insulting, threatening or abusive.
<P>

<a name="11210-10_para25"></a>Thirdly, the offence is directed at hatred&#151;a strong word. The dictionary definition Xhatred" is not defined in the Bill&#151;is more than contempt or ridicule. Fourthly, the offence deals not with hatred of a religion but of a group of people who are defined by their faith or lack of it.
<P>

<a name="11210-10_para26"></a>Fifthly, the conduct has to enter the public domain. The offence is not directed at purely private expressions of any sort. Sixthly, no prosecution can be brought unless it is instituted by the Attorney-General or with his consent.
<P>

<a name="11210-10_para27"></a> The Government do not underestimate the concern expressed in this House and in the other place that a person should not be prosecuted for expressing a legitimate religious belief. I have made that clear, as has my right honourable friend the Home Secretary. In Committee, I undertook to consider how best to ensure that such prosecutions do not occur. We carefully examined the amendments tabled in Committee and in another place but concluded that they would not be effective. The difficulty is that providing exclusion from prosecution or a specific defence&#151;where, for example, a person cites a religious text&#151;creates a loophole that could be exploited by persons who deliberately seek to incite hatred and who are the very people we want the legislation to catch.
<P>

<a name="11210-10_para28"></a> We have seen examples where extremists have used quotes from holy books out of context to incite hatred. It is not difficult for the devil to cite scripture for his own purposes. Amendment No. 92A will provide guidance, which will give reassurance, on the kind of conduct that, by being a legitimate expression of religious belief, is not likely to amount to an offence of inciting religious hatred. I hope that that provision, in conjunction with existing safeguards, will reassure those persons who feared that expressing truly held beliefs could inadvertently lead to them being prosecuted.

<A NAME="11210-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, I hope to persuade your Lordships that the offence should be left in the Bill. The intention is that the offence will come into effect once Royal Assent is given. It is important that guidance is available by that date, so that the public know the consequences. I am hesitant to promise that the guidance, which has not yet been drafted, will be available by Thursday. I shall give thought to that question as I continue.

<P>
<A NAME="11210-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, it is guidance that I shall give as the prosecuting authority&#151;as the prosecutor with the authority to say whether or not an offence should be committed. That is not the same as government guidance amending, in any way, the offence. I shall consider further the noble Lord's comments. I thoroughly share his views about the importance of democratic accountability. I shall return to the question of precise timing.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para0"></a>Amendments Nos. 95 to 97 deal with the penalties for incitement to racial or religious hatred. Amendment No. 95 would retain the proposed increase from two to seven years but only for racial offence, not religious offences. Amendments Nos. 96 and 97 would remove the provision.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para1"></a> The Government believe that the penalty for the existing offence of incitement to racial hatred as well as the new offence, if it is included, of incitement to religious hatred should be seven years&#151;which would match the penalty set by Parliament for racially aggravated offences in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para2"></a>Amendments Nos. 94 and 98 relate to aggravated offences, where there is a criminal element already but the crime is made worse by being aggravated by a racial element. It is not acceptable to use violence to cause harassment or to damage property because of hostility towards a person's religion. It is one thing to dislike a person for their religion; it is one thing to dislike the religion itself; it is quite another thing to punch a person because they hold a religious belief that one does not like. Sadly, those kinds of offences have increased since September 11th and we need to send a message now that that is unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para3"></a>Noble Lords will recall that there was support from both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats for this measure in 1998 when racially aggravated offences were introduced in the Crime and Disorder Act. Both parties opposite called on the then Home Secretary to include religiously aggravated offences. The Government undertook to keep that under consideration and that was happening when September 11th occurred. Those events made clear that religiously motivated offences are a reality and that we need to act now. That is why we have brought forward Clauses 40 and 43. Therefore, I hope that noble Lords will support the inclusion of those offences.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para4"></a> In conclusion perhaps I may quote an Attorney-General, albeit an American, Robert Kennedy, who said in 1963,
<P>
<br>

<FONT SIZE=3>
The Government's position is clear. We need to protect our communities and the people in this country from religious hatred. The provisions in Part 5 of the Bill will do that. We are not creating something entirely new. We are expanding existing offences with the same criminal thresholds and safeguards that have been in place for years. Where there have been concerns we have listened, examined the possible options, and in the case of Amendment No. 92A, we have brought forward a solution.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para6"></a>My right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary have both made it clear that the United Kingdom has no argument with Islam or Muslims. The vast majority of British Muslims are law-abiding citizens who condemn terrorism in all its forms. It is unacceptable in our society for innocent people to be subjected to hatred simply because another person equates their religion wrongly with terrorist activity. The Government believe that this part of the Bill strikes the right balance between ensuring freedom of speech, which we prize dearly in this country, and ensuring that innocent and law-abiding people are able to practise their religion and to go about their daily business without being subjected to hatred or threats.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para7"></a>With the support for this provision and the safeguards for it, I believe that there is no good reason to oppose it. It was described by Mr Oliver Letwin in another place as being introduced by the Government with Xnoble motive". To protect vulnerable religious communities is a noble motive. I hope that noble Lords will now want to join in sending a clear message that this House wants to protect those people, the young woman in Manchester, and British people against unjustified threat and intolerance. It is an opportunity to send a message of tolerance and inclusiveness. There is no justification for hiding behind delay and procrastination.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para8"></a>My right honourable friend the Home Secretary did the right thing in including this noble provision in this Bill. The House would do wrong to vote it out. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord has made a gallant defence of an inclusion in the Bill that is not a part of the fundamentals of the battle against terrorism. His proposition rests on the assertion that it is. Indeed, it would be wrong of me if I were not say that there is justification for legislation in this field. The question is whether this is the right legislation, the right time and whether the legislation itself is entirely correct.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para9"></a>I shall try to follow the pattern that the noble and learned Lord has followed in his remarks because it might lead me to follow a logical progression, otherwise my thoughts might tend to be slightly scrappy. The noble and learned Lord rightly listed those bodies which support this legislation, such as the Muslim Council of Britain the Jewish Board of Deputies, Justice, the Law Society in principle, and the Joint Committee on Human Rights which says that it will have little difficulty in supporting legislation in <P>


<a name="column_1168"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1168</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this field. The right reverend Prelates have also supported the principle of this legislation. That is a powerful argument with which we do not quarrel.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para10"></a>The question which I do not believe has been answered by all those bodies is whether in fact they have said that this legislation must be passed now and in this form. With the possible exception of the right reverend Prelates who, by the good fortune of their presence here, have been able to express their view, I doubt whether the other bodies have expressed their support in those specific terms.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para11"></a>We come to the definition of the offence. As the noble and learned Lord said, before an offence takes place there must either be threats or abuse or insults; there must be an intention to incite religious hatred; there must be an intention to insult. The offence must be to create hatred of a group and it must be public and not private.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para12"></a>Those are all valid arguments. I believe I am also right in saying that they are also offences likely to cause a breach of the peace. Under existing law, if it were correctly applied&#151;unfortunately today it is more honoured in the breach&#151;these matters could be dealt with. The question whether the amendments would or would not work I leave to one side.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para13"></a>The noble and learned Lord said that offences under this new part of the Bill would be subject to his ruling as to whether or not they were offences. He intends to issue guidance as to what would or would not be an offence in this matter. I do not wish in any way to call into question the integrity of the noble and learned Lord when I say this. I hope very much that he will not take it that way. But the fact of the matter is that guidance is entirely discretionary. It is not binding. It can be set aside, changed, and it is not subject to parliamentary approval.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para14"></a>To return to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, even if we have the guidance before us it is not certain that it is necessarily the guidance which will apply three or five years in the future when the noble and learned Lord has perhaps gone on to greater things and some other person is doing his job. So there will always be a question over guidance.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para15"></a>Furthermore, I am not satisfied that we are anywhere close to a proper definition of a Xreligious group" or a Xreligion". I have two ways of asking the question. We do not have any particular problem in this country with regard to Mormons. More questionable is the Church of Scientology. I think of a group such as the Baha'is. They are seriously religious, but is Baha'i a religion?
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para16"></a>If one thinks back to the early days of the Non-Conformist Church, how should we have dealt with someone like Wesley? He Xtook on" the established Church in order to establish a new church. These remarks may seem somewhat odd, but the legislation that we pass&#151;subject only to sunset clauses that we may apply to it&#151;will be permanent, unless it becomes the subject of subsequent legislation. So there are deep and serious long-term issues wrapped in these simple little clauses which have been included in the Bill to fulfil a short-term political need.

<a name="11210-11_para17"></a> We do not quarrel with the principle behind the Government's approach; but the method is wrong. It is still wrong, despite the noble and learned Lord's remarkably clear advocacy. I hope that when the time comes the House will support the following amendment in this group, which seeks to remove the clause from the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, in speaking to this amendment, perhaps I may speak also to the other amendments in the group, especially Amendment No. 93, and therefore speak only once. It is appropriate that we are discussing this sensitive issue on Human Rights Day, when we are concerned with the rights and freedoms of everyone in the country&#151;majorities and vulnerable minorities. The Government's proposals are directed at protecting vulnerable minorities in this country, as the Attorney-General has explained.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para18"></a>As long ago as 1994, during the debates on the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill, I sought to persuade this House and another place to abolish the common law offence of blasphemy, which is truly anomalous and is part of the problem connected with this proposed new offence, in line with the recommendations of the Law Commission, made after detailed consultation. I shall briefly explain the significance of that in a moment.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para19"></a>The Attorney-General was kind enough to refer to the Second Report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights on the Bill and on this offence. In the report we said that we shared the view of the Constitution Committee that the inclusion of non-emergency measures is inappropriate in emergency legislation required to be considered at speed. We observed also that this was not a proper or sensible way to make legislation. Those observations apply in particular to the proposed offence of incitement to religious hatred. The offence as it has been explained would apply not only to the spoken word but also to the written word, to public performances of plays and to all forms of broadcasting.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para20"></a>Unlike the new statute in the Republic of Ireland, the offence will not cover other forms of hatred&#151;notably hatred expressed against gay men and lesbian women. Ireland has sensibly legislated beyond race and religion to cover that other most vulnerable group in our society.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para21"></a>At paragraph 60 of its report, the Joint Select Committee noted:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> XWe were ... pleased to learn that the Home Secretary is not committed to the view that the present state of the law of blasphemy is in tune with the equality-based and respect-based arguments which would be likely to be used to justify the interference with freedom of expression potentially occasioned by the provisions of the Bill on incitement to religious hatred".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-11_para22"></a>
The trouble is that the Home Secretary has explained that he does not consider it appropriate to abolish the vague common law offence of blasphemy in emergency legislation designed to counter the serious threat of terrorism. But he does think it appropriate to create the new offence of incitement to religious hatred <P>


<a name="column_1170"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1170</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as a matter of emergency. There is no evidence before Parliament that there is any emergency or pressing social need to justify creating this new statutory offence in such extraordinary haste without dealing with the underlying anomalies in existing law.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para23"></a>There are two underlying anomalies to which the Attorney-General has not referred. The first is that the law does not deal with religious discrimination; it deals only with racial discrimination. It does not deal with incitement to religious discrimination; it deals only with incitement to racial discrimination. The second anomaly is that the Church of England is uniquely protected in its tenets by the ancient common law offence of blasphemy against gross forms of insult. That anomaly was abolished by the Supreme Court of Ireland&#151;of all places&#151;a couple of years ago in a judgment in which the Supreme Court said that the ancient crime of blasphemy existed to protect the Church of England, but the Church of England was not the same as the Catholic Church; that in Ireland no such offence was needed and it was too vague to be capable of enforcement.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para24"></a>But the problem is that, to many Muslims in particular, the existence of a common law offence that protects Christianity against gross insult, and Judaism as a branch of Christianity under the curious law that applies to blasphemy&#151;since Judaeo-Christian tenets are lumped together for this purpose in a complicated way&#151;is grossly insulting. As counsel for Viking Penguin in the Satanic Verses case&#151;where it was sought to put people from Viking Penguin and Salman Rushdie in prison for blasphemy in insulting Islam&#151;I learnt that the sooner we get rid of the offence of blasphemy, the sooner we remove a source of legitimate grievance from the Muslim community; and the sooner we stop people who do not believe in freedom of expression, whether they are Muslims, Jews or anyone else&#151;including Christians&#151;from seeking to use arguments based on mere insults of a gross kind as a justification for criminal prosecution.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para25"></a> I am very glad that I shall never be Attorney-General. Whatever guidance he produces, he will be in a catch-22 situation. In the first place, if we do not get rid of the offence of blasphemy, we can be perfectly sure that pressure will be brought to bear on him by some sections of the community to use this new offence when he does not consider it appropriate to do so. If he authorises a prosecution, we shall be in a catch-22 situation. I can say that with confidence because I have worked in race relations since the early 1960s and have watched what happens to the offence of incitement to racial hatred. If a prosecution is mounted and it succeeds, the danger is that one makes a martyr of the person who has uttered evil thoughts in public. If the prosecution fails, the danger is that one legitimises the evil utterances as those who purvey such views are able to say, XA jury has acquitted and this was the speech that was thought to be forbidden or punishable by law".
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para26"></a>I do not say that it follows from any of that that we should be opposed to this new offence in principle. Indeed, I am on record as saying, and have said since 1994, that, if we abolish the offence of blasphemy, we <P>


<a name="column_1171"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1171</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>need a new, narrowly drawn criminal offence in its place. I agree with the Attorney-General that, if one were to get rid of the other anomalies to which I have referred, this would be an acceptably, narrowly drawn criminal offence. What is proposed here is what has obtained in Northern Ireland. However, it is never used there because neither of the communities has behaved in the same way as have some on this side of the Irish Sea. It is also similar to a measure that exists in the Irish Republic, although, as I say, it has had the good sense to move beyond race and religion to cover other vulnerable groups.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para27"></a>I hope that I have said enough to make it clear that this matter is very complicated and very sensitive. It requires proper consultation and should not be rammed through via an emergency procedure in Parliament in this ridiculous way. The Law Commission spent a long time in its consultation and, by a majority, came to the view that not only should blasphemy be abolished but nothing should be put in its place.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para28"></a>From what the Attorney-General and the Home Secretary have said, I do not believe that a new manifestation of religious intolerance has arisen since September 11th. I agree that before September 11th there was a continuing manifestation of such intolerance, as we saw in the riots in the cities in the north of this country. I agree that there is widespread racial intolerance, sometimes expressed in religious form, and I entirely agree with the urgent need for effective legislation to counter religious as well as racial discrimination.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para29"></a>Although I would not have expressed it in the same way, I also entirely agree with much of what the Home Secretary said yesterday about the need for social cohesion and the need for everyone to rally round basic civic and political values in this country. Those include the values of a liberal society in relation to free expression as well as mutual respect and tolerance for others and equal treatment without discrimination. I know that the Attorney-General and the Home Secretary share those values. But, speaking with more than 40 years' experience, I shall say to the Attorney-General, who is brilliant but much younger than I am, that it is not sensible to legislate in haste on these complicated matters. Even though I sympathise very much with a large part of what he said about the need for a new offence, let us deal with it properly and not in this hasty way.

<P>
<A NAME="11210-11_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I want to suggest a somewhat different approach. I am afraid that it involves leaving out Clause 39. I am encouraged by the remarks made by Mr Blunkett over the weekend in various interviews when he spoke about the problems that we face in this area. I want to suggest that it is extremely unwise of the Government to highlight religion as the root of the problem when in fact it is a cultural problem. It is the problem that some of our citizens have in coming to terms with being a part of this country, rooted as it is in centuries of a Judaeo-Christian culture. It is rooted also in the <P>


<a name="column_1172"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1172</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>problems experienced by others, whose ancestors have lived here for many years, as the immigrant population begins to join in and they see our culture respond to that.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para30"></a>In my view, to highlight this as a religious problem is likely to be counter-productive. We are free in this country to practise and celebrate our own beliefs and religions. But the culture here&#151;a culture rooted in our history, albeit one which evolves as history moves on&#151;provides the setting in which we all live our lives and the setting for our freedoms, whatever our religion.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para31"></a>It is not easy for any of our people to come to terms with and express a cultural problem in terms of religion. It compounds the issue and makes the situation much more difficult if we attempt to do so. The confusion will be compounded even more should the first high-profile case under such a law happen to involve an alleged offender who is a Muslim.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para32"></a> I believe that the Government would be very wise to emulate what the Scottish Parliament has done. I can understand why it has done so because I have received 35 letters, some from south of the Border, but mostly from Scotland and very many from the Highlands and Islands. A shot asylum seeker in Glasgow followed by a church burnt down caused the Scots Parliament to pause for thought. I believe that the Government would be very wise to think again on this matter. I do not believe that the idea of the Government giving us the conditions under which legislation would not be made would help. I believe that that would be a fundamental error.
<P>

<a name="11210-11_para33"></a>I should be very interested to know the right reverend Prelate's view on this matter. I have discussed it with a number of his colleagues north of the Border who do not disagree with me that it would be very much better to pause and to return with a Bill which gets to the root of the matter. They agree that we require a Bill which tackles the question of how we live within the existing culture of this country and how we let it evolve without trouble. Religion is linked to culture but it is not the root problem. I ask the Government to consider that.

I am concerned only with Amendment No. 92A.

<P>

<a name="11210-12_para1"></a>If it is not acceptable that Clause 39 stand part, the Attorney-General should have no discretionary power to administer the unacceptable. In a sense this pre-empts the situation and is an ingenious Xfudge" for want of requisite particularity on the face of the statute. It is a departure from the manner in which I have always understood that legislation is and should be presented. The noble Lord, Lord Rees-Mogg, wrote in The Times today:

I do not in any way resile from the support I gave the Government then.
<P>

<a name="11210-12_para3"></a>Over the weekend suggestions were made about the Home Secretary. He was described as bullying and scaremongering and was accused of driving on some sort of illiberal and authoritarian agenda. Anyone who knows the Home Secretary&#151;I have known him since our days together in local government in two different northern cities&#151;knows that those descriptions are as implausible as they are offensive. He argues, and I agree with him, that,

I am certain that he is right about that. However, this clause on religious hatred falls into none of those categories.
<P>

<a name="11210-12_para5"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, mentioned the article which appeared this morning under the name of my noble friend Lord Rees-Mogg. In that article my noble friend also argued that the Bill is effectively hybrid because it contains so much, and that it is not really about emergency legislation or necessary in the circumstances in which we find ourselves today. I believe that there is a compelling case, therefore, for a separate measure to deal with this sensitive question, one with which I believe the Attorney-General dealt with great sensitivity from the Dispatch Box earlier on. It is precisely because he showed such sensitivity that he recognises&#151;I think we all do&#151;that wise deliberation and reflection are necessary here.
<P>

<a name="11210-12_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, was right when he said that no emergency issues are at stake. The Attorney-General spoke of the young woman in Manchester. All noble Lords would agree with him that the kind of remarks made to her were <P>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1174</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>vicious, outrageous and unacceptable in any free society. However, during the past four weeks I have been in Oldham, Bolton and Burnley. There, I have met people who are engaged in education at various levels. I repeatedly heard them arguing for a deepening of commonly-held central civic beliefs, alongside tolerance of different cultural and religious beliefs. I heard no call for measures of this kind. I doubt that this new law will do anything to realise the objective which the Attorney-General has laid before us today, or that it would have prevented last year's riots in Oldham, the recent reprehensible attack in Bolton or the continuing level of one in five votes cast just two weeks ago for a British National Party candidate in Oldham.
<P>

<a name="11210-12_para7"></a> By contrast, the painstaking approach, which I saw at first hand in Liverpool, of ecumenism, where first the denominations of the Christian faith work together and subsequently the great faiths have painstakingly worked together in promoting religious toleration and co-existence, seems to me to be a better and longer-term way to proceed. Legislation on religious hatred may simply be used as an excuse to stifle perfectly proper debate about, for instance, forced marriage or female circumcision. Surely, those have to be regarded as legitimate areas for discussion and debate. They are odious practices and words such as Xdiversity" or Xpluralism" become misnomers when used to defend them.
<P>

<a name="11210-12_para8"></a>The Home Secretary spoke yesterday about norms of acceptability. If Clause 5 were to be enacted, would he be free any longer to speak in such terms, let alone the rest of us? Earlier today he was accused of offensive remarks because of what he said yesterday. Are we really to force our politicians and other commentators into a form of Trappism because they ask whether arranged marriages are acceptable or whether British citizens should be able to communicate in English?

<a name="11210-12_para9"></a>Our best prospect is to move as Australians and those in the United States have done to the fostering of common civic values, while accepting diversity in religious belief; diversity of dietary codes or the celebration through food, dress or music of an individual's mixed origins.

Such beliefs can, by their very extraordinary nature, cause outrage and upset, but should that constitute a crime? Every citizen has the right to expect that the law will protect him or her from bodily harm. But the law must also safeguard people's rights to express their views freely and worship in whichever way they wish. The Attorney-General has said that there are people from the Muslim community who have spoken in favour of this provision. But there is disagreement within that community too and opinion is divided. Many Muslims recognise the threat which this legislation poses to the free expression of devoutly-held religious belief.

<a name="11210-12_para12"></a><P>

<a name="11210-12_para13"></a>The genuine fears and concerns that have been expressed by the Muslim community and the numerous letters which many of us have received from a variety of Christian denominations, as mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, indicate that we should tread very carefully in this area. Therefore, the noble Lord, Lord Lester, was right to say that we should not proceed in haste. The people who are expressing the very fears I have mentioned are the same people the legislation is supposed to protect.
<P>

<a name="11210-12_para14"></a>Among Catholics there has been much debate about the toleration of the right of minority faiths to attack Catholicism in Catholic states. In Britain the state once forbade attacks on the established Church, but also persecuted Catholics for not being members of the state Church. That led to James II introducing a more tolerant rule, with the Declaration of Indulgence. Happily, we have come a long way since those days. I would mention in parenthesis that just 40 years ago the Second Vatican Council's declaration on religious liberty, Dignitatis Humanae, occasioned a change of emphasis with its re-affirmation, as one Bishop put it in January 1998, at a meeting of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, that while error may have no rights, those in error certainly do have rights, including the right not to be unjustly coerced.
<P>

<a name="11210-12_para15"></a>Among Anglicans, Bishop Lesslie Newbigin, who referred to the XIslamic mission" in his Gospel and Culture lecture on 1st December 1995 at King's College London, stated:

For once I also find myself in the unusual situation of agreeing with the Guardian columnist, Polly Toynbee. She is right to express concern that legislation might be used to stifle religious debate or criticism of religious practices and beliefs. We already have laws decriminalising defamatory libel, obscenity, sedition and blasphemous libel. Those are still in force, but rarely invoked. Laws against racial hatred are rarely invoked. For example, five men who were arrested a year ago for allegedly distributing anti-Semitic literature in the ultra-orthodox area of Stamford Hill were freed after the Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to proceed with charges of racial hatred. The Jewish Chronicle reported that the police said that the charges were dropped because the material was targeted only at a local Jewish community with little likelihood of any civil unrest. Surely, we should be seeking to enforce existing laws, with suitable revision where necessary, rather than hurriedly introducing ill-defined legislation which will serve only to encourage those who seek to undermine the free expression of devoutly held religious belief.

<P>

<a name="11210-12_para17"></a>I turn to my last point. I am sorry to have detained your Lordships. If we are to encourage greater religious and racial tolerance in our society, it will be done through proactive laws which celebrate citizenship, not through reactive laws which demonstrate a failure to appreciate the true nature of religious belief.
<P>

<a name="11210-12_para18"></a>Two years ago, while giving the Roscoe lecture at Liverpool John Moores University&#151;I declare an interest, as I hold a chair there&#151;Jack Straw, the then Home Secretary, said that new Britons do not come together as do new Americans to celebrate the bestowing of citizenship. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XWe should be doing more to celebrate citizenship, to value those who take on the rights and responsibilities of citizenship by naturalisation and acquisition as well as by birth".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-12_para19"></a>
He was right. There are many ways in which we could celebrate and underline the full nature of citizenship, especially the opportunities we enjoy in this country for free speech and religious worship. Jack Straw said that there should be,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xa proper ceremony to mark such a key rite of passage".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-12_para20"></a>
Perhaps the taking of an oath to uphold our democratic institutions and the rule of law might underline the significance of becoming a British citizen. But these are big questions which are worthy of proper debate in a Bill which is capable of proper reflection, scrutiny and amendment following widespread discussion. This is not the way to do it. As this part of the Bill is not crucial to the Home Secretary's central objective, I hope that the Government will think again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-12_spnew2"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Southwark: </B>   My Lords, there may be three main reasons to support the group of amendments, Amendments Nos. 93 to 98, which seeks to remove Clauses 39 to 43 from the Bill. I do not find them convincing.
<P>

<a name="11210-12_para21"></a>First, there are those of your Lordships who do not believe that incitement to religious hatred should be outlawed because they feel that religious belief should not be given that kind of protection. I do not agree with that position. For many citizens of this country, their religious belief is one of the most precious things that they possess. That is particularly true for some minority groups which fear that their culture, including their religion, is under threat today.
<P>

<a name="11210-12_para22"></a>There are those who do not wish the legislation to go forward because of its damaging effect on freedom of speech; those who feel that the ridicule and criticism of one's own or another faith would be hampered; and those who suspect that the legitimate evangelism of any of the faiths would be constrained. Those are real fears which have been expressed in the House today, but they can be overcome.
<P>

<a name="11210-12_para23"></a> It should be recalled that in this legislation we are dealing with hatred. We are not dealing with humour, comedy or even strident criticism. Nor are we dealing with the unfortunate, the accidental or the arguably deliberate misinterpretation of another faith. Words spoken in sincerity by one faith community need not <P>


<a name="column_1177"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1177</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>imply hatred of another. A religious service or the desire to convert others, to share the blessings of one's faith with another, is not an occasion to call up loathing, unless it is seriously abused.
<P>

<a name="11210-12_para24"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, need have no fear; a modern day Wesley would not have incitement to religious hatred among his armoury, any more than did his illustrious ancestor. Amendment No. 92A standing in the name of the Minister addresses that anxiety. The amendment makes the Bill much easier to support.
<P>

<a name="11210-12_para25"></a>Secondly, there are those of your Lordships who feel that the proposed legislation would have their full support if it was separated from the anti-terrorism Bill. It certainly can be argued that the incitement to religious hatred did not commence on September 11th and is not contained by its aftermath. The members of the Inner City Religious Council of all faiths have been arguing for just such legislation for a decade or more.
<P>

<a name="11210-12_para26"></a> Nevertheless, since September 11th there are those who have not been slow to stoke up faith tensions for their own reasons. The noble Lord, Lord Desai, at Second Reading suggested that supposed religious hatred is in fact racially motivated and that our existing laws are therefore sufficient. I fear that some racist groups are now more sophisticated than noble Lords might surmise. In my capacity as co-chair of the Interfaith Network for the UK I have received reports of white racist groups seeking meetings with Sikhs or Hindus, using the message:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XOf course you are good citizens, it's the Muslims which threaten us all".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-12_para27"></a>
Such white racist groups are more than ready to use religious hatred in their divide and rule policy for weakening minority ethnic communities.
<P>

<a name="11210-12_para28"></a>For those reasons, I believe that the proposed legislation can legitimately be found in a Bill dealing with anti-terrorism. But even if I did not believe that, I would agree with the views expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, at Second Reading that the legislation is better found here than nowhere.
<P>

<a name="11210-12_para29"></a> I cannot follow the noble Lords who, like the noble Lord, Lord Lester, support the proposed legislation but not in the Bill. We should grasp this opportunity for much needed reform which has been illuminated more clearly since September 11th.

<P>
<A NAME="11210-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to the right reverend Prelate for giving way. As he was good enough to mention my name, perhaps he can deal with one of my main objections: the anomaly of the offence of blasphemy and the way in which that can distort this new offence unless it is abolished first.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-13_spnew1"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Southwark: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord. I shall come to that matter before the end of my speech.
<P>

<a name="11210-13_para0"></a>In pressing your Lordships to go ahead, I am encouraged that the view that I have expressed is also the viewpoint of the main-line religious leaders of all faiths in this country. As co-chair of the Interfaith <P>


<a name="column_1178"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1178</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Network for the UK, I am perhaps in a position to help the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, when he questions whether such faith leaders have in fact given their full support. For example, Mr Iqbal Sacrani, the general secretary of the Muslim Council of Great Britain, Mr Neville Nagler, the Chief Executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Mr Indarjit Singh, director of the Network of Sikh Organisations, Mr Om Sharma, the president of the National Council of Hindu Temples (UK) and Mr Paul Seito, the co-ordinator of Buddhist organisations in the UK, have been consulted during the past week. They all support this legislation.
<P>

<a name="11210-13_para1"></a>Of course there are those who argue contrary to that, but most of the representative religious leaders are of a common mind. It would be remarkable if they were not because for many years they have sought such legislation.
<P>

<a name="11210-13_para2"></a>Thirdly, there are members of your Lordships' House who believe that the proposed legislation, limited as it is to incitement to religious hatred, is not adequate; and that it should be withdrawn and become part of a wider Bill which also includes religious discrimination. I totally agree that the legislation before your Lordships' House does not do everything that could be desired, but it is a major first step along the way. The workings of the legislation will give us invaluable experience in the years ahead as it is followed by further legislation tackling religious discrimination. I also add that in such legislation there would be space to deal with the blasphemy law. Its day indeed may have come. It would certainly be easier to view its departure were the clauses regarding the incitement to religious hatred already on the statute book. Certainly, we, from the Church of England, would view the departure of the blasphemy law with much easier hearts were that so.
<P>

<a name="11210-13_para3"></a>I conclude by reminding your Lordships that the Bill deals with behaviour and not belief. A wise friend of my acquaintance says of those who mock his ancestry, XIt's not them I dislike; it's their behaviour I find difficult". This legislation is about divisive and anti-social behaviour&#151;the incitement to religious hatred. It is not about belief. With that in mind, I hope that your Lordships will not support the amendments seeking to remove these clauses.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, we heard and rehearsed the arguments for and against incitement to religious hatred at Second Reading, in Committee and in a debate instigated by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. Many of us receive a large number of letters and telephone calls on the subject. They demonstrate that, whichever side of the argument one listens to, the general public&#151;including some members of the ethnic minorities&#151;are adamant that the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Bill is not the place for such legislation.
<P>

<a name="11210-13_para4"></a>The Attorney-General cited some cases. May I ask him why it was not possible to prosecute when many of them breached the Public Order Act 1986? Some breached the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. <P>


<a name="column_1179"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1179</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>My noble friend Lord Lester of Herne Hill has the appropriate bible&#151;if I may use that expression&#151;from which to cite all the examples.
<P>

<a name="11210-13_para5"></a> At the heart of the debate are a number of important issues. They include the blasphemy laws&#151;as ably demonstrated by my noble friend&#151;the limits of free speech, cultural pluralism and the place of minorities in British society. Many of them are part of an on-going agenda, but that is not to argue that free speech should be valued more or less highly than civil order or racial harmony. That confirms that a public debate and consultation process are necessary before we legislate. That consultation has not taken place.
<P>

<a name="11210-13_para6"></a>If we cannot take the public, including the ethnic minorities, with us, the law is bound to fail. That is why, while we broadly support the need for incitement legislation, we believe that it should follow detailed public consultation and take into account matters relating to religious discrimination. We are concerned about matters relating to cases in which the hatred is directed against groups abroad. That will immediately bring the Government into the politics of the sub-continent and the Middle East. As I asked at Second Reading: do we really want those battles to be fought on the streets of London?
<P>

<a name="11210-13_para7"></a>The concession that the Attorney-General would be responsible for the decision whether to prosecute does not answer the question of why it is necessary to include it in emergency legislation of this kind. The record on incitement to racial hatred has been poor. In a debate on 21st November, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford pointed to the difficulty that since 1988 only 42 defendants have been successfully prosecuted and in 1999 there were only four prosecutions, resulting in only three convictions. We are now being asked to pass legislation that could have no better outcome.
<P>

<a name="11210-13_para8"></a>One argument that is often forgotten, but of which the noble Lord, Lord Desai, well reminded us, is that an extremist hell-bent on violence is not going to ask about one's religious beliefs. We have seen that not only the Muslim community but almost all visible minorities are victims of vile attacks perpetrated by extremists who will circumvent the law so that they can carry out their propaganda against vulnerable communities.
<P>

<a name="11210-13_para9"></a>The Home Office must accept that including incitement to religious hatred in this emergency legislation is resented by members of the Muslim community. Despite the Government's denials, they give the impression that that faith is intrinsically tied up with the events of September 11th. That is quite the reverse of what the Government intended, but they have only themselves to blame.
<P>

<a name="11210-13_para10"></a> When will the Home Office learn that these measures are resented not because they are inappropriate but because they patronise ethnic minorities, and the Muslim community in particular? The Home Office should understand that religious hatred is not new. I could have told the Minister about that when I came here in 1956. As early as then, when I was living in Sussex, the Sussex Racial and Religious Preservation Society was formed.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-13_para11"></a>The Government are shortly to produce a consultation document on Article 13 which will take into account discrimination based on religion. The matter needs to be considered not in a piecemeal fashion but as a comprehensive measure that will take into account the prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination on grounds of religion or belief. We need not worry about the statutory definition of religion or belief because practices that are contrary to human rights as guaranteed by the Human Rights Act 1988 will not be lawful. The Minister would have our full support if legislation were separated from the Bill. That would allow us seriously to consider what was appropriate and how we could command the respect of all our citizens.
<P>

<a name="11210-13_para12"></a>For that reason, we support the amendment. We are not alone. Even the Commission for Racial Equality argues that a distinction can be made between anti-terrorism measures that can be justified as necessary in the current situation and those that have wider implications and should be given greater consideration in Parliament.

<A NAME="11210-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, I rise&#151;paradoxically, now&#151;rather reluctantly. I wrote to my noble friend the Minister when the provisions first appeared to say that I could not possibly support Part 5 and would vote against it; I intend to do so in its entirety today.
<P>

<a name="11210-13_para13"></a>I rise because I regard myself as belonging to a great political party. It would be appalling if, when the history of our time is written, at least one voice did not speak out against what I regard as a thoroughly illiberal measure and one totally alien to the history of the party of which, as I say, I am proud to be a member. At least one voice from our side must say that the Bill is a mistake.
<P>

<a name="11210-13_para14"></a>I must admit&#151;this is where I differ from some noble Lords with whom I hope to be voting later&#151;that I would oppose such legislation more generally. I can think of no appropriate form of the legislation in respect of which I could put my hand up and say that it is compatible with liberal parliamentary democracy or the open society. Indeed, the main thought in my mind as I listened to those supporting the provisions is that the terrorists have won. If we pass this part of the Bill, we will undermine a fundamental principle of parliamentary democracy. That is the business that the terrorists are in: the destruction of parliamentary democracy.
<P>

<a name="11210-13_para15"></a>Further than that, returning to my early days as a student, when I had the great honour of being taught by Karl Popper, I believe that the open society is the essence of what we, the Americans and others do. The crime of religious hatred&#151;whatever that means, and I still have great difficulty following my noble friends' explanations of what it means&#151;is incompatible with the open society.

<a name="11210-13_para16"></a>The provisions have nothing to do with the protection of individuals against abuse, threats, and all that sort of thing. We have a legal system to do that; we have people who speak up for such people. I agree that sometimes, especially in the case of race, not enough is done. The lesson to learn from that is that we should enforce our existing laws properly, not invent this one.
<P>

<a name="11210-13_para17"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 92A, which I know that my noble and learned friend proposes honourably and with a desire to help, really gives the game away. My right as a citizen of this country cannot possibly depend on what the Attorney-General&#151;and I do not mean this specific Attorney-General but the office&#151;decides are grounds for conduct that consists of the legitimate expression of religious belief. I decide what I regard as a legitimate expression; I do not require the office of the Attorney-General either to tell me or to be in a position to tell me.

<A NAME="11210-14_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, I shall be so brief. I hate a caste system, which condemns someone to be a hewer of wood or a drawer of water, that is religious-based. I hate the concept that a widow can be forced to commit suttee. I hate forced marriages. I hate female circumcision. I hate the concept that people should be stoned to death for adultery. I hate that hands should be chopped off because of thieving. I hate that people should be forced to wear burkas so that they cannot be seen. I hate the rantings of Protestant extremists against the evil of sodomy. I hate the Wahhabite system of law. I hate all of those because they are wrong. I also think that it is wrong that I should be criminalised for hating, and encouraging others to hate, something that is held to be religious by a large group of religious people when I know those things to be wrong.
<P>

<a name="11210-14_para0"></a>The Attorney-General shakes his head and says, XNo, that's not it". If that is not the point, what is the point? Will I be able to say that I hate a religious doctrine? That is the dilemma that faces us all. Let us leave it to the laws of harassment, sedition and offensive behaviour; let us not pursue these religious lines. The issue is too difficult. Let us also remember that the Pope rescinded the Great Papal Bull Regnens in Excelsis, which absolved all Roman Catholics from loyalty to the United Kingdom, only in 1967, or so the noble Lord, Lord St. John of Fawsley&#151;a totally reliable source&#151;told me.

<a name="11210-14_para1"></a>Let us be very careful about making things that I hate illegal to hate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Taverne: </B>   My Lords, I shall give one very brief example, which appears in the current edition of the Economist, to demonstrate the dangerous territory that the Bill is entering into. There is apparently a radio station called Premier Christian Radio, against which a complaint was made by the Mysticism and Occult Federation. The Radio Authority, which judges such complaints, found some of the federation's criticisms valid, and it criticised the radio station for referring to other religions as full of superstitions and <P>


<a name="column_1182"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1182</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>absurdities; for derogatively referring to non-Christian faiths as XBuddhism, Hinduism and rheumatism"; and for publishing an advertisement from a Church promising certain listeners deliverance from Xoccultism".
<P>

<a name="11210-14_para2"></a>The Radio Authority is not concerned with religious hatred, it is concerned with good taste and decency. The above example, however, shows how difficult it is, both currently and in the future, to draw a line between hurting feelings and what amounts to inciting hatred. It could well be that, when feelings run high, regardless of the guidance that is issued by the Attorney-General, those who make certain types of statement will be prosecuted, freedom of speech will be suppressed, and the type of situation that we saw when a fatwa was issued against Salman Rushdie may well be repeated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </B>   My Lords, I want briefly to comment on Amendment No. 92A. The fact that the Attorney-General moved the amendment demonstrates that he is not 100 per cent confident that the Bill's current definition is clear to everyone who might be affected by it. It is an indication that, so far, the Bill's definition of the crime in question is not very adequate. I am sure, as has been said more than once, that it is a very difficult issue. The Law Commission examined the issue and concluded that it would be wise to have no provision at all to address it, although it reached that conclusion against the background of a different time and in considering whether the law of blasphemy should be removed from our common law.
<P>

<a name="11210-14_para3"></a>I want to put one question to the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General&#151;whose thoughts on the issue must be fairly right, as he said that guidance would have to be available when this emergency Bill receives Royal Assent. I am sure that your Lordships recollect the debates that we have had over the years on various provisions on abortion. The most recent such debate was on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, the scope of which made it possible for the first time to include this type of amendment in a government Bill.
<P>

<a name="11210-14_para4"></a>The difference between those who agree with abortion and those who disagree with it is a religious one. Generally, those who disagree with it have the view that human life exists from the time of, or very shortly after, conception. That is in the nature of a religious belief. Those who are against it hold the view that those in favour of abortion are killing babies by the hundred. I think that most people would regard killing babies by the hundred as a fairly hateful matter. Therefore, if I say that those who are in favour of abortion are in fact promoting the killing of babies by the hundred, surely I am inciting hatred against them as a group, as those who perform the abortions are said to be murderers, and those who agree with abortion are said to be supporters of murderers. The example demonstrates that we are seeking to legislate on a rather difficult subject.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="11210-14_para5"></a>It may be that the Law Commission, having long and very carefully considered the matter, has reached the right conclusion after all. Regardless, it seems that we cannot properly go down this road as quickly as an emergency Bill would seem to require.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Neill of Bladen: </B>   My Lords, I should like to follow up the remarks of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, by drawing attention to Amendment No. 92A, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XThe Attorney General may issue guidance as to conduct in respect of which he will not institute proceedings for an offence . . . or consent to the institution of such proceedings, on the grounds that the conduct consists of the legitimate expression of religious belief".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-14_para6"></a><P>

<a name="11210-14_para7"></a>That is an extraordinary power to confer on an office-holder. The Attorney-General can issue guidance, and presumably he can amend his guidance. If he can issue it, he must be able to say, XI have changed my mind" and revoke it. Therefore, we are effectively saying that the scope of the operation of these provisions depends on the opinion that is formed from time to time by the Attorney-General. That cannot be a proper way in which to legislate. If we wish to express something as being a criminal offence, we should be capable of defining it. It is totally unacceptable, and to my knowledge unprecedented, to allow the definition or scope of provisions of an Act of Parliament to depend on the opinion from time to time of a single officer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support Amendments Nos. 93 to 98. As I have consistently made clear, I do not like Part 5 of the Bill. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Neill, put his finger on my primary concern about Amendment No. 92A: the lack of clarity on whether future guidance from the Attorney-General will expand the scope of the provision although we do not agree to expand it.
<P>

<a name="11210-14_para8"></a>I am not concerned about specific individuals. As we know, however, British tabloids can drive us to a political frenzy, such as on the issue of dangerous dogs. I can very easily imagine a situation in which, as in the Salman Rushdie case, there is frenzy-driven tabloid propaganda saying that the Attorney-General must immediately take a given course of action. There will be no stopping once we start down such an illiberal road.
<P>

<a name="11210-14_para9"></a>I still believe that, if we want to stop attacks on Muslims or any other minority, we shall have to find a better way of defining those groups than by resorting to the label of religion. That is the wrong label. However, we can do that only if we put together all the religious issues&#151;for instance, discrimination, blasphemy and hatred&#151;and perhaps have a special committee of your Lordships' House to examine the matter in detail. After that, we should return to the legislation and deal with it properly. Bad legislation in this respect will be extremely harmful.

<FONT SIZE=3>Mackay of Clashfern seem to have torpedoed completely the palliative Amendment No. 92A, which was intended to persuade your Lordships to go down this route.
<P>

<a name="11210-14_para10"></a>I rise as a loyal member of the Church of England in order to try to persuade the right reverend Prelate to have at least a moment of doubt about what he advises us. There are only 24 hours&#151;perhaps a few more; 30 hours&#151;in which an alternative amendment can be tabled. Under ordinary procedure, not only would we have had weeks of discussion between stages so that our positions could have been fully realised, but we would have a full three days in which to carry out further discussions in order to find an alternative palliative amendment.
<P>

<a name="11210-14_para11"></a>Therefore, while I agree with the right reverend Prelate that something must be done, that is far from saying that anything will do. I do not believe that this will do and under this procedure I do not see how we can arrive at anything which will do. It follows, does it not, as we have been saying all along, that this is the wrong place for this provision? It should comprise a Bill of its own and not be in this one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-14_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Richardson of Calow: </B>   My Lords, I am well aware that many of our faith community leaders are in favour of the legislation being passed. However, it has been expressed to me on the basis of half a loaf being better than none. It is said that it will go some way towards helping against what they feel to be an injustice; that some parts of the community are protected and that they are not. I am not convinced by that argument. Our faith communities and all religions deserve better than to be put in that negative light. We have consistently said that the events of 11th September and the conflict are not religiously based, so I cannot see the justification for including the provision in an anti-terrorism Bill.
<P>

<a name="11210-14_para12"></a>I hope that we shall pass the amendments. The Government are committed to examining religious discrimination, which involves religion and belief. That covers an area wider than simple religious understanding. I hope that we shall have considered reflection of, and be able to put in a more positive light, the role that religions play in our community. We should carefully consider how that can be protected as a force for good within our common life.

<A NAME="11210-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, I do not want to delay the House and I do not want to disagree with the Home Secretary just when he is coming around to agreeing with me. However, I believe that the clause is out of place not merely in the Bill but in any legislation. Perhaps I may respond to a point which arises from what was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Richardson.
<P>

<a name="11210-15_para0"></a>The followers of bin Laden are undoubtedly acting as they do out of a religious belief. I have heard a number of Ministers who could be held to be guilty of causing religious hatred of the followers of bin Laden because of what they do. Those followers say that they do what they do because of their religion . That immediately goes to the definition of a religion. <P>


<a name="column_1185"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1185</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I notice that the Bill contains a reference to a religious belief or a lack of religious belief. However, the amendment tabled by the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General refers only to
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xthe legitimate expression of religious belief".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-15_para1"></a><P>

<a name="11210-15_para2"></a>Straightaway, at this stage in this hurried procedure through which we are going, we find inconsistencies in the legislation that is before is.
<P>

<a name="11210-15_para3"></a>What is an expression of non-belief? What is an expression of irreligious belief? Are they different? What of cults? Are they protected? Would we think it right to be protecting the local chapter of a Haitian voodoo group? I believe that we are rapidly getting ourselves into a great muddle. It is a great muddle into which we do not need to get.
<P>

<a name="11210-15_para4"></a>We can escape all those difficulties simply and easily without requiring any of these definitions; without requiring any discussion of whether a fringe comedian at the Edinburgh Festival could infringe the law; without relying on the whim of successive Attorneys-General to tell us what the law is. We should return to the common sense use of prosecuting for the use of insulting words or behaviour whereby a breach of the peace may be caused.
<P>

<a name="11210-15_para5"></a>If we were to increase the penalties for such behaviour to, say, seven years, we would have the perfectly flexible and useable weapon; that is, if a comedian went beyond the bounds of good taste or if someone in a pub among his friends of similar quirky beliefs was insulting about people who would never hear what was said, it could all be ignored. But if a hooligan of some kind went into a place where there were members of a religious group and chose to insult them and stir up hatred against them, we could proceed easily and simply with law that has been used for years and is well understood.
<P>

<a name="11210-15_para6"></a>We no not want this proposed legislation and we should get rid of it. It is a mess; it is a danger; and it is a disgrace to the legislation which should come from this Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Parekh: </B>   My Lords, I am afraid that mine will be a slightly dissenting voice because I have the feeling that many noble Lords are already persuaded by the amendments. However, that is the other side to the story and I hope that your Lordships will allow me to say it.
<P>

<a name="11210-15_para7"></a> In the debate on the issue there are four important questions. First, should there be an offence of incitement to hatred? I believe that the answer is yes. Secondly, should incitement to religious hatred be an offence? The answer seems to me to be yes. Thirdly, as no definition of religious hatred is ever perfect, do we have it just about right? The answer seems to me to be broadly yes. Fourthly, are we right to make it part of an anti-terrorism Bill? Again, in my humble view, the answer seems to me to be yes.
<P>

<a name="11210-15_para8"></a>Perhaps I may briefly explain those views. Our democracy is based on the principles of rational debate and dialogue. Obviously, it is incompatible with intimidating and aggressive utterances. That has become <P>


<a name="column_1186"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1186</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>particularly urgent because of our multi-cultural society which requires the sense of a dialogue between civilisations and cultures. It is crucial therefore to save the parameters of the public debate and to ensure that our public life is free of inter-ethnic or inter-religious hatred. Hatred is the enemy of dialogue and declares a war on a section of our citizens.
<P>

<a name="11210-15_para9"></a>We must also bear in mind that almost all forms of racial hatred grow out of religious hatred. For centuries, for example, Jews were attacked on religious grounds. Their religion was condemned and they were accused of deicide. It was argued that they were therefore objects of legitimate hatred. That kind of evil way of thinking created a climate whose consequences were exploited by the Nazis in the 1930s. The same was true of the Hindus whose so-called animalistic religion was condemned and whose people were declared legitimate objects of hatred.
<P>

<a name="11210-15_para10"></a>In your Lordships' House and elsewhere it is sometimes said that this clause relating incitement to religious hatred, is a sop to Muslims, that it singles them out for special treatment and may even prove counter-productive. I do not see the clause in that way at all. The clause protects no one and no particular community; it protects only our democratic system by banning utterances that are likely to poison relations between different communities. Such inciteful utterances may come from Muslims, as in the past they have tended to do, and so they will face the full rigour of the law. If they come from other groups, those groups, in turn, will receive the full rigour of the law.
<P>

<a name="11210-15_para11"></a>Sometimes it is said that the Bill will curtail freedom of expression. Again, I do not see why. The Bill is clearly directed to stop certain kinds of behaviour&#151;not utterances. It deals with utterances only in so far as they are action-oriented.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, for giving way. Am I right in thinking that in the Joint Committee on Human Rights he made clear in his questions to the Home Secretary that his position is that the Salman Rushdie novel, The Satanic Verses, should have been prosecuted as a criminal offence? I ask the question because the noble Lord says that this Bill would not threaten free speech. Am I right in saying that that is his position?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Parekh: </B>   My Lords, I shall come to that point in support of my argument. The Home Secretary made the matter clear in his evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights. In answer to a question of mine he said that the Bill would not have stopped Rushdie's The Satanic Verses. He also said that those utterances that are designed to demean, offend or degrade others are left completely untouched by the provisions of the Bill. In other words, the Bill is concerned with only those utterances that are likely to lead to certain forms of hatred and that are likely to precipitate action against certain groups of people. Therefore, I believe that the Government's intentions are broadly liberal and that any court dealing with the matter would want to take into account the kind of evidence that the Home Secretary gave to the Joint Committee.
<P>


<a name="column_1187"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1187</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-15_para12"></a>Many noble Lords have asked why Part 5 should be included in a Bill dealing with terrorism. I may be totally naive, but I like to believe that the connection is absolutely clear. Terrorism springs from hatred. Of all forms of hatred, religious hatred is the worst because it breeds fanaticism and justifies itself in the name of no less a personage than the Almighty. We have seen that in the Middle East and elsewhere. Religious hatred needs to be stopped or at least discouraged. Hence I see Part 5 as part of a campaign against terrorism in general.
<P>

<a name="11210-15_para13"></a>Questions have also been raised about what constitutes a religion or a religious group. Similar questions were raised in the mid-1970s when we were talking about incitement to racial hatred. After all, if race and ethnicity have not proved difficult to define, I do not see why religion should pose a problem. In short, the Bill is directed against religious groups and not against religions. It defines hatred in fairly narrow and tight terms and as far as I can see it has safeguards against indiscriminate use of the provisions of the Bill. Therefore, I am inclined to support the Bill and to reject the amendments.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-15_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, I shall be brief. I have a few points to add to the debate and I want to speak to Amendment No. 93 standing in my name. The prospect of a new law on religious hatred has attracted criticism from a wide range of groups. The Home Secretary is most concerned to protect Muslims with a new offence, yet Muslims are divided on it. As the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has already said, in a memorandum to the Home Affairs Select Committee in November, several Muslim groups have expressed grave reservations about the prospects of such an offence. Some of them may have been persuaded by the Home Secretary and the current wording of the Bill, but others have not. Given time, consultation and careful drafting, their fears may be allayed, but as it stands this new offence is still a cause of grave concern to many Muslims, let alone Christians and those of other faiths or no faith.
<P>

<a name="11210-15_para14"></a>The Home Secretary has one rather eccentric success in that he has managed to unite atheists and religious believers with comedians and journalists who have come together to condemn this new offence because of the potential effect on freedom of speech. While we all deplore religious hatred, this is not the way in which to deal with it. Many religious people have a real concern that the new religious incitement offence will cause more harm than good. Instead of protecting them, they fear that the new law could be turned against them. Religious people should be free to argue passionately in support of their beliefs as should those with no faith. Free speech and robust debate that pose no danger to anyone risk being caught by the new offence.

<P>
<A NAME="11210-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that under legislation relating to Northern Ireland there is a provision that is almost word for <P>


<a name="column_1188"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1188</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>word the same as may be enacted if Part 5 is put on to the statute book and that in 14 years there have been only four prosecutions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-16_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, I am very aware of that. I shall quote directly from the Christian Institute which has said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xwe know about anti-religious sentiment. We deal with cases of individuals who are mistreated because of their beliefs. To silence those who disagree with us we could easily make use of this new law if it is passed. But we do not believe it would be right to do so".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-16_para0"></a>
We are moving in dangerous territory. This issue should be left out of the Bill altogether. These provisions touch on such a sensitive area of our national life and they cannot be dealt with properly in the highly pressurised setting of a Bill on terrorism that is being raced through Parliament in time for Christmas. I entirely agree with my noble friend the Shadow Home Secretary, Oliver Letwin, MP, to whom reference has been made by the Attorney-General. The Government's motive is noble, but with respect, their actions are misguided. The House does not need to oppose or to reject Amendment No. 92A; instead I urge your Lordships to support Amendment No. 93 through which we can remove the offence of incitement to religious hatred from this Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, I know the hour is late and I sense the mood of the House, but I want to speak to a few points as there is confusion. I respect some of the views that have been expressed and, with respect, I consider some of the views to be misguided.
<P>

<a name="11210-16_para1"></a>Does this House believe that such conduct should be prohibited or condoned? I understand, with few exceptions, that the House is of the view that conduct involving the hatred of individuals because of their beliefs is not appropriate and should not be condoned. Therefore, one has to ask whether it is right to outlaw such behaviour as a criminal offence, in what form and when?
<P>

<a name="11210-16_para2"></a>I invite noble Lords to pay the closest possible attention to the views that have been expressed by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark who has spoken on his own behalf and on behalf of others. Within the past week he has obtained the views of representative leaders of the British religious communities, including the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Muslim Council of Britain, the Network of Sikh Organisations, and the National Council of Hindu Temples. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred specifically to the Muslim Council of Britain and to the appendix put in to the Home Affairs Select Committee in another place. In that memorandum the views expressed by the signatories was that at the moment they did not want to see legislation. As I told noble Lords, the Muslim Council of Britain has now changed its view on that. After reflection, having seen the provisions&#151;the paper was written before the Bill was published&#151;it has agreed the statement which I mentioned earlier. That is confirmed in what the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark said.
<P>


<a name="column_1189"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1189</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-16_para3"></a>I also ask noble Lords to pay the closest attention to the words of my noble friend Lord Parekh. The views expressed in his study in relation to multiculturalism in this country deserve, I suggest, the closest possible respect.
<P>

<a name="11210-16_para4"></a>I respect the view of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and it is important to note it. He spoke of the need for deepening our culture and cultural inclusiveness. I entirely agree with that. However, sadly, the people whose conduct we want to prevent are not susceptible to that deepening of culture and certainly not in the timescale of which we speak.
<P>

<a name="11210-16_para5"></a>Let me deal with specific topics. First, are the ingredients of the offence sufficiently defined? I have been at pains at Second Reading, in Committee and today to identify the ingredients of the offence. They are the same ingredients as existing offences: the offences of incitement to racial hatred. They have not been dreamt up for this Bill. Those ingredients are there and it is important to focus on them. I shook my head at the remarks of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow. He talked about violent disagreement with the tenets of a religion. As I sought to make clear, the ingredient of the offence is inciting hatred of a group of people not of the religion. That is clear from the provisions of the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, and other noble Lords shake their heads. Because of the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, I had placed in the Printed Paper Office a copy of Part 3 of the Public Order Act 1986, as it would be amended, which identifies what is meant by religious hatred. It is on the face of the Bill. It means hatred against a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief not to religion. The noble Lord, Lord Parekh, was right in relation to that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, will the noble and learned Lord tell us how that would bite on the case of the Muslim woman which he cited at the beginning of his speech? From his example, I understood that the hatred was directed at her.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, the hatred is against a group of persons of which she is a part because she is a Muslim. I hope that that helps the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-16_spnew5"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, I do not understand noble Lords' amusement. I have obviously said something which I should not have done.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-16_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, I think that it was a comment on my ability to take in what the noble and learned Lord was saying.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-16_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, at least the noble Lord has not been accused of being too young to understand <P>


<a name="column_1190"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1190</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what the Bill is about. I suppose that I should be grateful that I was not accused of not being a lawyer. That is the other criticism which has been made.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-16_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I am not accusing the Attorney-General of anything. However, is not the Muslim woman in the case he cited already adequately protected by existing criminal law, including the protection against harassment legislation which we enacted only recently?
<P>

<a name="11210-16_para6"></a>Can the noble and learned Lord also deal with the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, that his guidelines will not cover those who have no religious belief?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-16_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, let me deal separately with those questions. First, when the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said that no events had occurred since 11th September, I was going to intervene to ask whether he had read the appendix to the report of the Select Committee on Home Affairs. It sets out incident after incident attributed to events since 11th September. The first state-funded Islamic school, Islamia Primary School, in Brent was forced to close after threatening telephone calls since the incident in the USA on Tuesday 11th September. A school secretary wearing a hijab was abused verbally while out shopping. On Monday 17th September, girls in hijabs were spat on. There are examples after examples. Noble Lords who read the appendix cannot doubt that those events have occurred since 11th September.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-16_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, are those incidents not punishable under existing criminal law?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-16_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may pick up on that point. Would not Section 4 of the Public Order Act deal with those very allegations? It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XA person is guilty of an offence if he . . . uses towards another person threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or . . . distributes or displays to another person any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-16_para7"></a>
Making those kinds of abusive comments to a woman in the street wearing a veil would be an offence under that section.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-16_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, Section 4 of the Public Order Act makes a person guilty of an offence if he uses threatening, abusive or insulting words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xwith intent to cause that person to believe that immediate unlawful violence will be used against him . . . by any other person",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-16_para8"></a>
or that person is likely to believe that such violence will occur. It is a victim orientated offence.
<P>

<a name="11210-16_para9"></a>The reason for proposing the amendment was not because the ingredients of the offence are insufficiently defined. It was for another reason. With respect to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, it is not because I have doubts as to what the offence meant but for this reason. In another place, Sir Brian Mawhinney raised the question whether or not it would be possible to find a way of putting a reference <P>


<a name="column_1191"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1191</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to legitimate expression of religious belief in the Bill. In this House a similar point was made. The proposal was to help in this respect.
<P>

<a name="11210-16_para10"></a>I make two points about the position of the Attorney-General. It is already the position, as it is under a number of Acts of Parliament, that the consent of the Attorney-General, and in Scotland the Lord Advocate, is required for certain offences to be brought. It does not mean that the Attorney-General identifies the ingredients of the offence. That is for the court. Nothing I say could ever make criminal conduct which is not within the words of the statute. The consent&#151;it has been inserted by Parliament on a number of occasions&#151;filters out cases, to prevent them from going to court, where it is not in the public interest for them to be brought to court. It is a question of public interest not an executive decision. I do not say this because of the accusation of youth. But some noble Lords may recall that in 1924 a Labour Government fell because the Attorney-General of the day gave and withdrew a consent for a prosecution which was believed to have been motivated by political considerations. Ever since that day it has been an absolute tenet of faith to successive attorneys-general that the decision as to whether a prosecution takes place&#151;for example, I give consent to explosive substances cases&#151;is given entirely on the basis of public interest not political consideration.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, every noble Lord, by and large, knows about the powers of the Attorney-General. Can the noble and learned Lord say whether there is any precedent for the type of administrative power sought under the amendment to be put in the hands of one man, the Attorney-General?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, it is not an administrative power. It is a statement that I was offering to publish guidance, to police and prosecutors, as to the circumstances in which I would consent to or institute proceedings. I shall come to precedent. I cannot change the Act. I do not seek to do so. It is not an administrative power to change the ingredients of the offence. It is to give some assurance on what I have said repeatedly in this House: that legitimate expressions of religious belief are not, in my view, criminal and will not be prosecuted. It is for that reason only.
<P>

<a name="11210-17_para0"></a>I turn to the third question. Is it necessary to do so now? I was surprised to hear the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, suggest that it was not necessary to do it now. I have read to noble Lords what the Joint Committee on Human Rights said about this being a pressing social need, noting that the United Nations Human Rights Committee had urged us to introduce such legislation.
<P>

<a name="11210-17_para1"></a>Although coupling it with the question of blasphemy, the noble Lord is on record as saying that reforms would protect minority groups such as Jews, Sikhs, Muslims or Hindus from serious public order offences without unnecessarily interfering with freedom of speech and that such a law would not threaten satire and powerful criticism of religious beliefs or the lack of them.
<P>


<a name="column_1192"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1192</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-17_para2"></a> It is said that the Law Commission formed the view that it did not think such an offence was necessary. That is not right. In paragraph 2.35 of the report in 1985 the Law Commission said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xif such attacks appear to be or become a real social problem, the appropriate response in our view is not to extend the law of blasphemy but rather to adapt the present offence, penalising the publication of matter likely to arouse hatred towards persons on account of their race, so that it would penalise publication of matter likely to arouse hostility to others on account of their religious beliefs".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-17_para3"></a><P>

<a name="11210-17_para4"></a>In other words, the Law Commission took the view a number of years ago&#151;this is not a new issue&#151;that if there was a pressing social need, then the right way to deal with it would be to introduce some fairness of this sort.
<P>

<a name="11210-17_para5"></a>Ultimately, the question is whether to do it now. I urge noble Lords, despite the expressions that I have detected during the course of this debate, to follow what the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark said. It is now that we can protect our community. It is now that we can send out a message that we want them not to be vulnerable; that we want to be inclusive. To throw this out now would be sending exactly the opposite message. I urge your Lordships not to send that message.
<P>

<a name="11210-17_para6"></a> On Question, amendment agreed to.

<P>
<A NAME="11210-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway </B>   moved Amendment No. 93.
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Leave out Clause 39.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-17_para7"></a><P>

<a name="11210-17_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg leave to speak also to Amendment No. 94 and Amendment No. 95.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, if it would help the noble Lord, I think that the House wishes to reach a decision on whether Amendment No. 93 should be dealt with. I think that the House wishes to come to a decision on that now and then, if he wishes to speak to the other amendments in their place on the list, of course he can do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Lord. The essence of the problem&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-17_spnew5"></A><B> A Noble Lord: </B>   No!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, Amendment No. 93 has not been moved other than by myself.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-17_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, if it would help the noble Lord, the debate has taken place around the virtues or otherwise of Clause 39. The House now wishes to reach a decision on whether Clause 39, as amended, should remain a part of the Bill. After the House has taken that decision, it can then move on to the other amendments to which the noble Lord wishes to speak.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-17_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="11210-18_spnew0"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose </B>   moved Amendment No. 98A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 26, line 21, leave out from XScotland" to Xis" in line 22 and insert Xthe sheriff"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-18_para0"></a><P>

<a name="11210-18_para1"></a>The noble Duke said: My Lords, I am glad to have the chance once again to bring this amendment before the House. It is a particular pleasure to find that I am joined by the Minister, who has been able to reconsider the matter. I am acting merely on the advice of the Law Society of Scotland, but the Minister has the benefit of very distinguished advice. It appears that all are now in agreement. I am sure that tonight I shall receive a more positive response than was the case with my last group of amendments.
<P>

<a name="11210-18_para2"></a>In my view, the earlier answers I received to my questions raised a fundamental issue as regards what is to happen when legislation is subject to a XSewel Motion" in the Scottish Parliament. The noble Lord responded by making it sound as though the Scottish Parliament merely had to agree to what the government of the day proposed, whereas it is my understanding that the Scottish Parliament would ask for and accept that the Parliament at Westminster will agree the wording that is appropriate. Thus we do have a right to consider the issues.
<P>

<a name="11210-18_para3"></a> Speaking, I hope, with some support from the Minister, it would be good to think that the Scottish Parliament does not have a monopoly on consultation and co-operation between the parties, which they so often like to emphasise.
<P>

<a name="11210-18_para4"></a>The amendment would ensure that in Scotland only a sheriff and not a justice of the peace would be entitled to grant the search warrants referred to in the clause. I am advised that the power to grant such warrants should extend only to sheriffs. Often a justice of the peace will not be legally qualified and may be unfamiliar with the criteria needed to grant such warrants. In the interests of justice, therefore, this matter ought to remain within the sole ambit of the sheriff. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-18_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, I should like to speak in support of the amendment. I certainly prefer the use of the 120 full-time sheriffs rather than justices of the peace. The authorities will find it much easier to get hold of full-time territorial law officers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-18_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I believe that justices of the peace have a somewhat different role from that envisaged in the Bill, so I support the amendments. On the question of the Scottish Parliament, my noble friend on the Front Bench is right that it asked Westminster to do the job. Although we hope not to do anything that the Scottish Parliament would not want to implement, it has given us the job. It is up to the Minister to keep in touch on what the Scottish Parliament wants. I take it that he has consulted on the amendment.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I do not know whether noble Lords are trying to convince me to accept the amendment. If your Lordships really want a long debate, that is fine, but we listened to what was said in Committee, thought about it, decided that it was a good idea, and had another think about it. I do not know why I am being criticised for that. We heard your Lordships' views, we listened, and we have changed our minds. We do not want to get into a constitutional debate on who likes the measure in Scotland. We like it down here; it is a reserved matter and we accept it.
<P>

<a name="11210-18_para5"></a>While I am on my feet, I shall speak to the other two amendments that are in my name. Amendment No. 99 is a technical amendment. It tightens up the effectiveness of the operation of the Bill by removing a potential source of confusion. It could cause confusion if it were not absolutely clear under which provision a search warrant was being sought or granted. Deleting the reference to Xconstable" will remove the potential for confusion.
<P>

<a name="11210-18_para6"></a>Amendment No. 104A is a drafting amendment to include Part 6 with those other parts of the Bill that will come into force on Royal Assent. Part 6, which creates very serious offences, should come into force as soon as possible. We intended to have a commencement order and another order relating to Part 6. There was an oversight in the original drafting as Part 6 should have been in the same list as the other parts that come into force on the day on which the Bill is enacted. I hope that that meets with your Lordships' approval.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-18_spnew4"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his agreement.
<P>

<a name="11210-18_para7"></a> On Question, amendment agreed to.

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 XEXPIRY
<br>
(1) Subject to subsections (2) to (5), and without prejudice to any other provisions of this Act&#151;
<br>
(a) Parts 3, 4, 5, 10, 11 and 13 of this Act shall cease to have effect at the expiry of two years from the date on which the Act is passed; and

(b) Parts 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of this Act shall cease to have effect at the expiry of five years from the date on which the Act is passed.

(2) If the Secretary of State considers that it may be appropriate that any Part of this Act should continue in force without amendment beyond the expiry of its specified period, he may consult such persons as seem to him appropriate to obtain their views as to whether that Part can safely and properly continue in force without amendment.
<br>
(3) If, following such consultation, the Secretary of State certifies that no substantial grounds have been advanced as to why that Part should not continue in force, he may by order provide that that Part of the Act shall continue in force for a specified period not exceeding five years.
<br>
(4) Where any Part of this Act is extended by virtue of subsection (3) it may be further extended in like manner as set out above.

(5) An order made by the Secretary of State under subsection (3) or (4) must be made by statutory instrument and may not be made unless a draft has been laid before and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament."

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="11210-18_para30"></a>The noble Viscount said: My Lords, after that brisk, delightful canter, we now come to the question of sunset clauses. The concern that the Bill has been pushed through with extreme haste has been patent throughout our debates. There has been no time for reflection and discussion, or for interested parties or those who can impart knowledge to input matters into our thoughts, as would happen in more normal proceedings.
<P>

<a name="11210-18_para31"></a> It should be a principle that one does not legislate in haste. If one has to do so, the matter should be reconsidered in a relatively short time, and the Bill should be impermanent so that issues can be properly revisited. To that end, two alternative sunset clauses have been tabled, one of which is in my name and the other in the much more distinguished names of two Opposition Front Benchers.
<P>


<a name="column_1199"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1199</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-18_para32"></a>I shall explain the difference between the two in a moment but, first, I shall deal with the necessity of having such a sunset clause. The Home Secretary said that he would review the Act after a while to see how it was working. I am sure that that should be done, and I have no possible objection to it. If criticisms are made, even if they appear to have some force, the battle will still be whether anyone will find the time to legislate on them. It is necessary to have a provision that the Bill will lapse after a certain time and then the Government can re-enact such parts of it as are efficacious and without problem, and alter those parts that are undesirable.
<P>

<a name="11210-18_para33"></a>My amendment specifies two separate periods. The more worrying parts will expire after two years. It is fair to say that that is fairly academic in relation to Part 13 because the House has accepted the Government's earlier sunset clause for that part. Other parts would expire after five years. I readily confess that I have made the split merely to follow the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and others. I have not applied my own mind to the segregation.
<P>

<a name="11210-18_para34"></a>When this matter was debated in Committee, the Minister spoke to certain parts of the Bill which he suggested were unlikely to be objectionable and, therefore, did not need a sunset clause. He may have been right about some of those parts; he may have been wrong. My attitude was ideally summed up by the noble Lord, Lord Bach, last Tuesday, when he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XWe are attempting to deal with the problem. Whether this course provides the right answer, only time will tell".&#151;[Official Report, 4/12/01; col. 744.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-18_para35"></a><P>

<a name="11210-18_para36"></a>That is the truth of the matter. There may be parts of the Bill which the Minister or, indeed, some noble Lords, think are unlikely to be objectionable; they will probably turn out to be the ones that give rise to the worst problems. There are parts of the Bill about which people have expressed great concern; it may be that some of those concerns will prove to be unnecessary. But we do not know&#151;and that is the product of hasty legislation.
<P>

<a name="11210-18_para37"></a>My amendment differs from the one proposed by the Opposition Front Benches in that I have suggested that if the Secretary of State wishes a particular part or parts of the Bill to continue in force, and, as far as he is aware, there is no reason why that should not be done without amendment, then he shall, if he wishes to pursue that course, consult the appropriate people to obtain their views as to whether that part of the Bill can safely and properly continue in force without amendment. By pure chance, that ties in very well with the proposal for a review, because the review will constitute the consultation and reveal whether or not there are objections to that part of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="11210-18_para38"></a>If, following that consultation, the Secretary of State is in a position to certify that no substantial grounds have been advanced as to why that part of the Bill should not continue in force, he may continue it through secondary legislation. On the other hand, if there have been any substantial objections to it, he will have to proceed by way of primary legislation. So the contentious will come back to Parliament through primary legislation&#151;as is intended in the amendment <P>


<a name="column_1200"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1200</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the Opposition Front Benches&#151;but, in an attempt to satisfy the point made to me by the Minister, my amendment would give the Government power to continue without primary legislation those parts of the Bill to which, after experience, no one takes any real objection.
<P>

<a name="11210-18_para39"></a>I hope that this will accommodate the points made by the Minister when we debated sunset clauses on the previous occasion. I see the force of the argument that there is no point in Parliament re-enacting measures which have proved to be wholly unobjectionable. I hope that my amendment will prove to be a suitable compromise and will appeal to the Minister. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-18_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, the noble Viscount has advanced the cause of Amendment No. 105, with which my Amendment, Amendment No. 106, is grouped.
<P>

<a name="11210-18_para40"></a>The essential difference between the noble Viscount and myself is that he believes that following an informal review&#151;which may or may not produce a fully valid answer&#151;where no questions are raised about certain parts of the legislation, those parts may be continued by affirmative order. He believes that that may be a satisfactory conclusion. We, having filleted the Bill slightly differently, if I may put it that way, have concluded that, because of the emergency process we will have to go through to put the Bill on to the statute book&#151;which is what we are all determined to do&#151;the only way this legislation should continue is through the full parliamentary process.
<P>

<a name="11210-18_para41"></a>I do not need to speak for long on this matter. We have always made it plain that this is an emergency Bill, the principles of which we accept and agree. We have disagreed with the detail that was inappropriate for such legislation and we have disagreed with the process. Even now, after seven consecutive days, with a one day interval, this is still an ill-considered piece of legislation. We go to Third Reading tomorrow, for which amendments have to be tabled by midday. After seven solid days of debate on this matter, if we have time to think seriously of what we are about I would be extremely surprised.
<P>

<a name="11210-18_para42"></a>Whatever happens after the Bill leaves the House, the chance of any further detailed consideration is remote. We believe that a more severe examination, in due time, is appropriate. That is our reason for tabling Amendment No. 106, which, in relation to the more controversial parts of the Bill, requires a short sunset clause. The less controversial parts of the Bill, in common with the noble Viscount's amendment, could last for a somewhat longer period.
<P>

<a name="11210-18_para43"></a> The principle of Xsunsetting" the Bill is, in effect, accepted by the Minister's right honourable friend the Home Secretary. The concessions that he has made in this area are welcome but they do not go far enough. It is with that in mind that we have tabled the <P>


<a name="column_1201"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1201</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment. I hope that it will be supported when it comes to a vote and that the noble Viscount will not press his amendment.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I support the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith. We believe, in principle, that emergency legislation&#151;unless it is very simple indeed&#151;should have a sunset clause. That is why, for example, the Football Disorder Bill, which was enacted a couple of years ago, is coming back next week in a new form of primary legislation. We believe that is the right course for that legislation, and even more the right course for this Bill.
<P>

<a name="11210-19_para0"></a>The more contentious a provision, the sooner the sun should set on it&#151;and aspects of this Bill are very contentious. We have had lengthy debates on such aspects at Second Reading, in Committee and now at Report stage. While the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, has analysed the problem correctly, he has come up with not the most attractive solution. Unfortunately, when it comes to the issue of consultation, the Home Secretary can, of course, choose the people with whom he consults. No doubt he can find helpful people, both in your Lordships' House and elsewhere, with whom he can consult and who can say, XAll is well". I shall not suggest the names of those whom he may choose for that purpose.
<P>

<a name="11210-19_para1"></a>We believe that it will be much better to take the simple and direct course and to have proper reconsideration of this legislation in Parliament, where we will have a proper opportunity to consider the parts that are contentious and the parts that turn out not to have worked well. We should do that in due course and in proper time. If provisions turn out to be unobjectionable, it will not take any time to put them back on the statute book. If any are contentious or remain objectionable, they need proper consideration&#151;particularly in the other place. We strongly support Amendment No. 106 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, which is more or less identical in its effect to an amendment jointly tabled by our parties in the other place. I echo the noble Lord in hoping that the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, will not press Amendment No. 105 but will allow the House to go straight to a vote on Amendment No. 106.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, what would happen if the Opposition did not like another Bill and chose this measure as a pretext for attacking it? That is possible in either House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure that I follow the problem that the noble Lord sees. If the Bill or parts of it come back in new legislation, it will be debated. I do not see how it would be relevant to consider other Bills when dealing with further consideration of the Bill before us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has not been in the House as long as I have. I have seen <P>


<a name="column_1202"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1202</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>governments and oppositions use legislation for purposes not directly connected with a Bill. It may be that the current Opposition, faced with a general election that may be only a year away, would see some advantage in a debate when they would not have one otherwise. I believe that the Opposition should not be so rewarded.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, it has been customary for years, when emergency legislation has been in the national interest, to ensure that such a measure does not become a permanent part of our law&#151;more especially so, if it had to be rushed through. That is true of most emergency legislation to my recollection, which goes back rather a long way. As I said in Committee, it would normally be highly desirable for members of all Front Benches to agree something. If that has not and cannot be done, it will be necessary to accept a suggestion of the kind proposed by my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith, which seems ideal in the circumstances. I hope that Members of all parties will be glad to accept it.
<P>

<a name="11210-19_time0"></a><H5>7.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, this is the first time since I entered the House that I have witnessed a Cross-Bencher being so squeezed by the two Opposition parties. It is for the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, to decide what to do with his amendment, which should not be for the convenience of the Conservatives or the Liberal Democrats. Not that I am encouraging the noble Viscount to press his amendment.
<P>

<a name="11210-19_para2"></a>Amendment No. 105 may not fit parliamentary niceties but it is more intelligent than Amendment No. 106. That is not to disparage the Conservative Opposition&#151;far from it. However, Amendment No. 105 is more practicable because implicit in it is that a good part of the Bill should remain permanently in force.
<P>

<a name="11210-19_para3"></a>The amendments would virtually time limit the whole Bill. As the measure has progressed through both Houses, we have introduced two major sunset clauses that time limit the detention and justice and home affairs powers. The amendments would commit Home Secretaries to keep returning to Parliament with new legislation. The big pressure in future will be for more than one Bill. The complaint has been made that the measure's content should extend to two, three or maybe even four Bills&#151;exactly as was said by my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis. The Act would be used as a proxy to fight other legislation. That tactic is well known in the other place but I imagine that does not happen here.
<P>

<a name="11210-19_para4"></a>I am sure that we would want to retain the power in Part 9, which deals with aviation security, to remove intruders from airfields. It beggars belief that towards the end of the sunset, persons should be able to say, XSoon we will be able to get on to airfields because the authorities will not have the power to remove us". We are making sure that civil nuclear sites will be secure from terrorist attack. But will we lift that protection in 2007?
<P>


<a name="column_1203"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1203</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-19_para5"></a>The Bill also outlaws aiding and abetting persons to make nuclear weapons. It is inconceivable that we would want to remove that measure in three, five or 10 years. Is it being suggested that while technicians who work with the Ebola virus will be checked out between now and 2007, we should flag up in advance that we shall not be bothered after then but may try to find some parliamentary time? I shall give way if the noble Lord, Lord Elton, insists.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-19_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether it has occurred to the Minister that 2007 might be high time to close the loopholes found during the intervening period.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-19_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that that is a serious suggestion. All Bills are amended from time to time. I have said that we took stock across Whitehall to make precautionary moves to close gaps in legislation in the light of terrorists rewriting the rule book on September 11th. Before that, there had been many little niggles in various legislation but there had been no massive push for parliamentary time.
<P>

<a name="11210-19_para6"></a>We acknowledge that the Bill introduces powers that must strike a fine balance between individual liberty and the security of the state. No one would say that the Bill is perfectly drawn, so we have introduced safeguards. There will also be a review of the mandatory powers in Part 11, if they are ever used. We want to go the voluntary route on data retention but if we go the statutory route that has its own built-in review.
<P>

<a name="11210-19_para7"></a>We have included a review of the asylum and detention powers after 15 months, then annually thereafter. Any part of the Bill that amends the Terrorism Act 2000 will therefore be reviewed annually as part of that legislation's requirements where a report on the Act's operation must be laid before Parliament at least once every 12 months. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, has been appointed to undertake those reviews.
<P>

<a name="11210-19_para8"></a>We are not convinced of the need for more sunset clauses covering parts of the Bill or the whole measure. However, the speed with which this legislation is being passed must be recognised by the Government.
<P>

<a name="11210-19_para9"></a>As I have said before, eight days would probably have been par for the course, plus or minus two days. I accept that the root cause of the problem is the gap between the stages of the Bill. As far as Ministers are concerned, the Bill is bad enough without the Opposition getting at it in terms of keeping track of the process between stages where there is no such gap.
<P>

<a name="11210-19_para10"></a>Therefore, having the whole Act reviewed is a matter which we wish to take forward and I hope that it will meet with approval. I would not like to be tied to what I say next, but the words are the best I have at the moment. Between 9.30 a.m. and 12 noon tomorrow, noble Lords on all sides of the House will be able to table amendments for Third Reading, which I now discover is a very useful lifeboat in legislation, although it is not available in the other place.
<P>


<a name="column_1204"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1204</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-19_para11"></a> I am proposing a new clause which will sit somewhere in the latter part of the Bill, probably Part 14. but before Clause 122, as it is now. There will be a statutory review of the Act in addition to all the other Xsunset" clauses and reviews which already appear on the face of the Bill. It is a small, new clause. The Secretary of State shall appoint a committee to conduct a review of the Act. He will seek to secure that at any time there will be no fewer than seven members of the committee. It may be more, but seven is the minimum. Every person on that committee will be there only if they are a member of the Privy Council.
<P>

<a name="11210-19_para12"></a>The committee will complete a review of the operation of the Act with full access to all the information including that from the security services and so forth. A report will be sent to the Secretary of State not later than two years after the Act is passed. The Secretary of State will be bound on the face of the Act to lay a copy of that report before Parliament as soon as reasonably practical. We shall then say from the Dispatch Box in this House and the other place that we shall guarantee that the business managers will arrange dates and days in both Houses when the report will be debated. It will be detailed.
<P>

<a name="11210-19_para13"></a>It will be no use anyone saying, XWill you accept the recommendations?" That cannot be said at this point. If such a report is laid with suggestions for amendments to the Act, if they are not accepted the Ministers concerned will need to have very good reasons for not doing so, bearing in mind that people will have had access to all the relevant information and had a good review of the operation of the Act over the period of two years. It will then be for both Houses to make a judgment on the content of the recommendations.
<P>

<a name="11210-19_para14"></a>Subject to any drafting changes, tomorrow we will introduce a new clause to that effect. I hope that will meet your Lordships' desire. We are rushing the legislation and there are no gaps between the stages allowing for mature consideration of the issues raised. However, in the small gaps, such as over the weekend and not sitting on Friday, we have managed to meet some of the issues raised in debate. We hope to have further proposals to meet some of the conclusions reached last Thursday by your Lordships as regards the defeats that the Bill suffered. On some aspects we are seeking a reversal, but we also hope to bring forward what we believe to be a positive modification of some of the key proposals. We have not completed our conclusions; I do not know whether we shall be able to lay amendments tomorrow in this House or later in the other place. We have not completed our discussions and review.
<P>

<a name="11210-19_para15"></a> Therefore, I hope that I have said enough to enable noble Lords not to press either of the amendments and to accept our best endeavours to make sure that the Act receives a thorough review and that both Houses have adequate time to debate the conclusions reached by the review in a reasonable period of time.

<P>
<A NAME="11210-20_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Bledisloe: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for that reply. He said that there are offences in the Bill&#151;for example, invading <P>


<a name="column_1205"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1205</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>airfields&#151;which we shall undoubtedly need. The answer to that point was made by the noble Lord, Lord Elton. We shall want some kind of protection of that kind, but it is doubtful whether the clause in the Bill at the moment will be right. That is why the matter needs to be thought through again.
<P>

<a name="11210-20_para0"></a>Obviously, it is helpful that there should be a review of the Act of the kind indicated by the noble Lord. He further indicated that there would be a debate in the House about it. But what he did not indicate&#151;and I am sure that he is not in a position to do so&#151; is that the criticisms then made will be brought forward in legislation. The difference between a review and a Xsunset" clause is just that. If there is a Xsunset" clause it is inevitable that the matter will have to return to the House&#151;unless the noble Lord likes my amendment which he was kind enough to describe as Xintelligent" and which enables him to re-enact more simply matters which were not controversial.
<P>

<a name="11210-20_para1"></a>No one will be surprised to hear that I still believe that my amendment is better than that advanced by the Front Benches opposite. Quite frankly, the objection made by the noble Lord, Goodhart, that the Minister could just decide who he consults was fanciful. Quite obviously, he would have to consult Justice, the Law Society and so forth. But pride of authorship will not drive me to pressing my amendment because what is vital is that we should continue to insist that we have a Xsunset" clause. It can well run with the review, which we are delighted to have. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<A NAME="11210-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, now that we have completed our consideration of the Bill on Report, the debate on the Unstarred Question can be extended to one-and-a-half hours. Save for the noble Lord, Lord Renton, opening and my noble and learned friend Lord Williams replying&#151;whose time allowance remains as set out&#151;the Back-Benchers now have 11 minutes each, except for the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, who is speaking in the gap and who therefore gets four minutes.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what steps they will take to make the wording of Acts of Parliament easier to understand and more certain in their legal effect.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I rise to ask this Question with even greater pleasure after what the noble Lord the Chief Whip has said.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para1"></a>It is often said that this proposal is a contradiction and that making statutes easier for lay people to understand may destroy their legal effect. But in spite of that risk, I suggest that it is in the public interest that the Government and Parliament should try to improve legislation to make it easier to understand and less ambiguous and to make it more certain in its legal effect.
<P>


<a name="column_1209"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1209</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para2"></a>As long ago as 1547, the teenage King Edward VI pleaded for that to be done, and efforts have often been made since then. However, in the past 30 years the tendency has been to avoid enacting statements of purpose and of principle but to attempt to cover in detail the many hypothetical circumstances which might arise and do not always arise. That system often fails to anticipate some of the circumstances which do arise. The result has added to the problems of interpretation and led to a huge increase in the work of the courts, especially of the Court of Appeal and of the Law Lords in your Lordships' House. I therefore urge the Government to increase greatly the use of statements of purpose and of principle.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para3"></a>Although detailed provisions are sometimes necessary to define people's rights and duties, especially in fiscal legislation but also in some other legislation as well, they should, even when necessary, be preceded by statements of purpose. No harm would be done, and often clarification would be added. Indeed, such statements will always enable detailed provision to be better understood, not only by enabling the drafting of obscurities to be overcome but also by filling in gaps which are left by attempting to legislate simply to cover in detail hypothetical circumstances.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para4"></a> Since 1870 there has been only one official committee to advise government and Parliament on the drafting of Acts of Parliament. That committee sat from 1973 until 1975 and was the Committee on Preparation of Legislation. I was its chairman and the noble Lord, Lord Richard, who is not in the Chamber at present, was a valuable member. We had an experienced and strong committee, including several leading parliamentary draftsmen who had reached the top in Whitehall or in Edinburgh.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para5"></a>The senior judges who gave evidence before us, including the late Lord Denning and, I believe, the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder, the then Lord Chief Justice, all recommended that the intentions of Parliament should be made clear by statements of principle.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para6"></a>It is a great advantage that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, will speak in this fairly short debate. He has made a full and brilliant survey of drafting in recent years. It is very long and very detailed, and at its last conference last summer the Statute Law Society benefited from the address which the noble and learned Lord gave. Now that he can speak for longer than six minutes, I hope that he will not feel restrained in the length of speech that he makes, more especially as I shall not speak for the whole of my 10 minutes. And the noble and learned Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, who I am very glad is to reply to this debate, may even find that he has a little more than 12 minutes left. I hope so.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para7"></a>Perhaps I may say to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, that I implore him not to be defensive in the reply that he gives to the debate but to be progressive in this matter, for it is one which affects all the people of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_time1"></a><H5>7.45 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   My Lords, I have known the noble Lord, Lord Renton, for many, many years. In the other place and in your Lordships' House he has been a ceaseless campaigner on the very important subject of making our laws more apparent, readable and relevant to all those who are affected by them; that is, our citizens.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para8"></a>I am also delighted to know that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, is taking part in the debate. He has an unrivalled knowledge of the steps taken over the past 125 years to improve the drafting and presentation of legislation. His lecture to the Statute Law Society on 19th June this year on XDrafting Quagmires" is a rich source of information and suggestions. I have read it several times and I refreshed my recollection of it a couple of days ago.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para9"></a>I took part in the consideration of the wording of one of the Acts which the noble and learned Lord quoted in that lecture, to which I shall refer. Clause 1 of the National Health Service (Private Finance) Bill was debated in your Lordships' House on 17th June 1997. I shall cite that clause as it was first worded:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> XNothing in this section affects the validity of any agreement made by a National Health Service trust if the agreement has not been certified under this section, but would have been an externally financed development agreement for the purposes of this section if it had been so certified".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-21_para10"></a>
Can anyone explain that? One tries to imagine how a doctor, an administrator or even a lawyer, if consulted on that clause, would have interpreted it. Mercifully when people asked what it meant, it transpired that the Explanatory Notes to the Bill spelt it out in plain English. The explanation read:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XThe validity of an agreement which meets the conditions set out in subsection (3) cannot be challenged merely because it has not been issued with a certificate under this section".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-21_para11"></a><P>

<a name="11210-21_para12"></a>After a great deal of pressure was brought to bear on the Government, who at first rejected the suggestion, the wording of the explanatory note was moved as an amendment to take the place of the original drafting, and it was accepted. That is illustrative of one aspect of the need to have our legislation much more clearly defined. The wording of Explanatory Notes can be used in place of archaic and contorted wording that is often unnecessarily obscure. So much of our modern legislation is affected in that way.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para13"></a> I pose a question to noble Lords here: when one looks at a Bill presented in this House, how often does one look at the Explanatory Notes first rather than the clause? The Explanatory Notes are normally written in clear English. I believe that for years campaigning has continued for the use of plain, direct, modern English and for the avoidance of archaic and outdated methods of reference. I am sure that the noble and learned Lord who is to follow me will expand on that subject.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Peyton, who I am sorry is not in his place, in his own inimitable way when a member of the other House spoke on this subject on 3rd November 1975. He said that to describe our modern statute law as often unhelpful to the reader was one of the most charming pieces of <P>


<a name="column_1211"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1211</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>understatement that he had ever come across. Those words are equally true today. It is time that the Government took an initiative and did something effective and drastic.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para15"></a>I had tabled an Unstarred Question in case that tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, was not selected for debate. In that Question I suggested that there might be a joint committee of both Houses&#151;it would be helpful if that was chaired by a Law Lord or a former Law Lord&#151;to consider the question of whether there should now be guidelines for those who draft our legislation and those who present it. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, has many achievements behind him and no doubt many ahead of him. However, it would be one of his greatest achievements to ensure that in the future, not only are there debates of this kind in the other place and in your Lordships' House but that action is taken on them to ensure that we have statutes and legislation that can be easily interpreted by the ordinary citizens of this country.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_time2"></a><H5>7.51 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-21_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Renton for asking his Unstarred Question. He raises an important point, as most legislation is undoubtedly difficult to understand. Sometimes one cannot help thinking that parliamentary draftsmen are a law unto themselves. I know not how they would react to the suggestion made by the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, of guidelines.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para16"></a>My background is one of industry and not of public affairs, Parliament or law. Some time in the past I had occasion to look up road transport law. I went to the appropriate Act and then to what I now know to be secondary legislation. It was all pretty incomprehensible. My understanding now, nearly 10 years later, is a little better. I now understand what the terms, XThe Secretary of State" and Xperson" mean in legislation.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para17"></a>No doubt the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House will point out that there are some very good reference books. But sometimes even they are wrong, especially on matters of detail. I shall be surprised if the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, does not tonight extol the virtues of the Keeling schedules. I shall not steal his thunder, other than to strongly support his view.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para18"></a>On a related issue I find it hard to understand why it is not possible to consolidate much-amended Acts on a regular basis. If that is thought to be too difficult, surely it means that the current drafting of the original Act, as amended, is not certain. I may be missing something, but I cannot understand why it is not possible to consolidate any Act or statutory instrument with a pair of scissors and glue. Perhaps the noble and learned Lord will explain what I am missing; I suspect that I am missing something. If that is too difficult for me to undertake, surely it is an argument in support of the Keeling schedule.
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para19"></a>My noble friend's Unstarred Question relates to Acts of Parliament, but similar issues arise with regard to statutory instruments. Some SIs, for instance, the <P>


<a name="column_1212"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1212</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations, have been amended many times, but for good reasons. If a copy of the regulations is ordered from the Stationery Office, the original version will be supplied. It is possible to order amended SIs if their reference is known, but amending the original would be a massive undertaking. Can the noble and learned Lord tell the House why such important and regularly amended SIs cannot be completely remade at least annually in their fully amended state? Furthermore, it would be helpful if the noble and learned Lord could explain how from time to time Northern Ireland construction and use regulations are able to be issued fully amended when they read directly from the regulations for England and Wales?
<P>

<a name="11210-21_para20"></a>I hope that I shall not be testing your Lordships' patience by raising yet another issue, more applicable to statutory instruments than to primary legislation. Multi-million pound orders are placed on the basis of engineering drawings, which are made according to international standards. Engineering drawings have to be unambiguous. Any mistakes in that regard can be extremely expensive unless detected early on in the tender process. My understanding is that drawings and illustrations are only used in SIs when unavoidable. When I read technical SIs, they are difficult to understand, even though I am a hands-on technical person. However, a drawing or illustration can be quite clear about what is meant. After all, a picture paints a thousand words. Does the noble and learned Lord agree that drawings and illustrations should be encouraged in SIs, and if not, why not?

It is rather strange that one of the few committee reports I received in the early 1970s was from his committee, and it was very important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Goodhart corrects me; it was Henry VI. In the Putney debates 1947 the point was made strikingly and forcefully that the laws then were completely beyond comprehension, needed to be written in plain English and were generally unsympathetic to the yeomen and public of England. More in his Utopia envisaged a world without lawyers. I was told today by a Russian <P>


<a name="column_1213"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1213</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the first decree that Lenin signed into force in 1917 was one abolishing lawyers. He had to bring them back in 1922, but at least he tried.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para0"></a>The problem of a lack of public understanding of what we do, and certainly a lack of understanding of not only the content of the laws we pass but their number and range, is a pressing problem. It is so difficult to contend with that I sometimes think that we avert our eyes from it. No government ever contemplate the notion of legislating less law. The pressure is always for more law. We then have our own tradition of law-making which, compared with other parts of the world, is specific, concrete and stated. I suppose one could look to some of the continental jurisdictions, which are much more content to deal in generalisations. Each style has its own virtues and defects, although I think that one is driven into the arms of the lawyer either way. Our present law-making has become so complicated&#151;there is so much existing law to have to work it in with&#151;that the complexity of our present law defeats the layman in all but very few cases. There are very few Sale of Goods Acts or Partnership Acts around these days, so that the layman is driven into the lawyer just as certainly he is with the continental style in which, although the generalisation may be understandable, the application really is not.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para1"></a>In making that point I shall comment on the Human Rights Act in two ways. First, it was perhaps of a more continental style but that is not surprising, given its origins. Secondly, I commend the parliamentary draftsmen. The Act was a consummate piece of skilled work on their part. Nothing I say tonight is aimed at the hard-pressed group of parliamentary draftspeople who, by and large, do a sterling task.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para2"></a>However, I want to suggest that we need to stop the rot in our legislation. The amount of new law is fast growing. One only needs to go to the Library of the House to see, simply in terms of shelf space, the feet occupied by primary, secondary and of course European&#151;directives and regulations&#151;legislation. It increases year by year inexorably. The interlocking of existing with new legislation often gives rise to the most arcane difficulties. It is multi-dimensional. In many spheres trying to understand what the law provides is almost like playing 3-D chess. Finally, most of it is additional. One rarely finds that the amount of law jettisoned by a new piece of legislation is anywhere near the length of the new.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para3"></a>The effect of that is to lead to greater specialisation within the legal profession. That adds another vicious impulse to the whole process. One now gets&#151;it is not a conspiracy&#151;highly specialised groups of lawyers whose commercial advantage is in the specialisation and complexity of which they are masters. They are the drivers of further legislative change. They are the only people who understand the existing law, so when any new legislation is contemplated, they are the only people who contribute to the preparation of it, let alone the passage of the legislation concerned.
<P>


<a name="column_1214"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1214</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para4"></a>Therefore, the whole process is becoming incestuous, introverted and largely self-serving. That is highly dangerous. One gets spin-off effects. For example, large companies are the only happy dealers with the new complex world of law because they are the only people who can afford the legal department which can master the regulation that surrounds them. That becomes a problem and a disadvantage for the small and medium-sized companies.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para5"></a>Everything is added to and accelerated by the breakdown in our community and national society life, which in turn creates a greater need for regulation. Regulation has not only the problem that it is complicated, but that if it is not complied with or evenly enforced it becomes counterproductive. The vast majority of the public feel that it is an imposition. In turn that begets further regulation to shore up the ineffective edifice of existing regulation. One then gets into an Italianate situation which fast leads to a break down of public confidence in the law and low level, and not so low level, corruption.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para6"></a> What can we do with Parliament? We could do much more to help legislators in both Houses. For example, today we were given a conformed version of the new legislation on the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Bill, which simply melded the amendments into the existing law so that it can be read sequentially. A great deal more of that could be done.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para7"></a>There was the Bill dealing with the Nice Treaty that we were trying to deal with recently. What an appalling task it was to try to fit the bits together. That could have been done for us, including showing the omissions as well as the additions. It is no good unless you show both. That is regularly done between solicitors when they are drafting and redrafting documents.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para8"></a>The Explanatory Notes&#151;a great new development, for which we give thanks I am sure&#151;could be improved in two respects: first, there could be additional explanation of difficult parts of new legislation. Again, the anti-terrorism Bill provides many examples of that. It has extremely difficult passages. I refer to Clauses 17, 103 and 104, with which I am particularly involved. I am sure that a great deal more of the work that is done for Ministers could be made available to us. That would help to draw more Peers into the debate. Even in my three and-a-half years, I have noticed a decline in the activists behind debates. Again and again one talks to colleagues who say, XWell, I just can't get my head around it". Everything should be done to make Bills as accessible to as many as possible.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para9"></a>Examples are hugely important. We had the debate last Thursday in relation to Clause 17 where the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, gave three examples of the workings of some of the amendments. It would have been hugely helpful had examples of all the main clauses been given right at the beginning, so that everyone could get their heads around things.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para10"></a>Further, there is help to the public. Explanatory Notes of legislation that affects the public should be available to them. There should be brochures in <P>


<a name="column_1215"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1215</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>popular form and in plain English. Where legislation deals with changes in sovereignty arrangements, I believe that, as I tried to persuade the House in relation to the Bill dealing with the Nice Treaty, we should send a tabloid to every household in the country which explains and illustrates in a vivid way what will happen to their sovereignty. We need to reach out to the citizens.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para11"></a>In conclusion, we need to cut back on law making. It is an essential prerequisite of everything else that we talk about tonight. We need to review the continental approach and perhaps set up a committee to deal with it. We need to keep lay justices firmly in their saddles because they are the only breakwater to the welling complication of criminal law. We need to take citizenship seriously. That subject is coming on to the school curriculum at the end of next year. That will open up a huge opportunity. We need post-legislative audits and impact assessments to chuck out legislation which does not do what its proponents said it would.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para12"></a>Finally, I suggest a displacement rule: first, that anyone coming to the House with new legislation should say what the cost is not just to the Exchequer but to the public; and, secondly, if at all possible, we should have suggestions as to displacement of existing laws that help reduce the flow in complexity.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Brightman: </B>   My Lords, I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Renton, for raising the question of what steps could be taken to make legislation easier to understand and more certain in effect.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para13"></a>If I have time, I should like to add to the proposals already made six steps that might be considered. The order in which I mention them is not intended to signify any particular order of priority.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para14"></a>I mention, first, the avoidance so far as possible and so far as appropriate of legislation by reference, as it is usually called. I mean, of course, the patchwork amendment of a section or subsection by adding words here and removing words there, instead of repealing the whole section or subsection and enacting it in its finally amended form.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para15"></a>A neat example of unacceptable patchwork amending came before this House recently in the form of amendments to Section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1967. The section had already been amended by Acts passed in 1982 and 1994. The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill was designed to introduce further amendments. Instead of repealing Section 1 of the 1967 Act, which was divided into six subsections, and inserting a new section in its amended form, the reader was left with the following formidable task. Line 2 of subsection (1) was amended by Schedule 11 to the 1994 Act. The rest of subsection (1) was amended by Section 145 of the 1994 Act and Clause 2(3) of the Bill. Lines 1, 2 and 8 of subsection (3) were amended by paragraph 34(a) of Schedule 1 to the 1982 Act. A new subsection (3A) was inserted by paragraph 34(b) of Schedule 3 to the 1982 Act. Subsection (5) was repealed by Section 146 of the 1994 Act. Subsection (6) was inserted by Section 145 of the 1994 Act and amended by Clause 1(2) of the Bill.
<P>


<a name="column_1216"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1216</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para16"></a>Can anyone doubt that it would have been far more helpful to have repealed the already amended Section 1 of the 1967 Act and substituted a new Section 1 incorporating the existing and the proposed new amendments? That story can be read in Hansard of 11th April 2000 at col. 154 and of 13th November 2000 at col. 117.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para17"></a>A second step that might be considered is the greater use of Keeling schedules. As your Lordships know, that device allows the draftsman to insert in the text of an Act the patchwork amendments that the Government want and to insert in a schedule the relevant section in its finally amended form.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para18"></a>In a complicated case, a Keeling schedule can be enormously helpful. There is even a precedent for using it to rewrite an entire part of an Act. That was done by Schedule 5 to the Housing Act 1996, when an entire part of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 was reprinted in its amended form in a five-page Keeling schedule.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para19"></a>A third step that might be considered is a greater use of consolidation Acts. The output of such Acts has suffered a severe reverse in recent years. In the four Sessions of Parliament between 1981 and 1985, no fewer than 37 consolidation Acts were passed. In the last four Sessions there have been only four such Acts. Is that due to a lack of staff, of funds, of initiative or of parliamentary time? I doubt whether it is the latter, because there is a fast-track procedure whereby consolidation Bills pass through both Houses on the nod, after being vetted by a Joint Committee of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para20"></a>A fourth step that might be considered is the more frequent inclusion in Acts of an index of defined expressions. Your Lordships will have noticed such an index, admirably laid out, in the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Bill which has just left this House. Section 68 of that Bill is divided into two columns: column 1 lists all the defined expressions used in Part 1; column 2 states the section in which the definition is to be found. That has two advantages. In the first place, the reader can instantly discover whether, for example, a word in common use&#151;the word Xdocument", let us say&#151;is used in its dictionary sense or has a statutory meaning. Secondly, in the latter case, the reader can instantly find out where that meaning is to be found.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para21"></a> A fifth step might be to consider the introduction of drafting guidelines, which have existed in the Community since 1998. Apart from the more obvious directions, such as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XOverly long articles and sentences, unnecessarily convoluted wording and excessive use of abbreviations should be avoided",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-22_para22"></a>
there is also the guideline:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XPreference shall be given to replacing whole provisions . . . rather than inserting or deleting individual sentences, phrases or words".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-22_para23"></a><P>

<a name="11210-22_para24"></a>My sixth and last suggestion is that the status of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel should be reconsidered. As your Lordships will know, that office is responsible only to the Prime Minister. As I understand it, that means that only the Prime Minister <P>


<a name="column_1217"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1217</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>can give directions to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel on drafting policy. If that is right, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel is in practice&#151;I intend no offence by this&#151;a law unto itself. These days, no Prime Minister could possibly direct his attention to the drafting of Bills.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para25"></a>I must be right, because any of your Lordships who have researched the origins of the Keeling schedule will have noticed that the instruction given to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to try out that device was given on 26th July 1938 by no less a Minister than Mr. Neville Chamberlain, the Prime Minister.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para26"></a>In the few minutes that I have left, perhaps I could go back to add a little flesh to one or two points. I spoke about the inclusion in an Act of an index of defined expressions. In some quarters there seems to be a strange reluctance to help the reader of an Act of Parliament in that way. In the 1997&#150;98 Session, the Government of Wales Act 1998, the Scotland Act 1998, the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 and the Data Protection Act 1998 were all passed. Each was a long Act. Each Act made use of from 42 to 67 defined expressions. Each Act had a most useful index of defined expressions.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para27"></a>The Competition Act 1998 of the same Session contained 59 defined expressions but no index. I tabled an amendment to add such an index. The Government rejected the amendment. The only reason given for the rejection was that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xit would not be appropriate".&#151;[Official Report, 5/3/98; col. 1370.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-22_para28"></a><P>

<a name="11210-22_para29"></a>I probed the matter further by means of a Question for Written Answer. It came back that an index would be,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xunhelpful for users".&#151;[Official Report, 20/7/98; col. WA82.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-22_para30"></a><P>

<a name="11210-22_para31"></a> How on earth could the inclusion of such an index be helpful in the case of four Acts of Parliament of comparable length, with a comparable number of defined expressions, but unhelpful in the case of the Competition Act 1998? The inclusion of such an index would, I calculated, have cost just one page of print.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para32"></a>The problem of legislation by reference&#151;if I may turn to that for a moment&#151;has a long history. Cabinet papers held at the Public Record Office under the reference PREM 1/284 show that the problem dates back to at least 1875, when a Select Committee of the other place was set up to suggest improvements in the method of legislation. The committee reported that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XThe practice"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-22_para33"></a>
of legislation by reference&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xseems to be increasing, and when carried out to excess makes the statute so ambiguous, so obscure and so difficult of comprehension that the judges themselves can hardly assign a meaning to it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-22_para34"></a>
That was in 1875. In a tax case in 1928, Mr Justice Rowlatt echoed that complaint. He said that five pages of piecemeal amendments to an existing section of a Finance Act rendered that section,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xperfectly unintelligible to any layman or any lawyer who has not made a prolonged study with all his law books at his elbow".

<a name="11210-22_para36"></a>The all-time high of the problem arose in this Session from the Social Security Fraud Act 2001. Having regard to the time, perhaps I could just give the reference. If anyone is interested in reading the story, it is in Hansard of 8th March 2001 at column 338.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para37"></a>I am afraid that I have spilled over my time, but, finally, the Question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, put me in mind of an observation made by the noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley, when moving an amendment to the Vehicles (Crime) Bill. He said:

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-22_para38"></a>
I inquired of the Library whether I could borrow that book. The Library could not trace it. I do not know whether the noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal may be able to institute a search for that book.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Howe of Aberavon: </B>   My Lords, I begin by apologising for my incompetence in not being on the List of Speakers for this debate. However, I invite the Leader of the House, with his reputation for radical progressivism, to endorse a change in procedure. I have asked my noble friend Lord Attlee if I might borrow the seven minutes that he did not use, and he was entirely happy with that. Perhaps that will commend itself to the Leader of the House; we shall see.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para39"></a>One aspect of the tragedy of this debate is the quality of the speeches made by my noble friend Lord Renton and by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman. Both of them have been campaigning on this cause for as long as the memory of man runneth, with immense assiduity and immense concentration. If I may, with due modesty, I claim a small role in the paternity of the Renton committee. In 1970&#150;72, I was Solicitor-General and had the task of overseeing the drafting of the Industrial Relations Act 1971, the European Communities Act 1972, the Consumer Protection Act 1971, the Fair Trading Act 1973, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Act 1973 and companies legislation. Consequently, I was able rightly to persuade the then Prime Minister, as no one else could do it, to establish the Renton committee.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para40"></a>The tragedy is that both the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, and my noble friend Lord Renton are monuments&#151;I mean this with the greatest respect&#151;to our collective failure to achieve almost anything. This is the third debate of its kind, specifically on this subject, in which I have participated since I became a Member of this House. The debates follow the same pattern, with plenty of examples to be presented, plenty of jokes to be made and plenty of grievances to be aired. However, does anything actually happen? That is the problem. It is not a problem of diagnosis; it is a problem of prescription and procedure. That is why I want the Leader of the House to respond to my second challenge, and be as radical and progressive in that respect as he is renowned for being in the Welsh valleys, where his reputation for radicalism, like that <P>


<a name="column_1219"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1219</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, is second to none. That is quite radical enough. There is a challenge for the Leader of the House.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para41"></a>It is possible to design machinery to improve the situation. Without any sense of vanity, I point to the proceedings taking place in the tax law re-write project&#151;in which we are not merely consolidating, but taking apart, putting together, re-indexing and, without changing the law, rewriting in plain English our primary tax legislation. It is a task that can be achieved by setting up a procedure to do it, and also by taking other action. The task is enormously difficult, but one must first clarify what the project is about, spot omissions and re-order it.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para42"></a>Forty people in the Revenue and Parliamentary Counsel Office are working on the tax law re-write project, addressing themselves to 9,000 pages of primary tax legislation. Our total output thus far, after four years, is 333 pages and the Capital Allowances Act 2001, which was passed last March. The task is hugely difficult and hugely time-consuming. However, in the 2001 Act we are making use of tables and sign-posts, giving examples and illustrations, and doing all the things that noble Lords said should happen. We can do that only by Xvirginalising" the land on which we are working, sweeping away the extraordinary jungle of antique statutes and replacing them with immense care by a new structure. That is the scale of that task to which we have to give still more resources and time. One always comes back to the balance between a hugely excessive volume of legislation and a hugely inadequate application of resources in money and mankind.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para43"></a> We are rewriting 9,000 pages of tax law but have produced 333 pages. Meanwhile, down at the other end of this building, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, urged on by people on all sides, is annually introducing 600 pages of new legislation. As I have said, it is as though we have been contracted to repaint Brighton pier while the Chancellor and his gang are busy trying to extend it to reach the French coast. That is the scale of the tragedy.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para44"></a>Less legislation entails a hugely determined effort by Prime Ministers and colleagues to identify what need not happen. We need not have had the overseas development legislation, and we probably do not need the export control legislation. We certainly do not need legislation on that scale. That is one issue that has to be tackled. The other issue is the need to have far more resources than have ever been devoted to tackling the first issue. The current constraint on the tax law re-write project is imposed not by the Revenue but by a shortage of draftsmen, despite the yeoman efforts that the Parliamentary Counsel Office has made to try to make people of real talent available to us.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para45"></a>That is where the Leader of the House comes into the act. He is now the channel, the funnel and the lightning conductor for all these untreated grievances to be addressed. I know that he knows that it will not be sufficient for him to go along to the Prime Minister and say, XIt's time that we did something about this, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Tony." Although we are talking about very small sums, he will have to mobilise a mammoth effort to build up over years a much larger crew in the Parliamentary Counsel Office. It will cost only a few millions more. When I was making my first Budget, the margin of error in the public sector borrowing requirement was a quarter of a billion pounds. So, within that type of framework, the Leader of the House would be able to find enough to make a dozen PCOs.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para46"></a>Ministerial responsibility has to be focused somewhere more effective than at No. 10 Downing Street, although I know not whether it is in the Lord Chancellor's Department or the Law Officers' Department. The point, however, is crucial. All the other efforts, as magnificent and effective as they are, are of no avail in the absence of, for the first time, a truly radical determination to build up a new structure to handle this material.

<A NAME="11210-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I am very pleased to speak in this debate. I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Renton, for having introduced it. I am also very grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, for his speech. Undoubtedly they are the two masters of statutory draftsmanship in your Lordships' House. Both have very long experience of it, and both have developed immense wisdom in handling the difficulties of statutory interpretation and statutory draftsmanship.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para47"></a>I am also very glad to follow the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon. I have had the privilege, with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, of serving as a member of what is now the Joint Select Committee on tax simplification, of which he is the chairman, which oversaw the re-write project of the Capital Allowances Act 2001. That committee shows what can be done. It is a first step towards making tax legislation simpler and easier to understand. It has also made an effective and useful start. However, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, said, after four years the committee has managed to deal only with the Capital Allowances Act and has in front of it a great sea of other tax legislation. That demonstrates the difficulty of the matter.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para48"></a>There is no doubt that the situation has grown significantly worse in recent years. Not only tax legislation, but all legislation tends increasingly to be longer, more complex and harder to understand. However, there was a golden age of parliamentary draftsmanship, which I would say ran from about the 1880s to the 1920s. Some of those Acts&#151;several of which are still on the statute book, such as the Partnership Act 1890 and the Sale of Goods Act 1896&#151;were clear, simple, easily understood even by non-lawyers and remained for decades the basic framework on which the law was built. The nature of some of that legislation may be due in part to the fact that Lord Salisbury was the Prime Minister when it was passed in the 1880s and 1890s. As he did not believe in changing the law, the parliamentary draftsmen may have had plenty of time on their hands <P>


<a name="column_1221"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1221</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which they were able to spend fruitfully in producing some extremely skilful legislation. Going forward in time, we have the masterpiece of the Birkenhead property laws of 1925. Since then, I am afraid that it has been downhill. As has been pointed out, there are all the faults of modern legislation.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para49"></a>There is possibly an even worse problem in that the statutes are not only difficult to understand; they become increasingly difficult to find. So much is amended and one has to trace through not only the original Act but all the subsequent Acts which have amended it. Increasingly, amendments to primary legislation are not only in other primary legislation but now in statutory instruments; the Henry VIII clauses.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para50"></a>I was looking, for example, at the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Bill, which we discussed earlier today. That makes significant amendments to the Terrorism Act 2000; the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999; the Public Order Act 1986; the Crime and Disorder Act 1998; the Biological Weapons Act 1974; the Chemical Weapons Act 1996; the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984; the Aviation Security Act 1982; the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994; the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987; the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906; and the Intelligence Services Act 1994. I probably missed three or four along the way and a number of other Acts are amended in minor ways. We are therefore presented with an extreme difficulty in finding out what the legislation is.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para51"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, pressed for the Keeling schedules. I know that the matter is very dear to his heart. However, it would have been difficult in the anti-terrorism Bill to publish Keeling schedules applying to all the different previous Acts. I am grateful to a distinguished judge from New South Wales, Mr Justice Handley, for drawing my attention to the practice in Australia. He is currently present in this country as the Inns of Court visiting fellow.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para52"></a>Under the Amendments Incorporation Act 1905, which was subsequently amended, it is provided that:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-22_para57"></a>
Something of that kind seems a valuable step forward. I hope that the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House will be prepared to ask the parliamentary draftsman to consider whether it is possible.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para58"></a>It is extraordinarily difficult to discover what the law is on any given subject at any given time. At present, the Queen's Printer's copies of statutes are never printed in an updated form. It is true that commercial organisations provide updated versions, but surely the Government should do it, too.
<P>


<a name="column_1222"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1222</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para59"></a>It goes somewhat beyond that, because increasingly we use the Internet for the purpose. Government statutes are printed on the Government's website but only in the original form of the statute. So if it is more than about six weeks' old, it is probably out of date. Surely, it should not be beyond the wit of whoever is responsible for government information technology to have a parliamentary website which can provide the text of legislation not only as it was originally enacted but as it is now&#151;and, furthermore, on any date in between. Quite often, a lawyer needs to know not what the law was when it was originally enacted; not what the law is on 10th December 2001; but what it was on 10th December 1995. That is the date of the transaction which is the subject of litigation.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para60"></a>I believe that information technology provides a real opportunity for the Government to update the system of providing information which will enable members of the public, or lawyers, to find out quickly, easily and cheaply what statute law is at any given time. Indeed, I would extend that principle not only to statute law but, as the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, mentioned, to the main statutory instruments.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para61"></a>I am most grateful for the introduction of the debate. As has been said, the situation occurs regularly but nothing seems to be done. I hope that at last the Government will be able, particularly by taking advantage of modern technology, to ensure that legislation is easily available, even if it remains difficult to understand. I hope that we shall receive some helpful answers.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_time3"></a><H5>8.36 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-22_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   My Lords, I should like to begin my brief contribution by congratulating my noble friend Lord Renton on persisting in his tireless quest to render the wording of Acts of Parliament both easier to understand and more certain in their legal effect. My noble friend's commitment to these changes is longstanding.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para62"></a>In 1975, while still in another place, as your Lordships are well aware, my noble friend chaired the Committee on the Preparation of Legislation. It was the first thorough investigation into the matter since 1875. Above all, the committee's report recommended in paragraph 11.8 that statements of purpose should be used when,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xthey are the most convenient method of delimiting or otherwise clarifying the scope and effect of legislation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-22_para63"></a>
That recommendation was, I might add, unanimous. After all, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, said in the course of a previous debate in your Lordships' House on the subject:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XIt is axiomatic that every Bill has a purpose".&#151;[Official Report, 21/1/98; col. 1589.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-22_para64"></a><P>

<a name="11210-22_para65"></a>It would be unfair to suggest that no improvements have taken place since my noble friend's report. There has been one of some significance. Explanatory Notes aimed at making legislation more accessible have been published, together with each Bill, from the start of the 1998&#150;99 Session. They represent, undoubtedly, a substantial improvement.
<P>


<a name="column_1223"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1223</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para66"></a>Nevertheless, it is fair to say that my noble friend's principal objective has not found favour with successive governments. That is probably why, in 1992, the Judicial Committee of your Lordships' House felt compelled to reach its decision in the great case of Pepper v Hart. There, as I am sure your Lordships are aware, noble and learned Lords relaxed the rule that hitherto prohibited the use of Hansard debates and other material as an aid to the judicial construction of statutes.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para67"></a>The judgment was intended to serve precisely the same objective as a statutory purpose clause. It is interesting to note that my noble friend's committee, deliberating between the years 1973 and 1975, was wholly opposed to the approach that the Judicial Committee felt ultimately compelled to adopt. Had my noble friend's committee met with success, it is likely that the judgment in Pepper v Hart would not have been necessary.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para68"></a>Meanwhile, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, has made a remarkable contribution to the debate so assiduously initiated and fostered by my noble friend Lord Renton. In his superb lecture, XDrafting Quagmires", delivered to the Statute Law Society on 19th June 2001, the noble and learned Lord illustrates the follies of legislation by reference, of semantic quagmires and of the absence of indices of defined expressions and suggests some enticingly painless remedies.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para69"></a>Your Lordships will be relieved to know that I have no intention of rehearsing the many perspicacious and apposite observations made by the noble and learned Lord in concocting his remedies. They are there for all noble Lords to read. Suffice it to say that I, together with my noble and learned friend Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, had the honour to represent the Opposition during the passage through your Lordships' House of the Competition Bill 1998. I recall the doughty battle fought by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, over the need for an index of defined expressions. How much easier indeed it would be to have such an index when manoeuvring over the especially inhospitable terrain that characterises that Act.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para70"></a>However, as the noble and learned Lord told us in his lecture and has told your Lordships today, the Government asserted in answer to his Written Question that such an initiative would be Xunhelpful to users". I hope that the recent acceptance and adoption of a similar index in the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Bill is a clear sign of a change of heart. Surely the time has come to abandon legislation by reference, to place Mr Keeling on his well deserved pedestal and to consolidate legislation as a regular habit.

<P>
<A NAME="11210-22_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, not for the first time, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Renton, for bringing this subject before your Lordships. This evening I have not heard anything with which I fundamentally disagree. Perhaps that is the radical approach that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, urged upon me.
<P>


<a name="column_1224"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1224</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para71"></a>Not long ago, when I was able to speak at the end of the gracious Speech, I suggested to your Lordships that interesting as the nature of our composition is, and continues to be, a more fundamental approach is how we carry out our work and whether we should change our working practices. None of the reforms put forward this evening is capable of being put into effect unless we have different working practices.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para72"></a>There is&#151;I stress that this is my personal opinion&#151;no justification at all for having a two-and-a-half month Recess as during that time this interesting, closely-argued work of scrutinising and improving legislation could easily be carried out. I float that as a personal view. If during a Committee stage 40 Members are interested and present, that is a surprise. I believe there are fewer than 40 of us present this evening. If we were able to timetable that efficient, useful work on legislation&#151;the kind that has been described in the debate&#151;during the Summer Recess, that would mean a commitment from each of your Lordships of perhaps one period of three or four days throughout the summer.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para73"></a>At present there is not sufficient parliamentary time to accomplish the ends that have been described this evening. I dissent from none of them: clarity, efficiency and economy in legislation. However, none of that can be brought about unless we are willing to work differently. I hope that we take this opportunity. My right honourable friend the Lord President in the Commons is eager to modernise procedures, not as some tabloid newspapers have foolishly said so that the Commons may work shorter hours, but so that it may work the same hours but to productive purposes.
<P>

<a name="11210-22_para74"></a>We could lead the way. In this House there is a substantial body of expertise&#151;and I must not say in parenthesis, expertise which may be lacking elsewhere, and I never thought to express it in any form of conceptual parenthesis. The present spread of legislation has increased and will continue to increase. On two forms of legislation&#151; secondary legislation and European-derived legislation&#151;I offer two innocent questions. Is secondary legislation adequately scrutinised? Is European-derived legislation adequately scrutinised? Both of those categories of legislation may affect the individual citizen in a more direct way than primary legislation. No one will carry out the remedial work if this House does not do it.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Howe of Aberavon: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the noble and learned Lord will allow me to respond to that point in an interrogatory fashion. Is it not remarkable that in this House&#151;without Standing Committees&#151;we are able to carry out more effective scrutiny of primary and European legislation than the other place? The noble and learned Lord has refrained from making the comment, but the fact is that we undertake nearly all the scrutiny. That does not mean that we should not continue to do that, but it indicates that it is a much wider matter for both Houses. Underlying that is the need for better preparation of legislation before it reaches this House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of <P>


<a name="column_1225"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1225</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Aberavon. Limiting myself to this House, my proposition is that we do not carry out our work sufficiently well because we work in an absurdly archaic manner. When we come to some modest propositions that I hope to be able to put before the House about our working practices, I hope that every noble Lord who is present this evening will support what I say.
<P>

<a name="11210-23_para0"></a> It is idle to say that we are a House of volunteers. It is fruitless to say that we have other work to do. If your Lordships want the negative batting-back of all propositions for improvement that have been put forward this evening, I shall say that I have other work to do in the morning and that I am only a part-time volunteer. That is the answer that is offered with the icy hand of history upon it. It is no good noble Lords correctly defining matters, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, has done.
<P>

<a name="11210-23_para1"></a>We know the prescription, but we do not put it into effect. We will not be able to put anything into effect until we attend to our working practices. That means working sane hours, using the mornings and using two-and-a-half months in the summer and not tottering through the night, as we frequently have. I shall give way to both noble Lords as I intend to be entirely non-controversial. The answer is not to totter through at midnight and at two o'clock in the morning, failing to do our work because we are too tired and exhausted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, I confess that I am puzzled by what the noble and learned Lord has said. Bear in mind that for years we have been making several thousand amendments a year to government legislation that has come to us from the House of Commons. That is a sign of our industry, our expertise and our determination.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, as I always know, the noble Lord, Lord Renton, has the figures at his fingertips. On many occasions the amendments are government amendments and government amendments of a technical and textural kind tend to imply that there has been an original failure and possibly even an original sin.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   My Lords, I believe that there is a distinction between the drafting of legislation and the scrutiny of legislation. As I understand it, this debate is about the drafting of legislation, its clarity and its usefulness to the general public. The noble and learned Lord has raised issues about the scrutiny of legislation and the manner in which this House scrutinises it. I make no complaint about that; but I hope that the noble and learned Lord will accept that there is a distinction. The two issues are obviously related but they are nevertheless distinct.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I do not accept that for a moment. I do not think that they are distinct. If we continue along that path we shall never achieve decent legislation. I listened most carefully, as I always <P>


<a name="column_1226"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1226</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>do, to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman. His six categories are irretrievably and rightly linked with drafting because drafting cannot be distinguished from scrutiny. Once we have proper, effective scrutiny in this House, which means changing our working practices, that will have an inevitable consequence. Legislation will be better drafted.
<P>

<a name="11210-23_para2"></a>One of the answers is to increase the resource in parliamentary counsel. They are extremely highly skilled technicians. Their work is of the highest quality but there are too few of them. We ask them to do too much too late in the day. One remedy is to increase their number. We have increased the number from 36 in 1997 when this Government came to power to 43 today. We are therefore on target to 47 full-time counsel. They are exceptionally highly gifted and skilled. One of the dangers in all governments is putting too late to parliamentary draftsmen their policy instructions. I shall give way to the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, in a second, because I do not want to lose my next invaluable pearl.
<P>

<a name="11210-23_para3"></a>I put this forward to your Lordships in a genuinely co-operative spirit. One way to improve scrutiny which would undoubtedly improve drafting is to wonder whether the carry-over rule has any sensible function. If we do not have that rigid carry-over rule and, nevertheless, have done extremely good work on Bills, would it not be wiser to accommodate at least some Bills in a carry-over system?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-23_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord also think that there is inadequate scrutiny and inadequate time for scrutiny in another place? I recollect from my days in another place that the process there is more streamlined and does not achieve as much. There is, therefore, more work to be done in your Lordships' House. But part of the remedy surely lies in another place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-23_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, that may well be so. However, at this time when we are defining our functions, our critical function should be the scrutiny of new legislation. As the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, indicated, it may well be the review of existing legislation. One of the reasons why we should be composed differently from the House of Commons&#151;in other words, not wholly elected&#151;is that we bring a different range of skills, experience and expertise to a different category of work. It may well be that the House of Commons fails to give adequate scrutiny but that should be no excuse why we should not redouble our efforts.
<P>

<a name="11210-23_para4"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, asked about the attachment to statutory instruments of diagrams and so on. I put it generally; I think that it is a fair paraphrase. He knows that where appropriate maps and diagrams are sometimes attached. Where they are not, it is because of the fear of ambiguity which, as he knows with his experience, obtain in technical drawings as easily as in verbal descriptions.
<P>

<a name="11210-23_para5"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, said that we need the machinery to make these desirable consequences occur. I agree entirely. <P>


<a name="column_1227"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column 1227</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>But that is in the hands of this House. If we are determined to set up machinery which will work, it means extra financial resources, extra clerking resources for the committee&#151;again, that is a difficult skill&#151;and the extra resource of noble Lords determined to do the work for which we are supposed to be here. I had thought that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, was about to intervene.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-23_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Howe of Aberavon: </B>   My Lords, I do not question the validity of the noble and learned Lord's point. Of greater importance surely is the continued enhancement on a much larger scale of the offices of parliamentary counsel. It is the time and resources that they are given that enables the product to be in a far better condition when it reaches either House. The six principles of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, have to be applied when preparing the primary product.
<P>

<a name="11210-23_para6"></a>I agree with the noble and learned Lord that we may have to enhance our own resources. But of far greater importance is the enhancement of the primary workforce.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-23_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I have already made that point. We are not in disagreement. I repeat the figures. There were 36 parliamentary counsel when we came into office. Our target is 47. We have got up to 43. Parliamentary counsel have a distinct and rare skill.
<P>

<a name="11210-23_para7"></a> I do not believe that these topics are capable of being distinguished. They must work together. I have heard nothing today with which I fundamentally disagree as a matter of principle. The noble Lord, Lord <P>


<a name="column_1228"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Goodhart, said that we do not use IT effectively these days. Most speeches in the House of Lords, sitting judicially, are available on the Internet that afternoon. That is a distinct forward step.
<P>

<a name="11210-23_para8"></a>I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, who mentioned that Explanatory Notes have been a success. They were somewhat derided by those who were able to remember that it was never like that when they were a pupil. That is normally the conclusive argument that one hears on these occasions. Advance drafting is now more available. Pre-legislative scrutiny is also available. A number of Bills have been the successful objects of pre-legislative scrutiny. Noble Lords will not want me to give too many illustrations but, for instance, the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill, the Limited Liability Partnerships Bill, the Financial Services and Markets Bill and the Food Standards Bill were all helped by pre-legislative scrutiny. A vast raft of Law Commission material is still available. I know that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, will point out to me that, although it appears non-politically controversial, some of it is: a good deal of it is not and it should be capable of being looked at in the fallow, arid dead times of the summer.
<P>

<a name="11210-23_para9"></a>I am sorry that I have gone over my 11 minutes but it was deliberate to address the principled approach your Lordships have all expressed. The gloomy consequence to which I come is that we do not do our work properly. The better, more hopeful, conclusion is that we could. I believe that we can only do that if we attend to the way we work in a rather more efficient, realistic and&#151;dare I say it?&#151;modern way.

[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Lord Skelmersdale) in the Chair.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-24_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Skelmersdale): </B>  Before I put the Question that the Title be postponed, it may be helpful to remind your Lordships of the procedure for today's Committee stage. Except in one important respect, our proceedings will be exactly as in a normal Committee of the Whole House. We shall go through the Bill clause by clause; noble Lords will speak standing; all noble Lords are free to attend and participate; and the proceedings will be recorded in Hansard. The one difference is that the House has agreed that there shall be no Divisions in a Grand Committee. Any issue on which agreement cannot be reached should be considered again at the Report stage when, if necessary, a Division may be called. Unless, therefore, an amendment is likely to be agreed to, it should be withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para0"></a>I should explain what will happen if there is a Division in the Chamber while we are sitting, which seems fairly likely. This Committee will adjourn as soon as the Division Bells are rung and then resume after 10 minutes.
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para1"></a>Title postponed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-24_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   Before we proceed, there is a mistake in the list of amendments for today. Under the name of myself and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, are Amendments Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9. In fact, I only tabled Amendment No. 6; Amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 9 were tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and the noble Viscount, Lord Astor.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-24_spmin1"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  I was aware of that but it may or may not be, looking at the list of groupings, that these amendments will be called at all. So perhaps we can start with Amendment No. 1 in Clause 1, that of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham.
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para2"></a>Clause 1 [Duty of local housing authority to formulate a homelessness strategy]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-24_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:

X( ) Any such review or homelessness strategy shall be part of the wider-ranging housing strategy of each authority."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="11210-24_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: I disown completely Amendment No. 9, which I do not recall having seen before and which seems to replicate Amendment No. 8 almost in its entirety. Wherever it came from it did not necessarily come from me. I wish to speak to all the <P>


<a name="column_CWH2"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH2</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendments in the first group in order at this stage. In addressing Amendment No. 1, I shall also be speaking to Amendments Nos. 2 to 5, 7 and 8. As I said, Amendment No. 9 can be deleted as I do not know who it belongs to.
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para5"></a>All these amendments are related to the review of homelessness and the subsequent strategy which local authorities will have a duty to prepare. Amendment No. 1 would make it a requirement that any such review should form part of a wider ranging housing strategy and should not be a stand-alone exercise. It will be apparent from the most cursory examination of this Bill that it places a duty to house a much wider range of those in priority need than in the past. It also gives almost unlimited time for decisions to be made and agreed by homeless people. Moreover it takes a very cursory examination of the statutory housing figures available to each authority to realise that they are faced with an almost impossible task in trying to provide all the accommodation predicated as being necessary for those in priority need.
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para6"></a>There are already over 11,000 people in bed and breakfast accommodation alone and those who are currently defined as a priority of the homeless amounted to 114,350 in 2000&#150;01&#151;a rise of 11 per cent over the previous year. By definition, before adding any further categories there is a need for as many permanent units of accommodation as possible, but between 1997 and 2000 the amount of new social housing built amounted to just 95,000 units, which does not in any way match the numbers required.
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para7"></a>In many cases, the extra duties in this Bill will make an impossible task worse for many authorities, even those with the ability to co-operate with other authorities. It must be right, therefore, that all housing authorities' requirements are set alongside the availability of both current and future accommodation so that realistic planning can be carried out. For this reason, it would seem only sensible for there to be a full housing strategy to incorporate the homes review.
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para8"></a>Amendments Nos. 2 and 4 would add a reference to rough sleepers to the requirement to ensure that accommodation is available for the homeless. The Rough Sleepers' Unit is currently responsible for helping people who sleep rough, but it is clear from the debate in the other place that the unit's long-term future is by no means settled and that, in due course, the responsibility may fall back to individual local authorities. For that reason alone, each individual local authority ought to be aware of how many rough sleepers are in its area. In any event, it should be co-operating fully with the Rough Sleepers' Unit to identify and help people. There is no mention anywhere in the Bill of rough sleepers. There must be some recognition of their existence, because in many instances they require permanent rather than just temporary help. As I have already said, the accommodation to which they and other homeless people require access will always be limited and they should be recognised as being part of that need.

<P>

<a name="11210-24_para9"></a>Amendments Nos. 3 and 5 would define those who would be deemed to be strategic partners of local authorities in the provision of housing and help to the homeless. It is inconceivable that any review of homelessness could be undertaken without all those who have either responsibility for, or a means of, providing housing for the public sector being included as an integral part of the strategy.
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para10"></a>In many authorities, housing provision now relies heavily on approved landlords in the private sector&#151;not only those with houses in multiple occupation, but others who work at the local authority on a regular, if ad hoc, basis who will be part of a landlords forum. Without such co-operation, there would be an even greater deficit of housing than there currently is. No review would be meaningful or accurate without their interests being represented.
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para11"></a>Amendment No. 7 would require the authority to refer in its homelessness strategy to its allocation scheme, including details of how it is drawn up, what is included and what its priorities are. This will become comprehensively important as the Bill progresses and as we see the number of people who will be included in the priority category and the very real difficulties that there will be in housing anybody else who is not within those categories.
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para12"></a>Amendment No. 8 would make it mandatory for local authorities to consult with the Housing Corporation, relevant housing associations and registered social landlords. Without the amendment, the need to consult would be discretionary only. That ties in with other amendments in the group. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-24_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I shall speak to my amendments in this group but, first I shall respond to the amendments spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. I understand her point about including homelessness strategies in the general housing strategy. The Government say in one of their draft codes of guidance that that could happen, if appropriate. It will become more obvious as we discuss the Bill that there has been a lot of bad practice by some authorities. When the Bill is passed, we should encourage local authorities to review their homelessness strategies thoroughly. They should not have to be part of the general strategy, but should be something better. My experience of the 1996 Act and everything that has happened since leads me to believe that this is the correct thing to do.
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para13"></a>On the other issue that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, raised, the matters of who local authorities consult with, this is quite important. My honourable friends in another place raised the issue of the role of registered social landlords. Since it was discussed in the other place there has been a good deal of discussion and some helpful letters and correspondence from the Housing Corporation. I hope we can deal with this issue but I am still not absolutely convinced that we have exactly what we need on the face of the Bill. I will be listening with interest to what the Minister says on this point.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para14"></a>I now wish to turn to my own amendment, Amendment No.6. I make no bones about it&#151;this is an opportunity for me to talk about an issue that I have been concerned about ever since the Government proposed the Supporting People programme. From April 2003, the programme will totally re-organise support for people living in the community. This particularly affects support services for homeless groups and specialist homelessness groups.
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para15"></a>The groups about which I am particularly concerned are the small voluntary organisations that give support to people who are perhaps going into tenancies, before they get into tenancies, or when they are between living in a group tenancy and then going into their own accommodation. That is the group I am particularly concerned about and I know that the Government, in their good practice guide, their homelessness strategy, point out that voluntary organisations will play an important role in some of these areas.
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para16"></a>Having raised this issue when it was first announced by the Government, as time has gone on and I have increasingly read articles in the housing press, my fears about what might happen have not been allayed. The groups I am particularly concerned about are small voluntary groups. At the moment, a great deal of their revenue&#151;and from my own experience I know this applies sometimes to women's refuges, for example&#151;is based on the benefit that comes their way from the clients in that particular refuge. Organisations like that are often run by a few people on a voluntary basis. The work they are likely to do, to bid into this process, will be quite difficult.
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para17"></a>The Government are continuing&#151;and have been for some time&#151;to send out a constant stream of consultation papers, through questionnaires, draft guidance and discussion papers. Local authorities have recently received their first round of implementation funding and they are now adding to this. They are recruiting teams and setting up new forums and preparing their own questionnaires and consultation papers for local providers. However, I wonder how some of the small organisations I have talked about are managing to deal with this and whether they are engaging properly in the programme. I would argue that it is difficult for many of these groups because they lack capacity within their organisation to do so. I would be interested to know if the Minister and his advisers have any advice to local authorities as to how they can protect these people and help them with the time and resources that will be required to take part in this process.
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para18"></a>The next point I would like to make concerns what will happen after 2003. We know about the budgets until then and there is an interim housing benefit, which I welcome. However, if new schemes are to become available after 2003, it is by no means clear where that money will come from.
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para19"></a>There are other Members of the Committee who will share my concerns, perhaps not here but later in our discussions. There are particular areas such as floating support for people who are in new tenancies for the <P>


<a name="column_CWH5"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH5</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>first time, and support for families who have been homeless. I know that the YMCA is looking at people coming out of foyers, are also concerned about the type of support that it will get. It particularly emphasised the fact that follow up work is essential on all fronts. I believe these types of organisations can sometimes supply it.
<P>

<a name="11210-24_para20"></a>Nevertheless, to be positive, I welcome the fact that the Government have already announced funding this year to help councils prepare and some of that funding has been ring-fenced. Another helpful thing that the Government have done is to decide to pay people supporting grants a month in advance, rather than in arrears and that will help some of the organisations about which I have been talking. However, I have some concerns about this and have spoken to the Minister. I hope that he will be able to reassure me on some of these points.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-25_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Perhaps I can ask the Minister a couple of questions arising out of the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. First, with regard to rough sleeping, I would not for a moment deny the seriousness of the problem, but will the Minister tell us how localised it is? It seems to me, from what I have read, that while it may be a local problem, it is also one that manifests itself in areas other than that from which an individual may have come. It is therefore something that needs to be dealt with on more than simply a district-by-district basis.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para0"></a>Secondly, when I first read Amendment No. 1&#151;and I do not for a moment disagree with my noble friend&#151;I did wonder how it could be otherwise than that a review or homelessness strategy would be part of a wider ranging housing strategy, because local authorities just as much as central government need to join up their policies. I then began to wonder whether it was not likely to cause some problems to put it in this way, because there are other areas of policy work and strategies that need to have regard to housing strategy for a development plan.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para1"></a>Having made that point, why is it necessary to provide for the authority to have these two powers at all? If they do not already have powers to review homelessness and to formulate a homelessness strategy, that makes a nonsense of local authority activity and goes to support the arguments my colleagues and I have made for a power of general competence, but I do not believe that that can be the point.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para2"></a>It is important to get on the record that it is not necessary to spell out a power such as this in legislation, because if it is necessary to say that a local authority has such powers, that must call into question equivalent powers in different areas. For that reason I ask the Minister to confirm that it is convenient as a matter of drafting and readability of the Bill, but not necessary for legislation. There must be other similar powers that, if they needed legislation to spell them out, would be open to challenge as not being within the vires of a local authority.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="11210-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   We have heard a lot of good sense in the past 15 minutes, based upon wide experience of being members of committees, chairmen of housing committees and so on. I am sure that the Minister will appreciate that that is because of anxiety, not nit-picking or meticulousness. The Minister and the ministry are well served if it can give assurances either that that which is being sought is not necessary, or that that which is being sought has been taken on board and will be taken account of in some other way.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para3"></a>The great concern of parliamentarians is, of course, to see things written on the face of the Bill. I am glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, rightly pointed out that there may not be a need for some of the things that have been mentioned to be written on the face of the Bill if we can understand what is being asked. It would have been unthinkable up to 10 or 15 years ago to have had a Bill dealing with the homeless. The homeless have always been with us to one degree or another and it is manifest of the Government's interest and determination to tackle the problem that they have found the time to produce this Bill in a very crowded legislative programme. We all know exactly what I mean in that context.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para4"></a>I accept everything I have heard pleading the case. But I am also willing to listen to the Minister when he tells us, as I am sure he will, that what is being sought is not necessary. Like many Members of the Committee who spoke earlier, I do not believe that a strategy can be complete without a direct reference to the homeless as a segment of our people&#151;Xour people" being the people that we try to look after in the committees. I hope very much that the Minister will be able to give the assurances that colleagues are seeking and I look forward to hearing what he has to say.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-25_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions   (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </B>  I agree with my noble friend. We have heard a great deal of good sense in the past 15 minutes and I hope that I shall be able to give the reassurances that noble Baronesses have been seeking in relation to what I suspect have in many cases been probing amendments.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para5"></a>I shall deal first with what the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said by way of introduction. She is absolutely right that the effect of the order will be to increase the numbers of people legally in priority need. She is right to say that the number of households now housed in bed and breakfast has gone up to 11,000. She is also right to say that the problem is getting worse. I do not believe for one moment that she is suggesting that the right course is not to acknowledge that the problem is getting worse, nor is it the wrong course to extend the priority need order to those who are genuinely in priority need; for example, 16 and 17 year-olds. We should treat them as priority needs. As a result, the problem with which we are all wrestling is how then one delivers on making the law fit the environment in which we now operate.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para6"></a>The noble Baroness described Xan impossible task" being made worse by legislative changes. I did not understand her to be saying that the legislation was a <P>


<a name="column_CWH7"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH7</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bad idea, but that it makes us face the difficulties with which we have to wrestle in determining how we deal with homelessness. Those are problems with which we need to deal, but we need to deal with them up-front and recognise that there are real problems that we all need to face.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para7"></a>I turn to the first amendment, which the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, also addressed. Her first amendment would require local housing authorities to incorporate their homelessness strategy into their wider housing strategy. At the moment there is no statutory requirement on local housing authorities to have a housing strategy although in practice it is necessary under the Housing Investment Programme framework. Because there is no explicit requirement it would be inappropriate to impose a statutory requirement for an authority to make its statutory homelessness strategy part of its wider housing strategy. However, I entirely agree with what the noble Baroness is saying; that an authority's statutory homelessness strategy will inevitably be an integral part of its wider housing policy. It has to be. Clear advice to local housing authorities on this matter will be given in guidance.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para8"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Maddock and Lady Hamwee, both made the point that there would be other strategies as well that might affect homelessness. That is plainly right and the guidance will focus on that as well because it is necessary for people to look at homelessness in a context that is much wider than simply bricks and mortar. I hope that that deals with the first amendment.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para9"></a>Amendments Nos. 2 and 4 relate to rough sleepers. They are not explicitly mentioned, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said in her remarks: therefore could we make it clear on the face of the Bill that homelessness includes rough sleepers? I entirely understand her concern. Of course we would want homelessness strategies to deal with rough sleepers. However, I hope that she will accept my assurance that rough sleeping is already covered by the definition of Xhomeless" employed in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para10"></a>The definition appears in Section 175 of the Housing Act 1996 and clearly includes rough sleeping, for it covers those who have no accommodation available for their occupation. Moreover, the Code of Guidance will make it clear that authorities will need to take account of rough sleeping in their reviews and in devising their strategies. The situation is legally covered, but if that is not sufficient&#151;which it probably is not&#151;we will also make it clear in guidance that the homelessness strategies must cover rough sleepers as well as everything else.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para11"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee asked specifically how localised it is. Rough sleepers frequently come from other areas. Frequently, people in rough sleepers' accommodation will tell you that they got on the train intending to go to Newcastle, but got off at Nottingham, for reasons that they are inadequately able to explain. The problem moves around. Prevention is vital in addressing all forms of homelessness in the future.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   That thought occurred to me as I made that comment. I was not sure whether the train line went that way. I should have said the Newark. We hope that prevention will also be addressed.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para12"></a>Amendments Nos. 3, 5, 8 and 9, would insert further definitions regarding organisations that the local housing authority must involve in its work on a homelessness strategy. The need for the local authority to work in partnership and not alone underlies the amendments. We entirely endorse that approach. A partnership approach is central to our proposals. We require local housing authorities, of which the noble Baroness has experience, to take a multi-agency strategic approach to preventing and responding to homelessness.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para13"></a>Clauses 1 to 3 set up the basis for such a strategy and require that it be kept under review. Amendment No. 3 specifies bodies whose role in tackling homelessness should be considered in the course of a local housing authority's homelessness review. The other amendments, which are to an extent consequential, would allow a housing authority to include references to actions to be undertaken by strategic partners in its homelessness strategy and Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 would oblige housing authorities to consult strategic partners and, in particular, the Housing Corporation, housing associations and RSLs, before adopting or modifying a homelessness strategy.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para14"></a>Many agencies are involved with people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless and it is important that those agencies work together to avoid duplication or gaps in provision. Local housing authorities should of course work with other authorities and agencies in conducting reviews and in drawing up strategies. We have in mind social services authorities and departments, health services and those administering housing benefit, among others.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para15"></a>Registered social landlords will be central to the development and implementation of homelessness strategies. In some areas they provide the majority of social housing and the transfer programme is increasing their importance in delivering services to tenants and in supporting local authorities in the performance of their statutory duties. I held a meeting with the key stakeholder organisations on 21st November to discuss the way forward on homelessness. I am pleased to say that it was agreed at that meeting that the Housing Corporation, the Association of London Government and the Local Government Association would work on an agreed programme for closer co-operation between RSLs and local housing authorities on tackling homelessness. I have asked to be kept informed of progress.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para16"></a>This morning, I met 15 of the major RSLs to discuss how they can help local authorities to meet their homelessness duties. That will be followed up early in the new year with a joint seminar for RSLs and local <P>


<a name="column_CWH9"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH9</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>housing authorities. A wide range of other bodies should also be engaged, including probation services and voluntary organisations working with young people or with those suffering from mental health problems. Organisations that deal with rough sleepers also have a vital role to play.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para17"></a>Again, I repeat for the third time that I agree with the noble Baroness that the involvement of bodies cited in her amendment are vital to ensure effective local strategies. As it stands, the Bill enables local housing authorities to ensure that the potential contribution of such bodies is considered at the review stage, that their activities may&#151;with their agreement&#151;be outlined in the resulting homelessness strategy and that they are consulted on the adoption or modification of the strategy. This is by virtue of the references at Clause 2(1)(c) and Clause 3(3)(b) and Clause 3(8), to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XXvoluntary organisations and other persons".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-25_para18"></a>
Registered social landlords, as non-profit-making bodies, fall under the definition of Xvoluntary organisations".
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para19"></a>Homeless and multiple occupation landlords, and members of landlords' forums and clearly Xother persons", and the housing corporation is a Xpublic authority", so all the persons or bodies mentioned in the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, are already covered. From what I have said, I hope that it is clear that we completely share the approach that she outlined in moving her amendment. I can, in addition, assure the noble Baroness that clear guidance will be given to housing authorities as to the organisations they should engage with throughout the process of carrying out homelessness reviews and formulating strategies.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para20"></a>We should steer clear of placing such detailed and prescriptive requirements on the face of the Bill. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, would be the first to criticise the Government, quite rightly, for placing too many tick-box requirements on the face of the Bill. The Government are confident that the Bill already achieves what the noble Baroness has sought to ensure by tabling those amendments.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para21"></a>Let me move to Amendment No. 6, which was tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, on supporting people. The noble Baroness will forgive me if I do not deal with the detailed drafting of the amendment because she has made it clear, in moving her amendment, that she wishes to use it as an opportunity to raise concerns about the supporting people programme. The noble Baroness stated her concerns about the Government's funding regime for supporting people and the potential effects, in particular but not exclusively, on small voluntary groups. I am pleased to be able to reassure her on this point. Supporting people payments will be determined by contracts entered into between the local authority commissioning body and the service provider, and these contracts will last between three and five years. Supporting people funds are not allocated via a bidding round.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para22"></a>My department is very sensitive to the concerns of small voluntary organisations regarding the impact of supporting people and has taken a number of steps to address those concerns.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para23"></a>These include research into the black and minority ethnic sector, which the noble Baroness did not mention but which is a concern to significant numbers of people, on the basis of which guidance is being produced. This guidance is due to be published in January. Whilst the guide and research was primarily aimed at the black and minority ethnic sector, this is predominantly made up of small organisations and therefore much of the content is equally relevant to all small organisations. The guidance is mainly intended for local authorities but also mainstream providers and black and minority ethnic-led providers.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para24"></a>My department, through the supporting people programme, has a contract with the Housing Associations Charitable Trust to disperse grant funds to small organisations. This money is intended to enable small local and community-based housing support agencies to participate in the supporting people implementation process, locally and regionally, by building the capacity of the voluntary sector and enabling support service agencies to participate effectively in the supporting people strategies and plans.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para25"></a>In addition, the supporting people team at the department is currently drawing up a proposal to provide funds for two capacity-building co-ordinators to work with local authorities to assist small organisations to develop their capacity to play an effective role in the provision of services. They will also aim to develop information systems with community organisations so the needs and experiences of their client group can feed into both local and regional supporting people planning processes.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para26"></a>A number of supporting people workshops have been organised to engage the black and minority ethnic sector in the supporting people programme and to encourage them to start preparing for implementation in 2003. Other events are planned for 2002, so there is a good deal of work going on to try to address the specific concerns. The noble Baroness raised the question of what will happen after 2003 but much of the answer to that will depend on what happens in the build-up to 2003. I shall write in more detail as to what the present proposals are in relation to post-2003. If the noble Baroness has particular concerns about what I have said&#151;and I do not ask her to raise them now as it is quite a dense answer&#151;I suggest she raises them with me. I shall be more than happy to have a meeting with her to discuss any particular concerns that arise out of the detail of what I have said in my answer to her important amendment, because the Supporting People programme has a significant impact on dealing with homelessness, in particular in relation to various preventative measures that we hope will become the norm among local authorities.

<a name="11210-25_para27"></a>Amendment No. 7 is the last amendment in the group that I have to deal with. This would place a further duty on a local housing authority when it has <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>formulated its homelessness strategy not only to refer to its allocation scheme in that strategy but also to set out the relative priorities that will be accorded to homeless people and others to whom a housing duty is owed by the authority under that scheme. This takes us well beyond the sensible limits of a homelessness strategy. The principal purpose of these strategies is for the housing authority, with the assistance of social services authorities, and in consultation with other bodies, including RSL and voluntary organisations, to set out how it will tackle and prevent homelessness in its area. This is no small task and it will not be made any easier by an unnecessary requirement to address issues relating to the authority's allocation scheme. However, if an authority thinks it wise to refer to its allocation scheme, it will be more than able to do so in its homelessness strategy.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para28"></a>New Section 167 provides a robust framework for authorities to allocate accommodation. It requires that reasonable preference be given to certain groups, including the homeless; and that the allocation scheme may be framed to give additional preference to particular descriptions of people within the reasonable preference categories; and that the scheme may also contain provision for determining priorities in allocating housing accommodation to people within the reasonable preference categories. I am sure that we shall explore the detail of those allocation schemes later in our deliberations. However, the allocation scheme is the proper place to set out the relevant priorities, not the homelessness strategy. I should also note that authorities are already required to provide information about their allocation schemes under Section 168 of the 1996 Act.
<P>

<a name="11210-25_para29"></a>I very much hope that I have answered all the particular points that have been raised in the course of this short but interesting and important debate. I hope to be able to persuade the noble Baroness to withdraw Amendment No. 1.

<A NAME="11210-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   I reassure the Minister that I have no intention of asking any questions and, therefore, do not in any way oblige him to rise again but I postponed my remarks until after he had spoken. My remarks will be brief and relate to Amendment No. 1. The noble Lord, Lord Graham, made reference to housing history with which we are all familiar. It has always seemed to me that since owner occupation has so steadily crept up towards 100 per cent, the minority of housing that is not in the owner-occupied sector has received both diminished attention and, to some degree, concentrated attention because of its significance and also because it was falling as a percentage.
<P>

<a name="11210-26_para0"></a>In contrast, the underlying description of the problem given by my noble friend Lady Hanham and the Minister concerned the real problem we have now in terms of priority demand on the one hand and inadequate supply on the other. The consequence of that is that, whereas in terms of the general picture the non-owner-occupied sector is a small part of the proportion, in terms of what we are now talking about, <P>


<a name="column_CWH12"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH12</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>those who are homeless constitute quite a large proportion as regards the remaining stock of housing in the country.
<P>

<a name="11210-26_para1"></a>Where the demand is very high in comparison to the supply&#151;and there is no question at all that there are parts of the capital and, indeed, of other areas of the country where that is true&#151;that problem is particularly acute. It is, therefore, particularly important for those who are in housing need in those places to understand why it is that they are being denied housing; that is, because the statutorily homeless and those in housing priority need take so much of the stock.
<P>

<a name="11210-26_para2"></a>If I may illustrate my point briefly with a local example. A few years after the Brixton riots, the Peabody Trust, under the admirable George Barlow, introduced regulations that removed the principle that had given people who had grown up on Peabody housing estates some priority in terms of continuing to live there on the grounds that there were others in statutory need who had to be put first. That was a severe disadvantage in areas where there was a high concentration of Peabody communities and estates, because they were clearly going to be dissipated and broken down by that and the social coherence of the neighbourhood would be reduced.
<P>

<a name="11210-26_para3"></a>My question&#151;this is a rhetorical question and a paving observation rather than a question to which I am seeking an answer&#151;is whether the issue of communicating to the rest of the community why the homeless take up such a large proportion of the available housing should be part of a homelessness strategy or whether it should be addressed from a wider perspective so that it can be positive rather than negative. I dare say we shall be returning to these questions before the Committee stage is over.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-26_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I thank the Minister for what he himself admitted was a dense reply. I do not mean dense in the sense of stupid&#151;and I do not believe that he did either. We are talking about weaving our way through the thicket. To some extent that is the result of the way the amendments have been grouped, because they do not necessarily follow on one from the other. We could have had interesting debates if they had been carved up. I shall consider carefully the denseness of the reply before deciding what to do about the amendment. However, I should like to throw up one or two other points that have arisen out of the thicket.
<P>

<a name="11210-26_para4"></a>My noble friend Lord Brooke has highlighted a major issue on whether there should be housing strategy that encompasses the homeless review. The more we go through the Bill, the more one sees that very little housing will be available to allocate to anybody who is not on the priority list or vulnerable list of homeless. Somewhere along the line, someone is going to have to prioritise and decide how those priorities are to be recognised. Who is more vulnerable than the vulnerable? I am not sure that that can be done without having some housing strategy that takes into account the amount of housing that is available to any local authority within its own boundaries and <P>


<a name="column_CWH13"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH13</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>externally, now that one can woofle around in other people's housing areas. The requirement must be married up against the actuality. If the housing strategy is not linked to the homeless review, an authority will miss out on what the actuality is. There may be a huge gap in what the local authority will be able to provide or a reasonable match. The one should not be done without the other.
<P>

<a name="11210-26_para5"></a>I shall also refer briefly to the Minister's comments about rough sleepers. Like everyone else here, I am well aware that the Rough Sleepers' Unit is doing an enormously good job. I do not dispute that at all. However, I am not so clear that Section 175 covers the situation as was suggested. It says that a person is homeless if he has no accommodation available for his occupation. We all know of rough sleepers who have accommodation. They have left home and the comforts of home. They have walked out on their families. For some reason or another, they have decided to abandon the accommodation that they had. I would therefore be very tentative about taking Section 175 as a rationale or absolutely assuming that rough sleepers' well-being will be taken into account. I should still like to see that included. We have so many categories bobbing up in this Bill now, one or more less would not make much difference and it would be helpful to keep that in for the time being.
<P>

<a name="11210-26_para6"></a>On the question as to whether we ask or suggest that the strategic partners are identified, I understand that you can identify some, identify them all or identify some and miss some. As the Bill stands at the moment, Clause 3(3)(a) and (b) touch on the matter but do not help. Clause 3(3)(a) states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xby any public authority with functions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-26_para7"></a>
Why have that? It does not identify who these other people are. It does not necessarily lead you to housing associations, to other RSLs or to people who are using housing in multiple occupation in conjunction with the local housing authority.
<P>

<a name="11210-26_para8"></a>It is clear, as the Minister himself admitted, that many housing authorities now do not have any housing. Some authorities have transferred everything and they are working by influence as well as by co-ordination with other bodies. The matter is pretty vague. Clause 3(3)(a) refers to Xany public authority" and Clause 3(3)(b) refers to Xany voluntary organisation". Therefore I still hanker after having a little more direction within that.
<P>

<a name="11210-26_para9"></a>I would like to go through the Minister's reply closely, but, for the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-26_para24"></a><P>

<a name="11210-26_para25"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 11. Clause 5 brings us, under subsection (1), to the new provision for securing that accommodation is available for occupation by those who are homeless but not in priority need or considered to be intentionally homeless. The provisions go well beyond the duties in Section 192 of the 1996 Act, which are to give advice and help to someone who is in danger of becoming homeless.
<P>

<a name="11210-26_para26"></a>By the addition of subsection (3) of Clause 5 to Section 192 of the 1996 Act there is a further category for whom the local authority may potentially have to provide or ensure that housing is available in addition to those under this Bill who will be considered as being in priority need or vulnerable. It starts to beg the question that we have just touched on about how local authorities are to exercise their new discretion so far as this is concerned and balance that alongside those already included later, under Clause 15(3).
<P>

<a name="11210-26_para27"></a>The mind boggles as to how local authorities are to begin to ascertain who will have priority under the new provisions because prioritisation there will have to be. Indeed, the Bill is so far silent on how councils will be able to do this.
<P>

<a name="11210-26_para28"></a>Amendment No. 10 will amend proposed new subsection (3) to Section 192 of the 1996 Act by giving local authorities some room to decide that to help by providing accommodation to a person who was not on the priority list was likely to put into jeopardy their responsibility to others. Therefore in consequence, there would be discretion as to whether or not they could or should be given preferential help beyond the advice available under the current Act. Subsection (2) of Clause 5 amends the duties owed in section 195 of the 1996 Act to those who are not in a priority category <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>and who are threatened with homelessness unintentionally. The provisions enable a local authority to intervene to help ensure that existing accommodation remains available to the applicant.
<P>

<a name="11210-26_para29"></a>Amendment No. 11 would provide some safeguard for the interests of either the registered social landlord or private landlord in the case where efforts are being made to protect such accommodation, since it may be that they have a justifiable reason for trying to repossess the property. However, in any event they must be given an opportunity to be party to any agreement rather than having one forced upon them, which could be construed as being an outcome, under these provisions. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="11210-27_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   The situation for local authorities&#151;housing authorities&#151;up and down the country is different in different places, which is why the legislation should remain as stated in this Bill. For example, there are places where there is hard to let accommodation that might be suitable for single people. Until now, single people have not been eligible for housing by local authorities or registered social landlords. If we are to make best use of housing in some parts of the country&#151;I recognise that this may not be the situation that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, finds in her area&#151;we should not pass these amendments. In areas of high demand I realise that such provisions will never be enacted unless more affordable housing is somehow made available throughout the country rather than just within specific areas. In some areas, it may be that local authorities could help key workers with their hard to let properties. Some of the properties were built a long time ago, not to the standard that we tend to build today, which is why they are hard to let. Nevertheless, some younger, single people would be grateful for some of the properties I am referring to. I am afraid that I am not mindful&#151;I sincerely hope that some of my colleagues agree&#151;to support the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I entirely agree with what the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, said. Different conditions apply in different local authority areas depending, as the noble Baroness says, on whether it is an area of high demand, as is the case obviously in the borough that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, knows best. Places such as Knowsley, Liverpool or parts of Manchester present a totally different picture.
<P>

<a name="11210-27_para0"></a>Having said that, I appreciate the concern that those who have been accepted as statutorily homeless should not be given undue priority over those in housing need who seek local authority housing, particularly in the case of homeless people who do not have a priority need for housing.
<P>

<a name="11210-27_para1"></a>I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, that the new power in Clause 5(1), which she seeks to amend by Amendment No. 10 does not affect the preference or priority which must be given to applicants under an authority's allocation scheme. The new power, which will only be discretionary, will be equivalent to the duty owed to families and vulnerable persons who <P>


<a name="column_CWH16"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH16</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have become homeless through no fault of their own. It will allow the authority to arrange for accommodation to be made available by another landlord or for the authority to provide accommodation itself. Where the authority chooses the latter course, the accommodation will generally be made available on a non-secure&#151;that is, a temporary&#151;basis. I say Xgenerally" because that is the default position under the legislation whenever an authority provides accommodation in pursuance of a homelessness function, and that will apply equally to the new power in Clause 5(1).
<P>

<a name="11210-27_para2"></a>Having said that, it would be open to an authority to decide to allocate a secure tenancy to a non-priority need homeless applicant, as now but, where it did so, the allocation would, as now, have to be made in accordance with the provisions of Part VI of the 1996 Act and in accordance with the authority's published allocation scheme. It does not affect how it operates this allocation scheme, but it gives the local authority a greater power than it has now, and as now such allocations would not in future depend on the new power in Clause 5.
<P>

<a name="11210-27_para3"></a>Amendment No. 11 relates to the new power inserted by Clause 5(2). This extends the existing provisions of Section 195 of the 1996 Act. Currently, where the authority is satisfied that the applicant is a priority need and is not satisfied that he became threatened with homelessness intentionally, then the authority is placed under a duty to take reasonable steps to secure that accommodation does not cease to be available for his occupation.
<P>

<a name="11210-27_para4"></a>The new power enables an authority to take similar reasonable steps in cases where the authority is not satisfied that the applicant has a priority need and is not satisfied that he became threatened with homelessness intentionally. An authority might discharge this duty or exercise the new power through the provision of mediation in cases of relationship breakdown or in helping resolve delays in the payment of housing benefit where these have led to rent arrears. Where the authority is successful in doing those things, then homelessness is averted, to the benefit both of the applicant and his landlord.
<P>

<a name="11210-27_para5"></a>Amendment No. 11 would secure that in a case of accommodation not under the control of the authority, the authority could not exercise the proposed discretionary power unless all persons having an interest in the property in which the accommodation is located are in agreement with those steps.
<P>

<a name="11210-27_para6"></a>Where an authority takes the reasonable steps I have just outlined and is able to promote a satisfactory resolution&#151;satisfactory to all sides&#151;then an unnecessary case of homelessness is averted. Having to secure the agreement of all persons having an interest in the property would significantly hinder the authority's ability to avert what would be on the hypothesis identified as an unnecessary case of homelessness. That is why Amendment No. 11 would not be helpful in that respect.

<P>

<a name="11210-27_para8"></a>Somebody who owns a property will not necessarily have that property in the private sector. The pressure cannot be put on a private landlord to go against his will. There are situations where people do not pay their rent; they break up the flat; they cause an enormous amount of mischief; and one can well understand why the landlord may say enough is enough. The local authority may step in and, with the powers available in the Bill, say, XSorry, we have a right to deal with this and under those powers we are going to do so. We are going to make sure that this person stays in your flat or your accommodation". It cannot be right to use those powers in that way. There must be a right of agreement with the landlord and an understanding of the reasons why he might or might not wish to keep that letting available to somebody who is being supported by the local authority. If the Minister can satisfy me on that point, I shall not push the amendment.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I should make it absolutely clear that nothing in this power enables the local authority to interfere if the landlord has grounds for possession in the sort of example the noble Baroness gave, such as when a tenant is guilty of antisocial behaviour to his or her neighbours, or trashes the flat or house. It is not intended for one moment to provide compulsion on private landlords. It is also worth making the point that if an applicant is threatened with homelessness as a result of his or her antisocial behaviour, an authority can be expected to find that person intentionally threatened with homelessness. The existing duty and the proposed power apply only to cases in which the authority is not satisfied that the applicant became threatened with homelessness intentionally. I hope that reassures the noble Baroness.

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-27_para12"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 XPROVISION OF ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE
<br>
 A local authority, in providing (or securing the provision of) advice and assistance under sections 190(2)(b) and (3), 192(2) and 195(5) of the 1996 Act, shall ensure that&#151;
<br>
(a) an assessment of an applicant's housing and related needs is carried out, and that the results of that assessment are taken into account in the provision of advice and assistance;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_CWH18"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH18</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(b) appropriate and timely information is provided about the availability of accommodation in the area; and
<br>
(c) information and advice is provided about the applicant's right to a review of a decision under section 202 of the 1996 Act (right to request review of decision)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="11210-27_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: The purpose of this new clause is to ensure that local authorities meet basic minimum standards in providing advice and assistance to non-priority homeless people. There is a certain amount of deja vu in this for me, because I moved an amendment about the same group of people when debating what became the Housing Act 1996.
<P>

<a name="11210-27_para14"></a>Local authorities are under a duty to provide advice and assistance to help applicants who are not in priority need and who do not qualify for their main accommodation duty. However, there is much evidence&#151;and I am sure that the Minister has read Shelter's document, Singles Barred&#151;that in some cases authorities fail to provide any advice and assistance to that group and that what assistance is provided is often of very poor quality. For example, it is quite common for applicants simply to be given a list of bed-and-breakfast hostels. Many people&#151;not just me, but others who work in the housing field&#151;are concerned that a lot of very vulnerable people are slipping through the net. Applicants are not getting adequate support to enable them to find their own solution to their homelessness and, ultimately, more people will end up on the streets. We know the Government do not want that.
<P>

<a name="11210-27_para15"></a>The amendment would set out a basic minimum standard on the face of the Bill that should be met regardless of the individual circumstances of the client or the local housing market. It would require local authorities to carry out an assessment of an applicant's needs, to provide appropriate information about the availability of accommodation, and to provide information about an applicant's right to review.
<P>

<a name="11210-27_para16"></a>That is not a significant departure from the current legislation. However, it would require those authorities that are currently providing a rather poor level of service to meet their responsibilities and deliver what I believe is the intention of the Government in this area.
<P>

<a name="11210-27_para17"></a>The Government have said that they do not believe that the law requires further amendment, but if they do not accept stronger duties, they should set out the steps that they intend to take to ensure that standards in this area are raised. If the Minister is not mindful to have that on the face of the Bill as we have put it down, the Government should consider a specific commitment in the national homelessness strategy, which the Government are to publish in the new year, perhaps a new performance indicator under the best value regime to monitor local authority performance in this area and stronger guidance, including a clear statement that this issue should be addressed by the homelessness strategy that will be developed under this Bill.
<P>

<a name="11210-27_para18"></a>Let me explain the current situation. In some authorities the quality of advice and assistance is extremely variable and, in some cases, extremely poor. Sometimes people do not even have an interview. <P>


<a name="column_CWH19"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH19</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I cannot remember where I read that someone was turned away by the security guard on the door of the local authority.
<P>

<a name="11210-27_para19"></a>Assessments of vulnerability are not made consistently and there is no doubt that some of them contravene the statutory guidance. Much of the written information provided by authorities is often out of date, such as the sort of information they give on bed and breakfast accommodation. Standards of safety&#151;another issue we will talk about later on in the Bill&#151;are also of concern. Sometimes applicants receive no verbal advice at all; it is only written. It is also clear that some of the people who will find themselves homeless may not be literate, which may be one of the reasons why they are in difficulty.
<P>

<a name="11210-27_para20"></a>One of the other areas, to which we will return later in the Bill, is that many applicants do not receive a written notice of the authority's decision and they are not informed of their right to review. If the Government are serious about preventing homelessness, that is something we need to look at. I know the Government in another place responded by bringing forward their own amendment at a later stage to strengthen the statutory duty, but my colleagues and I still have some concerns.
<P>

<a name="11210-27_para21"></a>This new clause responds to some of the arguments that were made in another place, and it requires authorities to meet three minimum requirements: an assessment of the applicant's housing and related needs, so failing to interview and assess the needs of applicants who appear vulnerable would be ruled out; appropriate and timely information about the availability of accommodation in the area, and I have outlined the problems we have with the sorts of information that some local authorities think is satisfactory; and information and advice about the applicant's right to review of a decision, which is something we shall talk about at another point in the Bill. That is what we hope to achieve by these amendments and I look forward to the Minister's response. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="11210-28_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Rendell of Babergh: </B>   It may be that the provisions in this amendment are already covered in the Bill. But to my mind, the new ones recognise and emphasise that not all local authorities show the right levels of concern and care for clients' needs. They aim to secure basic minimum standards. It is not sufficiently recognised how many applicants suffer from intense vulnerability and confusion. They speak and understand English inadequately. As the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, said, some people cannot read. They are confronted by problems which to us might simply be time-consuming irritants but they can be frightening, particularly to those whose self-esteem is already badly shaken by hardship and humiliation.
<P>

<a name="11210-28_para0"></a>I wish to give two examples which come from articles written by sheltered housing advice centres. The first reads:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XAt one London authority Homeless Persons Unit, a 30 year old woman fleeing domestic violence was told by the receptionist that a passport was essential, before he could pass on her details <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_CWH20"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH20</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>to one of his colleagues. The applicant was also informed that the local authority required a police or doctor's report to prove that it was unsafe for her to remain in her present accommodation. She was told that she was non-priority because she was single, without children and not pregnant. The applicant was left with no choice other than to return home. She was not given any information by the Homeless Persons Unit, other than a customer satisfaction survey to fill out".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-28_para1"></a><P>

<a name="11210-28_para2"></a>The other example is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XThe experience of many of Shelter's advisers in London is that many authorities simply give out Shelterline's freephone number to homeless applicants who are not in priority need. Many callers contact them believing this will secure them accommodation."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-28_para3"></a>
I could give many other examples but I will not take up the time of the Committee. I feel that the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, is needful and I support it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-28_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   I rise to speak to the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock. The Minister reminded the Committee earlier this afternoon of the importance of prevention. The concern that is being raised here is that the needs of non-priority homeless people are not being met. In my experience at Centrepoint I have come across young people with mental health problems who have slipped through the system, and occasionally people with learning difficulties. We know that more than 4,500 families with children are not classed as priority needs because of decisions about their intention with regard to their homelessness. It is hard to decide what people's intentions are. The process is notoriously complex and can be very harsh but we are still dealing with families with children.
<P>

<a name="11210-28_para4"></a>Under the current arrangement how can one ensure that there is an adequate service? That is what concerns me. I am not sure whether the amendment or whether further strengthening the duty on local authorities is the way to reach that. There is clearly great inconsistency. I heard only this afternoon from a homelessness agency about young people being given just a telephone number; if they are given a list of hostels it may have the wrong opening times and they may make the journey to the hostel and find the doors are shut, or the information may be out of date. If they make a telephone call to the hostel&#151;and these are now referral only rather than direct access&#151;they have wasted the money on the telephone call. They also feel that they are struggling and it is counterproductive. This is a key area.
<P>

<a name="11210-28_para5"></a>Young people are drifting into the centre of London where there are many homeless agencies which are keen to see that they stay, if possible, in their local authority. It is better that the local authority should help them before they come into the centre of town and become subject to all its problems. There needs to be a uniform, high-quality level of assessment, up-to-date advice and, if there needs to be a review, an explanation of why they have been denied priority homelessness and their right to a review of that decision.
<P>

<a name="11210-28_para6"></a>There are examples of local authorities that have failed in London. So many young people come from Lambeth but very few from Tower Hamlets. Why is <P>


<a name="column_CWH21"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH21</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that? They are similar authorities with similar problems, but somehow the homeless persons units appear not to be functioning so well in Lambeth. There clearly needs to be better monitoring, training and support of staff in homeless persons units and the best practice there needs to be disseminated and a consistent service provided throughout.
<P>

<a name="11210-28_para7"></a>That job is tremendously demanding, especially in those areas where there is very little accommodation. Those staff have to be very creative in their responses to people. Often this does not happen. For example, a receptionist told an applicant that without identification and a letter providing proof that he was homeless there was nothing they could do for him. In another authority that person met a homeless persons officer who expressed genuine concern for the applicant's well-being. The attitude is very important.
<P>

<a name="11210-28_para8"></a>Is the Minister clear that funding for the implementation of the Bill&#151;#8 million, as I understand it&#151; will be sufficient to enable the better dissemination of good practice and secondment between, perhaps, different local authorities and homelessness agencies? The noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, mentioned the importance of ensuring that best-value regime applies in a focused way to raising the standards in this area and that there is a strategic goal nationally in the national homelessness policy in ensuring a high standard of service. She also said that there should be stronger guidance in the local authority strategy in relation to the Bill. I look forward to the Minister's response to those ideas.

<A NAME="11210-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   We are dealing with people who are desperate, people who are under attack and people who do not know which way to turn&#151;I am talking about the staff, not the applicants. One of the most wretched aspects of being a local councillor is dealing with housing, and one of the most desperate of desperate situations is trying to give assurances, with no resources at all, to people who are desperately in need of just a modicum of hope.
<P>

<a name="11210-28_para9"></a>We are asking the Minister to consider whether he can do anything more than he is already doing in this Bill and in other ways. The Minister has a dilemma in leaving power and freedom to local authorities to determine how they exercise their priorities and their budgets. That will inevitably mean that in some areas there will be a shortfall in what we might think they ought to do. Having been a local councillor, like many Members of the Committee, I know about the competing claims on local authority housing resources.
<P>

<a name="11210-28_para10"></a>In common with other Members of the Committee, I have a position with the Local Government Association. All that we and the Minister can do is try to engender a little more understanding and kindness where it does not exist. I do not believe that there are many occasions when there is no understanding of the needs of the desperate homeless or badly housed people. Very often, the officers of a council must be torn and end up being over-sympathetic and perhaps <P>


<a name="column_CWH22"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH22</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>leading people on, assuring them that there is a solution and that if they wait a little longer or do something else, they will get it. The fact is that there is a shortage of accommodation. The right-to-buy legislation has resulted in the stock of housing that was once available to a council drying up over the past 20 years. The remaining stock is diminishing all the time. I do not take kindly to people arguing that certain things can be done, when, by political decision, one&#151;only one&#151;of the weapons that was available has been taken away from the authority.
<P>

<a name="11210-28_para11"></a>I have dealt with many wretched circumstances. Many times I left my surgery as an MP and cried outside in the car at the helplessness and hopelessness of some cases. However, that will not solve the problem. Eventually, we need a greater availability of accommodation and an understanding by the people who are homeless or in wretched homes that there are limits and that everything that can be done is being done.
<P>

<a name="11210-28_para12"></a>I hear what my noble friend Lady Rendell has told us. We want to hear from the Minister that the aims of the amendment are already dealt with in the Bill. The Minister will be well served if he takes on board the heart as well as the brain of the Members of the Committee. Those of us who live well and are housed well and know about homelessness feel more than anybody else the helplessness of the people who cannot help themselves. When they come to the council, the very least that a council can do is to have properly trained people available.
<P>

<a name="11210-28_para13"></a>Rape at one time was treated simply as a crime. It is a crime, but there are ways in which the victim of the rape can be made to feel that at least there is an understanding of their condition. The same can happen for those who are in desperate need of housing. My experience is primarily in the London Borough of Enfield and in Edmonton. Because I am joint president of the Local Government Association I am conscious that even within London there are variations. The Minister has already referred to consultation with council leaders and councils. One of the Minister's priorities, with a short purse, is to ensure that every resource available is constantly tapped and trawled to see whether it cannot be squeezed again. I am delighted that we have on the Committee at the moment the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, who, as we all know, is the Chairman of the Housing Corporation.

<A NAME="11210-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   I follow the noble Lord, Lord Graham, and share experience with him, both in London local authority work and as a Member of Parliament. Apart from during evacuation, parts of my education, service in the Army and periods abroad, I have lived in London all my life. Therefore my perspective is essentially a London one. I feel deep compassion for those who have been alluded to by those who have already spoken. That applies both to the indigenous population and, a fortiori, to asylum speakers and refugees when confronted with the problem they have seeking housing in frequently dreadful circumstances.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH23"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH23</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-29_para0"></a>I tell the following anecdote to illustrate that this is not a simple problem. I will make it totally local. I refer to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and to the City of Westminster. It is perfectly possible for the Royal Borough to put one of its housing cases into Westminster and equally possible that, simultaneously, even on the same day, Westminster is putting somebody into the Royal Borough. An immediate problem arises in parliamentary terms as to who the representatives for those people then are. Do people who have moved into the Royal Borough then look to the Member of Parliament for that constituency and do those who have been moved into Westminster look to the Westminster MP? It is a fact that the first most likely thing that they will want to consult their MP about will be their housing situation and, secondly, if they are asylum seekers, their problems with the Home Office, which, broadly speaking, in the last Parliament gave up communicating with asylum seekers so that all communication was done through Members of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="11210-29_para1"></a>In those circumstances, the person who has the problem ideally should deal with the Member of Parliament for the housing authority that has put him or her into a borough other than their own. On the other hand, all the traditions of the House of Commons operate in the opposite direction. When I consulted the Speaker, my Chief Whip and the chairman of the Procedure Committee, all of them said that the matter should be dealt with by the Member of Parliament representing the constituency in which the person concerned lives.
<P>

<a name="11210-29_para2"></a>That is all right provided that everybody accepts that principle, but there are 74 London Members of Parliament who tend to act arbitrarily and independently. Therefore on the advice of the Speaker, the Chief Whip and the chairman of the Procedure Committee that we should stick by the existing rule, I acted as a shop steward for the Conservative Members of Parliament and secured agreement that that was what we would do. I then sought, through my parliamentary neighbour, Karen Buck, who was the chairman of the parliamentary group of Labour MPs in London, that we would all agree to do the same thing. It was clear that the system would not work if some of us were using one practice and some another. I pay the greatest possible tribute to Karen Buck, but she was not able to get a definitive answer out of the parliamentary group of Labour MPs before the general election was called, so, for all I know, the problem is still unresolved.
<P>

<a name="11210-29_para3"></a>I only tell that anecdote to demonstrate that if Members of Parliament, who are at the sharp end of the problem and who feel the compassion that I have indicated here, are incapable of organising a system among themselves to which they will all subscribe, as the noble Lord, Lord Graham, said, I have the greatest sympathy for the local authority staff who also have to deal with the problem. I have sympathy too for the <P>


<a name="column_CWH24"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH24</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>officials behind the Minister who are trying to run a system when it is so difficult to get common sense to prevail in the way we operate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-29_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   Very briefly, if I may address the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock. As I see it, Sections 190 and 192 address those who are homeless but are not considered as being priority need, or who are homeless intentionally. They are a specific part of this Bill and the other Act. Those sections already provide an explicit requirement for local authorities to provide advice, to take into account the local housing provision and to ensure that advice and assistance is given to anybody who makes an application to them.
<P>

<a name="11210-29_para4"></a>The amendment would have two effects. First, it would slightly widen what local authorities are meant to do, by making them responsible for making an assessment of the person and ensuring that that assessment is taken into account when they give advice. Secondly, it draws attention to the review that is now put into the Bill. That seems sensible. As a member of a local authority, I understand that some councils are better than others. My local authority or that of the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, may not need such advice, but others may, so I am not opposed to the widening of the existing wording.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   As the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has pointed out, the amendment prescribes what advice and assistance local authorities should give to homeless people. I agree straight away with the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, that advice and assistance for homeless people, including non-priority applicants, is an important part of local authorities' housing work. That is why the Xsatisfactory provision of support"&#151;meaning advice, information and assistance&#151;is specified in Clause 3(1)(c) as one of the areas that the homelessness strategies must cover.
<P>

<a name="11210-29_para5"></a>However, we have gone further, as the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, acknowledged, by including other provisions to strengthen the advice and assistance duty on authorities. Those provisions are set out in paragraphs 8, 9 and 11(b) of Schedule 1. Instead of advice and such assistance as the authority considers appropriate in the circumstances, the duty will be to provide or secure the provision of advice and assistance in any attempts that an applicant makes to secure accommodation. The provision is less subjective.
<P>

<a name="11210-29_para6"></a>An authority acting reasonably&#151;and they will all be obliged to act reasonably&#151;will have to consider the advice and assistance that it should give in the particular attempts made by the applicant. It will necessarily have to take account of what the applicant needs to pursue those attempts, as well as the extent of any advice and assistance that it can reasonably be expected to provide. The requirement is in effect applicant-specific.
<P>

<a name="11210-29_para7"></a>I imagine that the noble Baroness has in mind cases in which, as a matter of form, all that is ever given is a list of names and addresses of landlords and nothing <P>


<a name="column_CWH25"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH25</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>more. It is because the law or the terms of the Bill have been changed to make it clear the duty will be to provide or secure the provision of advice and assistance in any attempts an applicant makes to secure accommodation that the move is made from the general to the specific. The level of detail of the advice and assistance required by the amendment is too prescriptive on local authorities and would not be appropriate or helpful. We will of course cover the issue of advice and assistance in the statutory guidance which will accompany the Bill and we will deal with all the matters I have gone through. With respect, that is probably the most helpful way to do it, rather than sticking particular provisions in the Bill. What we have done instead, which is much more fundamental, is to change the form of the Bill so that the advice and assistance that has to be given is to secure,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xthe provision of advice and assistance",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-29_para8"></a>
in any attempt an applicant makes to secure accommodation.
<P>

<a name="11210-29_para9"></a>Let me deal with two other points that have been made. A point made by the noble Lord, Lord Graham, was echoed by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke. It was, in effect, that there is a real problem here because there is a great shortage of accommodation and one therefore pities the local authority staff who have to provide advice and assistance.
<P>

<a name="11210-29_para10"></a>Housing investment has gone up in recent years. The Housing Corporation's budget for new, affordable housing will double between 2001&#150;02 and 2003&#150;04, with an extra #872 million. An extra #250 million has gone into the starter homes initiative. Resources for local authority investment have gone up from #750 million in 1997-98 to #2.5 billion by 2003&#150;04. About #137 million is going into a new, safer community-supported housing fund. The figures have gone up dramatically over the past four years and will continue to go up, pursuant to spending plans already announced. I do not suggest that there will not continue to be a problem of homelessness but the investment is going upwards. Having said that, it will not be enough to provide for all the needs of homeless people in this country and that is why it is so important to reach a sensible legal arrangement of what the safety net consists of.
<P>

<a name="11210-29_para11"></a>The second point I should deal with is whether there should be a new performance indicator in the best value arrangements in relation to the provision of advice and assistance. In the context of local government arrangements, the Government have made it clear that it is unhelpful to have a huge range of targets with which local authorities have to comply. There is always a temptation, in every area, to want a best value performance indicator in relation to that because, in every area, one thinks that would be the way to improve standards. All the views that we receive from local government are to the effect that the quantity of best-value performance indicators is not necessarily the way to drive up performance. It is far better to target those best-value performance indicators on a small number of areas to have the desired effect. It may well be that, in particular local <P>


<a name="column_CWH26"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH26</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>authority areas, it would be sensible to have a best-value performance indicator, chosen in effect by the local authority as an appropriate course to take&#151;which they can do. Nationally, however, I do not think it would achieve the effects that Members of the Committee hoped for.
<P>

<a name="11210-29_para12"></a>I hope I have dealt with the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock. The way that the arrangements have been changed mean that we are dealing with a fundamental point. Prescription on the face of the Bill is not the way forward. We will deal with many of the points in the guidance. Best-value performance indicators may not be the panacea in every area that people think and one should be more sensible about where one targets them.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-29_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   I thank the Minister for giving way. On that point about best value targets, will the Minister undertake to keep a watchful eye on that? I suppose that it would be possible for those local authorities that are already doing a good job in this area to set best-value targets in this particular area, and for those local authorities that are already failing in this area not to set the best-value targets. Just in case there is a danger of the proposal slipping by, would the Minister keep an eye on the matter and perhaps come back to it at a later stage? I hope that he will do so in a year's time or whatever, and not in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I undertake to keep a watchful eye on that, personally and on behalf of the department so that it continues beyond.
<P>

<a name="11210-30_para0"></a>I have considered the question of best-value performance indicators before it was raised and I broadly take the view that this particular best-value performance indicator would be going much too far. If we had to have a best value performance indicator for this type of thing, we would have to have a great many, which ultimately would not be sensible or effective. However, I certainly give the undertaking that the noble Earl sought.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-30_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Before my noble friend responds, can the Minister help on this? He pointed us to the current legislation, as has the whole debate, referring to advice and assistance which a local housing authority considers appropriate and presumably reasonableness has to be imported into that. He reminded us of the change in the schedule which will take out the subjectivity. Is there in fact such a difference between the legislation as it now applies and as it will apply when this schedule comes into effect? Am I right that there has to be imported that degree of reasonableness into what a local housing authority considers appropriate? If so, does it make any difference what the guidance says in either of those two circumstances? Is there not the same problem? From the Minister's face it would seem that I am not making myself wholly clear!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I understand entirely what the noble Baroness is saying. Three points: first, there is a change because the provision, for the reasons <P>


<a name="column_CWH27"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH27</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I stated, is now less subjective, as the noble Baroness acknowledges. Secondly, it is applicant specific. Thirdly&#151;and this is not a change in legal principle&#151;the authority is obliged to act reasonably in the context of Wednesbury reasonableness; it would have had to have done so before but the obligation is different.
<P>

<a name="11210-30_para1"></a>The final question was about the guidance. The guidance is not part of the statute but if a local authority acts flagrantly against the terms of the guidance, it would be relevant material in considering whether or not the local authority had acted Wednesbury reasonable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-30_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I thank the Minister for his long answer. Various people have pointed out that good advice is key to the prevention of homelessness, which is one thing on which we can all agree. We can all also agree that there are many authorities that provide very good advice and a good pattern that we would like everybody to follow. The fact, however, is that they do not. We have heard examples this afternoon of authorities giving people poor quality advice&#151;and I could offer many more if the Minister wants.
<P>

<a name="11210-30_para2"></a>This is not about the amount of accommodation that local authorities have available. It is merely about a basic minimum standard of advice to people. I remind Members of the Committee that there are three minimum requirements: an assessment of housing and related needs; appropriate and timely information about the availability of accommodation in the area; and information and advice about the right to review.
<P>

<a name="11210-30_para3"></a>The Minister said that this is going to be in guidance but the fact is that guidance has a much weaker legal status than what is written on the face of the Bill. That is why so many people in the housing world are very concerned. They are the people who pick up the pieces when the legislation does not work and that is why they are concerned to see something rather better on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="11210-30_para4"></a>I shall look in more detail at what the Minister said and we may return to it at another time. I still have concerns but I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="11210-30_para8"></a><P>

<a name="11210-30_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: We have just had a discussion about reasonableness. The purpose of this amendment is to provide for local authorities to give homeless applicants a reasonable period of time within which to accept or refuse a final offer of accommodation. This issue was discussed in the last Housing Bill and in this Bill in another place. Homeless people are often given 24 or 48 hours to make a decision&#151;not always, but I must emphasise that we are dealing here with where things do not go well rather than where people do give a reasonable <P>


<a name="column_CWH28"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH28</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>time&#151;and a homeless person is not always in the best frame of mind to make a quick decision. If one has children one has to make decisions about where they are to go to school, and if one has relatives that need to be cared for there are quite a lot of things that need to be taken into account. It is important that we try to make sure that local authorities are genuinely reasonable in the amount of time that they give to applicants when they are offered accommodation.
<P>

<a name="11210-30_para10"></a>I suspect that when the Minister comes back there will be discussion about whether it is reasonable to talk about reasonableness in legislation. I point out that there are three other places in the Bill where reasonableness is mentioned. In Section (7F), when making an offer of assistance to a homeless applicant, the authority must be satisfied that it is Xreasonable". In Clause 13(10), notification of allocation decisions should be made available by the local authority, Xfor a reasonable period". Section 177(1) of the Housing Act 1996 states that a person is homeless if it is not reasonable for them to continue to occupy their accommodation. We have already had that discussion earlier this afternoon.

<a name="11210-30_para11"></a>I do not intend to speak about this for long but it is important that we make sure that it is not acceptable for local authorities to give a short period of time to homeless people when they are considering offers. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   It is a reasonable point I want to make. In the context of giving advice to a person who is about to get accommodation, what is reasonable notice? I have an example of someone who was rung up one day, regrettably by the Westminster council, and who was told that they must accept the accommodation the next day. That is most unreasonable. I do not say that that happens only in Westminster; there could be other examples as well. The dilemma that the Committee and the Minister have is that if one day's notice is unreasonable, what is reasonable? Is it seven, 14 or three days? When the Minister replies, will he tell us whether thought has been given to that, or whether the councils will simply be told that they must be more reasonable than some of them have been in the past. In that context, we should also understand the problems that the noble Baroness has mentioned. In the example I gave it involved a single person and the question of children and work did not come into it. Nevertheless, the atmosphere in which such events occur is, XTake it or leave it". When the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, replies, I should be grateful to know what she considers to be Xreasonable" in this context.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-30_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Fearn: </B>   I support the amendment put by my noble friend. Following what has already been said, it is essential that the staff, who should be fully trained, although at times they are not, should find out the state of health of the person who comes. The applicant fills in a form and speaks to one person or maybe two. There is no follow-up regarding the health side. As a previous MP, I have tackled many cases in my surgery where I realised that people were schizophrenic and not always able to act on their own but able to fill in <P>


<a name="column_CWH29"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH29</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the form at the time. However, their health circumstances had never been investigated by those who were supposed to be trained in housing matters with the homeless. Will the Minister say whether the time limit of one, two or three days takes into consideration the health status of that person, especially when that involves a young, single person who has not declared his state of health at that time?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-30_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   It was not the reference to Westminster by the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, that has brought me to my feet. In fact, the very point to which he was alluding had already struck me during the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock.
<P>

<a name="11210-30_para12"></a>The amendment states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xreasonable in all the circumstances".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-30_para13"></a>
That, by definition, implies reasonableness in the context of the applicant but also in the context of the local authority. However, the manner in which she spoke to the amendment suggested that she was thinking of Xreasonable" as applying to the applicant. I did not intervene during her speech but it would be interesting to know whether she had in fact also taken into account the local authority.
<P>

<a name="11210-30_para14"></a>The reason why I say that and would be hesitant about agreeing to her amendment, is because&#151;as she reminded us in response to an amendment that was moved by my noble friend Lady Hanham, we are dealing with national rather than regional or local legislation&#151;the circumstances will be very different from the point of view of local authorities around the country. If, as in Westminster, 80 per cent of vacant housing stock is needed for the statutory homeless or those in statutory priority need in the course of a year, that would mean running the rest of one's housing policy with 20 per cent. The pressures to get an answer from an applicant will be different from an authority where all its local authority housing is empty and it has all the time in the world.
<P>

<a name="11210-30_para15"></a>I have a nervousness about the word Xreasonable" in any case. The noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, herself put up an amulet against the charge. The definition of an act of God in Blackstone's Law Dictionary as an act which no reasonable man would expect God to commit has always seemed to me in a sense to concentrate the mind on how sensible it is to use Xreasonableness" as the basis for a judgment of that sort.
<P>

<a name="11210-30_para16"></a>I warmly commend Amendment No. 15 which I am sure will be spoken to in a moment by my noble friend Lady Hanham; it is quite astonishingly sensible. When I consider in the light of the words which the Home Secretary spoke yesterday&#151;they appear to have got him into some trouble with some parts of the community&#151;that there are people coming up to housing benefit appeals four years after they have arrived in this country and are not able to speak the language and would therefore presumably not be able to read the document which is being referred to here, the fact that there should be an allowance for having it read to him or her seems to be eminently sensible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-30_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   Two amendments in this group appear in my name&#151;Amendments Nos. 14 and 15&#151;and I want to discuss them briefly. On Amendment No. 14, one of the significant aspects of this legislation is the removal of any time limits on temporary accommodation or on the acceptance and provision of acceptable permanent accommodation. Proposed new Section (7C) seems to compound the difficulties that will be faced by housing authorities in this regard by local authorities being able to reject, seemingly without constraint, any number of qualifying offers without any provision for judging whether that is a reasonable or lawful response. For the moment, the deletion of this provision seems the best way of providing those constraints. We may have a better opportunity to think about how to rephrase it.
<P>

<a name="11210-30_para17"></a>The amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, should be taken within the context of the fact that there are unlimited qualifying offers. When the final offer is made, somebody has run out of steam. Either the applicant has finally accepted the accommodation or the local authority has run out of ability to help them. We need to set the matter against that.
<P>

<a name="11210-30_para18"></a>On Amendment No. 15, as my noble friend Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville has already said, there should be no question that somebody has understood the words relating to the qualifying offer. I know it is common practice in Parliament to suggest that somebody should sign in relation to what they have read and understood. In relation to the world in which we are trespassing at the moment&#151;those who are homeless and many of whom are vulnerable&#151;it would be correct not to assume that they could have read. Indeed, somebody should have ensured that they understood the matter and that, if they could not read, it was read to them and in a manner in which they could understand it. If that means that they have to be read to in another language, so be it. That is what the amendment should cover.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   First, I turn to Amendment No. 13, which is about the time in which the applicant has to consider the final offer of accommodation. It is very important that, when making that offer which will bring the homelessness duty to an end, the applicants have adequate time to consider the offer. The specific period of time necessary to allow this to happen will, inevitably, be different in different cases, depending, as the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, said on the circumstances both of the applicant and of the local authority. The circumstances of the applicant which are potentially relevant to that consideration will, to deal with the point of the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, include the health, both physical and mental, of the applicant.
<P>

<a name="11210-31_para0"></a>What is the right period of time? Under the law as it stands at the moment, local authorities must already give people a reasonable period to consider offers. The noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, is not suggesting a specified period of time and I believe she is right in relation to that, because the moment you put a <P>


<a name="column_CWH31"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH31</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>specified period of time on the face of the Bill as a minimum period, that becomes the operational period. What she suggests we say is already the law. That deals with the point raised by the two noble Lords to whom I have referred. Should it be put on the face of the Bill? If you put it on the face of the Bill, the very real danger here is that such a provision would be interpreted as meaning that a reasonable period must be allowed for considering final offers but need not be allowed in respect of any other offers. That would not be an acceptable outcome.
<P>

<a name="11210-31_para1"></a>I suggest the right course in relation to this is that&#151;it having been made clear in the remarks I have just made which I shall be happy to make again on Report&#151;the law as it stands must already give people a reasonable period to consider offers. The only additional protection that is then required and is sensible is that that should be spelt out in statutory guidance and, of course, I give a commitment to this Committee and thence to the House that this will be done. Authorities must by law have regard to such statutory guidance in exercising their allocation functions under Part 7 of the 1996 Act. Where they do not have regard to it, or they have regard to it but choose not to follow it, they are liable to have to justify their position to the courts, if challenged. I hope that deals with the specific point raised by the noble Baroness under Amendment No. 13.
<P>

<a name="11210-31_para2"></a>Amendment No. 14 was dealt with by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, in her most recent remarks. That would cut across the main aim of the Bill, which is to strengthen the protection available to families with children and vulnerable people who become homeless through no fault of their own. The current provisions in Part 7 of the 1996 Act contribute to the uncertainty faced by such households. Even though they may have a priority need for accommodation, if the housing authority knows that privately rented accommodation is available in the district, it can do no more than offer assistance to the household regardless of how vulnerable it may be. Even where the authority has a duty to secure accommodation, that duty is limited to just two years.
<P>

<a name="11210-31_para3"></a>One of the aims of the Bill is to remove that uncertainty. Authorities will have an obligation to ensure that suitable accommodation is available until a more settled housing solution can be found. Not only is the experience of homelessness traumatic but the experience of making an application under the homelessness legislation is not always a pleasant one, particularly in hard-pressed areas where the demand for housing is high. With pressures as they are, the household may have to endure a fairly lengthy period in temporary accommodation which may, all too often now, include a spell in bed and breakfast accommodation.
<P>

<a name="11210-31_para4"></a>So those turning to local authorities for help will normally be in pretty desperate straits. Many households who experience homelessness do so because of a number of underlying problems and <P>


<a name="column_CWH32"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH32</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>difficulties, which means that they are likely to be vulnerable to homelessness again unless they can be found a home which is settled, affordable and secure.
<P>

<a name="11210-31_para5"></a>The Bill has removed the time limit on the duty to secure accommodation for those who are unintentionally homeless and in priority need. That does not mean that it is a duty to secure permanent accommodation; it is a duty to secure accommodation until a more settled solution can be found. For many applicants that solution is likely to be an allocation of a social tenancy under Part VI of the 1996 Act.
<P>

<a name="11210-31_para6"></a>There are other solutions and the authority should and no doubt will explore those other options. The Bill makes specific provision for the homelessness duty to end if the applicant accepts an offer of an assured tenancy. It also makes provision for the duty to be capable of being brought to an end by an assured shorthold tenancy, recognising that the private sector has a role to play here. An assured shorthold tenancy is not, however, going to be the right solution for all applicants.
<P>

<a name="11210-31_para7"></a>The accommodation may be technically suitable but many tenancies are for a limited period only and may not be capable of offering the long-term form of security of tenure that some vulnerable homeless households need. Those authorities in the vanguard of best practice in meeting the needs of homeless families will already be carefully considering which of their homeless applicants will be capable of sustaining an assured shorthold tenancy in the private sector. They will not press those who are less well equipped to do so.
<P>

<a name="11210-31_para8"></a>The new Section 193(7)(c) of the 1996 Act inserted by Clause 7 of the Bill will provide a safeguard which ensures that those applicants who do not consider that an assured shorthold tenancy would provide them with a settled housing solution would not have to accept it. That is the right position to adopt; it is entirely consistent with the theme of the Bill, which is to provide more protection for families and vulnerable people. I urge the noble Baroness, when the opportunity arises, not to press this amendment.
<P>

<a name="11210-31_para9"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 15 seeks to protect the position of applicants who, for whatever reason, would be unable to read a statement from the local housing authority about the qualifying offer. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for raising this point. I give an undertaking to consider it and come back with some form of solution to the problem at Report stage because a solution is clearly required. I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, who is not here, but also, more importantly, to the noble Lord, Lord Fearn, who is.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-31_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Maddock:  </B>  That was going to be my first point. I am grateful to the Minister for his lengthy reply and also to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. It reflects on some of the reasons as to why it is unsatisfactory for people to make hasty decisions. I should apologise to Members of the Committee: I thought it would take up too much time to explain why this was necessary and I should perhaps have outlined the sort of circumstances I had in mind.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-31_para10"></a>The reason for not putting a specific time on it was to reflect that it will be different in different places. I am thinking mostly about the people who are homeless, admittedly, but as I said earlier on, different authorities are naturally in different positions to make offers. I was thinking about situations where, for instance, a family is offered accommodation that simply does not meet its needs&#151;it may be too small or in the wrong place. Those are the sort of things I meant.
<P>

<a name="11210-31_para11"></a>Another situation that often arises is that a homeless family will be told that it has a local authority offer&#151;it may be a local authority empty property, an empty property that the authority plans to use in the private sector or a registered social landlord's empty property&#151;but the applicant is not in fact told that the authority will do the repairs and so forth. A family may think that it cannot possibly live in such accommodation without realising the full circumstances, which is why sometimes it is important that there is a little time to go into the questions that are in people's minds about a particular property. If somebody is in work, they may have to go a long way to view the property. I have already explained the problems of carers' duties and schools. That is a little wide of my thinking on the amendment, but I am grateful to the Minister for going into it in detail. I will look at what he has said in due course.
<P>

<a name="11210-31_para12"></a>Similar amendments were tabled in another place by the Conservatives, because this is an issue that concerns people. As with previous amendments, we all know what we want to happen, but we have to work out how to make the legislation work on the ground and not leave loopholes for those who do not want to help people. That is the aim of the amendment. I shall look more closely at what the Minister said and we may return to the subject. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="11210-31_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: I thank the Minister for what he has said about Amendment No. 14, but I would like to look at it a little further. It may be that my amendment is not correct. Throughout the Bill I am concerned about the lack of time constraints on applicants. There are no limits on how many offers they may turn down. I appreciate that this is a qualifying offer and it is specific under the statute, but applicants will be able to go on refusing offers. That could result in an enormous amount of time being spent on one homeless applicant when there are enormous numbers of others and, as we have already said, limited suitable accommodation. This may not be entirely the right place to raise the subject and I shall withdraw the amendment, but I will come back to it in a different way. I beg to move.

<a name="11210-32_para0"></a>We cannot write this in the Bill, but we should remember that if you are reading something to somebody, you quite often need to read it twice.

<A NAME="11210-32_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I have yet another priority relating to lists of those who would be considered as homeless. Tonight and on other occasions we shall be concerned about the extra additions to those who are entitled to be considered homeless against the background of the likely inability of people to house all those who have been included on this ever increasing list.
<P>

<a name="11210-32_para7"></a>Where, in the 1996 Act, advice and help was to be offered to those for whom the local authority is satisfied that there is suitable accommodation, this whole clause is now to be deleted. What remains is that those who would have previously received advice and help are now to become entitled to be treated as homeless and, while presumably are not to be listed with those who are considered Xvulnerable"&#151;because they become a duty on the council for housing&#151;are making it more unlikely that the local authority will be able to house anyone who is not within the Xhomeless" designation.
<P>

<a name="11210-32_para8"></a>I have tried to point out&#151;and will do so again&#151;that there is a real danger that a local authority's sole ability to house will be engulfed by the increasing number of <P>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH35</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>those who are designated as homeless, with less ability to bring even those with a local connection into their view and their housing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-32_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I seem to be repeating words that I have said at least twice this afternoon. If we take this clause out of the Bill, we undo part of the aims of the reforms in the 1996 Act. I sat through about three months of that Bill and I would hate to see this go ahead.
<P>

<a name="11210-32_para9"></a>I understand what the noble Baroness is saying. It sounds as though I am not at all sympathetic, but we must make legislation that gives people their rights as homeless people but which does not help us do that because there is a terrible shortage of affordable housing. The noble Baroness, because of the situation in which she finds herself, is in danger of thinking that some of these things must not be included in the Bill because we cannot possibly deal with them since there is a shortage of affordable housing. That is not what we should be about, although I recognise that there are real problems. Therefore I am not minded to support this and I hope that Members of the Committee will be of a similar frame of mind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-32_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   I rise in support of my noble friend Lady Hanham and, wholly incidentally, in contradiction to the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, who was just spoken. I understand the argument of the noble Baroness and have some sympathy with it, but it is not sensible for us to be legislating unless we have some idea of how local authorities will be able to cope with the problem that they will be set.
<P>

<a name="11210-32_para10"></a>In terms of the draft order, which, in a way, is occurring in tandem with this, ironically the Government have in a way sought to be less prescriptive in this legislation. In particular they have rejected every amendment advanced by the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock. In that sense they have shown a willingness to be flexible. I could read the face of the Minister when the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, made the point. He believes that it is at the heart of legislation and that therefore one cannot be less prescriptive. If that attitude is to be adopted, some signal has to be given as to how resources will be provided to enable local authorities to deal with it. Otherwise we will be in a situation where the increase in bed and breakfast accommodation, which is an unsatisfactory provision, will fall on council tax payers. Council tax payers will understandably react against the categories who are being provided with that housing. Unless the Government signal in some way what their intentions are, we are conducting this legislation in mild circumstances of fog.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-32_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I could not disagree more, particularly on this amendment. With the greatest respect, those remarks slightly miss the target. In effect, the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, is seeking to reinstate Section 197 of the Housing Act, which prevents authorities from doing anything more than providing advice and assistance if other suitable <P>


<a name="column_CWH36"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH36</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>accommodation is available locally in the private sector. It prevents a local authority from providing any accommodation that it has available to a person who is vulnerable and in need, simply on the basis that that person might be able to get something in the private rented sector. Far from being prescriptive, the clause removes a restriction from a local authority without imposing any new duties. It unties an authority's hands.
<P>

<a name="11210-32_para11"></a>When we took office in 1997 we sought to reduce the restriction on local authority provision by specifying that the private sector accommodation had to be available for at least two years, but now it is clearly time to get rid of it altogether. It is obvious that certain vulnerable households who have experienced homelessness or been confronted with a real prospect of it need a period of stability and certainty to enable them to regain their confidence and equilibrium. The reality is that most tenancies on offer in the private rented sector will be assured short-hold tenancies. Those can provide a solution for some people who have experienced homelessness, but if such solutions are to be sustainable and genuinely suitable they must be provided with the agreement of the applicant. The Bill makes provision for that.
<P>

<a name="11210-32_para12"></a>We believe that removing the restriction in Section 197 is right. As the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, said earlier, different circumstances will apply in different local authority areas. Section 197 gives much greater room for manoeuvre for local authorities. I earnestly ask the noble Baroness to reconsider her position before Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-32_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I thank the Minister for what he has said and I will reconsider. As I read Section 197, it gives a local authority the opportunity to secure accommodation within the private sector for people who are already in the private sector if they seem to be becoming vulnerable. That duty can be carried out in a number of ways, and I readily accept that there will be some who do it better than others and some who will give more time to it. However, removing that section will make those people available for the full gamut of the Bill, because they will be put into the homeless category. I am trying to exert some caution on what is happening in the Bill. We cannot allow ourselves to legislate on a free-flowing basis for accommodation that may or may not be available.
<P>

<a name="11210-32_para13"></a>Even the 1996 Act and previous homelessness legislation has put a great deal of pressure on housing authorities and made it almost impossible for people who have a connection with a borough but who are not homeless to be accommodated in it&#151;people who are not priorities, because they do not have a need of homelessness as such, but who have a requirement or need to stay within a specific area.
<P>

<a name="11210-32_para14"></a>I am trying to exert a slight brake on what is being proposed. I know that it is not entirely what either the Minister or the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, would want, but we must try to live in the real world. Even if the Housing Corporation is going to be loaded with lots of lolly over the next few years, some of that will be rehabilitation money, some will be <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>improvement money and some will be difficult to spend on new accommodation. I am trying to provide a brake on what has been proposed and to make sure that the list of those who are entitled to be considered as homeless is not so long&#151;the whole thing is completely self-defeating. Section 197 still provides a perfectly reasonable answer in a perfectly reasonable way for dealing with somebody who is either threatened with homelessness or is in accommodation that is not entirely suitable. I would like to consider further what the Minister has said.

(c) at the end of subsection (2), there is inserted Xand investigation may be made, in considering violence other than domestic violence, of allegations or evidence of collusion between the victim (or a person associated with him) and the other person as mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (1A)"."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="11210-33_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: In introducing this amendment, I wish to make clear exactly what it involves. Paragraph (c) would come at the end of proposed new Section (1A). The words from subsection (2) refer to a proposed extension to Section 177(2) of the 1996 Act. If that was understood before I started, I am extremely sorry to have stated it again.
<P>

<a name="11210-33_para1"></a>Clause 10 would permit any violence, or threats of violence&#151;currently under the 1996 Act, they are domestic violence only&#151;to provide a basis of the homelessness duty. Given the greater attractiveness of becoming homeless provided by other clauses of the Bill, it would seem sensible to guard against fraudulent or collusive allegations of violence or threats of violence. This is a very wide open category and it could potentially be open to a great deal of abuse. While I accept, without reservation, that there are people who would need to be considered under the Homelessness Bill because of a threat of violence, it is an easy area for people to make up a situation. While I am sure there are not many, there will undoubtedly be those who would take advantage of this section, so there ought to be some caveats, and I see no other opportunity for providing against this within the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-33_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I was a little puzzled by this amendment, since most local housing authorities take considerable steps to investigate any allegation or stories that are brought to them. I wonder whether it would imply something that is not at all the case if this provision were simply to apply to allegations of violence. I am not sure that it should be treated differently than any other tale that is taken to a local housing authority.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I agree with what the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has said both explicitly and by implication. Authorities need to <P>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH38</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>safeguard themselves against any claims for housing which are based on inadequate facts or made up facts. That will include any allegation made in relation to violence. Authorities already have the power to make investigations where they have reason to believe that there may have been collusion. Section 184 of the 1996 Act provides that, if an authority has reason to believe that an applicant is homeless or is threatened with homelessness, they must make such inquiries as are necessary to satisfy themselves, among other things, whether any duty&#151;and, if so, what duty&#151;is owed under Part 7; that is, under the homelessness legislation. Where the question of whether the applicant is homeless depends on the possibility that it may be unreasonable for him or her to continue to occupy his or her home because that would lead to a risk of violence, the authority is empowered to make such investigations into that question as may be required. I am quite sure that Amendment No. 16 is well intended but, because it is already covered, and for the reasons given by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, I hope the noble Baroness will not feel the need to press it at the next stage.

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 XSECTION 202: REVIEWS
<br>
 After section 202 of the 1996 Act (right to request review of decision) there is inserted&#151;
<br>
 X202A SECTION 202: REVIEWS
<br>
(1) This section applies where an applicant has the right to request a review of a decision by an authority or authorities under section 202.
<br>
(2) If the applicant is dissatisfied with a decision by the authority&#151;
<br>
(a) not to exercise their power to continue to secure that accommodation is available for the applicant's occupation pending a review under section 188;
<br>
(b) in a case where the authority have secured that accommodation is available for the applicant's occupation under section 190(2)(a), to cease to secure that accommodation is so available before the time available to the applicant to bring an appeal under section 204 has expired (or, if sooner, the day on which an appeal is brought by the applicant);
<br>
(c) not to exercise their power to secure that accommodation is available for the applicant's occupation pending a review, under section 200(5); or
<br>
(d) to exercise their power under either section 188 or 200(5) for a limited time ending before the time available to the applicant to bring an appeal under section 204 has expired (or, if sooner, the day on which an appeal is brought by the applicant) or, in either case, to cease exercising their power before that time,
<br>
he may appeal to the county court against the decision.
<br>
(3) An appeal under this section may not be brought after the time available to the applicant to bring an appeal under section 204 has expired (or, if sooner, after the date on which an appeal is brought).

<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(4) On an appeal under this section, the court&#151;
<br>
(a) may order the authority to secure that accommodation is available for the applicant's occupation until the time available to the applicant to bring an appeal under section 204 has expired (or such earlier time as the court may specify); and
<br>
(b) shall confirm or quash the decision appealed against,
<br>
and in considering whether to confirm or quash the decision the court shall apply the principles applied by the High Court on an application for judicial review.
<br>
(5) If the court quashes the decision it may order the authority to exercise any of the powers mentioned in subsection (2) in the applicant's case for such period as may be specified in the order.
<br>
(6) An order under subsection (5)&#151;
<br>
(a) may only be made if the court is satisfied that failure to exercise the power in accordance with the order would substantially prejudice the applicant's ability to pursue the review against the authority's decision in his case;
<br>
(b) may not specify any period ending after the time available to the applicant to bring an appeal under section 204 has expired.""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="11210-33_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: The purpose of this amendment is to increase access to justice by providing homeless applicants with the right to appeal to the county court against a decision of a local housing authority not to accommodate him or her during the review of a decision.
<P>

<a name="11210-33_para6"></a>An applicant has a right to request an internal review of a decision made by a local authority concerning their homelessness, as to whether they are intentionally homeless or whether they qualify as being in priority need. The power is available for the authority to provide accommodation during this process. However, despite guidance setting out when this power should be used, it is very rarely operated by authorities, no matter how strong the applicant's case appears to be. This makes it very difficult for homeless people to exercise their legal right of review. If an authority refuses to provide accommodation during a review, the applicant can obtain an order from the court to require them to do so. Currently, however, the applicant must go to the High Court to do this and this new clause would simply transfer this power to the county courts.
<P>

<a name="11210-33_para7"></a>The Government have accepted that, at a subsequent stage in the Bill, where an applicant can appeal the review decision on a point of law, the equivalent power to require an authority to provide accommodation should lie in the county court. An amendment was included in the Bill to achieve that. This amendment mirrors exactly the Government's amendments at a subsequent appeal stage.
<P>

<a name="11210-33_para8"></a>There have been a number of arguments about this in another place in the passage of this Bill. However, many people feel that an appeal in the county court is much easier to deal with than having to go to the High Court. If one does not have any accommodation, taking an appeal to the High Court is quite a difficult task.
<P>

<a name="11210-33_para9"></a>I know that the Minister is worried that, if this is dealt with in a county court, many cases will come forward. I shall not go into this in great detail but there <P>


<a name="column_CWH40"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH40</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is evidence to show that that is unlikely to be the case. Shelter could provide a good deal of information on that point.
<P>

<a name="11210-33_para10"></a>This new clause seeks to provide a similar right to appeal against a decision by a local authority not to accommodate an applicant during a review as that introduced by Clause 11 of the Bill. It would give the county courts exactly the same powers to confirm or to quash a decision by an authority, and order that accommodation be provided as already provided in Clause 11. It sets out the full circumstances in which an applicant may appeal against a decision not to provide accommodation during a review.
<P>

<a name="11210-33_para11"></a>This is a technical amendment and it is lengthy because it needs to cover the four circumstances in which an authority may accommodate an applicant temporarily when it reaches an adverse decision on a homelessness application and decides to withdraw accommodation. Those four circumstances are, first, not to exercise its power to continue to secure that accommodation is available for the applicant's occupation pending a review under Section 188. That is a straightforward example of where an authority decides that an applicant is not in priority need and therefore it is no longer under a duty to house the applicant once it has made its decision.
<P>

<a name="11210-33_para12"></a>The second circumstance is that in a case where the authority has secured that accommodation is available for the applicant's occupation under Section 190(2)(a), it ceases to secure that accommodation is so available before the time available to the applicant to bring an appeal under Section 204 of the Act has expired (or, if sooner, the day on which an appeal is brought by the applicant). That is where an applicant is found to be intentionally homeless and has been accommodated under the duty under Section 190(2)(a). This duty requires an authority to provide accommodation for a reasonable period (usually 28 days) while the applicant looks for alternative accommodation.
<P>

<a name="11210-33_para13"></a>The third circumstance is not to exercise its power to secure that accommodation is available for the applicant's occupation pending a review under Section 200(5). This is where a local authority believes that an applicant has a local connection with another authority and proposes to refer the applicant to that authority.
<P>

<a name="11210-33_para14"></a>The fourth circumstance is to exercise its power under either Section 188 or Section 200(5) for a limited time ending before the time available to the applicant to bring an appeal under Section 204 of the Act has expired (or if sooner, the day on which an appeal is brought by the applicant), or, in either case, to cease exercising its power before that time. This mirrors the provision in Clause 11. If we are going to give proper access to justice for people who are homeless, it is important that they should not have to appeal to the High Court.
<P>

<a name="11210-33_para15"></a>There are circumstances under which the process might take anything up to three months, and we are talking about three months in which people are trying to get an appeal on a decision made about their right to accommodation and trying to appeal in the High Court.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-34_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   As my noble friend Lady Maddock was speaking, it occurred to me that the Minister, almost above any other Minister on the government Front Bench, would not want to suggest that procedural difficulties should affect an applicant's access to justice. I hope that that argument is one that he will be able to dispose of.
<P>

<a name="11210-34_para0"></a>Perhaps it might also be worth referring to access to legal aid. By definition, the people who would benefit from the amendment of my noble friend Lady Maddock would be seeking legal aid, but there would be no different criteria whether the application were made in the county court or the High Court.
<P>

<a name="11210-34_time0"></a><H5>6 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-34_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Every member of the Front Bench is united in their desire that there should not be procedural bars to justice, so I do not single myself out for any particular respect. The noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, explained the position very clearly. Can I, with equal clarity, indicate why at the moment we are not minded to accept the proposal made? It may be helpful if I remind Members of the Committee that there are two procedural stages open to an applicant who is dissatisfied with the decision made on his homelessness case.
<P>

<a name="11210-34_para1"></a>First, under Section 202 of the 1996 Act, he has the right to request the authority to review its decision. Secondly, if he is dissatisfied with the decision of the authority on review, then the applicant has the right under Section 204 to apply to the county court on a point of law. Under the current provisions, applicants who wish to challenge an authority's decision not to continue to accommodate pending either a review by the authority or an appeal to the county court must seek judicial review of that decision in the High Court.
<P>

<a name="11210-34_para2"></a>Applying to the courts to overturn an authority's decision should be a matter of last resort and should only be considered where it is clear that the authority has not made a proper decision. During the passage of this Bill's predecessor, then the Homes Bill before the general election, the Minister for Housing gave a commitment in another place to consider whether there was a case for giving the county court power to require an authority to accommodate an applicant pending an appeal to that court; that is, at the second stage of the procedural process. He gave that commitment in response to a new clause moved by the Member for Bath. He consulted the Lord Chancellor's Department and decided that there would be merit in providing such a power because of practical considerations involving court administration.
<P>

<a name="11210-34_para3"></a>Those obvious considerations are at the second stage of the process. The county court is involved anyway. It is ridiculous to have the county court deciding on the principal point, but to have to go to the <P>


<a name="column_CWH42"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH42</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>High Court to determine whether the local authority is right not to continue to house the applicant pending the consideration of the matter by the county court. In short, the Government recognise that it does not make administrative sense for two different courts to consider different decisions about the same homelessness case at the same time.
<P>

<a name="11210-34_para4"></a>The previous Bill fell before the General Election, but a suitable clause, Clause 11, was included in the new Bill. It contained the provision to allow the county court to consider whether continued accommodation should be provided pending the second stage of the process by the county court.
<P>

<a name="11210-34_para5"></a>The principle of judicial review by the High Court remains valid where applicants wish to challenge an authority's decision not to continue to accommodate, pending a review by an authority of the homelessness decision. That is at the first procedural stage, because at that stage there is no involvement of any court, so the problem of two courts considering the same issue does not apply. There is a difference between the first and second stages. In the second stage the county court is involved anyway, so it is obviously right for the county court to deal with that issue. The county court is not involved at the first stage and we strongly resist giving it the power to intervene in decisions by an authority not to continue to accommodate at the review stage, because in effect we are completely taking away the discretion from the local authority at that non-court stage to decide what to do while the review is going on. Unlike applications for judicial review, applications for county court are not filtered in any way; there is no permission or leave stage. The amendment would require the county court to consider every application made to it.
<P>

<a name="11210-34_para6"></a>If the power to intervene in local authority decisions not to continue to accommodate an applicant pending a review were removed from the High Court to the county court, every case would have to be considered on its merits by the county court. Secondly, there would be a strong likelihood that the court would be minded to require the authority to continue to accommodate in just about every case, until the court had had the opportunity to consider the application properly. Having done that, it is unlikely to want to take any action that would result, directly or indirectly, in the applicant becoming homeless, pending its decision of the case.
<P>

<a name="11210-34_para7"></a>Thirdly, the net effect would be a huge incentive for every homeless applicant who received a decision against his interests to ask for a review by the authority and to apply to the court for an order requiring the authority to continue to accommodate him. That would undermine the local authority's discretion to decide whether to exercise that power.
<P>

<a name="11210-34_para8"></a>We appreciate the motives behind the amendment. It is different from the second stage of the procedure, where the county court is already involved. It would be likely to result in local authorities being compelled to house every applicant whose case they have just rejected. That would place a significant burden on the local authority in respect of a large number of cases in which it had decided that there was no priority.

<P>

<a name="11210-34_para9"></a>While we understand the motives, we are at the moment not minded to accede to the amendment. I hope that the noble Baroness will consider carefully what I have said. It is an important issue, but we have put the procedural position on the right side of the line, because we also have to bear in mind the needs of the local authority and all the homeless people they are trying to house.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-34_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I thank the Minister for his very full reply to a rather complicated amendment, although the principle is quite simple. Most of those who practise law in the area of homelessness and housing believe that this would be a very helpful amendment. The main argument that the Minister used towards the end was that we would get far too many cases and that local authorities would be required to house everybody who came up with a request for a review. My noble friend Lady Hamwee has already pointed out that many of the people we are talking about would have to satisfy the test of the Legal Services Commission because they would probably be applying for legal aid. This is a very stringent test, so the situation would not be as the Minister suggested it would be. There is ample evidence to show that the Government are unduly frightened about the number of cases that would come forward. I will look again both at my amendment and the Minister's reply. It is a complicated area; I am still convinced of the rightness of what we are trying to achieve but, given that we are in Grand Committee, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="11210-34_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am grateful to the Housing Law Practitioners Association for drawing this amendment to my attention. I mention it in part because it is proposing these changes from its own experience. My noble friend mentioned housing law practitioners during our debate on the previous amendment. However, that did not meet with any <P>


<a name="column_CWH44"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH44</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>favour so it may be a mistake on my part to mention it again. However, the amendment arises from an awareness of problems and experience.
<P>

<a name="11210-34_para14"></a>The first part of the amendment is proposing an alteration to Section 188(3) of the 1996 Act. The eagle-eyed amongst Members of the Committee will observe that the difference involves inserting the word Xsecure". That will add to a power to continue to secure accommodation in the circumstances of Section 188(3). A similar provision is included in proposed paragraph (2) of the amendment, which will substitute for Section 204(4) of the 1996 Act. That would remove inconsistencies in the legislation which mean that housing authorities do not have the power to provide temporary accommodation for some applicants pending a challenge to a decision, whether by way of review or a county court appeal. I hope that the Minister can explain the inconsistencies. They appear to be as follows.
<P>

<a name="11210-34_para15"></a>There is no discretion to provide accommodation from new, as it were, only to continue to provide it. If for some reason, therefore&#151;and there must be many reasons&#151;temporary accommodation has not been provided during the period between application and the initial decision, there is no power to provide it pending the review or the appeal. I have already mentioned my wish to see far wider powers in local authorities. The power of general competence seems to be a particular oddity if it is necessary to amend legislation in order to provide it. If it is required, however, let us take the opportunity to do it.
<P>

<a name="11210-34_para16"></a>A further inconsistency is that there is no power to provide temporary accommodation pending a review of the duration of accommodation provided to an intentionally homeless household. Moreover, there is no power to provide temporary accommodation for a person who is threatened with homelessness pending review or appeal. I hope that the Minister can say that there is no need for these amendments because the powers are included elsewhere. That would be the happiest answer I might receive. I beg to move.

<a name="11210-35_para1"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 12 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-35_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I seek clarification of what the clause means. Currently, by Section 159 of the 1996 Act,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xa secure or introductory tenant . . . an assured tenant . . . of housing accommodation held by a registered social landlord, or . . . an assured tenant of housing accommodation allocated to him by a local housing authority",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-35_para2"></a>
are excluded from Part VI of the 1996 Act. That means that they are not entitled to further consideration for housing allocation.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para3"></a>By Clause 12, assured tenants of registered social landlords and of local housing authorities are removed from such exclusion and are, therefore, by definition, included in those who may be considered for housing allocation as are those who are secured tenants unless they make an application for a housing transfer, in which case they are to be excluded from this section; that is, they are not to be considered for allocation. So subsection (7) is not to be altered and it allows the housing authority to allocate housing in whatever way it deems appropriate. Potentially, therefore, all those mentioned above could be brought back into consideration.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para4"></a>This intervention seeks to probe what is in fact intended by this clause. What is its purpose? What is to be the effect if statutory tenants already with accommodation are then included in the duties of a council for accommodation? How are those who are seeking a transfer to be considered within this section? Also, what is the relationship between Section 159(7) of the 1996 Act and the new Section 160A(2) proposed by Clause 13(2) of the Bill?
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para5"></a> Without wishing to sound in any way patronising, the Minister may want to give me a general reply and, since I have not been courteous enough to give him notice of this question, I would be perfectly happy if he wanted to write to me and the Members of the Committee in detail regarding the relationship of the various clauses one to another.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para6"></a>Amendment No. 21 is also part of this group, and I am sure the Minister would say that this provision is already included elsewhere in other legislation. But the amendment is designed to ensure that other applicants and the authority are protected against the making of false statements in order to obtain housing. The wording of the amendment is based on ground five in Part I, Schedule 2 of the Housing Act 1985.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-35_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Dealing first with Clause 12, one of the aims of the Bill is to improve choice for those seeking social housing and remove any barriers which some would-be applicants face. Elsewhere in the Bill there are provisions which give everyone the right to apply for a housing allocation with the exception of those who are ineligible, and everyone will have the right to have their application considered fully in accordance with the authorities' published allocation scheme.

<a name="11210-35_para7"></a>Currently, local authority allocations of housing to their existing tenants, which is one of the specific concerns that the noble Baroness raised, and to tenants of registered social landlords do not fall within Part VI of the 1996 Act and are, therefore, not subject to the priorities and procedures of the authority's published allocation scheme. There is no requirement to consider, for example, whether reasonable or additional preference should be given. There is currently no statutory framework governing applications for transfers. Individual authorities' policies on how they treat applications from these groups can be arbitrary.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para8"></a>Clause 12 will bring those groups of applicants within Part 6 and extend to them the same right to have their application for accommodation considered equitably, along with new applicants for social housing.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para9"></a>Clause 12 substitutes a new Section 159(5) of the 1996 Act and removes existing Section 159(6). The effect of these changes is that allocations to applicants who are existing secure or introductory tenants of the authority and who have requested a transfer must be considered under the terms of the published scheme. Tenants of registered social landlords who apply to an authority for housing must also be treated under the scheme on the same basis as all other applicants.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para10"></a>Clause 12 will therefore ensure that all existing tenants within the social sector who make an application to a local housing authority for accommodation must have their application considered according to their housing needs on the same basis as all other applicants. That will bring greater certainty of fair treatment to existing tenants who, as matters now stand, may not have their applications for transfer given the priority deserved.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para11"></a>At the same time, where local authorities wish or need to initiate a transfer of accommodation for management purposes&#151;for example, where existing tenants of a block of flats have to be moved to other accommodation to allow the authority to effect repairs or renovation work&#151;the necessary allocation of alternative accommodation can be made without being subject to the rules of their allocation scheme.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para12"></a>That important provision will ensure fair treatment for existing tenants within the social sector. I hope that it deals with the specific points raised by the noble Baroness. If not, she will no doubt raise any that I have missed.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para13"></a>Amendment No. 21 would lift the exemption for existing tenants if the applicant had knowingly made a false statement or instigated someone else to make one to obtain his existing tenancy or accommodation. The amendment is unnecessary, because there are already established provisions that deal specifically with that situation.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para14"></a>In the case of a secure tenancy granted by the local authority, the Housing Act 1985 sets out various grounds on which a court may make an order for possession. Those set out in Part 1 of Schedule 2 to that <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Act are fault grounds, where the court may make an order if it considers it reasonable to do so. Ground 5 says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xthe tenant is the person, or one of the persons, to whom the tenancy was granted and the landlord was induced to grant the tenancy by a false statement made knowingly or recklessly by the tenant or a person acting at the tenant's instigation."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-35_para15"></a>
Ground 17 in Part 2 of Schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1988 makes an identical provision in respect of assured tenancies allocated by a housing association. That provides the proper remedy to apply where a tenancy has been granted as a result of a false statement. Accordingly, I hope that the noble Baroness will not oppose the clause standing part and will not move Amendment No. 21 when the time arises.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-35_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   As the Minister's comments are now on the record, I am content not to press Amendment No. 21. However, I am not quite so content with Clause 12. I have listened carefully to the Minister, and I will have to read his comments again. I find the clause extremely confusing. I am not a lawyer, but I suspect that it will also be confusing in the future. The trouble is that Part 6 is by itself a negation, because it excludes people under Clauses 5 and 6. What is now happening is that those people are being brought back into Part 6, but then, if they are seeking a housing transfer, they are excluded again. I may have completely misunderstood what it is all about, but I would like this to be considered again. I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. I am impressed that he does not need to write to me because he has probably got it all sorted out, but if he does think there is anything more that he could do, I would be grateful.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para16"></a>It is likely that I shall want to return to the amendment, if for no other reason than that it extends once again the number of those who will have to be considered under the Bill. We have now probably encompassed the entire list of anybody who is ever likely to apply for housing under any circumstances. One begins to wonder whether this should be called the Homelessness Bill or whether it is actually the local authority's housing allocation that will come into question. That is really where we all started.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para17"></a>Under the circumstances, although I may return to it at a later stage, I shall withdraw my opposition to the clause.

<P>

<a name="11210-35_para22"></a>The purpose of the amendments is to remove the power to disqualify an applicant due to unacceptable behaviour at the eligibility stage of the allocations process, which comes before the allocation. The construction of the Bill means that a number of <P>


<a name="column_CWH48"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH48</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendments are required to achieve this. They break down as follows. The first six amendments remove the provisions relating to unacceptable behaviour at the eligibility stage. The penultimate amendment makes it clear that there is no requirement to house an applicant where no preference is given due to unacceptable behaviour, even where there is a surplus of housing.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para23"></a>It is one of the Government's worries that if at the stage of eligibility housing need was taken into account, and somebody was not told that he or she had no rights to anything, when it came to allocation, if an authority had a surplus of housing it would be forced to give an applicant a place, even though it had decided that he was ineligible due to behaviour when his needs were assessed beforehand.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para24"></a>The final amendment inserts the unacceptable behaviour test at the no preference stage. This is only necessary because the Bill currently refers back to the eligibility provisions at this point.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para25"></a>These amendments would ensure that more emphasis was placed on housing need in the allocation process, bringing the Bill more in line with the policy intentions set out in the housing Green Paper, while still meeting the Government's intention that local authorities should have clear discretion not to house applicants in cases of anti-social behaviour.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para26"></a>As the Bill is currently drafted, the unacceptable behaviour provisions arise at two points in the allocations process: at the beginning where eligibility is considered; and later on when preference is removed. These amendments would not remove the provisions from the Bill altogether. They would simply omit them from the eligibility stage, thus ensuring that housing need is considered before decisions are taken not to house applicants. If we are in the business of preventing homelessness, assessing need is the first thing that should be done, whatever else is included in the process. That is the aim of the amendments.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para27"></a>The amendments would retain the unacceptable behaviour provisions at the later stage where preference can be removed and make it clear that authorities have clear discretion not to house applicants in cases of anti-social behaviour.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para28"></a>The unacceptable behaviour test goes much wider than anti-social behaviour and it would allow local authorities to apply it in a wide range of other situations, particularly where rent arrears were concerned. The Minister will know that that is something about which people have been very concerned because sometimes rent arrears are due to the fact that housing benefit claims have not been dealt with within a reasonable time. The Bill would clearly give authorities discretion not to house tenants in circumstances other than anti-social behaviour.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para29"></a>At the eligibility stage no account needs to be taken of housing and support needs. Housing need is considered later in the process. If we are thinking about rough sleepers and those with problematic histories, many of whom may have been evicted from previous tenancies, they would be likely to fall foul of the unacceptable behaviour provision&#151;the very people whom we would probably find sleeping rough <P>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH49</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on our streets. I believe that this would undermine resettlement work in particular. If we look at other strategies to help people in that position, again this is not in line with those, which is why the amendment is so important.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para30"></a>In addition, it would be possible for an authority to refuse to house a homeless family because of the anti-social behaviour of just one member of that family, no matter how extreme the needs of other members of the family.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para31"></a>It is also important to consider the way in which the provisions will be interpreted and applied by local authority officers. That is something to which we have returned time and again today. In practice, the unacceptable behaviour provisions will be translated into practice notes and forms for allocation officers to use in making decisions. In reality, officers will base their decisions on the guidelines produced to help them apply what is a hypothetical test and the officer must in effect second-guess the court by deciding whether the authority would be entitled to a possession order, because that would be the ground on which the test would be made.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para32"></a>There is clearly a significant danger that, in practice, applicants would fall foul of guidelines drawn up to assist officers when applying the test. It is important to remember that officers would not have to take any account of the housing need at this point. That is our greatest concern.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para33"></a>I want to say something about the test of being unsuitable to be a tenant the testing authority must apply at the eligibility stage and the Xno preference" stage to determine whether an applicant's behaviour makes him or her unsuitable to be a tenant and the applicant must be guilty of unacceptable behaviour. That is defined as behaviour that would entitle an authority to a possession order under Section 84 of the Housing Act 1985; moreover, that behaviour must be serious enough to make him unsuitable to be a tenant and that must still be the case in the circumstances at the time that his or her application is considered.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para34"></a>The Government have argued that this is a high test and they believe that it will be used in exceptional circumstances but that it will provide an important tool to prevent authorities being required to house anti-social tenants. However, the grounds for possession are wide-ranging and include any breach of tenancy conditions and rent arrears, as well as anti-social behaviour or conviction for an arrestable offence.
<P>

<a name="11210-35_para35"></a>In 2000, 150,000 possession actions were taken by social landlords, the vast majority of which were for rent arrears. If a landlord takes proceedings as far as the court it can presumably be assumed that he is satisfied that he is entitled to a possession order. However, of those 150,000 cases only 65 per cent resulted in an order being made, of which only 18 per cent resulted in an outright order. So in more than 80 per cent of the cases where social landlords presumably believed that they were entitled to a possession order, the court ruled that they were not. If that is the case, it adds to the argument that we are <P>

<A NAME="11210-36_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I wonder whether I may be anecdotal as the noble Lord, Lord Graham, was earlier. I want to test what the effect of the amendment would be against what is in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para0"></a>In my borough of Kensington and Chelsea, for a significant amount of time we have had an extreme problem with crack dealers in housing estates. As a result of enormous effort, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 has been changed to make dealing crack a criminal offence.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para1"></a>Once the local authority has evicted a crack dealer from his premises because he has committed a criminal offence, which happens very quickly, why should the local authority spend any more time considering whether that person is entitled to housing? As I understand the amendment, it would move the test further along the line so people such as the crack dealer would have to be considered at a later rather than an earlier stage, when one might quickly draw the line under the consideration of whether they are going to be given housing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-36_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I understand what the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, is saying about crack dealers, but crack dealers have families. We are worried about the families of crack dealers under current legislation. Because of one person, the needs of the rest of the family will not be considered.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-36_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   Most of the crack dealers we have found have been single, unaccompanied and loaded with other crack dealers in the premises. Some might have families and some may not, but there needs to be some balance between letting things roll on for too long and drawing the line at a much earlier stage. I am sure there are examples other than crack dealers which I cannot bring to mind at the moment. There should be an option to draw the line at the beginning.

<P>
<A NAME="11210-36_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The exchange between the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, identifies the issue here. The Bill as drafted allows local authorities to draw the line at the beginning of the process rather than considering a person's conduct later on at the allocations stage, as the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, wants. That is the issue. What is the right approach?
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para2"></a>There is concern in some quarters that the Bill would allow an authority to decide to treat someone as ineligible for an allocation by simply assessing their behaviour and not considering any other factors. I assure the noble Baroness that that is not the case.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-36_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I was acknowledging that there was concern in some quarters that the Bill as drafted would allow an authority to decide to treat someone as ineligible for an allocation simply by assessing their behaviour without considering any other factors. Let me assure the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, who was most concerned about this, that that is not the case. I will briefly go through the provisions. Section 160A(7) gives authorities a power to decide to treat individual applicants as ineligible for an allocation of housing. It applies only where a person&#151;either the applicant or a member of his household&#151;is guilty of unacceptable behaviour serious enough to make him unsuitable to be a tenant of the authority and in the circumstances at the time of the application he is unsuitable to be a tenant by reason of that behaviour. Where a local authority receives an application and has reason to believe that either the applicant or a member of his household has been guilty of behaviour that may make him unsuitable to be a tenant, there are a number of steps through which they have to go.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para4"></a>First, they have to satisfy themselves that there has been behaviour that falls within the definition of Xunacceptable behaviour". In others, there has to have been behaviour by the applicant or by a member of his household that would, if the applicant were a secure tenant, entitle the authority to a possession order under Section 84 of the Housing Act in relation to certain grounds. Those grounds are set out in Part 1 of Schedule 2, except Ground 8. They are fault grounds and include behaviour such as conduct that is likely to cause nuisance or annoyance and the use of the property for immoral or illegal purposes.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para5"></a>In considering whether a possession order would be granted in the circumstances of a particular case, the authority will have to consider whether, having established the grounds, the court would consider it was reasonable to grant a possession order. It has been established in case law that, when the court is deliberating, Xreasonable" means having regard to the interests of the public and the interests of the parties. So in deciding whether it would be entitled to an order, the authority will need to consider these interests and this will include all the circumstances of an applicant and his household.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para6"></a>That is stage one. Under stage two, having concluded that they would be entitled to an order, authorities will need to satisfy themselves that the behaviour is serious enough to make the person unsuitable to be a tenant of the authority. For example, the authority would need to be satisfied that, if a possession order were granted, it would not be suspended by the court.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para7"></a>Thirdly, the authority would need to satisfy itself that, in the circumstances, at the time of the application the applicant was unsuitable to be a tenant by reason of the behaviour in question. Taken together, those three criteria provide a pretty stiff test.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para8"></a>Only if satisfied in all three aspects may the authority consider exercising its discretion to decide that the applicant is to be treated as ineligible for an <P>


<a name="column_CWH52"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH52</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>allocation. In reaching a decision on whether or not to treat the applicant as ineligible, the authority will have to act reasonably, which means that it will need to consider all the relevant matters before it. Those will include all the circumstances relevant to the particular applicant, whether health, dependants or other factors. In practice, the matters before the authority will include the information provided on the application form.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para9"></a>It is therefore important to bear in mind that it would be impossible for an authority to take a view on whether it would be entitled to a possession order without considering fully all the factors that a court would take into account in determining whether or not it was reasonable to grant an order. In reaching a decision as to whether or not to treat someone as ineligible, the authority must again consider all the relevant factors.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para10"></a>It is important that housing authorities are clear about the implications of these important provisions and, accordingly, I undertake to ensure that those issues are included in the statutory guidance that will be issued to accompany the Bill.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para11"></a>There is agreement that authorities should have the power to decide not to allocate where they are satisfied that the applicant is unsuitable to be a tenant&#151;and there is agreement that the test of that should be the criteria set out in the Bill as drafted.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para12"></a>Let me say again that this has been a difficult balancing act to get right and a great deal of careful consideration has gone into the construction of the provisions in the Bill. I believe we have got them about right. If authorities are to have the power to decide not to allocate&#151;on which there is a consensus&#151;it is appropriate for that power to be framed in terms of eligibility and to be included in the section of the Bill which specifically deals with eligibility.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para13"></a>Where the authority comes to a decision that the applicant is unsuitable to be a tenant and will not be allocated accommodation, then that is not a matter of priority. In such a case, the question of what degree of priority should be given to the applicant does not arise. It would not be appropriate, therefore, for the power enabling the authority to decide not to allocate to form part of Section 167 of the 1996 Act, which deals with the scheme which authorities must have for determining priorities and procedures to be followed when allocating housing.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para14"></a>I hope Members of the Committee will agree that the best way to ensure that authorities act reasonably and look at all the circumstances of the case before deciding to treat an applicant as ineligible for housing is through the undertaking I have given to make this clear in guidance.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para15"></a>I therefore urge the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, not to press her Amendments Nos. 19, 20, 22 to 25, 32 and 34.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para16"></a>Amendment No. 31 seeks to ensure that, in determining the priority and preference to be given to an applicant, an authority can take account of <P>


<a name="column_CWH53"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH53</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>behaviour which affects the applicant's suitability to be a tenant only if the behaviour was deliberate, wilful or negligent.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para17"></a>An authority may have a large number of applicants who fall within the categories of applicants who must be given reasonable preference. In determining which among them should be given priority for an allocation, the authority may take a number of factors into account. The basis for determining priority will need to be made clear in the authority's published allocation scheme. The Bill sets out three factors which, among others, a scheme can include as factors which can be taken into account when determining priority. Those include any behaviour of a person or a member of his household which affects his suitability to be a tenant.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para18"></a>That will allow authorities to take account of both good and bad behaviour which may have been demonstrated by individual applicants. Bad behaviour might include unacceptable behaviour such as persistent but minor rent arrears, which is not serious enough to make an applicant unsuitable to be a tenant but, nevertheless, is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the level of priority that is deserved relative to other applicants. Another applicant, perhaps an existing tenant applying for a transfer, may have demonstrated that he or she is a model tenant. All other practice being equal, the authority may decide that the latter deserves more priority than the former.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para19"></a>The issue of what relative priority individual applications should receive for an allocation is a matter for the authority to decide, in accordance with the principles of its published scheme. It is right that that discretion, including decisions about how behaviour should be taken into account, should rest with local authorities. I therefore ask the noble Baroness not to press Amendment No. 31 when the time comes.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para20"></a>Government Amendment No. 33 is a minor drafting amendment. The Bill gives local housing authorities powers to take account of unacceptable behaviour when making decisions about applicants for the allocation of housing.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para21"></a>Clause 13 constructs a test of unacceptable behaviour serious enough to make the applicant unsuitable to be a tenant of the authority. Where an authority has decided that an applicant is guilty of such behaviour, it will have the power under Clause 13 to decide to treat them as ineligible for an allocation, or it may decide to treat them as eligible but not to give them any preference under Clause 15.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para22"></a>The policy intention is that the test of unacceptable behaviour should be exactly the same, whether as a basis for treating a person as ineligible or for deciding that he or she does not deserve to be given any preference. The qualification,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xby reason of that behaviour",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="11210-36_para23"></a>
which Amendment No. 33 inserts into Clause 15, is essential to ensure that authorities do not have a broad power to decide to treat applicants as ineligible or not to give preference for reasons that are not linked to the unacceptable behaviour. The qualification appears in Clause 13&#151;new Section 160A(7)(b)&#151;which deals <P>


<a name="column_CWH54"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH54</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with the treatment of an applicant as ineligible for an allocation. However, it was omitted from Clause 15&#151;new Section 167(2C)(b)&#151;which deals with the treatment of an applicant as deserving not to be given any preference.
<P>

<a name="11210-36_para24"></a>Amendment No. 33 merely inserts that qualification in new Section 167(2C)(b) to ensure that the provisions on unacceptable behaviour are clear and symmetrical. I hope that the Committee will feel able to agree to that technical amendment when the time comes.

At this stage, I have to withdraw the amendment and I shall not be moving the others in the group, but I would be grateful if the Minister could undertake to consult a little wider with those groups, because they are of the opinion that perhaps we should have amendments along those lines.

<FONT SIZE=3>even with private landlords who are working with the authority. These formed a real basis for ensuring that lettings were made on a basis which prevented too many people with multiple social needs being placed together in one small community.
<P>

<a name="11210-37_para8"></a>The extension of these priority categories, and the emphasis that will be placed upon them rather than on those who have non-priority requirements, will assist local authorities which still prioritise who receives the limited accommodation available. There must be some statutory requirement to record the allocations made and the decisions implemented. The suggested wording of Schedule 1A, which is included in Amendment No. 40, would provide guidance for that. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-37_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The amendments seek to restore a statutory requirement for housing authorities to have a register of applications for allocation of accommodation. This cuts across the thrust of the Bill which is to encourage authorities to move away from fixed registers and consider more flexible ways of operating their allocation schemes, which can enable them to offer more choice to those who seek a social housing tenancy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-37_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   May I intervene? I may not have made myself clear. What I believe is required is not the traditional housing register where everybody went on in date order and the points rammed up. I suggest that for all those to whom the authority appears to have an obligation and whom they are treating as homeless persons or priorities, the decisions that are made must be recorded. It is not a case of keeping a list against which it works but rather one that records what happens, who is treated and dealt with, what housing allocations are proposed and how many offers people receive. That is what I mean by a register rather than the traditional register which concerns housing allocations under the points system.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-37_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   That is helpful. It is hard to imagine how a reasonable local authority can operate any housing allocation scheme without proper records being kept. It clearly could not do so and it clearly needs some list or register of applicants and some record of what it has done in relation to the applications. However, it is not for the Bill to specify or prescribe as far as local authorities are concerned what is the best means of administering their housing allocation arrangements. If an authority decides that it would be necessary or constructive to keep a particular form of register it will be for that authority to decide what form or type of register will best meet its administrative needs. I entirely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, that there needs to be proper administration but I do not believe that it is right for us to prescribe it in the Bill, particularly having regard to the way the noble Baroness has put her argument in support of the amendment. What we are dealing with when we talk about the register, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, described it in her opening remarks, is a formal sort of register which very few people will <P>


<a name="column_CWH56"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH56</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mourn. What the noble Baroness is talking about is the record-keeping facilities for local authorities. I do not believe it is right to put that on the face of the Bill. The Bill builds in safeguards to ensure that all applicants must have their applications considered properly, including transfer tenants, and to ensure that applicants can obtain the necessary information that will allow them to assess how long they will have to wait for an allocation. The Bill provides a sensible framework of duties and powers. It is for individual authorities flexibly to construct the detailed administration arrangements as they see fit. Therefore the statutory requirement that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has in mind is not appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-37_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. The sad truth is that not all local authorities are quite as good and rigorous as others. It will be fundamentally important, as we get into the operation of this Bill, that there are no misunderstandings about who is housed and against what criteria.
<P>

<a name="11210-37_para9"></a>I am sure that most authorities will do it in a most rigorous way, but if there is not a requirement for those records to be kept then there could be confusion and cause for challenge over a particular housing application.
<P>

<a name="11210-37_para10"></a>I hear what the Minister has said. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="11210-37_para14"></a><P>

<a name="11210-37_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 28, 30 and 35.
<P>

<a name="11210-37_para16"></a>Amendment No. 27 relates to the allocation scheme and the extension relating to those eligible for statutory housing by dint of being homeless and those to whom a duty will be owed. This extends not only the need for permanent but also temporary accommodation. The Bill gives no recognition to the fact that both are going to be difficult to supply&#151;particularly in an over-stretched part of the country such as London. For those authorities in particular, it must be right that they are able to indicate that there are pressures on both permanent and temporary accommodation. They need to give a reasonable indication of the availability of both temporary and permanent accommodation, and the likelihood or otherwise of the need or prospect of choice in either.
<P>

<a name="11210-37_para17"></a>The reality is that temporary accommodation is seldom a choice anyway, but there are areas which are so pressed for temporary accommodation that it should be proper for the local authority to indicate that that temporary accommodation might not even be in the borough&#151;indeed, it might not even be in the same part of the country. That should be made clear, together with the permanent housing constraints.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-37_para18"></a>Amendment No. 28 brings us to the nub of the Bill. It refers to those who are to be eligible under the homeless priority categories. My amendment adds a few more categories which I plucked from Section 167(2) of the 1996 Act to the Bill's provisions. However, neither it nor anything we have so far been told covers comprehensively those who will be eligible under the Bill to be considered as homeless.
<P>

<a name="11210-37_para19"></a>The Minister was kind enough to send me and other Members of the Committee a copy of the consultation paper on the homeless priority needs categories. These are not spelt out in the Bill but unless they are all included at a later stage, they will be introduced by an order subsequently.
<P>

<a name="11210-37_para20"></a>It is essential that the categories that have been in consultation, together with all those we have discussed today and which appear in the rest of the Bill, should be included in the Bill so they can be considered before the Bill leaves this House.
<P>

<a name="11210-37_para21"></a>As I have said before, I believe that local authorities will have the greatest difficulty in fulfilling their obligations under the Bill, not only because of the increased number of categories, but also because of the limited time which they will have to keep people in temporary accommodation and the unlimited amount of time which can pass before an offer is accepted or reviews can be completed and refined.
<P>

<a name="11210-37_para22"></a>Amendment No. 30 is interesting. It must be the first time that any suggestion of means testing has been considered in relation to homelessness legislation. What does it mean? Does it mean that if a person who is deemed to be homeless but who has more than a certain income&#151;I wonder what that income is&#151;he or she will not be helped? Will they be charged for such help? Will they be given more expensive accommodation? Will they have to pay more for whatever accommodation is provided to them? Not even the Explanatory Notes give any help with that and I suggest, therefore, in the absence of explanation, that it should be deleted.
<P>

<a name="11210-37_para23"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 35 is a probing amendment, to see what thoughts the Government have on the provision of housing by any local authority to its community, not just to the vulnerable homeless. One of the greatest dangers posed by this Bill is that the only people ever to be accommodated by the local authority in future will be those with other social needs in addition to that of housing. There are no indications as to how priorities are to be judged or what discretion the local authorities will have to try to make allocations of properties in a way which will ensure that they have balanced communities. They particularly need to ensure that they have a sufficient number of ways to support themselves both financially and socially so as to encompass and embrace those less able to do so.
<P>

<a name="11210-37_para24"></a>Under those circumstances, a local authority should have a discretion, where it can show a plausible reason for doing so, to cease temporarily to operate under the terms of this Bill and allocate properties to others who may not be governed by it. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-38_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Amendment No. 29 is grouped with this section and it might therefore be appropriate for me to speak to it now.
<P>

<a name="11210-38_para0"></a>When we last debated the Bill at Second Reading, I raised the matter of same-sex couples, pointing out that homelessness could be created in a situation in which the partner in whom a tenancy was vested died, leaving the remaining partner in danger of being made homeless since the local authority is perfectly within its rights to seek repossession and would be under no obligation to offer alternative accommodation. There have been incidents where that has in fact happened.
<P>

<a name="11210-38_para1"></a>The Minister was kind enough to say that he would write to me and has since done so. It seems that the Government are aware that the rights of couples outside marriage are prompting debate within society. It is felt, however, according to the Minister's letter, that the issues are complex and need to be considered in total, which is currently being done. I had intended to table an amendment which would automatically extend tenancy rights in such cases to the remaining partner, in the same way as exists for married couples. However, it would probably not be appropriate in the light of the Minister's letter and the fact that this Bill is about homelessness rather than tenancy rights.
<P>

<a name="11210-38_para2"></a>My amendment therefore looks at the problem from a different angle. The point of the amendment is to oblige local authorities, via their allocation schemes, to give preferential treatment to partners from same-sex couples who have been denied succession to a tenancy under the relevant provision of the various Housing Acts. In other words, the amendment directly seeks to prevent homelessness and is thus relevant to this particular Bill. I would very much welcome hearing from the Minister in response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-38_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I wholly support what the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, has just said. I thank the Minister for the copy of his letter to the noble Baroness, in which he indicates that there is a detailed cross-departmental review of issues which concern same-sex couples arising not just in the housing area. When he responds, perhaps he can say when we might have some more news of that review. Also, if he is going to oppose the amendment, can he say what harm there might be in at least making this small step in a limited area before we have the result of the whole of the review?
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-38_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I rise to speak to Amendment No. 36, which is also part of this group. The purpose of the amendment is to require an authority to inform an applicant of the decision that their priority for housing has been adjusted due to behaviour affecting their suitability to be a tenant, or when their preference is removed because of unacceptable behaviour.
<P>

<a name="11210-38_para3"></a>There are two points in the Bill at which the local authority can deem an applicant's behaviour unacceptable and refuse to house him or her: the eligibility stage in Clause 13 and the removal of all preferences at Clause 15. At the eligibility stage there is a requirement that the authority should notify the <P>


<a name="column_CWH59"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH59</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>applicant of the decision, the grounds and the right to review. That is covered in Clause 13(9) and (10). No such requirement exists at the later stage, where all priority is removed. Instead, the onus is on the applicant. That is covered in Clause 15(4). That is inconsistent.
<P>

<a name="11210-38_para4"></a>On Report in another place, the Minister undertook to consider the problem further. How far have the Government got with those considerations? The Minister also undertook to consult the local authority associations. I would be interested to hear his response now, since the matter is still being raised by people who are concerned about it. There seems to be an inconsistency. I look forward to the Minister's reply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-38_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   I hope that the Minister will say something about the growing problem arising out of the nexus of asylum seekers. In many parts of the country, there are people whose business is to purchase properties and let them directly to asylum seekers or to act as an agent for the council. I am disturbed at the desperation that councils often feel, believing that they have to use every agency and avenue available, only to find that they are aiding and abetting the exploitation of the market of desperate people who need housing.
<P>

<a name="11210-38_para5"></a>When the Minister seeks to put the onus on councils and housing associations, I hope that he will bear in mind that in many circumstances there is a burgeoning market that meets the bill. I shall not use the term Xunscrupulous". They are businessmen who invest money and provide a service, but the occupants of their properties are part of the whole nexus of homelessness and need some protection.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-38_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   The Minister reasonably rebuffed my last attempts to support my noble friend Lady Hanham. In expiation of any fault in this direction on my part at a previous stage, I shall be entirely content if the Minister says that Amendment No. 27, moved by my noble friend, is not required under the wording of the Bill and is superfluous to requirements.
<P>

<a name="11210-38_para6"></a>In case he does not say that, I will put forward what I intended to say. Earlier in our deliberations I described London local authorities criss-crossing London, moving tenants around from one authority to another so that there could be as many exports as imports and vice versa. I took that up with the authority in the constituency that I previously represented. I was told that one reason was that my authority was more particular about where it put people and that it was sorry that accommodation that it had rejected within the City of Westminster was being used by other local authorities.
<P>

<a name="11210-38_para7"></a>The cause of my anxiety is that that other accommodation may be cheaper and in circumstances where demand exceeds supply, one would see more of such accommodation being used. Whether that falls into line with what the noble Lord, Lord Graham, alluded to a moment ago, I do not know. I can put on record that, when I was a parent with undergraduate <P>


<a name="column_CWH60"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH60</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sons, I could not help noticing that the accommodation in three different universities was all being managed from within the same ethnic group. This suggested that there was a degree of what the noble Lord, Lord Graham, described as a nexus at work. However, if the Minister tells me that those words are not required, I can obviously rest easy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-38_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I hope that I can give the assurance that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, seek, in relation to Amendment No. 27. That amendment would require authorities to include in their allocation schemes a statement on offering applicants for accommodation choice, not only within the authority's own boundaries but also in other areas also.
<P>

<a name="11210-38_para8"></a>I am very keen to see authorities co-operating to allow allocations to be made across local housing authority boundaries, which I take to be the intention of this amendment. The noble Baroness, as a member of a London borough council, will be aware of the London Housing Partnership, which is an excellent example of inter-borough co-operation, and of the London Authorities West and North initiative, which gives London social tenants the opportunity to move out of the capital. I also refer to HOMES&#151;the Housing Mobility and Exchange Services, which operates across the UK.
<P>

<a name="11210-38_para9"></a>People's choices about where they want to live do not neatly fit into local authority boundaries, as the noble Baroness, above all, will know. There will frequently be excellent reasons for seeking accommodation outside the authority in which an applicant is currently situated. Of course, facilitating movement from areas of high housing demand to areas of low demand makes good sense.
<P>

<a name="11210-38_para10"></a>I say that because I wish to make it clear that I fully agree with the spirit of Amendment No. 27, but I do not believe it is necessary to place such a statement on the face of the Bill. The provisions of the 1996 Act about allocations relate to the selection of tenants of an authority's own stock and nominations to tenancies of accommodation held by other housing providers, whether other authorities or RSLs. An authority's policy on offering people a choice of housing implicitly includes its policies in relation to its own accommodation and its arrangements with other authorities. This is a matter that can best be supplemented by guidance and to put it on the face of the Bill would be superfluous.
<P>

<a name="11210-38_para11"></a>One small point on Amendment No. 28. The noble Baroness will recall that Part VI of the 1996 Act is concerned with long-term allocations of secure, introductory or assured tenancies. On reflection, it may be that the reference in the amendment to the choice of Xtemporary" accommodation is therefore misplaced.
<P>

<a name="11210-38_para12"></a>Amendment No. 28 raises a different issue. It would add a number of additional categories of housing applicants to the categories that must be given reasonable preference for an allocation. In fact, it would restore three categories that are currently on the face of the 1996 Act.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH61"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH61</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-38_para13"></a>I can see the temptation to restore those particular categories. At first blush, it might look as though the Government had cast aside the housing needs of those who would fall within these categories. However, let me quickly explain that we are doing so such thing.
<P>

<a name="11210-38_para14"></a>The provisions in the Bill that deal with the allocations framework seek to give effect to the policies that are set out in Chapter 9 of the housing Green Paper. That sets out the Government's view that meeting housing need must remain the priority for lettings and transfer policies. It also suggested that assessments of housing need should in broad terms consider whether the applicant is homeless or threatened with homelessness, living in housing conditions that are intolerable or has a need to move to avoid hardship. The Bill reshapes the reasonable preference categories to give effect to that approach. We are not tinkering; we are setting out to rationalise the allocations framework and trying to ensure that the circumstances of everyone who may have a need for social housing are captured by the reasonable preference categories.
<P>

<a name="11210-38_para15"></a>The starting point was the categories in the 1996 Act, but these are flawed to some extent by the policies underlying the 1996 changes&#151;that is, the implication that households accepted as statutorily homeless should have to wait for an allocation of housing. In 1996, for the first time since the homelessness legislation was introduced in 1977, households that were owed a main homelessness duty were removed from the reasonable preference categories. However, in practice, housing authorities still needed to be able to give preference to these groups or they would not be able to move them on and bring their homelessness duties to an end. Therefore the three categories which are the subject of Amendment No. 28 appear to have been introduced as a proxy for these groups, to facilitate them. Virtually all homelessness applicants accepted as unintentionally homeless and in priority need would fall into one or other of these categories but their housing need derives from the fact that they had experienced homelessness and needed a settled home not from their social circumstances. It makes far more sense, therefore, to construct a single reasonable preference category that reflects that fact&#151;

<P>

<a name="11210-39_para1"></a>Looking objectively, the three categories that are the subject of the amendment are based on vulnerability, not on housing need. The fact that someone may have social needs or dependent children or may be expecting a child does not necessarily mean that they have a need for housing. They may be adequately housed already. We are dealing with allocations, not determining whether somebody is homeless.

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH62</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para2"></a>I understand the concern that households who fall within the three categories in question and who have housing needs should be entitled to be given reasonable preference for an allocation of local authority accommodation. I can assure the Committee that that is achieved by the revised categories of reasonable preference included in Clause 15(3).
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para3"></a>Amendment No. 29 would alter the categories of applicant to whom a local housing authority would be required to give reasonable preference in its housing allocation scheme. It would require a local housing authority to give reasonable preference to the surviving partner of a same-sex couple. Such partners do not at present have tenancy succession rights, as they are not considered to be spouses.
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para4"></a>The noble Baroness has already made her concern about that clear at an earlier stage and, as she very fairly said, I wrote to her and sent a copy to other interested Members of your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para5"></a>We have already made a commitment to a full review of the tenure arrangements for social housing. It will be undertaken by the Law Commission, which has been asked to produce a report and draft Bill by July 2003. I believe that that answers the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. I am pleased to say that succession issues will be considered in the first phase of the review. Tenancy succession is just one of many issues that the Government intend to review with regard to its effect on couples outside marriage&#151;same-sex or otherwise. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked what harm would it do to deal with it now. We believe that it is appropriate that the issue of same-sex couples should be dealt with as a whole rather than piecemeal, one issue at a time.
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para6"></a>Although I understand the concerns of the noble Baroness on this issue, I believe that any surviving partner who is in housing need as a result of the ending of a tenancy to which they cannot succeed will be caught by the provisions of the new Section 167(2) as inserted by Clause 15(3). I ask the noble Baroness to bear that in mind when considering what to do with her amendment when we get to the next stage.
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para7"></a>I am rather surprised by Amendment No. 30, because authorities may reasonably wish to take account of a person's resources in determining the relative priority to be given to those applicants who must be accorded reasonable preference for an allocation of accommodation.
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para8"></a>I should stress that the new Section 167(2A) relates only to determining priority between those applicants who must be given reasonable preference. It does not remove that preference but provides authorities with the power to take account of differences between applicants with similar needs. It is surely reasonable that an authority, perhaps in an area of high demand, faced with two families in equally difficult circumstances should consider the resources available to those families in resolving their housing problems. Where, for example, one family had the resources to enter the private sector, perhaps through a shared ownership scheme, but the other did not, the authority is surely right to give priority to the poorer family first.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH63"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH63</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para9"></a>That would obviously not relieve the authority of its responsibilities to those who fall within the reasonable preference categories, including the better-off families. It does, however, allow the authority to prioritise the use of its scarce resources in an entirely appropriate way.
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para10"></a>I hope that, on reflection, the noble Baroness will feel that taking account of financial resources is a good example of a factor that authorities may wish to take into account in prioritising claims of those who must be given reasonable preference for accommodation. While Amendment No. 35 is not necessary or appropriate, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for the opportunity to address the important issues it raises.
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para11"></a>Subsection (3) of Clause 15 in fact substitutes new provisions in Section 167 of the 1996 Act. Most of those provisions confer discretion on the local housing authority when framing their statutory housing allocation schemes. That is the case with new Sections 167(2A) to (2E) inclusive. Nothing would be gained by allowing authorities to suspend those provisions when the extent to which they use them is, anyway, at their discretion. Furthermore, some of those provisions are particularly helpful in meeting some of the concerns of the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para12"></a>New Section 167(2), like its predecessor, requires allocation schemes to be framed to give reasonable preference in allocating housing to those who in general terms have the most pressing needs. That is a duty; but the preference required to be given is one which is reasonable in all the circumstances. In determining priority between applicants who fall into a reasonable preference category, an authority may specify factors it will take into account, such as an applicant's financial resources or behaviour. They also allow authorities to ensure that local circumstances&#151;for example, a particular estate&#151;can be reflected in allocation schemes.
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para13"></a>Section 167(2E)(b) allows authorities to be able to allocate particular housing accommodation to persons of a particular description in accordance with schemes known as Xlocal lettings schemes". These could include key worker schemes where it might help attract modestly paid but essential staff to high cost areas. In another area, such a scheme might be used to lower the child to adult ratio on an estate with a high child density or the scheme might be operated to provide housing for those who do not usually receive high priority on an authority's register&#151;young single people, for example. It is up to the authority, in consultation with its partners, to draw up a scheme which meets local housing needs and which will support the development of sustainable communities. The provisions of the Bill provide the foundations for that work and, within the statutory framework, wide discretion is given to authorities and schemes can be adapted to reflect local circumstances. It is important to keep local lettings schemes under review and to monitor their impact on those who are not part of any local lettings schemes. Of course, local lettings schemes <P>


<a name="column_CWH64"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH64</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should not override the reasonable preference categories across an authority's stock when taken as a whole.
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para14"></a>Taken together, the provisions of subsection (3) provide a robust framework for authorities. They will ensure that, in general, authorities will allocate their housing to those in greatest need but will also provide flexibility to adapt schemes to local circumstances. In that way, the Bill as drafted meets the principal purposes behind this amendment. I hope that the noble Baroness will not proceed with the amendment at the appropriate time.
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para15"></a>I move on to the topic of provision of information. The Bill as drafted gives housing applicants the right to request information about any decisions that have been taken or are likely to be taken about the facts of their case and any decision that no preference is deserved and therefore will not be given because of unacceptable behaviour. Amendment No. 36 would remove the onus from the individual to request information, and would place an obligation on authorities to inform applicants of any such decisions.
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para16"></a>I am sympathetic with the thinking that lies behind this amendment. I share the noble Baroness's concern that the application process should be transparent and accessible, and that applicants should be able to obtain the information they need to get an indication of the degree of priority that their application will receive relative to others.
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para17"></a>I also believe local authorities should be encouraged to provide as much feedback on individual applications as is practicable&#151;as early as practicable&#151;so that those applying for housing know where they stand and understand their prospects, good or bad. This is particularly important in respect of those households that are being accommodated temporarily under the homelessness legislation whilst they wait for the opportunity of an allocation to provide them with a more settled home. This will be reflected in statutory guidance.
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para18"></a>I remain concerned, however, that we do not inadvertently place local authorities in a difficult position. The provisions in the Bill have been very carefully and thoughtfully drafted. They recognise that while some authorities may decide to continue to operate what may be characterised as points-based allocation schemes, we hope that&#151;in response to encouragement from the Government&#151;many other authorities will adopt choice-based schemes that allow applicants more opportunity to exercise their preference for particular properties. The statutory provisions therefore need to be appropriate to both types of scheme, as well as any others that authorities may devise.
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para19"></a>The provisions on applicants' right to information about their application&#151;which Amendment No. 36 would modify&#151;are a case in point. Under choice-based schemes, active consideration of the facts of an applicant's case may not occur until he or she makes a specific application for a particular property. Under the provisions as drafted, an applicant has the right to ask about decisions that are likely to be taken on his <P>


<a name="column_CWH65"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH65</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>application. This right applies at any stage of the process, including from the outset. If no decisions have been taken by the authority at the point he makes his request, the authority would nevertheless have to give consideration to his application and inform him what the decisions would be likely to be. It is right that those applicants who want to have this information from the outset, should have the right to obtain it. However, I remain concerned that it could be onerous for authorities operating a choice-based allocation scheme to have to provide that information as a matter of course for all applicants, whether they require to have it or not.
<P>

<a name="11210-39_para20"></a>In light of what I have said, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment in relation to the information divisions. I believe that I have dealt with all of the amendments in this group.

<A NAME="11210-39_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Perhaps I can pick up on the Minister's final point. Does he think that it is particularly important, where a local housing authority is making a decision that is based on the behaviour of the tenant, that the tenant is told very clearly&#151;and with the onus on the local housing authority&#151;why the decision has been made? That is a particular circumstance where, rather than going to the local housing authority and asking why, a tenant is told why as a matter of course&#151;routinely&#151;at the same time as the authority takes the decision? After all, quite apart from the rights of tenants, there is an interest on everybody's part in modifying behaviour. If the tenant knows about it, the tenant may be able to take steps in the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-40_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I have considered this point carefully. I continue to see a distinction between the decision to exclude and how it operates in relation to allocations. There will be nothing to prevent an individual authority from notifying applicants at the allocation stage about such a decision if they wish. It will be a matter for each authority to make its decision about that. I do not wish to place an obligation on it to do this. Separately from this, the Bill makes adequate provision for applicants to be able to obtain information about how their application is being treated. As I have said, we will encourage in guidance that authorities make the allocations process as transparent as possible and that they provide as much feedback to applicants as possible. At this stage, we think that the right balance is to leave it to the local authority to decide who to tell and when, but also to give a power to require information.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-40_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   The Minister has dealt with a number of amendments in his customarily lucid and well directed remarks. However, I remain concerned about the fact that the people who are included in the order, plus all the others who are mentioned in the Bill, do not look as if they will appear on the face of the Bill. We need to consider that. It is a sine qua non that a Bill that embraces homelessness should at least define what homelessness will encompass, particularly the increased priorities. It is broadly covered in <P>


<a name="column_CWH66"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH66</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Clause 15(3), but I am not sure that that is adequate. We should think about that again and possibly return to it.
<P>

<a name="11210-40_para0"></a>The other concern that the Minister has not entirely allayed is the business about being sure that one can maintain a balanced community. I hear exactly what he said, that the local authority is left with discretion, but my fear is that the priorities are so wide and that there will be so many people included in them that the discretion will, by definition, not be there. There will be no possibility to allow discretion within the terms of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="11210-40_para1"></a>I will probably return to both of those matters. In the meantime I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

We have spent as long today discussing allocation as we have spent discussing the homeless. One cannot really take place without the other. Therefore, it would make more sense to make it clear in the heading that that is what the Bill is about.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-40_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I recognise the purpose of the amendment, but it is unnecessary and adds nothing to the substance of the Bill. The current provision allows the short title to be very short indeed, for which we should all be grateful.
<P>

<a name="11210-40_para12"></a>The principal purpose of the Bill is to deliver the Government's manifesto commitment to strengthen the homelessness safety net.

<a name="11210-40_para17"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall be very brief. This amendment seeks to address the important issue of children of homeless families being separated from their parents. I realise that the amendment is not perfect but I would like to highlight again the problems in legislation regarding homeless families who have children.
<P>

<a name="11210-40_para18"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for the interest he has shown in this issue, and for distributing relevant information and documentation. I also realise that children's rights go across several pieces of legislation and that discussions have occurred in another place in relation to the children and adoption Bill, also in the Standing Committee of the Homelessness Bill, and in an adjournment debate, so it is being well discussed. I understand also that an amendment to the Children Act is outside the scope of the Bill and so we must work with what is possible.
<P>

<a name="11210-40_para19"></a>Local authorities need to have joined-up thinking about homelessness and housing and many do. However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, said, there are inconsistencies and variations, and these may impinge negatively on children.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-40_para20"></a>I would like to emphasise what I said during the Second Reading debate; namely, that the Children Act places the needs of children as paramount&#151;and I emphasise the word Xparamount"&#151;in offering council services, but that there have been cases where children and their parents have been separated.
<P>

<a name="11210-40_para21"></a>Shelter continues to collect evidence from its housing aid centres. In the cases it has presented as snapshots, there are no apparent child protection issues involved. The parents have been able to care for the children but the only problem was that the families were homeless. In one case, the Court of Appeal found that Section 17 of the Children Act conferred a power for local authorities to provide assistance, rather than a duty, and that the duty to provide accommodation under Section 20 of the Act is a duty to house the child, not the parent or parents, and the child is thus taken into care.
<P>

<a name="11210-40_para22"></a>Shelter considers that the judgments made in that case, and another, are likely to have a significant impact on homeless families with children in need and will inevitably result in social services authorities providing assistance in far fewer cases.
<P>

<a name="11210-40_para23"></a>In the adjournment debate in another place, the honourable Member for Regents Park and Kensington North spoke of experiences from her caseload, which indicated that strict adherence to the letter of the law may find households intentionally homeless in Xcircumstances that appear unjust", for example, if a family has unexpected financial problems and is forced to sell their home.
<P>

<a name="11210-40_para24"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, in her reply, rightly pointed out that striking a balance in relation to housing and social services is important, and undertook to look at the judgments I referred to again and to examine the implications. There is a clear concern from the Government about this issue. I recognise that this is complex but, if children's welfare is being put at risk, we must act. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-40_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I rise to support this amendment, having put my name to it. I raised this at Second Reading too. There is considerable evidence that there are some pretty awkward and difficult cases where children have been taken away from their parents. There is a good deal of evidence which Shelter can provide, as I am sure others can too.
<P>

<a name="11210-40_para25"></a>The Minister shared our concern about this and said he would consult a little more widely. I hope that, by supporting this amendment and giving him a chance to tell us how far he has got with those endeavours, we will at least hear something which shows that we are looking at this matter.
<P>

<a name="11210-40_para26"></a>I recognise that this is a difficult matter. What the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, and I are looking for, is a firm commitment from the Minister that, whatever he does, he will try to take some kind of action to ensure that the sorts of cases we have heard about no longer happen.

<A NAME="11210-41_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   I should like to speak briefly to the amendment in the names of the noble Baronesses, and to express my deep concern about the current situation. This was brought home to me in a recent conversation with a housing allocations manager in a London authority, of 30 years' experience. He described how he had started, enthusiastic and there to help people and now at the end of each day he was depressed because there was no housing to provide people with. We all recognise that some local authorities are under tremendous pressure.
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para0"></a>I also spoke with the manager in Barnardo's for families in temporary accommodation. He understands what is happening and his perception is that families are being threatened with their children being taken into care, not because it is a realistic proposition&#151;it would cost local authorities #300 to #400 or probably more to look after such children&#151;but because there is such a shortage of accommodation and they regularly use this is a means to put families off applying any further pressure to gain accommodation. They hope that they will stay with in-laws or find some other means. That can lead to families being in poor accommodation, and they can disappear from sight. Shelter has described case histories in which we learn that so-and-so is happening to a family but after that we do not know what happens to them.
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para1"></a>I welcome the fact that at the latest meeting that we attended the Minister brought up this matter unprompted. It clearly weighs heavily on his mind and I look forward to his response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-41_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I said on Second Reading that we were in the process of investigating whether there had been any change in practice in the way that local authorities provide assistance for families with children who are homeless. We regard it as a very important matter and we need to get to the bottom of what is going on. Subsequent to that debate, there has been a further legal development in that one of the two cases, A v. Lambeth, has been heard and decided by the Court of Appeal, which has simply brought further confusion to what the legal position is. My colleagues and officials and lawyers at the Department of Health are studying the implications of that latest decision. It goes without saying that the more confusing the law becomes, the more one's concern about the matter rises.
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para2"></a>In addition to discovering the detail of that recently decided case, I have seen&#151;I said that I would do so&#151;the social services directors of a number of local authorities, some unitary and some two-tier. The social service directors who I saw all had arrangements in place to ensure that the social services departments work together with the housing authority&#151;or housing department in the case of the unitaries&#151;to find an appropriate solution for the whole family when dealing with families with children who have made themselves intentionally homeless. Concern arises in relation to intentionally homeless families.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para3"></a>The authorities that I saw were therefore authorities in which the process was joined up between housing and social services. I have asked my officials to work closely with their counterparts in the Department of Health to see how we can ensure that this kind of sensible and co-ordinated approach is adopted much more widely. We need to see whether amendments to the law are required. What I said on Second Reading was that I would come back with a conclusion in relation to this while there was still time for the House to do something about it. That means that I will try to let noble Lords know what the position is before Report and that on Report at the latest I will say what conclusion has been reached.
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para4"></a>It is plain that we are still at the development stage, so I have nothing definite to offer Members of the Committee today. However, I reaffirm my commitment to report back to the House before it is too late for something to be done.
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para5"></a>On the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, it has been put forward on the basis that it is a means of raising the issue. She should hold that in the hope that we will be in a position to say that anybody who is intentionally homeless and who has children shall thereafter be treated as if they were unintentionally homeless. As everybody rightly says, a balance has to be struck. We must try to ensure that there is an arrangement in place where local authorities and social services and housing departments are motivated to work together to find solutions for families as a whole. I will report back in correspondence to those who are interested, and certainly at the latest on Report.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="11210-41_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am conscious of the hour so I shall not say as much on this issue as I intended. The purpose of the amendment is to require <P>


<a name="column_CWH71"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH71</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>accommodation to meet minimum physical housing standards in order for it to be considered suitable for homeless applicants.
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para9"></a>Under the current requirements for accommodation provided for homeless households to be suitable, local authorities need only to Xhave regard to" housing standards on overcrowding and physical conditions. That does not mean that they have to meet those standards.
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para10"></a>We all know that homeless households are often placed in temporary accommodation that is overcrowded or unfit. Accommodation will usually only be unsuitable for a household if it can be proven that, for example, disrepair or overcrowding will be harmful to that particular family. This amendment seeks to strengthen the definition of suitability, so that temporary accommodation for all homeless households has to meet the same minimum standard as that applying to all other households.
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para11"></a>The Government are and have been trying to ensure better standards in all our housing, including houses in multiple occupation, and the Government have also just consulted on proposals to replace the fitness standard with a more modern standard based on risk assessment.
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para12"></a>One of the other interesting areas is overcrowding and this amendment would have two effects. First, it would make the requirement that accommodation should meet minimum housing standards; but, secondly, it would specify the standard with which the accommodation would have to comply.
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para13"></a>The legislation on the overcrowding standard is very much out of date and has remained virtually unchanged since the Second World War. The amendment would at least ensure a prohibition on the use of overcrowded accommodation for homeless households. One of the issues I was concerned about is that people sometimes have to make quick decisions and sometimes they are offered accommodation for which there would clearly be overcrowding. If this provision were passed, that would be one matter I would not be so concerned about.
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para14"></a>It seems inconsistent that local authorities have the power to enforce standards in their area, but they do not have to meet those standards when they are accommodating homeless households. I hope the Minister will look favourably on this. This may not be the way to do exactly what we are asking, but I hope that he will understand the point I am making. I believe it is in line with the Government's desire in other areas of housing to improve housing standards in Britain. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210-41_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for raising the issue of housing standards. Overcrowding and poor standards are unacceptable; but it will take, as she interestingly acknowledges, a long time to address those deep-seated problems. Pressure on housing, particularly in London and the South, is growing. Many people live in unacceptable conditions. We have made a start in <P>


<a name="column_CWH72"></a>

<B>10 Dec 2001 : Column CWH72</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>addressing the problems of poor quality housing stock and insufficient supply of affordable accommodation in some areas, and I listed earlier some of the measures that we have taken.
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para15"></a>Taken together, our measures will bring all social housing up to a decent standard by 2010; they will improve the supply of affordable housing in areas where it is most needed and promote sustainable home ownership and a healthy private rented sector. However, as everyone in this room knows, none of that will happen overnight. We are making progress. We know that more needs to be done. Amendments that strengthen the duty on authorities would not tackle the real problem. They would not increase the supply of suitable accommodation on the ground and would make no real contribution to the efforts being made physically to improve the standards of existing accommodation.
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para16"></a>There must be real concern that, in the very immediate term, the amendments could add to the difficulties which many local authorities in high demand areas are experiencing in securing sufficient accommodation to discharge their statutory obligations to homeless people. The issues of fitness and decent standards of accommodation are very important and have been neglected by previous administrations for too long. They are real issues, but they must be addressed by devoting real resources to finding real solutions. That is what this Government are doing.
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para17"></a>There is a general consensus that the housing fitness standard in Section 604 of the 1985 Act no longer reflects a modern understanding of the health and safety risks in dwellings. We are therefore trying to replace the standard with the housing health and safety rating system, which will apply a modern, risk-based approach to assessing housing conditions and will apply to all dwellings. We have consulted widely on this proposal and we are currently carrying out further work to strengthen the system and ensure its robustness.
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para18"></a>We are consulting on proposals to legislate to enable the selective licensing of private landlords in areas of low housing demand. These measures will give local authorities the power to tackle the problem of unscrupulous landlords who will not meet minimum standards of management.
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para19"></a>All those reforms will secure better standards of accommodation, and we plan to legislate for them as soon as we have an appropriate vehicle. However, the Homelessness Bill is not the appropriate vehicle.
<P>

<a name="11210-41_para20"></a>As Members of the Committee may know, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary in another place has given an undertaking to review the current overcrowding provisions, which are very outdated, as the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, has said. At this stage, I cannot say what the outcome of the review will be, but I can give an assurance that the Government are determined to address poverty in all its manifestations and will take the necessary steps to do so.

<P>
<A NAME="11210w01_wqn1"></A><B> Baroness Sharples  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What steps are required by asylum seekers to gain asylum status in the United Kingdom; what steps they take to verify entitlement; and what documents are issued at each phase.[HL1666]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210w01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker:  </B>  In order to qualify for asylum under the terms of the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, an applicant must show that he has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Having made an application for asylum an asylum seeker must: attend a screening interview to establish identity and to enable us to determine whether their claim should be considered by the United Kingdom or a third country; where appropriate, complete a statement of evidence form (SEF) and return it within 10 working days; and attend an interview to substantiate the claim.
<P>

<a name="11210w01_para0"></a>Each asylum claim is considered on its individual merits when all the evidence that the applicant has provided is taken into account, together with detailed country information from a variety of sources.
<P>

<a name="11210w01_para1"></a>An asylum seeker will be issued with various documents at the different stages of the process: a standard acknowledgement letter (SAL) once the screening process has been satisfactorily completed; a SEF and notes in a language that the applicant understands, and (in most cases) a Section 75 notice which asks for any other reasons the applicant may have for staying in the United Kingdom, where appropriate; an invitation to interview letter; a letter conveying the decision. If asylum is granted, further papers explaining the benefits attached to the new status are sent; if the application is refused, the decision letter will be accompanied by appeal papers and notes on how to appeal.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210w01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker:  </B>  No. The list of offences at Draft Article 2 of the framework decision are in the main Xharmonised" offences. There are no common EU definitions, but all member states have criminal offences under the generic headings.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210w01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker:  </B>  Offences will be defined by the issuing member state. Depending on the circumstances, if issued by a judicial authority in the United Kingdom, Xswindling" would include any offence under the Theft Acts 1968 and 1978, and Xforgery of administrative documents and trafficking therein" would include any offence under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981.

<A NAME="11210w01_wqn5"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether, under the proposed European Union arrest warrant, the British plane spotters detained in Greece would be extradited for interrogation and trial in that country had they returned to the United Kingdom prior to arrest.[HL1784]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11210w01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker:  </B>  The Government cannot speculate on the possible outcome of an extradition request that has not been made. The draft framework decision has not been brought into force.
<P>

<a name="11210w01_para3"></a>If a European arrest warrant had been issued by a judicial authority in a European Union member state for the offence of espionage, that would have fallen within the scope of the draft framework decision. This is also an offence carrying a sentence of more than
12 months in United Kingdom law. Although the draft framework decision proposes removing the dual criminality test from a number of serious offences and making it optional for other offences, the retention of the dual criminality test would not be a barrier to extradition for espionage. The draft framework decision does not provide for any person subject to its provisions to be interrogated. It follows the standard provisions of extradition instruments, which provide for the handing over of persons either suspected or convicted of extraditable offences solely for the purposes of trial and/or imprisonment. Requests for the taking of evidence are dealt with under separate instruments.

Hence our welcome for the recent WTO Ministerial Declaration at Doha, launching a development-focused trade round, which should remove barriers to developing country exports and so offer the best route for the developing world to escape from poverty. We particularly welcome the commitment on the part of all WTO members to the objective of duty-free, quota-free market access for products originating from Least Developed Countries (LDCs), which encourages other WTO members to match the EU's EBA initiative. This already allows tariff-free imports for everything but arms, bananas, rice and sugar from LDCs.

<A NAME="11210w03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has decided to introduce new arrangements for the future management of both the fabric of Apsley House, the last historic building for which DCMS retains responsibility, and the Wellington Museum, currently run by the V&A. A contracting out order to be laid before Parliament will, if approved by both Houses, allow certain of the Secretary of State's functions under the Wellington Museum Act 1947 to be contracted out. The functions to be contracted out are intended to relate to the maintenance of the fabric of Apsley House and the running of the Wellington Museum. It is expected that expressions of interest in taking on the contract will be sought through an advertisement and that tenders will then be invited.
