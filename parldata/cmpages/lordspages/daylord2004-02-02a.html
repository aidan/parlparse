<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>When they will set up their review of the law on prostitution; and what will be its terms of reference.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, a scoping exercise for the review is well under way, examining issues arising from prostitution, to establish what measures need to be included in a national strategy for prostitution in order to reduce exploitation, protect communities, and address the links with serious crime, particularly the illegal use of class A drugs. The scoping exercise is looking at both street-based and off-street prostitution, and we hope to be ready to publish a paper for public consultation later this year.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that welcome reply, particularly for the news that the review team will be up and running very shortly. He may be aware that I spent last Thursday with the street offences and juvenile protection unit of the Metropolitan Police on patrol in Brixton. Is he aware that those officers, whom I cannot praise highly enough for their caring and compassionate approach to the people they were dealing with, will particularly welcome his commitment to examine the question of drug dependency, for that factor is driving the great majority of street prostitutes into that way of life? Will my noble friend assure me that the review will be sufficiently wide ranging to take into account how other countries are tackling the problem of prostitution and look particularly at some measures of decriminalisation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, we are grateful for the important insights that my noble friend brings to the subject from his close attention to the way in which the Metropolitan Police works in the field. We are well aware of the link between prostitution and the use of drugs. That issue will covered by the review, as will the way in which other jurisdictions deal with the persistent problem of prostitution. We will look at all aspects of the issue and the potential for legalisation will be one of the aspects examined in the review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   My Lords, given that the Home Office is leading the review and given that two of the major issues are sexually transmitted diseases and drug addiction, how will the Home Office work with the Department of Health in conducting the review? Will <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the Minister comment on the suggestion that some young women are forced into prostitution in order to pay their university tuition fees?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew4"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, there is absolutely no evidence to support the noble Baroness's latter point. Obviously, in conducting a review of prostitution, the Government will seek to work holistically and across all departments with an interest in the issue. The Department of Health is one of the most important of them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, what dealings have the Government had with the English Collective of Prostitutes? My noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes and I both had dealings with it when we were representing this country on the United Nations Status of Women Commission. Has the noble Lord ever heard of the English Collective of Prostitutes?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lady Amos reminds me that when were in the employment of Camden borough council, we both had quite a lot to do with the English Collective of Prostitutes. I am not aware of its exact status among our current contacts, but no doubt it will make its views volubly known during the review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   My Lords, the latest Home Office figures, published in 2001, confirm that children continue to be prosecuted under the Sexual Offences Act 1956 and the Street Offences Act 1959. Will the review consider the position of children abused by prostitution and is it still the Government's intention that children should no longer be criminalised in that way?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, it is true that the sex offences legislation is used in regard to young people, but I think that the number of prosecutions is relatively small. I am sure that the reasons for those prosecutions that do take place are carefully considered. That issue will obviously be covered in the review and will need to be addressed very carefully.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware of the trafficking of women, particularly from eastern European countries, for the purposes of prostitution? That seems to be more lucrative now than trafficking in drugs. Will the review take into account those who exploit women for such purposes?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, the review will of course have to cover that issue. The issues of trafficking in women and trafficking in drugs are closely linked. That is clearly an area on which policy will have to focus. The Metropolitan Police estimates that approximately 1,400 women are trafficked annually. It believes that some 70 per cent of women who work in off-street sex markets in London are <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>foreign nationals. We recognise the problem. It may well be larger than that, but we are not sure. The review will obviously focus on the problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew12"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Southwell: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it is important to consult other faith communities within society, particularly in areas such as my own in the east Midlands? Does he recognise how strategic that is for good community relationships?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I am confident that we will want to be in touch with all faith communities on the issue. No doubt they will have important insights to offer and help greatly with the review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the whole matter was addressed in a report that the Government received in April 2000 and that, last October, the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said that the scoping was under way? What is the reason for the still-further delay in tackling such an important issue?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, the Government have had a busy legislative agenda, as the noble Lord is well aware. All things have to take their place. We have not sought to ignore the issue. We have brought forward legislation to reform the law on sexual offences. We said at that time that we would review our position on prostitution. That is exactly what we intend to do and we have been congratulated in your Lordships' House today on doing so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, will the review take into account the pros and cons of licensed brothels?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to confirm to the noble and learned Lord that the review will do exactly that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew18"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that in New South Wales, Australia, a prostitute who was infected with HIV flatly refused to give up her job, although she was described as a walking timebomb, and was imprisoned in order to keep her&#151;or the community&#151;safe? What is the position concerning health checks in this country? Is there a formal procedure or is it just a matter of individual choice?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, in the end, that must be a matter of individual choice. When prostitutes are caught up, as it were, in the law, there is an opportunity to make advice and more assistance available to them. A number of projects do exactly that. The housing trust project is one such example. But it is a personal tragedy for those involved and a great problem with regard to public health. It is in our interests to do as much as we can to ensure that women in the sex industry have proper health checks.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spopq1"></A><B> Baroness Massey of Darwen </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What initiatives they propose to tackle obesity in children.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, the Government take very seriously the need to tackle obesity not only in children but also across the population in terms of prevention and management of the condition. Prevention is the best long-term approach, especially for children. We already have under way a comprehensive programme of action which is now being further developed through two new cross-government strategies: the Food and Health Action Plan, which promotes healthy diet, and the Activity Co-ordination Team, which promotes physical activity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew21"></A><B> Baroness Massey of Darwen: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that wide-ranging reply. Does she agree that schools have a role in tackling obesity by means of exercise and diet? What are schools currently doing with regard to exercise and diet, and are there any future plans to expand that process?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-01_spnew22"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, schools have an incredibly important role to play in spreading the message about healthy eating and diet. It is very important that that message goes to the mainstream of schools, through the National Healthy School Standard and the Personal, Social and Health Education Curriculum. We have recently introduced two welcome initiatives: the first will ensure that all four to six year-olds get a free piece of fruit in schools&#151;we will have accomplished that by the end of the year&#151;and the second is the new Food in Schools Programme. As for sport, we are putting £1 billion into additional sports facilities in schools to help to increase access to sport.

<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, with reference to schools, the FSA said that it is sometimes easier to get a fizzy drink than it is to find a glass of water. When it publishes its very welcome report on the promotion of food to children, will the Government&#151;particularly the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills&#151;look very carefully at the situation involving vending machines? I refer to that in particular in light of the fact that only three companies control all vending machine operations in schools.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, that is a very important point. The consumption of carbonated drinks has doubled since the 1980s. I draw two points to the noble Lord's attention. We all look forward to the FSA's report on the promotion of food to children. The Food in Schools Programme consists of eight elements, one of which is to promote more access to water in schools and another of which will examine <P>


<a name="column_441"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 441</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what else vending machines can offer by way of healthy options. I am also told that the vending machine industry is in close consultation with the Department of Health about what else can be done.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Chan: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that, for poor families in areas such as Merseyside, it is cheaper for mothers to feed their children on hamburgers rather than healthy food? What will the Government do to help mothers&#151;particularly single mothers&#151;to feed their children on healthy food?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, the policy of promoting healthy eating must be put firmly within the strategy of reducing inequalities. We do not have complete evidence but we know that women in low-income families are twice as likely to be obese as women in the highest percentage. In areas such as Merseyside, it is important to have a co-ordinated strategy. The Food and Health Action Plan involves precisely that; it brings together all of the partners&#151;transport, local authorities, and so on&#151;to ensure that there is better access. Giving information is not sufficient: enabling people to reach cheap, adequate sources of food is very important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that figures given to us by Cancer Research UK in its briefing on this issue show that one in four adults are now obese&#151;not overweight&#151;and that 5 per cent of children are obese? However, they are not being measured in the same way&#151;many more children could well be obese; 20 per cent of them are certainly overweight. In the circumstances, doing the sort of things that the Government are doing and taking account of all of the issues that we have discussed, such as carbonated drinks and vending machines in schools, is very worthy, but that only chips away at the surface of the problem. Is there any way in which we could properly educate the whole population about obesity?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   Yes, my Lords, I quite agree. Fifteen per cent of 15 year-olds are currently obese. It is important to approach the issue as a partnership in which industry is part of the solution. The Food and Health Action Plan is very much about co-ordination. The Food Standards Agency has figures showing impressive increases in awareness of, in particular, fruit and vegetables and the amount of salt in food. We have made a good start, but there is a long way to go.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Billingham: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister be supporting Sport Relief 2004 this year? Sport Relief is a combination of Comic Relief and the BBC. It intends to raise millions of pounds for this purpose, both in the UK and internationally. I have just come from a meeting and I am very excited about it. Will the Minister say what prospect there is of getting a huge party from this Chamber to go on the Westminster Mile on 21 July to raise money for it? We can jog, cycle, skateboard or get out our Zimmers; we can all raise money for a thoroughly worthwhile cause.

<A NAME="40202-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness has made an irresistible argument. I shall be sitting on the Whip's chair later this afternoon, if people want to volunteer. I am sure the date of 10 July will be marked in all noble Lords' diaries.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that we are all pleased to hear of the initiatives under way. More than £4 billion is spent per year marketing goods on television to pre-school children alone. Does the Minister agree that, if legislative control is to be avoided, considerably more corporate social responsibility needs to be exercised by the food industry?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   Yes, my Lords. We are putting a lot of pressure on the industry to do just that. The Food Standards Agency is looking at the whole field of promotions for foods, particularly those aimed at young people and children. There was a good and lively debate on 27 January, which the noble Baroness will know about. The Food Standards Agency will be making recommendations at its March meeting and will issue a document for formal consultation later this year. At the same time, Ofcom is making it one of its first priorities to make a fast-track review of this, looking at the best approach to take to any changes to the Code for Broadcast Advertising. A great deal is happening in this field.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, in recent debates on sport I argued for an extension to the PE curriculum in schools. Will the Government consider extending it to tackle this problem? It must be financially profitable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, we expect every child to have access to two hours' PE and sport in school; by 2006, 75 per cent of them will have it. We are making great efforts. We are investing in school sport facilities and in a range of out-of-school sporting activities, particularly those linking school activities and adult club activities so that, once we capture the children, they go on being active in their adult lives.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe: </B>   Does the Minister agree that food labelling can be misleading and confusing for those who are seeking to lose weight? What plans do the Government have to introduce simple, standardised food labelling that would help everyone, including children?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, we are pressing hard on this issue, both here and in Europe, and with the industry. There are several issues. A problem is that labelling is not mandatory unless a claim is made on the label that the food is, for example, low fat. In practice 80 per cent of products carry information but often one cannot read it or cannot understand it. We could make a start by insisting that sodium is always labelled as salt. That is something we want to see. In Europe, we are pressing for full labelling and contents listing to be mandatory. We hope that we shall be able to achieve that in the not too distant future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Strange: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that many children, particularly fat children, suffer <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>from second-hand, sedentary living&#151;too much television; too much Game Boys; and too much computer use? Has she ever read The Secret Garden in which a chronically ill child is cured by seeing plants grow, by handling live animals and by running free in God's beautiful world?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I have read The Secret Garden. The noble Baroness is quite right. You will find that in contemporary children's literature there is also great emphasis on activity and adventure. One of the aspects of the Food in Schools programme that the noble Baroness will enjoy hearing about is growing clubs. They encourage young people to create and cultivate gardens. We are looking forward to seeing the results.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, as I have young children&#151;three under the age of four&#151;I tend to watch a lot of breakfast television. This morning, between 5.30 and 6.30, I was surprised to see a number of advertisements, involving three different products, that highlighted the fact that there was chocolate within the staple food&#151;breakfast cereal&#151;being advertised. When the Minister talks to the industry about responsibility, can she try to make clear the difference between breakfast cereals and sweets?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I did not know that breakfast television started that early. It is very impressive. One of the matters that the FSA is looking at is those foods that are favourites of children. Cereals are problematic in relation not only to chocolate, but also in relation to salt and sugar. We are making salt a priority for change. It is a particular problem because children's tolerance of salt levels is much lower than that of adults. I imagine that cereals will be one of the priority groups that the FSA will want to study. I believe that the industry is also prioritising it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-02_spnew18"></A><B> Baroness Oppenheim-Barnes: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it is time to come down to earth on this subject? The simple fact is that it is nothing to do with manufacturers or with the price of food. Children prefer food that is bad for them. They do not like vegetables and other foods that they are supposed to eat. It is very difficult for parents to persuade them. When I was a child, I was told to eat everything on my plate or I would not get any pudding, or that I should think of all the poor children. I used to say, "Well, give it to them". Seriously, this is the root of the problem. This is what needs tackling first.

<P>
<A NAME="40202-03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, we all have a problem with self-denial, I would not deny that at all. However, we should not give up the ghost on this because the evidence from the Food in Schools programme shows that there is a 95 per cent take-up rate and that the children are enjoying the piece of fruit they get each day. Furthermore, early evaluation suggests that it is also leading to a take-up of fruit outside school. I speak for myself when I say that we ought to be a bit more optimistic and, maybe, a bit more self-disciplined.

<P>
<UL>What obligations local authorities have to de-ice footpaths and roads.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, Section 111 of the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 requires that highway authorities in England and Wales ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that safe passage along a highway is not endangered by snow or ice. A corresponding requirement on Scottish authorities is imposed by Section 34 of the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to my noble friend the Minister for that very interesting reply. Is he aware that 24 hours after the snowfall last week many roads had been treated but most footpaths were sheets of ice? Is it the fact that local authorities do not find it reasonably practicable to treat footpaths, or that they are too lazy, or that they do not have the equipment? Does he agree that many times more people are affected by icy footpaths&#151;put at more risk of broken bones&#151;than by a few slides in a car?

<P>
<A NAME="40202-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend and I shall try to answer him before listening to the noble Lord, Lord Burnham. The code that governs these issues makes no distinction between priorities for pedestrians and footpaths and those for roads. However, it is inevitable that with the enormous media interest in what happens to road transport, particularly with regard to motorways&#151;as we recall from last year&#151;local authorities are bound to be concerned about keeping crucial routes open so that people can get to work and get home. I agree with my noble friend entirely that footpaths should receive equal priority.

<A NAME="40202-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to the House for the delay in getting to my feet. Following the Question of the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, am I right in thinking that if a householder clears the ground in front of his house, he is liable if anyone should fall or damage themselves? If that is the case, can anything be done about that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has lighted upon a difficult issue in terms of the law.

<A NAME="40202-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Strange: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that last week when Old Palace Yard was full of ice it was cleared by the good offices of Black Rod so that it was safe for your Lordships?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, we are all used to the diligence of Black Rod in all matters regarding the House. I am delighted to hear how gainfully employed he was last week to the advantage of us all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   My Lords, all local authorities face considerable funding difficulties, are subject to criticism from road users, pedestrians and, of course, motorists, and funding is made available through the block grant. Will the Minister therefore please tell us regarding a review of local government funding whether the funds available for highway-related matters and pavement-related matters will be clearly identified in future instead of being carried forward in the block grant as for any other purpose?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the role of local authorities that we are discussing competes with very many other priorities. I believe that the House will recognise the reluctance to identify this matter as a particular priority requiring specific allocation of funds. However, the noble Lord is right that when local authorities have duties laid upon them they require the resources to fulfil their obligations. I do not believe that local authorities found that the tackling of the problem that occurred last week was hindered by a very significant lack of resources.

<P>
<A NAME="40202-03_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord's response to my noble friend Lord Burnham was extremely interesting. I was not aware that members of the public were liable if someone slipped after they had cleared the pavement. In view of that and the desirability that everyone should do their bit in this respect, will the noble Lord suggest to his colleagues in government that perhaps a change might be made to the law? That could be done very easily under the Regulatory Reform Act. I should have thought that would be highly desirable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I have no doubt at all that my colleagues in the appropriate department have considered this matter over a period of time. It is an interesting area of law and contrasts with the way in which other countries address the responsibility of householders. I merely reflected how difficult the situation is. Such cases brought against householders are few and far between. I merely indicated that the local authority owns the pavement and takes responsibility for its proper upkeep in all weathers.

<A NAME="40202-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend may say that this is an interesting area of law but I find it alarming that something I have done for years every time there has been snow may render me liable for legal action. Is there not a case for dealing urgently with this matter? It is a fairly simple point in law and yet after this episode at Question Time no one will sweep the front of their pavement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, that would be a great pity. I would have acted to the detriment of the nation if my contribution led to such a response. Of course, if people completely, utterly and totally clear away all the snow and return the pavement to the condition it was in before the snow landed, they will have done an excellent job. I am sure that all conscientious citizens do that. That is why any cases brought against householders in such circumstances are very few and far between. I merely reflected that if the snow is cleared in a less than complete manner and ice is left which is more dangerous than the original covering of snow, it may not necessarily be the local authority that is responsible but the householder for having dealt with the matter inadequately.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Clarke of Hampstead: </B>   My Lords, at the height of the skidding around that occurred last week the Highways Agency spokesperson said on the radio that the incorrect salt was used as the temperature was six degrees below freezing. If the temperature had been five degrees below freezing, the salt would have been okay. Is that an accurate statement on the part of the Highways Agency? If it is, perhaps Black Rod could advise local authorities where to get their salt.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-03_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the Question is about local authorities but my noble friend mentioned the Highways Agency. Different forms and different concentrations of salt have different effects at different temperatures. The time at which the salt is laid down is important. It can be laid down too early as the snow may arrive slightly later than anticipated. Therefore, although it appears that the Highways Agency has acted promptly, the snow may cover the salt which does not result in the effect that we would all wish. We are not dealing with a precise science as regards road clearing in these conditions. I am grateful to my noble friend for his question as much mirth was generated by the statement that different concentrations of salt have different effects upon snow, ice and, indeed, water.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-03_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40202-03_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: Since we began discussing this Bill in Committee, we have tried to assist the Government in their aim of passing a well drafted law by bringing to their attention instances where we have had reservations about, for example, imprecise terminology or the use of unnecessary words. We have asked the Government to clarify their thinking with regard to the consequences that may flow from specific phrases in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40202-03_para8"></a>I am moving this amendment to Clause 42 with similar aims in mind. I should like to probe the Government's intentions in relation to the discretion of local authorities to decide what they think is necessary to support a planning application. Perhaps the Minister can say whether he thinks it is possible that, as the Bill stands, two local planning authorities that share a border with each other could demand entirely different particulars to be included in a planning application for a development that is essentially the same.
<P>

<a name="40202-03_para9"></a>I hasten to add, of course, that local autonomy and local discretion are something that we have advocated throughout the passage of the Bill through this House, so we might welcome the language as it stands. What I am really seeking, though, is some clarification regarding the issue of local planning authorities' freedom to decide what is necessary for inclusion in planning applications; how this freedom relates to development orders specifying what applications should contain; and whether the Government believe that the system of deciding what must be included in planning applications is simple, transparent and consistent or whether they take seriously our concern that this particular part of the planning system is potentially inconsistent and confusing to developers. I look forward to the Minister's response. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40202-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for his amendment. I entirely understand his desire for some further elucidation on the point. Amendment No. 114A would, as I understand it, allow a local planning authority to require that an <P>


<a name="column_448"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 448</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>application for planning permission includes such particulars as "are" necessary rather than particulars "they think are" necessary. I understand the rationale behind the noble Lord's amendment.
<P>

<a name="40202-04_para0"></a>Similarly, Amendment No. 114B would require a local planning authority to require that an application for planning permission includes such supporting evidence as "is" necessary rather than the evidence "they think is" necessary. The noble Lord was kind enough to spell out his reason for it. As I understand it, the noble Lord is concerned about the planning authority boundary issue.
<P>

<a name="40202-04_para1"></a>The draft clause does allow a local planning authority to require whatever evidence it sees fit as part of the particulars and supporting evidence of an application. The information required for assessing a planning application will vary, depending upon the nature of the proposed development.
<P>

<a name="40202-04_para2"></a>I am sure the noble Lord would argue&#151;particularly given his background in local government&#151;as I argue with my own background in local government&#151;that local planning authorities need to be able to exercise judgment and discretion in specifying information that they think should be included in an application. The amendments themselves would remove an element of that local planning authority discretion. I am sure the noble Lord does not have that intention because, like myself, authorities will all want to express maximum local discretion&#151;reflecting local interests, local pressures, local opinion and so on&#151;when planning applications are brought forward.
<P>

<a name="40202-04_para3"></a>I am also unclear what the noble Lord is seeking in terms of the content and particulars of evidence in an application. I am interested to know what extra elements of evidence the noble Lord is seeking to bring forward. That is quite an important part of this whole issue.
<P>

<a name="40202-04_para4"></a>There is no precise answer to the noble Lord's point. The characters of two local authorities with a common boundary may well be different in terms of what they see as important for particular developments, particularly where a development site spans a boundary. You will from time to time get disputes and disagreements as to what is most appropriate. What we are trying to do with this and earlier legislation is to provide a common framework and a common understanding of what is appropriate on a cross-boundary site. Ultimately, each local authority will have the discretion to decide what it thinks is appropriate in terms of supporting evidence for particular applications.
<P>

<a name="40202-04_para5"></a>It is important that we leave scope for local authorities to exercise judgment and discretion about the information they require when assessing applications. Our job as legislators is to provide a rational framework which can have common application in every locality. Obviously the amendments will not be pressed this afternoon, but were they to be successful I think they would probably prove to be a straitjacket. I am not confident that that is a good thing nor that the noble Lord thinks that is a good thing.

<A NAME="40202-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   There is only one question I want to ask the Minister. Can he explain in a bit more detail what the distinctions are between the matter that is covered by the development order, which is dealt with in subsection (1) in the inserted Clause 62, and the matters which are within the discretion of a local planning authority in subsection (3)? All we know about the relationship between the two provisions is that anything which the local planning authority may stipulate as being necessary under subsection (2) must be consistent with what is in the development order. But that does not tell you anything about the substance of each of the two categories of provision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   Before the Minister answers, I totally agree with what he says. I do not want, in any way, to put more direction on the local authority. I want to give them as much discretion as possible. But obviously there are cases when sometimes it is very important that the local authority consults its neighbouring local authority about a larger cross-boundary development. I wonder whether some advice could be given in the guidance, particularly about consulting. That might get over the point. Perhaps the Minister could answer the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, as well. It is not a point we want to be difficult about; it is something we are trying to clarify to make certain that some large cross-border developments do not get held up because of the new system. We also do not want to confuse developers in the early days of a new system.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am very grateful to the noble Lord for his further elucidation, because he is hitting real problems here. From my time in local development I can certainly think of cross-boundary planning applications where it seemed to take for ever to get the local authorities in a straight line, as it were, before you could get some consented agreement for an application to move forward. The noble Lord is absolutely right&#151;these things can lead to horrendous delays and there is a lot of opportunity on these grounds for people to hold up desirable developments with a strong public interest behind them. The whole purpose of the legislation is to enable things to be speeded up, and for there to be a framework which is understood so that in any area where, in particular, an application crosses boundaries, there is pressure to agree a consensual position to enable sensible planning applications to be brought forward and pushed through, particularly where there is strong public interest behind it.
<P>

<a name="40202-04_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked a question that I would like to reflect on. I think it is slightly more complex than he realises and I cannot deal with it adequately from the Dispatch Box this afternoon. The noble Lord has made a useful intervention and I will provide him with a response and share it with all noble Lords with an interest in the Bill.

<a name="40202-04_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 115, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 117. Both amendments are in the name of the leading proponent, the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, who is unable to be here today.
<P>


<a name="column_451"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 451</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-04_para11"></a>Amendment No. 115 is about access statements. The purpose of both amendments can be expressed probably more briefly than the amendments themselves. The first of the two would require developers to submit an access statement with a planning application to demonstrate how the scheme would be accessible and inclusive.
<P>

<a name="40202-04_para12"></a>We have already touched on the difficulty arising from the fact that questions of access are currently addressed much too late in the development control process. Under Section 76 of the 1990 Act, development attention is drawn to this on its being granted planning permission, and later at the stage of building regulations approval. If good access is not part of the design from the start, it will obviously be difficult to make significant alterations to an existing design or, indeed, to an existing structure. Retrospective changes are not likely to achieve the same level of accessibility, and bolting-on solutions can be a good deal more costly.
<P>

<a name="40202-04_para13"></a>The new duties of service providers to make changes to facilitate access will come into force in October this year. The good practice guidance from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister encourages planning authorities to urge applicants to submit access statements with their applications. The ODPM argues that access statements are key to developers taking seriously the issue of inclusive design at the earliest stage. It suggests that if such a statement is not submitted, a local authority could reject the registration of an application.
<P>

<a name="40202-04_para14"></a>The Government's own Disability Rights Task Force has recommended that Section 76 of the 1990 Act be revised when a suitable legislative opportunity arises. If this is not the opportunity, I am not sure what is.
<P>

<a name="40202-04_para15"></a>In Committee in the Commons, the Minister, Yvette Cooper, indicated that the Government would consult on whether the access statement should be a required document to accompany planning applications. She suggested that the Government could use order-making powers in this connection. I understand that later&#151;not in the House&#151;the Minister with responsibility for planning said that access statements might be required only "in appropriate circumstances". I believe that that is the phrase that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has used.
<P>

<a name="40202-04_para16"></a>Therefore, while I should obviously be delighted if the amendment were accepted, although we shall have other opportunities to take a bite at the cherry, let us at least, if we can, find out this afternoon exactly what the Government propose, how firm their commitment is, what the timetable is and, if there are to be exemptions, what type of applications would be exempted.
<P>

<a name="40202-04_para17"></a>The second amendment&#151;Amendment No. 117&#151;would place a new duty on planning authorities, when considering planning applications, to have due regard to the need to ensure that reasonable provisions are made so that buildings and the approaches to them are accessible to, and usable by, people, regardless of <P>


<a name="column_452"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 452</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disability, age or gender. In its good practice guidance last year, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister conceded that. It said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Whilst there may be many examples of new public and commercial spaces and buildings that have reached the highest standards of inclusiveness, this has often been achieved by one of the parties . . . taking a leading role, with others having to follow. However, there are still many inaccessible environments throughout the UK. In many cases this is because schemes have been granted planning consent without any party in the process properly assessing whether the scheme would result in an accessible environment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-04_para18"></a><P>

<a name="40202-04_para19"></a>The example to which I want to refer is one that is very close to home in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#151;that is, City Hall on the south bank of the Thames. It is near Tower Bridge but not very near a public place where those with any kind of mobility difficulty can be dropped off by cab or by car unless they are among the happy four, I believe, who have taken their place in the queue to obtain a parking space underneath the building. That is the number of disabled user spaces available.
<P>

<a name="40202-04_para20"></a>On the day that Her Majesty the Queen opened City Hall, I took as a guest a lady who admitted to being 86 years old, although I am not sure how old she is. She had considerable difficulty. Until then, I had not realised just what a long way the building was from the highway. Once one is inside City Hall, one tramps a long way up gradients even to reach the lifts. I consider it a disgrace that London's newest government building has been designed with those inherent difficulties. I believe that the Mayor is considering extreme action and I hope that he finds a way to deal with the problem. However, it is difficult to see how it can be rectified after the event.
<P>

<a name="40202-04_para21"></a>Having said all that, I shall return to my script. The amendment would enable the Government to meet their manifesto commitment to revise Section 76, to which I have already referred. On 22 January, when debating another amendment concerning disability, the Minister said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Believe you me, there is no attempt whatever to marginalise the issue, make it an add-on or regard it as an afterthought. The whole thrust of the way we intend to approach this issue is that nothing gets built unless these issues have been considered".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-04_para22"></a>
At that point, we were talking about regional spatial strategy, but I believe that the same thing applies. He went on to say that the Government,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"want to be wholly positive about this matter",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-04_para23"></a>
and would,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"give further reassurances and provide further details on different aspects of the same issue when we come to later clauses of the Bill".&#151;[Official Report, 22/1/04; cols. 1206-07.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-04_para24"></a>
I assume that that is the point that we have reached, and I hope that the Minister can give the reassurance that many people are waiting for. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40202-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   I rise briefly to add to what my noble friend has said. I believe that Amendments Nos. 115 and 117 are in the spirit of what is recommended at present and, specifically in the case of Amendment No. 117, that they would fit nicely into what is being discussed in the draft disability Bill. They would mean that local authorities would have a duty <P>


<a name="column_453"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 453</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to take account of the needs and interests of disabled people and promote their causes and, indeed, their inclusion.
<P>

<a name="40202-05_para0"></a>Amendment No. 117 seems to be exactly in that mode. Would the provision proposed within the amendment form a necessary part of the local authorities' planning procedure? If an engine does not already exist to allow local authorities, when dealing with planning statements, to take account of the needs of disabled people, I recommend that we include Amendment No. 117. Simply, if there is such a duty without the necessary planning structure, we shall have more problems.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I strongly support the spirit of the amendments. I am not sure that I am entirely at home with the wording, but I support the idea that something should be in place right at the beginning of the planning process which sets out what is being done and, through guidance, what the Government have said should be done to provide better access for the disabled and elderly. The sooner we have that kind of thing in force, the better. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, it should be up-front and at the beginning of the process. That seems to me entirely right.
<P>

<a name="40202-05_para1"></a>As for the wording, proposed new subsection (10) in Amendment No. 115 refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"how the works in question will provide reasonable access".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-05_para2"></a>
However, I should much rather see the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"how reasonable access should be provided in the context of the works in question".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-05_para3"></a>
Otherwise, the type of situation will arise where you submit a planning application to change the glazing bars on a third-floor window and you are asked how that affects disabled access. Unless you are thinking of providing a catapult on the ground floor, I rather doubt that there is any way in which that could be done.
<P>

<a name="40202-05_para4"></a>Many planning permissions concerning alterations to existing buildings involve great constraints on what can and should be done. I have just redone a house myself. I think that I would have been in considerable difficulty if I had been asked to make it disabled-friendly due to the structure that was there already. Indeed, it would have necessitated the destruction of the historic character of the building even to get on to the ground floor because it had a very narrow entrance.
<P>

<a name="40202-05_para5"></a>I cannot see how one can provide for that in primary legislation, which has to be absolute. But we need a very sensible and sensitive set of guidelines to make sure that what will apply to a great number of existing buildings is a reasonable set of requirements and that the bias is towards making sure that public buildings or those used by the public receive much more attention than private houses. After all, if one fails to provide access for the disabled it is oneself and one's friends and family who suffer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cobbold: </B>   Following on from that point, there are certain historic buildings which open to the public where these very severe problems arise.

The order can specify the form and manner in which a planning application must be made, what must be included in an application, and the documents and other material that must accompany it. The powers are intended to introduce a standard application form for all planning authorities.
<P>

<a name="40202-05_para7"></a>Before making any prescription, we would seek stakeholders' views on the forms as part of our proposed consultation which is due shortly. But without prejudging the consultation&#151;although in a way I am going to do so in what I say&#151;I wish to make it well understood that we would want to see an access statement, or something which demonstrates how the project will meet certain provisions of legislation and related codes of practice. That will ensure that the needs of the disabled are addressed. That is one of the documents that would accompany the form in appropriate cases. The use of the term "appropriate cases" means no more and no less than when it is right and necessary to consider its application. It would not be right in the kind of case to which the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, referred or where one is fitting a dormer extension. It is not an expression which is being used to exclude things specifically, but simply to recognise the reality of different kinds of planning application.
<P>

<a name="40202-05_para8"></a>It is very important that we see an access statement when it is appropriate. That would mean that access would have to be considered and be shown to be considered, right at the start of the application process. We probably all agree that that is important. Those applying for planning permission would be required to demonstrate how their proposals contribute to an inclusive environment and local planning authorities would have to consider this alongside the other requirements.
<P>

<a name="40202-05_para9"></a>There are also links here to the work that is continuing in relation to outline planning permission to which my noble friend Lord Rooker referred at Second Reading. He was clear at that time that we would be willing to consider the retention of outline planning permission if it provided the opportunity for the provision of more information than is often the case at present. My noble friend made it plain at the time that at the very least this would need to cover among other things the key design principles and address the important issue of access.
<P>

<a name="40202-05_para10"></a>I hope that from what I have said as regards this issue and what I said in earlier debates on the new planning system&#151;I explained that development plans must contain clear and comprehensive, inclusive access policies&#151;those Members of the Committee who have been involved in this debate can see that our <P>


<a name="column_455"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 455</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proposed system seeks to ensure that access is recognised as a legitimate planning consideration from the outset.
<P>

<a name="40202-05_para11"></a>What I have said means that Amendment No. 117 is probably unnecessary, as the new system places access on a level playing field with other planning considerations. Local planning authorities and the Secretary of State will have to pay "due regard" to access issues in considering applications.
<P>

<a name="40202-05_para12"></a>I am not convinced that there needs to be a specific requirement in legislation to cover the issue of access statements. If I understand the amendments properly, the question has to be asked whether the movers and supporters of the amendments really mean to suggest that all planning applications, including household applications, should be accompanied by an access statement. That is somewhat heavy-handed and overly bureaucratic. Personally, I believe that the system is in danger of being just that. We have to try to minimise that as much as we can. Having said that, I would not want to undermine the important part that access statements play. I make it plain to everyone with an interest that this is a matter which is more properly dealt with in guidance and as a proper consideration when a planning application is appropriate and it is brought forward. With what I hope was a very positive response to the amendment which has been moved in good spirit, I trust that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-05_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I am grateful to those who have taken part in the consideration of the issue. As the Minister and other Members of the Committee may well be aware, the amendment comes from the Disability Rights Commission and other organisations which were mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, when she moved an amendment at an earlier date. This is not their point and it is entirely personal: it seems to me that for an access statement not always to be required risks the system not working very well. I would argue that the Government should at least consider whether it is appropriate for there always to be an access statement even if the words "not suitable" or something to that effect appear, to draw attention to the issue right at the start.
<P>

<a name="40202-05_para13"></a>There are a number of other situations. The noble Lord, like myself, will be used to papers going to local authorities which specifically consider a number of issues and which may say that there are no financial implications. At least, attention has been drawn to the issue where it may be necessary not just to tick a box, but actually to consider what is right.
<P>

<a name="40202-05_para14"></a>To pursue the example used by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, one would not want to suggest that there should be a parachute down from a window on the outside, but it might be important to ensure that the window could be opened from the inside by someone who has difficulty in reaching it. I do not believe that one can necessarily write off examples immediately.

I do not know whether he is in a position to do either of those things this afternoon.

<A NAME="40202-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   As regards historic buildings my noble friend may be aware of an example very close to home. I asked the Chairman of Committees recently whether it was possible for disabled people to have access to the Galleries here. He wrote to me saying that it had been ruled out because lifts could not be provided within the Palace of Westminster to our Gallery because of the historic building requirements. Alternative arrangements were made for disabled people to listen to our proceedings by coming to the Bar of the House. That is an example where access had been considered: it had been ruled out elsewhere for the reason which the Chairman of Committees gave. It did not mean that we had not considered the possibility of access, but we were unable to implement it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am not able to comment further on what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said. It is a consideration, where we have a historic building. We have probably all come across a contradiction between our intentions and the limitations of a building that was not designed to be as accessible as we would want it to be now for people with disabilities.
<P>

<a name="40202-06_para0"></a>Consultation on guidance, which was mentioned by the noble Baroness, will take place in the next few months. That can mean a lot and a little, as we are aware. I will try to be more specific and I will press officials for a tighter timetable. The other points made by the noble Baroness were good ones. I am sympathetic to the points that have been made and we will give them further consideration. I cannot promise more than that because to do so would be wrong. However, they are important points.

<a name="40202-06_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: I speak on this subject as a member of the Campaign to Protect Rural England living in East Suffolk. This is not an easy matter and I found the CPRE document circulated to some of us helpful&#151; one might even say illuminating.
<P>

<a name="40202-06_para6"></a>We have become accustomed to bright lights, and more of them, and our opinion of the need for external lighting will vary according to circumstances. Clearly, when driving on a busy motorway at night, at this time of year, good lighting improves safety. But when I look out of my window on a clear summer night and see the western horizon 20 miles away, brilliantly lit from the operations at Felixstowe docks, which operate round the clock, I ask myself: do they need to be so brilliant?
<P>

<a name="40202-06_para7"></a>No doubt those interested in astronomy would have stronger views. I dwell for a moment on astronomy. Some 20 or 30 years ago it was found that the observations made at the Greenwich Observatory were becoming increasingly difficult because of the ever more powerful street and other lights in London. A long-term decision was made to transfer the observatory to Hurstmonceaux in Sussex, at considerable expense. This was done over a period of years. The result was generally well received until it was discovered that the lighting from Brighton made observation as difficult as it had become in London. So, another decision was made to join other European countries in siting their outer-hemisphere observations from an island in the distant Atlantic, on the Azores, I believe, where conditions are better.
<P>

<a name="40202-06_para8"></a>This must seem a strange introduction to this subject, but I suggest that astronomy is likely to become an even more important subject than it is today. In the next century we may become increasingly preoccupied by the danger of collision with large objects in outer space, which has been the subject of some recent debates in this House. The growing intensity of illumination on our planet may have a direct bearing on the safety of our successors.
<P>

<a name="40202-06_para9"></a>I suggest that some degree of prudent control over external lighting might be advisable for this and for another reason&#151;the desirability of avoiding the wasteful use of electricity. Recent debates have shown the anxiety felt by many at the profligate use of power and its environmental effects. This is germane to the Energy Bill now proceeding through your Lordships' House. We seem to be moving from a period marked by the abundance of cheap electric energy to a different world in which we would be more cautious about our reliance on electric power.
<P>

<a name="40202-06_para10"></a>It is difficult to say what form such restraint might take. I believe that a parliamentary committee in another place had proposed making obtrusive light a statutory nuisance. But that would be difficult to enforce. So, my amendment would approach the topic in a more moderate way, by empowering the Secretary of State to make regulations under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. This follows the precedent that the Secretary of State already has the power to control advertisements with a similar set of words. I suggest this might be an appropriate first step. It is permissive, not mandatory, and it gives the <P>

<P>
<A NAME="40202-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   I add our support to the amendment, if only to control some of the increasingly bizarre Christmas lights we see every year, particularly last year.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I, too, support the amendment. It concerns not only the professional astronomers mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, who are able to afford the movement of expensive telescopes to an area of the world where they are not overwhelmed by the street lighting, but also the flourishing amateur astronomical community we have in this country. Their interests should be considered, particularly when the effectiveness of the lighting is not impaired if the direction is altered so that it does not shine into the sky. There are plenty of technical methods of ensuring the lighting is directed downwards without casting the same amount of light into outer space, for example directing the lighting on motorways downwards so that it illuminates the carriageway. It would be useful if the Secretary of State had these powers and I hope the Minister agrees.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-06_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I am disappointed by what my noble friend said about Christmas lights. I had the great pleasure of spending Christmas in Melbourne in Australia. The street I stayed in was blocked with cars from 6 p.m. until midnight because everyone came to see the Christmas lights. It was a wonderful festivity of individual enterprise producing something that was worth seeing. The more we have of that in our duller suburban streets, the better. However, I think street lighting is one of the main sources of light pollution. There are technical solutions that ensure there is little light escaping sideways and upwards. However, does planning permission bite on these things? Is there a requirement for local authorities to go through the planning process in order to decide what kind of street light is put in?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-06_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   The Minister may use the Blackpool illuminations defence in response to the amendment, according to what the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said.
<P>

<a name="40202-06_para11"></a>I was interested in the response to the amendment moved by my honourable friend the Member for Ludlow in Committee in another place.
<P>

<a name="40202-06_para12"></a>The Minister told the Committee that the UDP for the London Borough of Sutton has a policy that developments and proposals involving the use of external lighting and floodlighting will be permitted only where there is no unduly adverse impact from increased levels of light pollution on the environment or on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. I do not know whether that was introduced when my noble friend Lord Tope was leader, but it is an innovative authority. That to me does not suggest that the matter <P>


<a name="column_459"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 459</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>can be dealt with outside the regulations proposed, but that the Government might have a role in disseminating that sort of approach.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-06_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   I support the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, in his amendment. Light pollution is a relatively recently recognised subject. Some years ago, when I first raised the matter in the House, the Minister responded by stating that heavy pollution had to be dealt with first and seemed quite unaware of the issue. Frankly, I do not remember under which government that was. At any rate, the concept of polluting by light had not at that time sunk through to Whitehall.
<P>

<a name="40202-06_para13"></a>What the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, asks for is extremely modest and, in a Bill of this kind, it would be desirable to take the opportunity to deal with light pollution. The amendment would merely give authority to the Minister to make appropriate regulations as and when necessary. Of course, one could remove all forms of intensive lighting from the night sky. The noble Lord, Lord Bridges, referred to Felixstowe. The fact is that Felixstowe works 24 hours per day and probably needs a good deal of light. However, I would not regard Christmas tree decorations, which have also been referred to, as a top priority for restriction.
<P>

<a name="40202-06_para14"></a>Certain basic facts need to be considered. In order to light up the ground, we do not need to light up the sky. Technically, that is not necessary and has become increasingly less so. Certainly, it is true that in England, as opposed to Scotland and Wales where the situation is perhaps better, it is difficult to think of areas where the black night sky, "the starry, starry night", can be seen.
<P>

<a name="40202-06_para15"></a>When I was chairman of the CPRE we commissioned a study of the United Kingdom from a satellite, on the same day of the year and at the same time, 10 years on. The difference was huge. More recently, a similar study was conducted and a further deterioration was seen. My noble friend mentioned the Christmas lights in Melbourne. The only time in recent years that I have seen the deep night sky was on a visit to the outback of New South Wales. That was a wonderful experience, and one from childhood which I had almost forgotten. We cannot get back to that. We cannot remove necessary lighting for road safety, pleasure, football matches, and so forth.
<P>

<a name="40202-06_para16"></a>However, what we can do, and what I would ask the Government seriously to consider, is to introduce in the Bill, which is a good vehicle for this issue, a power for the Minister to make regulations. I am the last person to want over-regulation. The details of the wording and how such regulations are to be used would be a matter for sensible discretion. However, the Bill provides this opportunity. Even if the Minister does not like the particular wording of the noble Lord's amendment, I hope he will say that the <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Chorley: </B>   I wish I could follow the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, in his visit to the outback. The only time I went to the outback was to Ayre's Rock, which is in the middle of Australia, where all the hotels are hugely illuminated. So, that was something of a failure, but I appreciate the comments of the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="40202-07_para0"></a>All noble Lords who have spoken have said that light is now becoming a pollutant. Another pollutant, which we are not discussing, is noise. It would be difficult to see how we could discuss that under the Bill. To me, this is mainly a countryside issue. I do not mind really: in many senses, the more light we have in cities the better, provided that this type of regulation does not, as it were, escape the cities. I note the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, in that regard. Therefore, I support my noble friend's amendment.
<P>

<a name="40202-07_para1"></a>Not being a professional in these matters, I do not know whether this would be best done by primary legislation. If that is impractical, one wonders whether, alternatively, it could be done by way of guidance. The Minister may say that this issue is included in guidance, in which case I should be delighted. As noble Lords have said, the amendment is quite modest. It merely gives the Secretary of State a power, and that seems to me to be appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Tanlaw: </B>   I rise to support my noble friend's amendment on behalf of astronomers and, indeed, schools throughout the country. There is a real need in every town for a dark area, or access to a dark area, where telescopes can be used. Astronomy is one of the fastest growing subjects in schools. It is relevant to the future and yet, because of light pollution, teachers have little opportunity to introduce students to the reality of looking through a telescope.
<P>

<a name="40202-07_para2"></a>It is unnecessary for town councils to ignore this issue. Any legislation which draws attention to it and allows for dark spaces for astronomers with access to the town will be beneficial, not just for pleasure but educationally.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cobbold: </B>   I, too, support the amendment. I feel strongly about the ability to see the stars. It is probable that a generation of children have grown up in an urban environment in this country not knowing that there are stars above. An important point which has been made is that a very large proportion of so-called "light pollution" is caused by local authorities in the form of street lighting. That needs to be taken into consideration in this debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   I rise to offer the tiniest footnote, happily in positive antithesis to what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, about Hurstmonceux. In the late 18th century, two centuries before the events which have been earlier described, Archbishop Robinson of Armagh was anxious to <P>


<a name="column_461"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 461</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>transform Armagh, which is the head of the Catholic Church in Ireland as well as the head of the Anglican Church, into a university. There are no Lords Spiritual on their Benches today, but the Holy Spirit did work in the context of his ambitions.
<P>

<a name="40202-07_para3"></a>In the run-up to any plans he might have implemented, the Royal Society reported that the best observations of Halley's comet in 1785 had been provided by a curate in County Tyrone. Arguably, that curate may have been the furthest observer of Halley's comet from London of anyone in these islands and clearly benefited from the darkness of the sky. The consequence of his contribution as admired by the Royal Society was that it was determined that an observatory would be built in Armagh. That is now the second oldest observatory in the United Kingdom. The Lords Spiritual will be pleased that the Archbishop of Armagh has consistently been the chairman of the trustees. That seems to me to be a very short, moral tale in support of the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Bridges.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-07_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister   (Lord Rooker): </B>  I say at the outset that we have great sympathy with the intentions of the amendment. I agree with virtually every speech that has been made in the past 15 minutes. There is no question that this is a serious issue and it is right that it should be raised. The Bill provides an ideal opportunity for a brief discussion on the matter.
<P>

<a name="40202-07_para4"></a>I shall not say that this issue has never been considered, but one of our difficulties has been in assessing the amount of light concerned. It is not the easiest thing in the world to assess external light for statutory planning control purposes. It is not as though Parliament has not addressed the issue recently. The Select Committee on Science and Technology in another place considered this issue and produced a report in October last year. That committee did not recommend the introduction of new planning legislation. It specifically addressed light pollution and astronomy.
<P>

<a name="40202-07_para5"></a>I, too, was incredibly impressed by the CPRE document which was produced last summer, with the satellite maps referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford. I do not have a briefing on Christmas lights, and I am not sure of the context in which that was raised. The two references to Christmas lights could have been interpreted entirely differently: first, in the context of people going to see the wonders of Regent Street; and, secondly, in the context of people decorating their houses with such lights. Honestly, I would say, "The nanny state's gone too far".
<P>

<a name="40202-07_para6"></a>Last December I saw some houses in the Essex and Suffolk countryside, in the middle of nowhere, which were wonderful sights. What the electricity bills were and how long it took to put up the lights and take them down I do not know. I would hate to think that we were introducing legislation against such a transient way of making an individual statement. Those are the two ways in which reference was made to Christmas lights.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-07_para7"></a>Any legislation that we brought in&#151;this is not an excuse for saying no&#151;would have to be enforceable in a practical way. If matters are to end up in the courts we will have to be precise. I have something positive to say: I believe that we should do something about the difficulties that we see currently in the planning system. The point about astronomy is incredibly well made. The planning system has long recognised that certain types of development should be allowed to take place without requiring individual planning permissions. The placing of lamp standards is one of those. It is not as though they do not have planning permission, but highway authorities have permitted development rights, which means that they have planning consent to put up or to replace street lighting. It is not as though there is no rule. They have the development rights. Those are usually of a minor technical nature. One reason is to reduce the burden on the planning system. There is a practical point there.
<P>

<a name="40202-07_para8"></a>We believe that bad lighting practice, of which there is plenty, is best dealt with by raising public awareness, by providing help and guidance, and by more effective use of existing powers, such as development plan policies on and the use of planning conditions to mitigate the effects of external lighting.
<P>

<a name="40202-07_para9"></a>It is not as though nothing happens now. We already have a document, Lighting in the Countryside, part 3 of which is entitled "Towards Good Practice". If I recall correctly, some time late last year I was asked about this matter at Question Time so I had occasion to look at the document. It provides practical advice to local authorities, to developers and to members of the public on what can be done to lessen the adverse effects of external lighting. It is freely available on the ODPM website. It makes the exact point that in order to light the ground to make roads safer one does not have to light the sky. Loads of examples are given.
<P>

<a name="40202-07_para10"></a>However, we intend to introduce an annex to planning policy statement 23 which is entitled Planning and Pollution Control, an annex specifically on light pollution. We are going to beef it up, throw some light on the issue&#151;I should not have said that&#151;and raise its profile. The annex will have the same status as the parent planning policy statement and would be a material consideration in the preparation of regional spatial strategies and local development documents and in the consideration of planning applications.
<P>

<a name="40202-07_para11"></a>Something practical is coming down the line that we believe will be added to existing procedures. Given the practical difficulties relating to enforcement and the potential burden on the planning system, we believe that this is the best way to deal with the issue. In another place the Select Committee considered the matter and took advice. It did not recommend the introduction of planning legislation&#151;that is not to say there is no reason to do so&#151;but there is a practical way to deal with the problem. We have identified the problem and we genuinely believe that there is a problem to be dealt with, but it is best dealt with by introducing the annex on light pollution. It would have the same status as the parent planning policy statement, so it could be used in arguments about <P>

"( ) The Secretary of State may issue guidance as to the meaning of the word "similar" in subsection (2)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40202-08_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: First, I declare an interest. I am associated with a consultancy called Green Issues, which, among other activities, advises development companies on their relationships with the communities in which they have developments. I have taken advantage of that connection to hold several discussions with their clients on this part of the Bill. Amendment No. 118 is entirely self-explanatory. I do not understand what "similar" is supposed to mean or where one is supposed to go for a meaning for the word. I hope for enlightenment from the Benches opposite. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Amendment No. 118 concerns repeat applications. Clause 43, which is a fairly long clause for reasons that are obvious, is intended to inhibit the use of repeated applications to wear down the opposition to undesirable developments. The amendment would allow the Secretary of State to issue guidance on what is meant by an application "similar" to one that had been refused.
<P>

<a name="40202-08_para2"></a>Section 70A(8) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 defines applications as "similar" if the local planning authority thinks that the development is the same or substantially the same. The decision to decline to determine the application will be made by the local planning authority. That decision involves the local planning authority taking a view as to whether the application is similar to a previous application. Subsection (8) clarifies "similar" so far as it is practicable to do so: the development and the land must be the same or substantially the same. With the greatest respect, we cannot imagine what guidance could usefully add to that without being over-prescriptive. As it is already on the statute book, it can be tested in the courts if it is thought to be unreasonable. So it is not a matter of us inventing the <P>


<a name="column_464"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 464</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wheel and having to redefine "similar" for the purposes of repeated applications. I hope that that is a satisfactory explanation to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   I can see the force of the subsection. Presumably that would not apply if planning policy is changed between the submission of one application and another; for example, presumably a new PPS, as we now call them, which cast a different light on the matter, would not give powers to the local authority to refuse to consider an application that would have been inconsistent under the old policy, but which was perhaps similar, but was consistent under the new one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   As a lay person, I think that, if that were the case, that would be an abuse of the power of a local authority. I have experience of, as no doubt have Members of the other place, locations of developments where planning applications are refused but within a couple of months a similar application is submitted specifically designed to wear down the opposition. I had one case in my former constituency where there were at least half a dozen applications, each with slight variations, relating to one site, and yet the matter had been to appeal and had been refused. The applications were designed to wear down the local authority. Clearly, if in the mean time the planning policy changes, the case would have to be considered on its merits.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I am grateful for that explanation. I am concerned that the definition of "similar" to be applied here is quite narrow. I think we all agree that this clause is worth including in the Bill, but is it strong enough? If a development purely of houses is proposed and refused and the application comes back for a development of two-thirds houses and one-third light industrial, is that similar? It does not sound similar in the context in which the noble Lord expresses the matter, using the words from the principal Act. I would like some comfort on that, otherwise we are looking at something that is quite narrow in its effect. A change from 120 houses to 110 houses may be similar, but will the fact that you are developing the same area but proposing something that is substantially different&#151;although the effect on the neighbourhood may be the same&#151;be caught by this clause?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Again, speaking purely as a lay person, if an application is put in that is purely for housing, it fails and later comes back as a mixed development for housing and light industrial development, no one can claim that it is "similar". For a start, it would be a mixed development; it would not be dwellings. You might go in, for example, for 120 dwellings of three storeys, and come back with 110 dwellings on another application, most of which are three storeys but some of which are two. You might argue that those look pretty similar. If it is a mixed development, it is not the same as 100 per cent dwellings.

<P>

<a name="40202-08_para3"></a>From experience, the planning committees and the local authorities would probably have some case law on this anyway, as it has been in the legislation since 1990. It is just that they are now getting the power to knock out and not consider these similar developments. If developers want to appeal against it&#151;if they think that the authority has abused its power&#151;they have every right to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-08_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Yes, so developers just have to be rather more inventive in their abuse of the system than they have been to date, which I suspect they will be. I am grateful for the explanation. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40202-08_para4"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-08_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Lucas </B>   moved Amendment No. 119:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 28, line 30, leave out "A" and insert "Subject to the Secretary of State having expressed himself satisfied with the performance of a local planning authority's development control function, that"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-08_para5"></a><P>

<a name="40202-08_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 119 concerns overlapping applications, which is a technique that many developers have found useful. It means that you can put in two essentially identical applications at the same time. One of them you dip into the appeal process, because you jolly well know that the local authority never decides anything in eight weeks, so you keep going with it on that sort of timescale. The other one remains on the table with the local authority, so that you can carry on with negotiations at its own pace. That way, you get the benefit of the timescales, which are laid down for appeal and for getting the thing done properly, but you keep discussions open with the local authority.
<P>

<a name="40202-08_para7"></a>Clearly, where a local authority is performing well, and if it does not want an overlapping application in a particular case, that should be allowed. Where overlapping applications are applied to an authority that is habitually misbehaving and habitually taking far longer than it should do, to prevent it from doing so one can close a door on allowing people seeking planning permission to obtain it in a reasonable timescale. That is not the right way to go. I therefore suggest in this amendment that the ability of an authority to dismiss a second application as an overlapping one is restricted to those occasions where the local authority is regarded as a well performing authority, rather than one that has troubles. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-08_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I hope that the Minister will not be too tempted to accept this amendment. Apart from all the problems that we on these Benches have with the CPA process, the amendment seems to assume that quality in development control matters is pretty much limited to the time within which they are dealt. That may not be in the noble Lord's mind, but it is certainly how I read the amendment. I put it to him that not only is this not the right way to judge whether a local planning authority is "behaving itself", but to have such a provision would create a vicious circle. If there are more applications going in, the system gets more clogged up, rather than the problem being solved.

<A NAME="40202-08_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for moving the amendment and explaining his desire to deal with twin-tracked applications. Clause 43 will prevent twin tracking. The amendment would enable a local planning authority to decline to determine a twin-tracked application only if the Secretary of State had expressed himself satisfied with the authority's development control performance. The Government recognise that the performance of local authorities varies. Some authorities are good at determining applications; some are less good. We also recognise that authorities need to improve before we allow them to decline to determine twin-tracked applications. This measure will therefore be implemented only once the delays in the planning system have been substantively overcome.
<P>

<a name="40202-08_para8"></a>Amendment No. 119 would require the Secretary of State, rather than to express satisfaction with local planning authorities generally, to consider each local authority's planning performance. The result would be that some local planning authorities would be able to refuse to determine twin-tracked applications, while others would not. This would lead to a degree of uncertainty for applicants. It would also lead to something of a bureaucratic nightmare for the Secretary of State in formally assessing each and every planning authority's performance level. Such an assessment would provide no guarantee that the performance would remain at the same level, although the power to decline to determine applications would remain.
<P>

<a name="40202-08_para9"></a>Though well intentioned, the amendment offers the prospect of more bureaucracy&#151;which the noble Lord does not like&#151;and greater uncertainty. I can see the problem, but this is not the remedy. The noble Lord would be well advised to withdraw the amendment.

However, I agree that there is no requirement of consistency from government. I cannot say that we achieved it, and I do not expect it of this Government. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40202-09_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 199ZB also has the support of the Conservative Front Bench. Clause 44 deals with major infrastructure projects. It,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"aims to ensure that major infrastructure projects are subject to an Economic Impact Report (EIR) and to exclude site-specific proposals in national policy statements to prevent them from reducing the scope of a public inquiry".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-09_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40202-09_para7"></a>Those words are from the CPRE, which prompted us to table this amendment. The moment that I read them, I thought of Lord Hanningfield and Stansted&#151;and perhaps also of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and Heathrow.
<P>

<a name="40202-09_para8"></a>If White Papers are site-specific, they are not doing the job that we would see them doing of setting a framework to guide policy on specific developments. In another place, the Minister said that,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-09_para9"></a><P>

<a name="40202-09_para10"></a>The discussion there centred around roads and transport infrastructure, but particularly trunk roads, with reference to work done by the Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment. I accept that there is different legislation for transport, but the fact that SACTRA recommended that economic impact reports be produced before decisions on new transport infrastructure were taken forward can be read across to the provisions of the Bill as a matter of principle. In the debate, the Minister in the other place seemed to say that it was not a matter for primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="40202-09_para11"></a>The Minister has already dealt with an amendment suggesting that Clause 38&#151;the sustainable development provision&#151;need not specifically be applied to development control matters because, indirectly, it applies through the development plan process. However, having such an economic statement would ensure that the whole issue was considered before an inspector got near the application.
<P>

<a name="40202-09_para12"></a>It is important that there are safeguards in the planning system&#151;not least the proposed duty for plans to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development&#151;and that they are not bypassed. Major infrastructure projects are often likely to have a particularly damaging environmental impact. I would be interested to hear the Minister say whether, if and when there are regional assemblies undertaking the provisions, those assemblies will have a role in dealing with the projects. That is perhaps not central to the point that I am making. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   I support the amendment. It is extremely important to the Government's proposals for major infrastructure projects. I am particularly engaged with such issues at the moment, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said. I am leader of Essex County Council, which is hugely affected by the Government's proposals for the expansion of airport capacity in the south-east.
<P>

<a name="40202-09_para13"></a>I recognise that there are good reasons for the Government to seek changes to the current system. Major infrastructural projects, by definition, concern <P>


<a name="column_468"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 468</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>planning issues that will have a major impact on our communities and will be extremely visible. To some extent, the Bill is testament to the fact that, in large part, confidence in the planning system rests on the ability to handle such planning matters sensibly and efficiently.
<P>

<a name="40202-09_para14"></a>The amendment is an attempt to enhance the provisions of this part of the Bill, not to undermine them. The first part of Amendment No. 119ZB would require the Secretary of State to conduct an economic impact assessment of any planning matter, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, that he deems to fall within this part of the Bill. There are two reasons why it is important to deal with the issue in that way. First, it is simply right that, on matters of major development that will, as the noble Baroness said, have a huge environmental impact, a robust economic appraisal of the proposals should be carried out. Responsibility for doing that should rest with the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40202-09_para15"></a>Secondly, it is important that arguments about the economic impact should be in the public domain at an early stage. In another place, it was suggested that a statutory economic impact report would be unnecessary because an inspector would look into the economic effects of development as part of his examination. That is in no way acceptable. Local people affected by major planning proposals will not want to wait until an inquiry is held to make their voice heard. They will want to confront the issues head-on, as is happening with Stansted at the moment. By the time that an inquiry comes around, positions will have hardened, and there will be little chance of persuading people of the merits of a particular development. That might be okay, if we were not too concerned about taking a local community with us, but that would be wrong. We should make every effort to ensure that local people fully understand the rationale behind such planning proposals. Those in favour of development will welcome the chance to get robust economic arguments into the public domain as early as possible. I would have thought that the Government would seek to reshape local debate in that way.
<P>

<a name="40202-09_para16"></a>The second part of the amendment is equally important. It would enable an inspector to examine the justification for a site-specific proposal in a government White Paper. Planning by White Paper is simply unacceptable. Of course, it is appropriate to use a White Paper to set out a broad national policy, but bypassing the checks and balances in the planning system by making site-specific recommendations is another matter. To some extent, the amendment would mitigate the worst effects by enabling an inspector to investigate the proposals as part of the inquiry process.
<P>

<a name="40202-09_para17"></a>It is an important amendment to an important part of the Bill. It concerns a lot of people in the south-east, with regard not only to Stansted but to Heathrow and, ultimately, Gatwick. People should feel that there will be fair hearings about such proposals.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   This is an important part of the Bill. The proposal has not turned up in the Bill in the way originally envisaged in the White Paper. We made some policy changes on the issue in 2002, and I shall come to them in a moment.
<P>

<a name="40202-09_para18"></a>The first subsection in the amendment would require an economic impact report to be made on an application that had been designated as a major infrastructure project. The second part would require that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Any planning application for a major infrastructure project based on a site specific proposal in a national policy statement White Paper shall be considered by an inspector who shall be able to question the need for the specific development".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-09_para19"></a>
I shall not go into any current issues&#151;it would be inappropriate for me to do so&#151;but such requirements are not necessary in the Bill. During the inquiry, the inspector will consider all aspects of the application, including the need for the specific development, economic, environmental and any other impacts. I must make that clear: during the inquiry, the inspector will consider all aspects of the application, including the need for the specific development, economic, environmental and other impacts.
<P>

<a name="40202-09_para20"></a>I am not fully up to date with debates in the other place, but the original proposals for major infrastructure projects, which were issued in March 2002, before ODPM was born, suggested that Parliament itself would consider the principles of such applications and that any subsequent inquiry would consider only the detail of the case. That was the original proposal in the White Paper. Parliament would therefore need to be aware of the economic impact of the application to be able to consider the case properly, and we envisaged that a statement of the economic impact would be laid before Parliament for that purpose. I do not devalue the importance of the issue, but after five minutes' discussion, my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister and I took the view that it was not proper for Parliament to be involved in executive action anyway and that, secondly, the parliamentary processes were wholly inappropriate for the kind of proposal envisaged. We had to find a better way of doing it, so we made the proposal that is now in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40202-09_para21"></a>An inspector will consider the principle and the detail of the case through an inquiry. I make it clear: the inspector will consider the detail and the principle of the case for major infrastructure projects. We set out a three-part approach to handling planning applications for such major projects. It is important to have clearer government policy statements, which may be supported by clearer regional policies. In case anybody asks me, I make the caveat that regional assemblies will have no role in major infrastructure projects. The inspector works on behalf of the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40202-09_para22"></a>The second new aspect is that new inquiry rules will allow an inspector to make better use of inquiry time, while ensuring that everyone can adequately express their views. The matter is fundamental&#151;we are not seeking to snuff out the right for any voice to be heard.
<P>


<a name="column_470"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 470</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-09_para23"></a>Thirdly, there are new procedures in the Bill that will allow a team of inspectors to operate. A national policy statement White Paper will help reduce the argument at a planning inquiry about the need for a specific development on a particular site. The inspector should not have to spend inquiry time considering whether the need for a development exists, but should consider instead whether the need identified is outweighed by other factors. That would go to the principle of the application in any event.
<P>

<a name="40202-09_para24"></a>An inspector must ensure that all relevant impacts of the specific development are considered by the inquiry. Therefore, all material considerations will be considered in his report with all relevant impacts of the project, such as those that are economic or environmental.
<P>

<a name="40202-09_para25"></a>In other words, the requirements&#151;those two limbs&#151;in Amendments No. 119ZB are not necessary. They are fully covered in the current drafting of the Bill. There is no intention to say that the principle of the infrastructure project cannot be discussed at an inquiry, just because there has been a White Paper. That is not on. The principle and the detail can be discussed and considered. We just think that it would be easier if the Government did not have the "spineless" approach of the past of not wanting to make a proper statement; when no one knew what was happening and too much time was spent discussing the principle of an application, because there was no policy statement. Therefore, it is important that the inspector can look at all aspects of an application. We have made changes to speed matters up, so that we do not have the type of issue that caused the length of the Terminal 5 inquiry. But there is no attempt to snuff out people being heard. Our proposals are for making better use of inquiry time for discussing the merits of the case. The inspector has to weigh up the considerations on whether the need for, say, a major infrastructure project, is outweighed by other factors&#151;in other words, whether the inquiry can go to the principle of the issue.

Many people feel that if maximum use has been made of all existing runways, another runway is not needed anywhere. Could that come up at the inquiry into an extra runway at Stansted, which we expect towards the end of next year? He seemed to imply that while in principle the Government may want another runway at Stansted, many people feel that we have made maximum use of existing runways and we do not need a runway at all. Can that issue of principle be challenged and talked about at an inquiry?

<FONT SIZE=3>new inquiry rules will make better use of inspectors' time, while ensuring that everyone can express their views, and will set up new procedures that will allow a team of inspectors to operate. The principle of the application can be questioned at the inquiry in the terms that I have described.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I have listened to the Minister's reply. Bearing in mind that all such matters blew up because of the Terminal 5 inquiry, I am not at all clear what will cut inquiry times for future major infrastructure proposals. He said that the inspector will be able to "curtail" or "restrict". What is to be restricted and who will be curtailed in those inquiries? It can and must not be those people who have objections. Presumably they will be able to harness their views, to have counsel and so forth. What is it that happened in the Terminal 5 inquiry that will not happen now?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   There is probably more than one answer to that, but the specific answer is that a team of inspectors will listen to aspects of the inquiry concurrently. That will definitely make a difference. That does not snuff out the right of anyone to be heard, but it means that a team of inspectors who work for the main inspector can operate concurrently and are not required to operate consecutively. That is the single proposal that would have curtailed the time that the Terminal 5 inquiry took.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-10_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I can see that, but I also have some difficulty in understanding how it will work in practice, given that those who are objecting may wish to hear other people's objections and how the points are argued. It will be difficult to say: "That lot go into room A and the other lot into room B", and so on.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para0"></a>I may have misheard the Minister regarding whether it would be possible to question the need for a development, because I thought that I heard him say that that could not be done. That did not seem to work correctly with his welcome comment that both principle and detail can be considered. I may have to read it in Hansard. I entirely accept that the Government have moved a long way from their original proposals. That is welcome, although it crossed my mind that the issue was the sort of proposal that might be put into a Green Paper to divert people from everything else that was there, given that there was a row about it. I made that comment because I wished to know whether my question would be further addressed&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I believe that if tomorrow the noble Baroness reads my comments in Hansard, she will see that I have not spoken with a forked tongue. I know that she is not accusing me of that, but I have been clear that the principle as well as the detail can be covered by the inspector. I plead guilty to taking on policy responsibility for the issue and I have used my experience in the other place to suggest that the amendment is probably not a practical solution.

"(c) to submit his report under subsection (7) by a specified date."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40202-10_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is straightforward and I hope that the Government will support it. Put simply, the amendment will require an inspector who is directed by the Secretary of State to examine a planning application on a major infrastructure development project to submit his report by a specified date.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para4"></a>To a large extent the Bill has been constructed on the altar of speed. So much of what is important in the planning system has been sacrificed in the name of speeding up the process. Furthermore, it sometimes appears that speeding up happens only in one direction. Local authorities are subject to schemes and timetables while the Secretary of State appears to be relatively unfettered by such considerations.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para5"></a>We are not arguing for an unnecessary and onerous addition to the Bill&#151;simply that the Secretary of State should specify a date for the report from an inquiry to be submitted to him. We have left the Government maximum flexibility in how that specification might be made. Our intention is to help the Government with their avowed aim to speed up the planning process. I hope that noble Lords will support us. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   I support the amendment because it is important. I remember that when I was on the Countryside Commission for 12 years, one of our most important powers was the ability to have proposals "called in" when it was appropriate for them to be considered at a more national level. In a sense, this is analogous; it is looking at something which has a big environmental impact before specific proposals are put forward in order to be able to consider the environmental impact separately. That is a crucial consideration, particularly in the light of the Government's overall policy as reflected in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-10_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Notwithstanding what the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, has said, things have changed in the past few years. The amendment is unnecessary as there is already a provision within the Town and Country Planning (Major Infrastructure Project Inquiries Procedure) (England) (Rules) 2002 to allow the Secretary of State to set a date by which the inspector must make his report to him. That provision is carried through to the revised draft major infrastructure project inquiries procedure rules which we published for consultation on 18 October last year. That consultation has just ended, and officials are analysing the responses. Early indications are that the revised rules are welcome. Quite separately, we have also set our own departmental targets for ministerial responses to these inquiries.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para6"></a>In other words, the amendment is unnecessary as there are procedures to ensure that this happens, and we have just conducted a consultation. So I hope that we can meet the spirit and the practicality behind the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para7"></a>Regarding all the pressures on local authorities, the note says "not true". Clause 53, which we have not yet reached, introduces timetables on the Secretary of State to make decisions. We have made it clear that all players in the planning system have a role to play, including the Secretary of State.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-10_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply. It is helpful, because he suggests that the Government are already going along the route that the amendment proposes. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para8"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para9"></a>Clause 44 agreed to.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para10"></a>Clause 45 [Simplified planning zones]:
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para11"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 45 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-10_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Clause 45 introduces the topic of simplified planning zones. I assume they are the same as the business planning zones referred to in the Green Paper, which says at paragraph 5.36:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We need to ensure that the planning system is capable of meeting the needs of fast-moving businesses such as our leading-edge technology companies. Planning delays can prove a significant obstacle to the development of such companies".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-10_para12"></a>
The following paragraph states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We intend such zones to be specific to types of business that have a low impact on the surrounding area, such as clusters of high-tech industry".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-10_para13"></a>
So much for mixed development. Paragraph 5.38 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We propose that every region should have at least one such zone to promote technology companies".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-10_para14"></a>
So much for the mixed economy.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para15"></a>This talk of the white heat of technology does not accord with the experience in London that creative industries&#151;some of which, but not all, are indeed high-tech&#151;make up the fastest growing sector. However, even if simplified planning zones were as effective as the Green Paper indicated, I would have great difficulty with Clause 45.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para16"></a>We have had simplified planning zones for well over a decade. The CPRE tells us that research for the Select Committee in another place provides evidence that the notion that planning is bad for the economy and competitiveness, which seems to be the underlying rationale for the proposal, is a myth. If the Committee is to be asked to agree this clause, no doubt the Minister will take the opportunity to explain what evidence there is that it hinders competitiveness.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para17"></a>It is possible&#151;indeed, more than possible&#151;that each local planning authority must keep possible simplified planning zones under review. As I said, they can establish them now. But proposed new Section 83(1B) refers to considering for which part or parts of <P>


<a name="column_474"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 474</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>their area a simplified planning zone scheme is desirable. That seems to allow no discretion&#151;the provision does not consider whether such a scheme is desirable. However, I take heart from proposed new Section 83(2A) which says that if a local planning authority so decides, immediately it meets, as is customary, the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para18"></a>How does the proposal relate to local development orders? Do they not give the extra latitude that the Government are seeking to add to the simplified planning zone provisions that we already have? Are simplified planning zones to be imposed on local planning authorities? There is bound to be a concern about that.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para19"></a>There is also bound to be a concern that they will lead to development which is not sustainable by the use of greenfield sites. I am sure the Minister will tell us that we should not have such a thought in our heads but I am sure he can understand why there is a concern.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para20"></a>In our book, simplified planning zones undermine the planning system both because of the lack of normal accountability and because, as we see it, the quality of development is put at risk.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para21"></a>The Local Government Association published a survey of local authorities on planning reform in February 2003. In answer to the question how likely were they to introduce business planning zones&#151;as they were then&#151;in their authority area, one said very likely, four said fairly likely, 42 said not very likely and 53 said not at all likely. In answer to the question whether they had any concerns about the introduction of business planning zones, 68 per cent answered yes and 32 per cent answered no. It can be said that local authorities do not have a "Don't know" among their number.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para22"></a>We oppose the clause. Amendment No. 132A is consequential.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-10_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   We also oppose the clause. I said on Second Reading that I thought the Bill had few friends. As it has progressed, we have seen that its friends are melting away. However, simplified planning zones have absolutely no friends as far as I can see. Business planning zones never had very many either, which is the reason they have not been taken up in the way I think people envisaged they would be.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para23"></a>Business planning zones are far from simple; they are quite complicated. A great deal of checking has to be done with the local authority. They have not fulfilled any of the ambitions that people had for them.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para24"></a>There are quite serious implications in Clause 45, some of which have been alluded to by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. Proposed new subsection (2)(1A) states to what the provision applies; the Secretary of State is given the right to indicate whether there will be a simplified planning zone. The clause also gives the regional spatial strategy the role of identifying in which area of a local planning authority the simplified planning zone should be identified. That is not local planning by any stretch of the <P>


<a name="column_475"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 475</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>imagination&#151;that is planning by diktat. It is one of the other worries we have about simplified planning zones.
<P>

<a name="40202-10_para25"></a>The question of whether Clause 45 stands part of the Bill is clearly open to further thought. We would be grateful to hear why the Minister believes that the clause is necessary and what he feels about the views expressed by the Local Government Association, among others. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, there is practically no support for it. None of the other organisations which represent business or planning seems to have any faith in the clause or any desire to use it.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   Will the Minister explain how the simplified planning zones will be introduced into the new system? I am puzzled by that. If they are not in the existing regional planning guidance, which becomes the RSS when the Bill is enacted, they would not be introduced until the RSS was modified at a later stage. That might be some time away. However, my noble friend informs me that the business planning zones, which do exist at the moment, would become simplified planning zones under the new system. I do not follow that argument. If the simplified planning zones are not mentioned in the regional planning guidance and cannot therefore feed across into the RSS, what are the mechanics of the process? The Explanatory Notes on Clause 45 state:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A simplified planning zone can only be made where the RSS, or the spatial development strategy for Greater London, identifies the need for such a zone in the area of a local planning authority".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-11_para0"></a>
That need cannot have been identified unless it already appears in the regional planning guidance. Can the Minister offer an explanation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I hope I can, because I am quite interested in the answer to that question. I may not be able to answer all the questions that have been raised, but I shall be able to answer some of them.
<P>

<a name="40202-11_para1"></a>The purpose of Clause 45 is to change the existing system so that the simplified planning zones cannot be made by an authority unless the need for one has been identified in the regional spatial strategy. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, pointed out that if the simplified planning zones do not become part of the regional spatial strategy until a revision, there is no practical purpose in identifying one. The revision would be the trigger mechanism.
<P>

<a name="40202-11_para2"></a>The clause would enable the life span of a simplified planning zone to be a period of up to 10 years rather than restricting it to 10 years, so flexibility is provided there. The clause facilitates the creation of areas of high-tech businesses that will be referred to as "business planning zones", as they were introduced in the planning Green Paper in 2001. The business planning zones will provide a flexible planning regime to facilitate the rapid development of high-quality, high-tech business clusters and encourage investment for growth and regeneration. We envisage only one or two per region, if they are identified in the regional spatial strategy. It is not a question of misusing the <P>


<a name="column_476"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 476</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>changes in the planning law on a grand scale to pepperpot a region with dozens of such zones. We anticipate only one or two per region to be identified in the regional spatial strategy. We intend for them to be of high quality and low environmental impact. Their locations will be chosen to meet identified strategic needs.
<P>

<a name="40202-11_para3"></a>Any business planning zone schemes brought forward will be required to undergo environmental impact assessments and public consultation, so we have no intention of snuffing out the opportunity for people to be consulted. The zones will serve a valuable and positive purpose. Therefore, we wish to proceed with them rather than knock the clause out of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40202-11_para4"></a>On the timetable, I am working only on the assumption in the Explanatory Notes, together with the reading of the Bill and the Notes on Clauses. If the zones are not in the regional spatial strategy, none will be recommended anyway. If there are none in current regional planning guidance, I have no information on how long it would take. The Government are not imposing the zones across the country as a quick fix once the Bill is enacted. That is clearly not a practical proposition. I do not wish to upset noble Lords, but I cannot understand the heated opposition to the prospect of simplified planning zones. Such zones will not present a major problem. They will be high quality, high-tech. They will not be low quality, nor will they cut corners on the environment or on public consultation. In fact, the very opposite is the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I think that the Minister has confirmed what I thought was the case; namely, that if the simplified planning zones are not already in the regional planning guidance, they are not introduced into the regional spatial strategy. Therefore, I would be grateful if the Minister would at some point provide your Lordships with a list of the zones that do currently exist in the regional planning guidance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I would be happy to facilitate that as quickly as possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-11_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   Will the Minister also clarify the status of the business planning zones and who is dealing with them? It is abundantly clear from Clause 45(2) that it is mandatory that a regional spatial strategy should include the Secretary of State's regional planning guidance. The Secretary of State has the power to say that a certain field must be set aside for a business planning zone because that is in his regional planning guidance. If that is right, and if the regional spatial strategy imposes on a local authority, as it does under Clause 3, the obligation to institute simplified planning zone schemes in all or any part of its area, where does the consultation come in? When will the local community have an opportunity to put forward its views? Moreover, when will the local authority be able to say how the simplified planning zones fit into its scheme of things if it is told that it has to do it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   That is a very good question, for which, I profoundly apologise, I do not have an <P>


<a name="column_477"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 477</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>answer. I should have, but I do not. The consultation process cannot be avoided, but I cannot say at what point it will take place. I accept that the regional spatial strategy must be agreed by the Secretary of State. If the simplified planning zones are added to the regional spatial strategy at a revision, it would apply only to specific areas. As I have said, given that the regions are large and consist of dozens of planning authorities, we anticipate there being only one or two per region. Let us be clear about that.
<P>

<a name="40202-11_para5"></a>I have forgotten how many planning authorities there are in the country. I believe that there are some 350&#151;it is a pretty substantial number. If there are some 20-plus a region, we envisage only one or two business planning zones per region being identified in the regional spatial strategy. It is not a question of imposing them on every local authority. The consultation would take place at regional spatial strategy level; in other words, during the revision of the regional spatial strategy. At local level, there would be full consultation on the size and location of the proposed zone, plus, if required, the option of a public inquiry.
<P>

<a name="40202-11_para6"></a>The timescale depends on the zones being identified through the next round of regional spatial strategies. I can say that with some confidence because I am told that there are no zones yet. I hope that that is reassuring, because it means that, whatever reasons people may have for opposing them, there is no prospect of any such zones being lifted out of the present process into the new one on the Act coming into force.
<P>

<a name="40202-11_para7"></a>It gets even better. The first zones are still several years away. I rest my case.
<P>

<a name="40202-11_para8"></a>It makes you wonder why we are doing this. Put it this way: it is obviously thought to be a useful tool for later use. It is not thought to be highly desirable next year.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-11_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   Will the Minister accept our amendment now?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-11_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   No, we are debating clause stand part. I feel that my response to it has been wholly inadequate. This is the first clause stand part debate we have had and it is the first time that I have not had a speaking note for clause stand part&#151;although I have a good speaking note on the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40202-11_para9"></a>A fair point has been made, but with the notes I have had I hope that I have been able to give some reassurance that there is no hidden agenda. There are no zones and none will be transferred over. By implication from our previous debates on regional spatial strategies, they will come in only on the revision, so we can tell that they are several years away.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-11_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Before the last round of exchanges I was going to observe that "modified rapture" might correctly sum up the Minister's enthusiasm for this provision. I do not think that he has been inadequate; the proposal is inadequate.

<P>

Despite that wording, I take it from what the Minister said that that does not mean that every local planning authority has to have one. I think that he is confirming that he said that.
<P>

<a name="40202-11_para12"></a>I am not sure whether the Minister responded to my question about how this fits in with local development orders and whether they would achieve some of what these provisions are aimed at. I would be happy to leave that for a future debate, as it is now past 5 o'clock and I assume that the suddenly increased attendance in the Chamber is not because the blood is running really hot on simplified planning systems.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-11_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   At the risk of boring colleagues, I shall put to bed the issue of the relationship between the business planning zones and the local development orders, which I hope will be helpful. The business planning zones are strategic and are identified in the regional spatial strategy. There will be only one or two per region. The local development orders are local tools to provide greater freedom to develop specified types of development.
<P>

<a name="40202-11_para13"></a>These are obviously some way down the road, so there is plenty of time to debate them before they come in.

<A NAME="40202-12_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   An example was given somewhere that local development orders might be used for the development of a business park, which seems to be rather close to all this. However, this is not the moment to pursue the issue.

The Question was to ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a Statement on the process of appointing a new chairman of the BBC. The Answer is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="40202-12_para3"></a>"I thank the honourable gentleman for his Question and welcome the opportunity to respond for several reasons. First, this gives me an opportunity to put on record the House's appreciation of the outstanding contribution made by Gavyn Davies, both as vice-chairman and as <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_479"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 479</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>chairman of the BBC. I regret that we now have to appoint a new chairman. But the fact that Gavyn felt that he had to resign&#151;his decision and his alone&#151;is a mark of his honour and integrity. It also demonstrates his overriding concern for the interests of the BBC. I should also take this opportunity to pay tribute to Greg Dyke and to the inspirational leadership that he has brought to the corporation. Now it is, of course, for the governors to appoint his successor.
<P>

<a name="40202-12_para4"></a>"These two resignations happened over the past week, which has been a very difficult period for the BBC, but now we must look to safeguard its future. The corporation needs strong leadership, stability and the capacity to engage fully with the charter review process, which is already under way. We will therefore move swiftly to appoint a new chairman.
<P>

<a name="40202-12_para5"></a>"The process for appointing Mr Davies's successor will follow in full the Nolan rules. We shall publish a role specification against which all candidates will be assessed. The post will be advertised in the national press and on the Internet. Shortlisted candidates will be interviewed by a panel, including an independent assessor, who will be involved throughout the process.
<P>

<a name="40202-12_para6"></a>"Under the BBC's Royal Charter, the appointment will be made by the Queen in Council, following this process, on the advice of Ministers.
<P>

<a name="40202-12_para7"></a>"It is worth recording, for the benefit of the House, that Gavyn Davies was the first BBC chairman to be appointed through the transparent Nolan process, which is now the standard for public appointments. The Nolan process is held in wide respect, but because of the public interest in this appointment we have decided to enhance the process further. Dame Rennie Fritchie, the Commissioner for Public Appointments, has agreed to act as guarantor for the fairness of the process and will convene a scrutiny panel to ensure its integrity. The panel will be made up of privy counsellors from the three main parties.
<P>

<a name="40202-12_para8"></a>"I hope that the names of the counsellors will be announced in the coming days and I hope that the double lock of Nolan and the scrutiny panel will give the staff of the BBC and the public the reassurance that they need about the independence of this process.
<P>

<a name="40202-12_para9"></a>"I have often said that we all want a strong BBC, independent of government. Anyone who cares about politics, standards in public life and the quality of our media knows how much the BBC matters. It provides this nation and the wider world with a cradle-to-grave public service. Because of that, it should have the self-confidence to promote those values and defend them against all comers. Central to that independence and self-confidence is the leadership of the BBC chairman. I can assure that House that whoever is chosen will be chosen fairly, freely and with the best interests of the BBC at heart".
<P>
</UL>
<a name="40202-12_para10"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.

<A NAME="40202-12_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for being flexible on the timing of this Statement. The Opposition join the Government in wanting to put on record our appreciation of the outstanding contribution made by Gavyn Davies as vice-chairman and as chairman of the BBC. We, too, very much regret that a new chairman must now be appointed. We agree that the fact that Gavyn Davies felt that he had to resign is a mark of his honour and integrity. It also shows his overriding concern for the interests of the BBC.
<P>

<a name="40202-12_para11"></a>I also take this opportunity to join the Minister in paying tribute to Greg Dyke. I entirely agree with the Minister's comments about Greg Dyke as an inspirational leader who has brought to the corporation a great deal of excitement, change and challenge. We accept that it is the governors who must now appoint his successor.
<P>

<a name="40202-12_para12"></a>The corporation needs strong leadership, stability and the capacity to engage fully with the charter review process, which is already under way.
<P>

<a name="40202-12_para13"></a>We welcome the fact that the new appointment will be overseen by Dame Rennie Fritchie. She comes with a distinguished record of having already exposed the Government for packing health quangos with their own placemen. Does the Minister accept that if the Government had accepted our amendment during the passage of the Communications Bill to place the BBC fully under the remit of Ofcom, this whole sorry business of having to find a new chairman might not have arisen? Does he also accept that the public are rightly concerned at the very powerful accusations by Greg Dyke that he and other journalists at the BBC were systematically bullied and intimidated by the Government and that that makes it all the more important that the process of appointing the new chairman is impartial?
<P>

<a name="40202-12_para14"></a>As morale at the BBC is clearly extremely low, will the Minister ensure that the appointment of a new chairman takes place speedily, as the BBC needs clear direction at a critical time? Will the new independent process for selecting the chairman of the BBC be made permanent? Will this very welcome transparent process extend to all other board members of the BBC in future? Finally, I return to the DCMS document, Review of the BBC's Royal Charter, published in December 2003. Page 24 makes the position clear. It states:

Comments are invited on whether these arrangements continue to be appropriate. Do they, for example, put the BBC in the best position to deliver on its commitments to its audiences whilst at the same time preserving its strength and independence from Government?".

<a name="40202-12_para16"></a>We on these Benches have always argued that the BBC board of governors cannot both run and regulate the BBC. There is now an even stronger case for independent regulation of the BBC. The role of chairman is a tough challenge. Let us hope that the events of the past week will not deter the right candidate from coming forward.

<A NAME="40202-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, I shall not follow the noble Baroness on a number of her points, including whether the Ofcom magic would have worked. I suspect we shall return to those issues, perhaps on Wednesday and certainly at later discussions about the BBC Charter.
<P>

<a name="40202-12_para17"></a>I hope that the willingness of the Government to respond to this Question today indicates that it has dawned on them over the weekend that winning a game 26-nil is not always the best outcome, even for the victors, and that there is therefore a new sense of realism about what should happen at the BBC. We only have to imagine how we would have looked at a happening abroad where there was a spat between the prime minister and the state broadcaster that resulted in the removal of the chairman and the director-general of that state broadcaster. One would say that that would be quite understandable in Mr Berlusconi's Italy or perhaps even in President Putin's Russia, but not in a country that has taken pride in the robust independence of the BBC from the government of the day for over three-quarters of a century. Therefore, any hint of the "berlusconisation" of the BBC is something that is not only difficult to say but to be resisted.
<P>

<a name="40202-12_para18"></a>We welcome the reference to the Nolan rules and the scrutiny panel in the Answer. We also welcome the assurances that the final choice will be free from political influence. Does the Minister agree with me that politicians should not necessarily be barred from applying? We can think of very good examples&#151;Lord Hill of Luton in the BBC, my noble friend Lord Thomson of Monifieth in the IBA&#151;who have managed to carry out these responsibilities with great skill. It is important to get the right person rather than to worry about their politics.
<P>

<a name="40202-12_para19"></a>I share the noble Baroness's concern about speed. Of course, the process should be thorough, but there is a need for somebody to be at the helm as quickly as possible. There is also a need&#151;we welcome the mention of it in the Statement&#151;for a commitment to an independent, well financed BBC as the iron pole of our public service broadcasting. Vested interests and the enemies of the BBC have certainly seen their opportunity in the past few days. It is important that those of us who value a commitment to this organisation should be prepared to fight for it.
<P>

<a name="40202-12_para20"></a>That also goes for the Secretary of State and for the Minister's department, the DCMS. All too often over the past months there has been an impression that, in Lord Willis's immortal phrase, the DCMS has been like a cushion bearing the imprint of the backside that sat on it last. If we are to defend the BBC, the first line of defence must be a robust Secretary of State and a robust departmental responsibility for its integrity. The commitments in this Statement are extremely welcome. By their deeds we shall now judge them. The sooner a good, independent chair of the BBC is in place, the better for all concerned.

<A NAME="40202-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Statement was about the process of appointment of the chairman of the BBC. I shall depart so far from the subject matter of the Statement as to welcome what the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, and the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said about Gavyn Davies's work as chairman and Greg Dyke's work as director-general. I know the Secretary of State will be very grateful to hear those views expressed in this House.
<P>

<a name="40202-12_para21"></a>A number of the other points made do not relate directly to the process of appointment of the chairman of the BBC. It would not be appropriate for me to respond to them, other than to say that many of these issues will come up over the next couple of years in the consideration of the charter review. It is entirely appropriate that those views, which have been expressed, should be expressed now but the Government should respond to them only in the context of the charter review.
<P>

<a name="40202-12_para22"></a>I can confirm, as the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, said, that it is the duty of the governors to appoint a successor to Greg Dyke as director-general. She asked me about speed and urged it on the Government. I entirely agree with her. My understanding is that press advertisements will appear within the next week. We have no intention of losing time or leaving the BBC in a position of uncertainty. I do not think that there is anything else I need to respond to, other than to reaffirm, as did the noble Lord, Lord McNally, that it is the intention of the charter review process to land up with a strong, independent BBC. I think that that is welcomed all round the House.

<A NAME="40202-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, as oppositions do not like to congratulate governments too often, perhaps I could. I am happy to congratulate the Government on deciding to use the Nolan rules, even though I was appointed as vice-chairman by the then Prime Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher. She also appointed me acting chairman on the occasion when, sadly, the chairman died. I am sure that the Government are right to press ahead as quickly as possible. I hope that they will not rush into accepting the advice of the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, that an independent regulator might have avoided a lot of these or any other troubles. I am not sure that Gilligan's error would have been spotted any quicker by an independent regulator. I hope all of us are concerned about a truly independent BBC with an independent chairman. In my experience, whichever political party held the chairmanship of the time, there was never any problem with its independence, even though the chairmen were not appointed under the Nolan rules. The Nolan rules are an improvement and I congratulate my noble friend.

<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Puttnam: </B>   My Lords, given that the entire thrust of the Government's statement seems to be about independence, impartiality and the creation of an atmosphere of trust, does the Minister agree that very important people, such as chairmen of select committees, would do well to temper their expressions of prejudice during this difficult period? There is a real danger that in displaying prejudice they could discredit the entire system of evidence-based select committee scrutiny.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, in so far as that question relates to the process of appointment of the chairman of the BBC, I would say that everyone involved in the process of selecting the new chairman of the BBC should exercise the maximum restraint.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, how will the panel that is to make the selection be compiled? How will the role specification be alighted upon? Will there be any external consultation, particularly with the governors, on both those matters?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, it is not normal to name those who take part in the interviewing process other than to say, as the Statement says, that there will be an independent assessor. The answer to the second part of the noble Lord's question is that Dame Rennie Fritchie is already involved and will be involved throughout the process including in the selection of the panel of three Privy Counsellors and of the independent assessor.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I understood the noble Lord to say that the process will be carried out according to the Nolan rules, that it will be scrutinised by the scrutiny panel and that a name will be put forward to the Prime Minister that he will put before Her Majesty. Will the Prime Minister be able to decline to put that name forward?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Nolan rules are very clear and we shall observe them in detail. They involve publishing a role specification against which all candidates will be assessed, advertising the post as widely as is necessary and, as I said in response to the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, shortlisting candidates who will be interviewed by a panel, including an independent assessor, who will be involved throughout the process. The final part of the question of the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, is answered under the Royal Charter which says that the appointment will be made by the Queen in Council following this process on the advice of Ministers. It does not mention the Prime Minister specifically. Clearly, the Prime Minister has at least a formal responsibility for any advice that he tenders to Her Majesty, but that is true of all appointments; there is nothing particular about this one.

<A NAME="40202-13_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I hope that I may follow that up. Can Ministers decline to put the name forward? That was my point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I believe that in theory they could.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, given the grave circumstances under which these resignations of two such distinguished people have taken place, is it not appropriate that all the people who are to be on the scrutiny panel are named in the interests of greater transparency and, indeed, independence?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, we have said that we shall involve the Commissioner for Public Appointments right from the very beginning and that she has agreed to be involved. She will be assisted by a panel of three Privy Counsellors from the three major parties. If she wants to make recommendations about the process&#151;so long as those recommendations do not involve a departure from Nolan procedures&#151;of course we shall listen.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Jopling: </B>   My Lords, while it must be right that Mr Davies and Mr Dyke resigned, will the party leaders be consulted in this process? Does the noble Lord not agree that there is some advantage in choosing a chairman with no political baggage? I say that as the noble Lord will know that over the years there have been a great many accusations from both sides of this House and another place that the BBC has been guilty of bias. I seem to recall that often that was attributed either to Labour "luvvies" or to Conservative contributors. Does he not agree that it would be an advantage if someone could be found to lead the BBC in the future who had sufficiently tough managerial experience and no political baggage?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew12"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, it would be most unwise for me to respond to suggestions regarding the right kind of person to lead the BBC whether it is the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, that he or she should not be a politician or the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord McNally, that he or she should be a politician&#151;I did not quite think that that comment constituted the job application when he said it. I shall not respond to that point if the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, will forgive me.
<P>

<a name="40202-13_para0"></a>However, the noble Lord asked me a specific question regarding consultation with party leaders. We have said that Dame Rennie Fritchie will convene the scrutiny panel of Privy Counsellors. Who she consults in doing that is a matter for her.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew13"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, why will the names of those on the scrutiny panel not be published? Will the noble Lord give an undertaking that even though theoretically the Prime Minister can decline to accept the nomination and pass it on to Her Majesty, he will not do so?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew14"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I did not say that the names of those on the scrutiny panel would <P>


<a name="column_485"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>not be published. The names of the three Privy Counsellors will be published. I said that it was not normal practice for the names of those on the interviewing panel to be published. My answer regarding the powers of the Prime Minister was a theoretical answer. It has always been the case that when the Prime Minister submits names to Her Majesty he has the power in theory to reject names.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Baker of Dorking: </B>   My Lords, in view of recent events, will the noble Lord ensure that no judge is involved in this process?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew16"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I shall not comment on the qualifications or background of any potential candidate for the job.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Howe of Aberavon: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord accept an anecdotal reminiscence that the procedure outlined seems likely to be an improvement on the one that was followed when I was remarkably present in the early 1970s and suggested a name that provoked the Prime Minister to comment that the named person had much too high an opinion of himself, which led my noble friend Lady Thatcher to retort, "But most men do, Prime Minister"? That led to the appointment of Sir Michael Swann, who was not at all a bad choice in the circumstances. The present method seems more orderly than that which was then adopted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew18"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am glad to have that wise contribution. It will have been noticed that I avoided doing what the Secretary of State did in the Commons, which was to read out the way in which the noble Lord, Lord Hussey, was appointed chairman of the board of governors of the BBC in a manner that was a long way from Nolan procedures.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Jordan: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the speedy moves to replace the director-general and the use of the Nolan procedures. A strong character is needed. The acting director-general, Mark Byford, is such a strong character. I hope that his name will be put in the hat. A strong character is needed not only to maintain the world perception of a BBC that is independent of the pressures of government but also to counter the culture of contempt and arrogance that emerged from within its ranks and gave birth to the problems that led to the departure of the director-general and the chairman. I hope that such a character emerges.
<P>

<a name="40202-13_para1"></a>Noble Lords in this House who side with those who declare their opposition to political interference must bear in mind that the present culture of contempt extends to everyone within the parliamentary system&#151;there are no sides in that regard. I hope that the next director-general will recognise that such contempt does the BBC an injustice and will certainly undermine its attempts regarding the renewal of the charter. I hope that the procedure we are discussing will result in the director-general recognising that the <P>

<P>
<A NAME="40202-13_spnew20"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, in response to the noble Lord, Lord Jordan, I am conscious that throughout these brief proceedings I am resisting any temptation to talk about candidates or the qualifications for candidates. In other words I am saying very little positive in response to the questions, but I am sure those who have taken part in asking questions will realise that those who are responsible for this process will inevitably be reading Hansard today. Therefore what they say is not running into the sand. In response to the noble Lord's specific question, the appointment of a director general is the responsibility of the governors and not of the process I have been describing today.

My question is about process. I am not quite clear whether I caught a response from the Minister to the question of my noble friend Lady Buscombe about whether this process which we are now adopting will be applied in future to governors at large.

<P>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 487</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-14_para3"></a>The Government announced a consultation on the reform of planning obligations in November and gave consultees a nine-week period for responses. I have written down at this point "whinge". The Minister will be aware that a statement from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister was published on Friday. He may not be aware of the difficulty for Members of this House who do not have a quick and immediate line to the ODPM, not only in seeing that statement but even knowing of its existence.
<P>

<a name="40202-14_para4"></a>I became aware of the statement on Friday afternoon because the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors was good enough to e-mail it to me. I discovered this morning that planning officers at the Greater London Authority had inquired, I think on Thursday, whether a statement on the issue was going to be made. We were told, yes, it was coming. The institute was sent a copy I think on Friday&#151;I may be wrong; it may have been this morning. This House was not sitting on Friday, so Members of the Committee may not be aware that there was a statement.
<P>

<a name="40202-14_para5"></a>Today the Government published a summary of consultation responses. In Friday's statement the Government said that they prefer where possible to offer a 12-week consultation and regret it was not possible on this occasion, but they believe that having decided to take the opportunity to legislate on planning obligations provided by the carry-over of this Bill, it was better to supply Parliament with an output from that consultation as soon as possible and while the Bill is still under consideration than to have the consultation still going on as they consider it. Therefore they are publishing on 2 February a summary of the consultation responses. The document is intended to inform debate on the Bill's clauses and goes on to say that it contains a summary.
<P>

<a name="40202-14_para6"></a>I am flattered that the Government think that we are all so competent that we can absorb and assess all this in the time available, despite our being part-time Members of the House, difficulties of getting here, our doing other jobs, and so on, but I wonder whether my next move should not be a Motion to adjourn the Committee to give Members an opportunity to read the statement.

I have spent some time in the Library and the Printed Paper Office trying to find it. It is not available; it is not in the House so far as I can see; it certainly has not been made available to us, and I take that extremely badly. The Government are very slow on making sure that we have adequate information; we now seem to be completely devoid of <P>


<a name="column_488"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 488</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>one of the most important parts of the Bill, and of one of the most important aspects of that&#151;the outcome of the consultation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-14_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I was not in London on Friday but I know a letter was written on my behalf with a copy of the statement to every noble Lord who spoke on Second Reading.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-14_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I am sorry to have distracted the Committee but no doubt the postal systems are even now ensuring that the statement wings its way to us. There are other matters of communication, but if we had all received it on Friday it is still extremely short notice. The Government are creating a rod for their own&#151;and, indeed, for everybody else's&#151;back in rushing at this.
<P>

<a name="40202-14_para7"></a>We keep being told that we only get a planning Bill about once every 10 years, despite the fact that there were, I think, two in 1990 and one in 1991. But if this Bill did not include the provision, which is not even a framework&#151;or perhaps it is just about a framework&#151;but which is a long way from being in a proposal state, perhaps I am being naive but it seems that a bit of legislative time would be freed up and we could have corresponding time later in order to consider real proposals. Maybe human nature does not work like that.
<P>

<a name="40202-14_para8"></a>This amendment, however, stands whether or not there is content that needs to be taken account of in the ODPM statement, because many people who have spoken to us on these Benches about this issue have made the point that the evils that the Government appear to be seeking to address could be dealt with without changes in primary legislation. Therefore, my amendment is to the effect that the Secretary of State will issue additional guidance on the application of the existing planning obligation provisions under Section 106 of the 1990 Act.
<P>

<a name="40202-14_para9"></a>The changes that the Bill seeks to allow for are presented as a response to complaints about the length of time that the process takes, uncertainty for developers, a lack of transparency and, I understand, a necessary policy update because of the Tesco case, which I believe was decided before the last guidance was issued. Obvious responses were, for example, better training and better staffed planning departments, where the problem is resourcing, and, as we discussed previously, co-ordination between local authority departments, earlier discussions and perhaps, in addition, more realistic expectations.
<P>

<a name="40202-14_para10"></a>We asked the CBI to comment on whether or not the problems could be dealt with without primary legislation. It said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Much can be done to improve the current system, and we believe that this is where efforts should initially be focused".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-14_para11"></a>
The CBI would welcome, in particular, the greater use of standard terms and clauses, bringing in external resources to assist planning departments, clarity about a local authority's approach to planning obligations within development plans, phased payments, the <P>


<a name="column_489"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 489</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appropriate use of formulae and the use of mediation. None of that&#151;or, certainly, very little of it&#151;seems to require legislation.
<P>

<a name="40202-14_para12"></a>On policy statements, the CBI says that the uncertainty could be reduced if more councils were encouraged to set out in their development plans some indication of their policy towards Section 106 agreements. They could indicate what general issues the community expects to be addressed through planning obligations, for what kind of development the council is likely to need agreement to address these issues, and what approach and procedures it expects to take for the negotiation in order to set a framework to give applicants clarity up-front but without setting a rigid and inflexible schedule of tariffs. That also would not need legislation.
<P>

<a name="40202-14_para13"></a>The CBI says that the Green Paper is right to state that the negotiation of planning obligations should take place much earlier. I do not see that the new provisions will assist with that. It supports the wider promotion of standard terms to simplify and speed up the negotiation. That, again, is not dependent on legislation. It is presently concerned about the inadequacy of the current accounting of how planning obligations are agreed and then spent, and it comments on the lack of transparency. One must agree that those issues need to be addressed, but does that require primary legislation?
<P>

<a name="40202-14_para14"></a>The CBI also says that the introduction of an independent dispute resolution mechanism for questions of valuation would be welcome. Again, I wonder whether that requires legislation. It seems to me that that type of issue could be provided by a code, guidelines or guidance.
<P>

<a name="40202-14_para15"></a>The papers that some of us have now managed to gather together recognise that many consultees had proposals for improving the operation of the current regime. However, Friday's statement seems to fail to recognise that those proposals were generally put forward as an alternative to the introduction of a planning charge. Therefore, rather than giving details, the statement refers to the fact that they should simply be passed on to consultants, who should be employed to draft a best practice guide.

<a name="40202-14_para16"></a>Much could be done without Parliament being asked&#151;I, for one, feel most uncomfortable about having to take a view on this&#151;to agree to provisions in a Bill where so much is not only unclear but unresolved in the debate which is properly taking place among those who will be affected. I beg to move.

Ever since we started discussing the Bill, it has been absolutely plain that this whole area is controversial, that it is causing problems and concerns, and that it was inserted into the Bill at the very last moment in the House of Commons before Christmas on the basis that consultation would take place.

<a name="40202-14_para17"></a>I believe that it is almost unheard of for legislation to include clauses relating to a consultation document and for that consultation not to finish in time for everyone who is concerned with the discussion on it to form views before being asked to consider it. Not least is it unheard of for the Government, however they may have tried to do so, not to have ensured that Front Bench Members were aware of the outcome of the consultation and that the Secretary of State was pronouncing on it. That seems to go well beyond how one expects this House to operate.
<P>

<a name="40202-14_para18"></a>There are ways in which the Section 106 provisions could be tightened up, and there are probably ways in which they could be made more accessible. That is what this amendment is about. We would not oppose that. We would want to see what the expectation was and what detail was likely to be included. That can only be in guidance because, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, it does not appear likely that this will require primary legislation. However, we do not see guidance either. The measures would all take place without our having considered them. Therefore, by necessity, we would have to ensure that amendments were tabled so that we would have a chance to consider the matter.
<P>

<a name="40202-14_para19"></a>How we discuss the following clauses, I know not. No doubt the Minister will have some views on that, but it seems to me that all the amendments that we shall move relate precisely to the consultation document. It was a consultation document but the measure is now in legislation and, apparently, we are not entitled to have sight of the response. I support the noble Baroness's amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40202-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I want to say something about affordable housing. I declare an interest, as I have done previously, as a vice-president of the National Housing Federation. Over the years, registered social landlords, and also, I believe, the Government, have seen Section 106 agreements as a very important tool in providing housing in areas where, in particular, there is not a plentiful supply of land. They have also viewed them as part of their policies to develop mixed communities. Those are the two areas about which registered social landlords are very concerned.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para0"></a>Like others, I find it unacceptable that we are trying to question the Government and trying to help to create a Bill with which people can work, yet we are having to rush around, reading documents in a very short time in order to get to grips with announcements that the Government have made. Indeed, I have been reading material while sitting on the Bench.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para1"></a>However, one point that I have picked up&#151;this came out during the consultation&#151;is that many consultees pointed to the benefits of the existing system and, in particular, to its flexibility in responding to the circumstances of individual development proposals and its role in securing a proportion of affordable housing. That is one of the key issues here. When we reach the Question whether the clause shall stand part of the Bill, I believe that we shall all be asking the Minister many questions. We shall hope that he can respond, given that he has the <P>


<a name="column_491"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 491</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information. He has had it longer than we have and he also has at least six people giving him advice on what to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My impression is that developers have never particularly liked Section 106. They have grumbled about it for a long time and are very much in favour of the Government's efforts to see what can be done to provide an alternative and to improve on it. However, I have not yet spoken to one who has not thought that the alternative being provided is far worse than the existing Section 106. It is much less certain and much less directly connected to the development and does not tackle at all many of the points which will still need to be concluded in negotiations between them and a local authority as regards all the elements of the development, which will have to be provided by the local authority or other agencies.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para2"></a>I have not yet spoken to anybody who wants these new clauses to follow that road. I do not see wild enthusiasm expressed by noble Lords on the Benches opposite. I know that those officials in the Box are not allowed to jump up and down with enthusiasm, but I have not even seen a smile on their faces while we have been discussing this issue. It is a noble attempt. I recognise that the Government understand the problems. This is an honest attempt to see if there is a better way.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para3"></a>Looking at the matter and the Government's reaction, I believe the right conclusion is that there is not a better way. Section 106 is the best thing we have in front of us at the moment. Improving that section is the road we should follow so I am very much in favour of the amendment. Section 106 would benefit from advice based on considerable experience as to how best to use that method; what is and what is not best practice, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, as regards facilities for settling disputes and making the wheels turn quicker. But to go in the Government's direction as outlined in Clauses 46 and onwards, even with the best of intentions, would be a wrong move.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para4"></a>The Government should listen to what has been said. I have not had access to the consultation paper, either. I have not had a letter and I have seen no other reference to the matter. My researches are based purely on talking to a number of people in the industry and local government. As I say, not one whit of enthusiasm has been shown for the new idea: they much prefer the old way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   If the developers like the old way they can carry on using it. That is the whole point. I apologise if anyone believes that we have been discourteous, but sometimes it is better to get the information out late rather than not at all.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para5"></a>Although the amendment is specific, it might help if I take a little time to clarify our intentions as regards Clauses 46 to 48. That will assist the Committee in the clause stand part debate. I make it absolutely clear: if developers love the present system there is nothing in the Bill which stops them using it. There has been a <P>


<a name="column_492"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 492</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>great deal of misunderstanding about this matter and I can only apologise for the inadequacy of our communications because ultimately it is the Government's fault. It is our Bill; and it is our system which we are trying to improve.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para6"></a>We definitely have problems with the existing system of planning obligations, which are well known. It is a system which enables negotiations between local planning authorities and parties interested in land. The full variety of stakeholders in the planning system have criticised the system as being slow, opaque, unfair and complex. It is these criticisms to which the Government are responding with the amendments in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para7"></a>Although the consultation overlaps slightly with the Bill, there is nothing in the Bill to stop the Government taking account, as we will, of the outcome of the consultation. We shall publish further details today as regards what we shall do later. It is not as though everything in the Bill is copper bottomed and that this is the new system. It is not a question that we have completed the consultation and, therefore, the Government cannot take anything further into account: we can. There is nothing in the consultation process which we are unable to take into account in working up the final system as an alternative, and not a replacement, for the present system.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para8"></a>The system is slow at present. We have evidence which shows that Section 106, as the planning obligations are known, can sometimes take years to negotiate for a variety of reasons. That can be very frustrating and delay the developments necessary to allow communities to grow and prosper. The system is opaque and uncertain because land developers do not know what they will be expected to contribute through a planning obligation in advance and also because the public is often not party to the negotiations. I have never known the public to be party to the negotiations, which means that the system lacks transparency. It is an accusation of buying planning permission behind close doors. That is the tabloid way of putting it and what ordinary citizens would say.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para9"></a>The system is unfair. As I have said, negotiations are often conducted privately and their outcome uncertain. That can mean two developments with very similar impacts on a local community finishing up contributing very different amounts to a planning obligation. I do not believe anyone can defend that as a right and proper way to operate.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para10"></a>The system is incredibly complex because of the range of matters with which an applicant may be asked to deal. It is also complex because a developer may be asked to negotiate simultaneously with several public sector bodies, which have not co-ordinated their requests. That is the fault of the public sector, but it puts an extra burden of cost and complexity on the developer.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para11"></a>Our reforms aim to tackle these problems. The clauses before the Committee provide the Secretary of State with the power to prescribe a new route to the agreement of a planning obligation; namely, the optional planning charge. As I said at the beginning, I <P>


<a name="column_493"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 493</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wish to emphasise that this route is not a replacement for the negotiated route; it is an alternative. Nothing in these clauses precludes developers from choosing to negotiate as they do now. The clause provides in regulations for the reconstruction of the existing negotiated system lock, stock and barrel. Our aim is to offer developers a fast and certain alternative to the negotiated route through the optional planning charge. Charges will have to be published in public and in advance, which will significantly increase transparency and the certainty of the system.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para12"></a>I am well aware that some business representatives have been concerned about whether the charge will add to the burdens upon them. We recognise these concerns. I hope that the Written Statement published by my right honourable friend Keith Hill on Friday in another place will assuage developers. I wish to draw attention to some of its key points. The charge will have the same scope as a negotiated obligation. It will have the same ground rules as a negotiated obligation in terms of its relationship to a planning permission. An example of what that means is that, as now, it would be entirely open to a developer to refuse to make any contribution at all and insist that his application be determined having regard to the development plan and all other material considerations. If such an application is refused, we anticipate that, irrespective of whether developers opt to pay the charge or negotiate, they will be able to give a unilateral undertaking at an appeal just as they can now. I could give further examples of this equivalence.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para13"></a>The charge is not an attempt to introduce extra burdens on developers. It is not an attempt to allow the planning system to pay for impacts unrelated to planning matters. We will be extremely careful that policies relating to the new charge take account of the economics of development so they do not render development proposals unviable.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para14"></a>As Members of the Committee have said, they are concerned about the impact of the charge on the provision of affordable housing. There has also been some confusion on this issue, in that some commentators assume that the optional charge could only be paid in cash. That is not right as my right honourable friend's Statement makes clear. It also addresses the wider concerns about affordable housing provision. The Government are committed to the creation of mixed communities and to maintaining the level of affordable housing provided through the planning system.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para15"></a>Our new obligations policy and the up-dated policy on planning for housing, when published, will be entirely consistent with each other. We are committed to continuing debate as regards planning obligations. It is not finished because it is a complex area. The Statement made on Friday and the summary of the consultation responses published today, demonstrate a commitment to an open and frank debate. That will continue while this Bill is before the House. Many people agree that we should not continue with the present system. However, if people have learned to <P>


<a name="column_494"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 494</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>love that system, there is nothing to stop them using it. The proposal is not a replacement, it is an alternative to the present arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para16"></a>I do not apologise for the point made on the invitation to consultants. We said in the statement that we intended to issue practice guidance to support local authorities in developing planning obligation policies, particularly the alternative charging policies. We have issued tender invitation to consultants to provide advice on what that guidance should contain. The guidance will build on many examples of good practice identified in the consultation process, not just in the preparation of policies but in the process of negotiating, mediating, implementing and monitoring planning agreements. Therefore, as far as concerns the amendment, it is inappropriate to bind the Secretary of State to publishing guidance by legislation and within a timescale.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para17"></a>We have made a commitment to publish guidance and it is acknowledged that it is in everyone's best interests that the guidance comes out as early as possible and is as full as possible. I cannot give details about the timescale.
<P>

<a name="40202-15_para18"></a>I probably cannot say enough on this issue, which is controversial. I hope I have given a flavour of why we have taken the approach we have to the clauses and why it is not possible for me to accept Amendment No. 119ZCZA. I will return to this issue as your Lordships desire.

<A NAME="40202-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Cobbold: </B>   The Minister has outlined some of the aims of the proposals in Clauses 46 and 47. However, the principal concern with these new clauses is that the new planning contributions may be used by local authorities as a stealth tax on development or, worse, as a means of preventing a development with which the authority is not in sympathy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   That cannot happen. The developer can say, "I am not taking that route, I want to take the negotiated route". It is in the hands of the developer. The system cannot be misused by local authorities in the way the noble Lord suggested.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Cobbold: </B>   It is of considerable concern to developers that it could be used in that way. It is also a concern that it could be used for small-scale proposals. Section 106 agreements are currently applicable to only a small proportion, the major planning applications, and developers accept the obligation to pay for local service improvements necessitated by the development, provided that the obligation is within reason and does not damage or destroy the financial viability of the development. It is the proposal to dispense with this necessary connection to the development that worries developers and which could open floodgates to unreasonable calls on developers to fund local improvements not directly related to their development. It seems that the meat in this will be in the guidelines or in the regulations.

<a name="40202-16_para0"></a>Will the Minister confirm that the regulations will ensure that the planning contributions will be directly related to the development in question and that local planning authorities will not be able to use planning contributions as a simple revenue-raising exercise or as a financial deterrent to a specific development proposal?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   In his reply, the Minister said many people expressed the opinion that the current system could not continue. Do the documents published to date allow me to identify some of these people, so that I might talk to them? I would like to speak to somebody, other than a member of the Government, who wants this change on the basis of what they have seen to date. Speaking to my own and the Liberal Democrat Front Benches, given that this is an important part of the Bill, given that we have a lot of new information and another day on this Bill and not too much to do, would it not be sensible to break now? It would give us a chance to look at this new information. We could then return to the matter informed and prepared on Thursday. I cannot see any reason why we cannot get through what remains on Thursday. It is a strung-out collection of amendments. We have about three inches on this clause alone, when it could be dealt with as one group. I would have thought that is a more satisfactory way for the Committee to proceed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-16_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I am not sure I should attempt now to pick up issues which are more for the clause stand part debate. On the specific amendment, I accept that the three-month provision would not give the opportunity for consultation we would like to see. The issue occurred to us at about 4.55 on Thursday and we wanted to get something down to make the point. It is not a perfect amendment but it has made the point, which is what Committee is all about.
<P>

<a name="40202-16_para1"></a>The Minister said that the Bill has not copper-bottomed the issues on this. I acknowledge that, but it is disingenuous and perhaps irrelevant to suggest that the statement seemed to, and that it was a contribution to this stage of the Bill. As we have seen, it has been difficult to use it helpfully to contribute to our debate. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40202-16_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hanham </B>  : Before speaking to the amendment, I would like to take up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. It seems we are hampered in the discussions on Clauses 46, 47 and 48 without having sight of the statement and the results of the consultation.
<P>

<a name="40202-16_para4"></a>It seems to me we have three options. One is to do nothing. Another is to put forward a Motion that the Committee adjourn for half an hour while the Minister gets us coffees and also the statement and the results of <P>


<a name="column_496"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 496</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the consultation. That would give us an opportunity to look at the statement and consultation papers. Another alternative is for us not to consider Clauses 45, 46, 47 and 48 today but to put them on hold until Thursday. They might not be anything to do with this, but the Government have landed us in this difficulty. I suggest we consider those clauses on Thursday and carry on with the other clauses.
<P>

<a name="40202-16_para5"></a>Something has to happen because my amendments open up all the areas that the consultation, presumably, has dealt with. They open up areas on which the Minister has sought to respond on the back of this statement that has already been made. I am sure he is correct in what he says and I have absolutely no means of knowing how I would reply on the basis of that.
<P>

<a name="40202-16_para6"></a>I am prepared to move either Motion. One is that we skip these clauses and go on with the rest of the Bill; the second is that the Committee adjourn for half an hour to get access to the statement and to the consultation papers.

I do not think we can handle them as it is. I do not think I am asking to move anything at the moment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-16_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   We have a series of amendments on the clauses. I made an introductory statement, which got me towards the end of the clause. I have perfectly detailed notes to respond to the amendments on the Marshalled List. There is nothing that is in the document that has been published that we cannot accommodate in terms of the consultation. There were 340 responses to the consultation. I do not have a figure to give an answer to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas.
<P>

<a name="40202-16_para7"></a>I am able to respond to the amendments and I think that that would be useful to the Committee. Whether we adjourn for half an hour now or come back on Thursday, I shall not be able to say much different to what I have already said at this stage of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40202-16_para8"></a>We should bear in mind that there are three stages at which the Bill can be amended. If Members of the Committee feel that we have not covered all the points raised, we can have an extensive Report stage after everyone has had full opportunity to consider this matter. I believe that to adjourn now would be counterproductive in the use of time. I am not trying to get round matters. I do not control the business of the House. I want to be as helpful as I can. I am in <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-16_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </B>   It seems appropriate that the House should be resumed in order that Members of the Committee who want to know the questions they should put can put them. It is all very well for the Minister to say that he has the answers, but the noble Baronesses want to put the questions. They cannot do that if they have not studied the document. A good way of working is for people to have the information that they are endeavouring to debate. If they do not have that information, they are not in the best position to debate it. Surely it is right that they should be in the best position as far as concerns information.

The noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, will recall a moment in Committee on the Housing Bill in another place in 1996 when the Minister, Mr David Curry, suddenly withdrew half a dozen clauses and was subjected to a violent attack by Mr Raynsford, who led the Opposition on the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40202-16_para10"></a>I do not believe that on this occasion, the Opposition, nor indeed the Liberal Democrats, have in any way adopted the same degree of aggression towards the Government Front Bench as Mr Raynsford assumed on that occasion. We are <P>

I wholly understand that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, believes that no harm has been done by noble Lords not receiving a document we were meant to receive and that we can muddle our way through without it. However, from the point of view of those on this side of the Chamber who are seeking to move amendments to the Bill, which we are seeking to improve, it must be the case that we would do that better if we had access to the consultation paper.

<a name="40202-17_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: I thank the Committee for adjourning to give us time to read the inspiring statement produced by the Government on the back of the consultation process. It seems almost the same except that there will be more consultation and that PPG3 and PPG1 will be amended at some stage on the back of the Government's new policies.
<P>

<a name="40202-17_para8"></a>I presume that the Government's new policies are in the Bill, so I presume that we will see the consultation results. I notice that the Government thought that 340 responses was rather good; I am not sure how many people or bodies they sought responses from, but that figure is about half of the planning authorities and it certainly does not include developers&#151;if it does, then it does not include half the planning authorities in the country.
<P>

<a name="40202-17_para9"></a>Having read the document I can take account of some of it as we go through the amendments. It does not negate any amendments that I have moved, which is one of the reasons I wanted to see it. If the Minister has responses which will help us on Report we will take the matter further then.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-17_para10"></a>I turn to my amendment. The legislation is extremely vague about what the Government intend and how planning contributions will work. The statement does not make that any clearer and nor did the consultation paper. It is of great concern that the public, Parliament and possibly the Government do not know how the scheme will work. From the statement, I am bound to say that they still do not know.
<P>

<a name="40202-17_para11"></a>The Government are looking to speedier planning processes and to improving affordable housing and community benefit, but it is not clear how that is to be achieved. We will need proposals to make it work, or to make it work better than Section 106, so that everyone does not simply ignore the new tariff system.
<P>

<a name="40202-17_para12"></a>Contributions are to be required in relation to the development or use of land, which requires a planning application. The Bill does not say whether those contributions are required solely when developments are taking place or whether they can be sought in respect of existing development. The provisions seem wide enough to require contributions in those latter circumstances. If so, that would be a tax.
<P>

<a name="40202-17_para13"></a>The thinking behind the amendment is that planning contributions are for making planning applications. The Bill could require contributions on existing development unrelated to a fresh planning application. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Amendment No. 119ZCZB is too restrictive because it seeks to ensure that planning contributions can be sought and made only in relation to planning applications. The current system does not make that restriction. Section 106 agreements can be made at any time between a local planning authority and a person with an interest in land. For example, they could be used in relation to permitted development for which no planning application is required.
<P>

<a name="40202-17_para14"></a>The planning contribution scheme does not seek to change the scope of the existing power. I want to make that absolutely clear. It could be that there is concern that local planning authorities will force developers to make payments that are unrelated to development proposals and hence thought to be inappropriate. I can sympathise with that view. In practice in the past most Section 106 agreements have been made in the context of planning permission. I want to make it absolutely clear that the local planning authority will have no power to compel a developer to make a planning contribution. That is the position.
<P>

<a name="40202-17_para15"></a>However, it can be appropriate for a local planning authority to seek a contribution or for developers to offer a contribution at any time for matters related to a development. We do not believe that it would be right to preclude that option remaining. We think that overall it would be wrong to close off the option of seeking and making contributions at other times to maintain the flexibility of the system. What is proposed in the planning charge does not change the scope of the existing power. I agree that in many ways <P>


<a name="column_500"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 500</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the scope of the existing power is sadly misunderstood. I hope that I have explained the way that it works because Section 106 agreements can be made at any time, but a local planning authority cannot force or compel a developer to make a planning contribution in the first place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-17_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I thank the Minister for that helpful response. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40202-17_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hanham </B>   moved Amendment No. 119ZCZC:

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> Page 34, line 34, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-17_para17"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"(2A) That an applicant for planning permission has made a contribution by the prescribed means does not prevent the local planning authority or the Secretary of State, as appropriate, refusing to grant planning permission because of a failure to provide other planning contributions."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40202-17_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: The Bill allows a developer to choose to make a planning contribution by the prescribed means or, in everyday language, by the tariff. We shall have to come round to the fact that this is a tariff, a proposal that started in the Green Paper. Although everyone held up their hands in dismay at a tariff system, that is precisely what we are talking about.
<P>

<a name="40202-17_para19"></a>The amendment provides that paying the tariff does not excuse the developer from dealing with other matters, possibly by relevant requirements. The tariff is unlikely to cover all planning contributions required by a scheme. Some of those contributions may have to be tailored to a particular proposal; for example, environmental improvements. That avoids the situation in which a developer offers affordable housing in accordance with the tariff, but does not provide the open space improvements that are also required. It also affects the extensive use of planning obligations for development control purposes, controlling, for example, the phasing of developments or the types of goods sold in a shop.
<P>

<a name="40202-17_para20"></a>It would be extremely damaging if those necessary controls on the scheme were lost because the applicants have offered to pay the tariff. That is touched on briefly in the statement. As I understand it, it will be possible for there to be payments in kind, although the Minister may wish to confirm that in his reply. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-17_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   The noble Baroness can describe what was originally planned as a tariff, but I repeat that what was originally planned by way of a tariff was a replacement for Section 106. I have repeatedly made that clear. What can be called the tariff, or now the planning charge, is an alternative to Section 106. Section 106 can still be used. I agree that the principle is exactly as it was, as a tariff. Earlier on I said that we want up-front charges so that people will know what the costs are, but the original plan in the Green Paper was that Section 106 would go and there would just be tariffs. That was abandoned for the purposes of the Bill and, because of the time that the Bill spent in <P>


<a name="column_501"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 501</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>another place and the discussions that we have had about infrastructure costs in the growth area, we have taken the opportunity to find an alternative. We have not found a replacement, but this provision provides the developers with a choice. That was the point that I was making earlier.
<P>

<a name="40202-17_para21"></a>I fully understand why the amendment has been tabled and I have a degree of sympathy with it. The intention is to make it clear that the planning authority or the Secretary of State may still refuse planning permission where the applicant has agreed to pay the charge because other matters are still outstanding. That is already covered by how the planning system operates at present, which I shall explain briefly.
<P>

<a name="40202-17_para22"></a>Local planning authorities and the Secretary of State, when deciding whether to grant planning permission, have to determine the application in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. The fact that the applicant has agreed to pay the planning charge would be a material consideration to take into account. But if the failure to agree a further matter that should also form part of the planning contribution means that the harm caused by the development will not be overcome, this would also be a material consideration and the local planning authority or the Secretary of State may decide that it is sufficient to justify refusing planning permission.
<P>

<a name="40202-17_para23"></a>The point I am about to make is sometimes ignored or not discussed. The policy on planning obligations makes it absolutely clear that planning permission should never be granted because of benefits offered by a developer. That is the position. All material considerations have to be taken into account. We want local authorities and developers to deal fully and properly with the impacts of development, so it would be quite improper to grant planning permission where issues requiring planning contributions had not been addressed, but we are content that the current and proposed legislation and policy are sufficient to ensure that that does not occur.
<P>

<a name="40202-17_para24"></a>As we have said, in some cases where a developer chooses to pay the charge, it may still be necessary to address some issues through negotiated agreements. We will not ask anyone to pay for the same thing twice; there is a caveat on that in the consultation that we put out. We are still considering how the boundary will be drawn in policy between those two types of planning contributions and we need to set that out in the draft circular that will be produced in the spring. We are quite clear that the developer should, first, not be asked to pay twice in relation to the same matter but, secondly, that a negotiation may be required over matters that could never be covered by the charge. I hope that is clear and that it assists, not so much today's debate, but planning for further stages of the Bill.

<FONT SIZE=3>development control and conditions on planning, a tariff system, if there is one, reflects both of those. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40202-18_para0"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-18_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham </B>   moved Amendment No. 119ZCZD:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> Page 34, line 36, leave out from first "document" to end. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-18_para1"></a><P>

<a name="40202-18_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: I have four amendments in this group, Amendment Nos. 119ZCZD, 119E, 119ZCA and 119ZCB. Clause 46(3) provides for regulations to require local planning authorities to include their policies on planning contributions in,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a development plan document (or in such other document as is prescribed)".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-18_para3"></a>
The procedure for preparing development documents, including individual rights of objection, a right for all objectors to be heard and independent examination, is in Part 2, which we discussed last time. Therefore the Committee can have a reasonable understanding of how that procedure will work.
<P>

<a name="40202-18_para4"></a>However, the Bill does not explain at all how the possible planning contributions documents will be created. Those policies will have a considerable effect on many people. Largely, they will determine how much is paid by landowners, developers and those who buy new houses or new developments. They will also affect the providers of public services such as schools and local residents who need to know that local services will be able to cope with major development.
<P>

<a name="40202-18_para5"></a>The amendments remove the ability to put the local authority policies in non-development documents. These are probing amendments, to see what procedures the Government will introduce for these other documents. Amendments Nos. 119ZCA and 119ZCB are designed to bring clarity to the circumstances in which a local authority will accept a planning contribution. Clause 46(3)(b) and (c) include reference to the circumstances in which the local planning authority will and will not "consider accepting" a planning contribution. My amendments would remove "consider accepting" and insert "accept". I beg to move.

<A NAME="40202-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   These amendments have been discussed once already in another place. They were explained as an attempt to clarify the Bill's provision. However, the amendments are unnecessary, and they probably result from a misunderstanding of the Bill's provisions. As the noble Baroness explained, Clause 46(3) sets out the ambit of the Secretary of State's regulation-making powers. It enables the regulations to require local planning authorities to set out in a development plan document the circumstances in which they are likely to consider that a planning contribution&#151;whether by way of negotiated agreement, or by the option of planning charge&#151;is appropriate and specifically state when a planning charge will not be accepted.
<P>


<a name="column_503"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 503</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-18_para6"></a>The regulation-making powers in Clause 47 set out the types of controls that can be placed on planning contributions sought by local planning authorities. Guidance will be issued on the types of matters that planning contributions should apply to and the circumstances in which it may be appropriate to seek a planning contribution. Detailed regulations and guidance are the more appropriate places to set out how the planning contributions scheme will operate. The regulations will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, so there will be full and ample opportunity for detailed scrutiny of those regulations at a later stage.
<P>

<a name="40202-18_para7"></a>The amendments would restrict the regulation-making powers, rather than the matters for which planning contributions can be sought. If the amendments were accepted, having set out the local planning contribution policy local authorities would be forced to accept a contribution in every circumstance contemplated by that policy, leaving the local authority little or no flexibility to make allowances for the viability of a particular development on a difficult site.
<P>

<a name="40202-18_para8"></a>That would be different from both the existing system and from our new proposals where it is, and would be, open to the local authority not to seek any planning contribution. We need to strike a balance, with flexibility and certainty. In working up our proposals, we have been concerned to ensure a degree of flexibility, while offering certainty and predictability. Clause 46(3)(a) strikes that balance. It enables local planning authorities to set out what they consider to be an appropriate charge for particular developments and for particular matters, but it does not bind them to seeking that level of charge from developers. It leaves them the option of charging less, or nothing, making a judgment about what is appropriate in each set of circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40202-18_para9"></a>The amendment would remove this degree of flexibility and require, perhaps even oblige, the local authority to seek the full contribution as set in advance. The clauses as they stand will protect developers and communities and provide them with that benefit. They might not have to pay a full charge, or any charge, in circumstances where the local authority believes that that is right, for example when it would affect the viability of a proposed development. If it undermines the potential for development, the charge will not be made. That is good news for local communities, because the flexibility will ensure that developments that can benefit the community are delivered.
<P>

<a name="40202-18_para10"></a>In the circumstances, I hope that the amendments will be withdrawn. We have got the balance of benefits between developers and communities about right. It will provide some local discretion and flexibility, and that is worth protecting.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-18_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I am glad to know that I am not alone&#151;that is encouraging. I have two questions for the Minister. Why are the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"or in such other document as prescribed"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-18_para11"></a>
in the Bill? We want something that is subject to the procedures, scrutiny and checks that are appropriate for a development plan document. The way I read the effect of the amendments on subsection 3(a) and (b) is that if, for example, I, as the developer, go to the local authority and say, "I would like to pay the planning contribution on this development, because this is the sort of development on which you have said it is appropriate", it has the option to reply, "No, we did not say that we will accept; we said that we will consider accepting it, and in your case we have considered and we have decided that we will not accept it".
<P>

<a name="40202-18_para12"></a>It makes the acceptance of the planning charge something that the local authority can decide whether to do, in each case, and therefore can, in every case, drop a developer into Section 106; in other words, it is the option of the planning authority whether to go down the Section 106 route.
<P>

<a name="40202-18_para13"></a>The latter is not the understanding that I have gained from the Minister as to the intention behind this provision. As I understand it, the intention is that in appropriate cases if a developer opts for paying the planning contribution, that is what happens. I do not read subsection 3(a) and (b) that way. The amendments proposed by my noble friend would cure that problem and make it clear that where a local authority has said that it will accept a planning contribution it is obligated to do so. I do not read it, and I cannot construe it, as the Minister did in his reply. I should be grateful for further clarification.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I said at the outset that I thought that the amendments were based on something of a misunderstanding. I make that point again. The noble Lord has given us his reading of the amendments and his reading of the clause. I am happy with what I have said and put on the record, but, as ever, I am willing to listen and learn. If there is something else there that we have not spotted, I will be more than happy to have another look at it.
<P>

<a name="40202-18_para14"></a>Equally, I suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, that they study carefully what we said. We have got the balance right; we are trying to create some flexibility. We do not want to straitjacket the local authority. Where it would be of greater community benefit not to "obligate" the authority to seek a planning charge, we want to provide that facility. The way in which the amendments are constructed may be unnecessarily restrictive in that regard. I hope that is a helpful observation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-18_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I do not wish to delay proceedings any further. I should be delighted if the Minister would write to me. There are still two things that I do not understand. First, where in this clause does it say that if this is a development for which a planning <P>


<a name="column_505"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 505</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contribution is appropriate&#151;it having been so set out in the required document&#151;and it is offered by a developer, the planning authority is obligated to accept it? I cannot find that in these provisions. It is possible that it will be in regulations, and that it is just something that I cannot see. Where does it say that the initiative rests with the developer to go down this route?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-18_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I think that the answer is that that will be in regulations. The local authority must ensure that it is clear about what its upfront charges will be.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040202/text/40202-19.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Absolutely. I understand that, and it must be up front about the circumstances in which it will accept these contributions. That will be in accordance with the regulations, which I am sure is the right place. However, I cannot see anything here that covers the situation. How will it be possible for a developer to say to the local authority, "Here's the planning charge", with the local authority being obliged to say, "Yes, thank you", rather than, "No we do not want it this time, thank you", which is how I construe subsection 3(a) and (b)?
<P>

<a name="40202-19_para0"></a>The second thing is that I have not had an answer to my questions about the first amendment in the group. I should be grateful for an understanding of it. I see no need to delay proceedings, and I would be happy to receive it in writing. The ultimate initiative rests with my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Obviously, I would be happy to write to the noble Lord. I think that the other question that I failed to answer was how the contributions document might be created. I do not have a response on that. I am sorry that I cannot provide one, but we will.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-19_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   The Minister's answer made me think that I had been talking to myself. As he did not reply to the thrust of the amendment, which related to what would be in the documents and how they would be produced, I look forward to a reply at a later stage.
<P>

<a name="40202-19_para1"></a>I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Lucas for his intervention. When the Minister clarifies the matter for him, he might also clarify it for me. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

Precisely how does the Minister envisage that local planning authorities will achieve the extraordinary task of setting planning contributions throughout their area in the absence of any actual proposals on which to base their funds? As land values vary significantly over a small area, into what size of unit must the authority divide its area in order to determine the different contribution values?
<P>

<a name="40202-19_para7"></a>My authority, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, could hardly set a similar planning contribution for a development, say, in Chelsea, and for a development in the farthest north of north Kensington. How many man-hours do the Government anticipate that it will take for the local authority to complete the exercise? Will not the type of development itself be a criterion that it would be useful for the local planning authority to know, in order to set the value of the contribution that must be made? That is where we become entangled and ensnared in the tariff system. I look forward to the Minister's reply. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   The established and time-honoured system for such things is for a Labour-controlled authority to set a zero contribution in areas that vote Conservative and vice versa.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I have an answer, but it probably will not satisfy the noble Baroness. The power in subsection (3)(d) is essential. It ensures that the local planning authority is required, when it sets out its policy on planning contributions, to set out the criteria by which the optional planning charge will be calculated. We do not have a fixed plan for that, but there could be a formula for it or a methodology related to the size or type of development. The methodology could relate to the size or type of development in particular parts of the authority's area. Either way, it must set out the criteria.
<P>

<a name="40202-19_para8"></a>I suspect that it will be complicated, but it has the big advantage, once it is set out with a pound sign hanging on the end of it, that the developers will have a choice. They will have a choice between knowing what the upfront charge will be or going down the negotiated route. That may make a difference to a developer's decision to proceed or not to proceed. Although I fully accept that the criteria may be made to look complicated&#151;I suspect that they would be, in time&#151;the developer will see a pound sign at the end of the criteria for a given development or planning application. That is the beauty of the system: the developer can say, "Right. That's the sum of money. We'll do it that way or the other way". It will be transparent and open, so it has that added advantage.
<P>

<a name="40202-19_para9"></a>I cannot give exact details of what the formula will be, but the Secretary of State will be able to set it out through regulations so that it is upfront and clear and has, of course, been debated by Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-19_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   The Minister's reply worries me terribly. It exemplifies where the problems will be. Local authorities will have to identify chunks of land <P>


<a name="column_507"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 507</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>all the way through their area that will have a specific value&#151;some will be more valuable than others; there will be land abutting green belt in some areas; there will be brownfield sites; there will be sites for industrial development; and there will be sites for affordable housing. There will be so many ramifications, if authorities have to identify every specific area and put a cost on it.
<P>

<a name="40202-19_para10"></a>How long will the costs and charges last? Will they be updated annually through the RPI? Will they stay static? What if the local authority also wants additional open spaces, schools and all of that? There will have to be schedules of information. We talk about resources, but that will consume most of the local planning authorities' resources.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-19_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Amendment No. 119ZDA was originally grouped with this amendment. Unfortunately, I have separated out my speaking notes, and I did not want to go down that road, as the two amendments are now separate on the list. However, I want to make one thing clear: the charging system and the criteria must be related to the impact of the development. It is not a means of capturing values and raising finance in a way that is unrelated to the impact of the development. It need not be as complicated as the noble Baroness says.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-19_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   What the Minister has said worries me. The Bill puts forward a scheme, the details of which have not been worked out. Is it sensible to legislate on that basis?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-19_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   A point that occurs to me is how we will ensure consistency between one local planning authority and another. I cannot see how, if all of them are free to develop their own formula or methodology, it will be possible to secure equality of treatment for developers as between, say, Kensington and Chelsea, on one hand, and Huddersfield, on the other. A national developer who has schemes in lots of different parts of the country will expect the fundamental algorithm that lies behind the process to be the same. That is what worries me about what the Minister said.
<P>

<a name="40202-19_para11"></a>The Minister offered two alternative formulations. He said that there could be a formula. When I speak of a formula, I think of it in mathematical terms as something that gets from a set of variables to a final result. One can write down the variables in the formula, and the functional relationship between those variables and the result creates the arithmetic. The Minister also said that, alternatively, there could be a methodology related to the size and type of development. In that case, we would simply consider two independent variables&#151;the size and type of development&#151;and they would be the only things taken into consideration. I am sure that the Minister used that only for the purposes of illustration, but, if he is going to put things in Hansard in that way, he ought to try to enumerate the whole set of variables <P>


<a name="column_508"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 508</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that would be taken into consideration, instead of giving people the impression that those are the only ones that matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-19_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   With respect, that is not a fair reflection of my comments. I talked about setting out the criteria by which the optional planning charge will be calculated, for example, by a formula or a methodology related to the size and type of development. I think that is a fair way of explaining what could happen at the moment. I agree with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, about a formula. Off the top of my head I can imagine&#151;and it is not written in front of me&#151;that the formula could relate to, for example, the floor area and the volume of a particular type of industrial or retail development. That is a formula with a sum of money at the end. The methodology related to the size and type of development could relate to the density of mixed developments or dwellings or similar issues.
<P>

<a name="40202-19_para12"></a>So those factors can be taken into account. After reading the Bill, which is dangerous for a Minister, I note that the opening of Clause 46 implies&#151;I can take advice if I am wrong&#151;that the regulations would apply to "a" local authority. The implication of the regulations is such that there will not be a catch-all for all authorities. The tenor of the drafting of the clause relates to "a" local planning authority. I am not saying that there will be 350 sets of regulations, but it is clear in my reading of the Bill that the regulations have to apply criteria to a local authority&#151;perhaps wrapped up with several other authorities listed in those regulations&#151;but the criteria cannot be the same all over the country, because that would negate local planning.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   I do not believe the Minister has understood the point made by several noble Lords. He refers all the time to the development. Obviously, the clause does not apply just to a development but to the areas adjacent to it. Even with a small district council the access to some of it can be much easier&#151;for example, the availability of a school. In an urban area there would have to be different requirements because it is not just the question of a particular development which the Minister is always talking about. Developments are never in one space: they have roads to them, schools, hospitals and everything else. Therefore, Section 106 negotiations now often take account of all those considerations relating to adjacent areas, not just the particular development. The Minister constantly said "a development".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I fully accept that using the best practice we have now under Section 106 will enable us to write the new guidance and best practice. For example, in some areas there is a generalised formula: such and such a number of new dwellings equals the need for a primary school&#151;I am aware of the figure but I shall not give it off the top of my head; such and such a number of new dwellings requires a secondary school which may or may not be on that development and can be used by it and requires access to it. I fully <P>


<a name="column_509"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 509</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>accept that point but it cannot be achieved out of thin air. There is already a wealth of evidence from good Section 106 practice which will help us to write the guidelines and the regulations.
<P>

<a name="40202-20_para0"></a>I have a note on the consistency point, which is not unimportant. The charging and obligation policies will have to be developed within the framework of central government policy and guidance using best practice. We have already mentioned that guidance will ensure consistency of policies, including methodologies and formulae. We need consistency on that, but I suspect that they do not have to be exactly the same in every authority. The guidance will build on existing best practice. It is not as though we have had no experience of the effect of planning obligations&#151;for example the requirement for health centres, education, access roads, bridges or whatever is a result of "x", "y" or "z" development, be it mixed, dwellings or industrial. We have experience of that around the country and will use that to write the guidance and be consistent across the policies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Best: </B>   I shall offer one or two thoughts that I would have shared with your Lordships in the clause stand part debate. I shall throw them into the pot now, because they relate to the practical problems of moving from the site by site negotiation of Section 106 agreements to pre-determined planning charges, contributions or tariffs. I echo a number of points made by noble Lords.
<P>

<a name="40202-20_para1"></a>My own housing association in York, the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust, has been engaged in a number of developments in recent years. I have discovered that the circumstances of each site are unique. One brownfield site was an old refuse tip leaking methane gas, where we had to undertake expensive decontamination work. One large greenfield site has huge pylons and power lines that need to be buried underground. Special measures will be needed on another site to protect against flooding. We may find the expensive consequences of discovering archaeological remains under one site, while there may be requirements to remove some protected species like the greater crested newt on another site. A development on one site could bring new viability to a school with falling numbers, but another development will have to be properly charged for the extra education costs flowing from the arrival of more children where there are no available school places.
<P>

<a name="40202-20_para2"></a>In one part of any town gentrification of a neighbourhood that needs renewal would suggest a low tariff to attract development. In another part, perhaps close by, a developer will be able to sell for high prices and the local authority will have the chance to go for a higher tariff. The scale of a development will make a major difference, as will its density. There are also variations in the subsidy arrangements for affordable housing which face the developer and any partner housing association. Those financial arrangements will also vary from site to site. In one case the Housing Corporation will be able to offer social housing grant worth several thousands of pounds per house so the housing association can pay <P>


<a name="column_510"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 510</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the developer something approaching the market price for each affordable home. But in another case no more funds may be available as grants from the Housing Corporation. If the development is to incorporate affordable housing, the developer will need to put in some serious money. In that case it is not realistic to expect as many affordable homes as could be supplied if plenty of public money was available.
<P>

<a name="40202-20_para3"></a>Each case is different and a negotiation, not a fixed charge or tariff, either in case or percentage terms, will be necessary to achieve outcomes that are acceptable to all. In York, the headline aspirational target of the council is for 50 per cent of affordable housing to meet its pressing needs. But it has to accept lower figures of half, or less than half, where the constraints on the developer make it impossible to achieve such a high quota. No fixed tariff could cover all those circumstances. If an authority goes down that route there could be long delays in trying to calculate the level of tariffs, as has been suggested. Once those levels are announced they are likely to lead to disagreements, appeals, calls for judicial reviews or further delays because one size may not fit more than one site.
<P>

<a name="40202-20_para4"></a>The Minister suggested that developers could simply reject the offer of the alternative system of tariffs and choose to stay with the current Section 106 negotiations&#151;thereby having nothing to do with the new system. But the developer will worry that once the local authority has set up its system of tariffs it will be under some pressure to accept them. They will fear that once the tariff system is set up, developers who reject it will find that all the current problems facing Section 106 agreements&#151;I shall argue later that there are many ways to improve them&#151;are not likely to be cured. Current delays include there being no skilled planners able to negotiate at a sophisticated level, a lack of co-ordination between relevant public bodies, and the lack of a mediator or arbitrator to help the processes. The problems facing Section 106 agreements may still be there and may be worse if the local authority chooses a system of tariffs instead&#151;and developers will feel under some pressure to accept them.
<P>

<a name="40202-20_para5"></a>I suggest that it is not likely that we would be able to find the ways in which tariffs could be applied to anything more than a single site at a time. If you have a tariff which you apply to only one site at a time, you do not have a tariff, you have a negotiation site by site. If we are to have a negotiation, let us improve the Section 106 agreements that do just that&#151;negotiate site by site. There is good mileage in that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-20_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I was going to ask this question on clause stand part but given the way this debate is going, perhaps I can ask it now. It is a short question. Why have the Government left in the repeals schedule the possibility of repealing Section 106 in view of the alternatives that are being described?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I entirely support what the noble Lord, Lord Best, has said, but surely under these circumstances a local authority will set a high tariff. There is no way that a local planning authority wants <P>


<a name="column_511"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 511</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to miss out on the planning contribution that it can get from the best sites in its area. Therefore, on all the lesser sites it will negotiate a lower tariff. It will go straight back into negotiation again.
<P>

<a name="40202-20_para6"></a>The idea in Clauses 46 to 48 is wonderful. It is done with the best of intentions but the closer you look, the more you can see that it does not work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   If it does not work, people will not use it. I know that that is a glib answer and is not satisfactory on the very important, practical points made by the noble Lord, Lord Best. I fully accept that all his examples need a proper answer. Given the way he put them, it is very difficult to see what the answer would be, so we are led down the negotiated route.
<P>

<a name="40202-20_para7"></a>On the concern expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, I do not know the precise answer. However, I said earlier this evening in relation to this issue that we are creating an alternative to Section 106, not a replacement, but it will require the wholesale rewriting of Section 106 in regulations. That is why I suspect that the point about the repeals schedule is there. But if that is not the case, I will find the noble Baroness a proper answer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-20_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I thank everybody for their contribution. I am sure that the Minister will read carefully what the noble Lord, Lord Best, said, in particular, because he has wide experience of having to deal with Section 106 and the pitfalls that we all recognise in trying to develop the criteria in the development plan documents for this new tariff system.
<P>

<a name="40202-20_para8"></a>Thanks to the Library, my extensive efforts, and being slightly late back, I now have the results of the consultation that the Minister published. It would have been enormously helpful had we had it before. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="column_512"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 512</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I beg to move that the order laid before the House on 11 December 2003 be annulled.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para1"></a>I do not think it will surprise the Minister to know that I have chosen to pray against these regulations. It was of great regret to me and, indeed, many other noble Lords, that when the Water Bill went through your Lordships' House last year, the Water Framework Directive was not included in it in some form; there was not even a reference to it. What we feared at the time&#151;that the regulations, although good in intention, left much to be desired&#151;has come to pass.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para2"></a>I would like to recap my views for the record, although the Minister is quite clear about them. The Water Framework Directive is a very good piece of European legislation. It is visionary and it has firm outcomes within a timescale. It recognises that water is a precious commodity. Indeed, it says that it is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a heritage which must be protected, defended and treated as such".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-21_para3"></a><P>

<a name="40202-21_para4"></a>The Water Framework Directive recognises that there is a big problem to be tackled, especially with point and diffuse pollution. It accepts that there must be a correlation between the clean-up and the pricing of water. There are also issues surrounding the sustainable use of water. Most European countries need to move a long way to improve aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and wetlands.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para5"></a>The Water Framework Directive recognises that it can succeed only with full public participation. Article 14 refers to the active involvement of all interested parties. This point is perhaps the most graphic illustration of how the transposition of this excellent directive into UK law by these regulations has been disappointing&#151;even minimalist. I shall come back to that point in a moment.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para6"></a>The Environment Agency is the competent authority chosen by the Government to undertake the implementation of the Water Framework Directive. On public involvement, perhaps the Environment Agency does not have enough experience of real public engagement. Does the Environment Agency have the capacity to undertake this work at the moment?
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para7"></a>In January, EnvironmentBusiness magazine contained an interview with Barbara Young&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, herself. It says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Young is forthright in stating that the Agency is 'very, very pressed on our environmental protection work, with more and more new duties coming from Europe'.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-21_para8"></a><P>

<a name="40202-21_para9"></a>She went on to say,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that means finding smarter ways to keep business in line. In other words, doing more with less.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-21_para10"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>'There are two issues&#151;have we got enough money and have we got enough staff', she says. 'Government agencies never have enough money'".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-21_para11"></a>
In the light of those comments, does the Minister think that the Environment Agency is now sufficiently funded and that it has sufficient capacity?
<P>


<a name="column_513"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 513</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para12"></a>How does the agency feel about the regulations? I quote from an agency document, written by an agency member of staff, stating that its view is that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in general, the regulations are acceptable but a significant number of issues still remain which need to be resolved".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-21_para13"></a>
The document was dated 12 January 2004, so the agency had seen the final form of the regulations.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para14"></a>The agency has particular concerns that the diffuse pollution powers needed to tackle diffuse pollution are simply not explicitly referred to in the regulations. It says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"These are critical to the implementation of the Directive".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-21_para15"></a><P>

<a name="40202-21_para16"></a>The next point refers to the powers of other relevant authorities. The document says,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"there is an important need to bind other relevant authorities (both public and private) into the process of River Basin Management planning"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-21_para17"></a>
the building block on which the Water Framework Directive exists.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para18"></a>I ask the Minister to comment particularly on this point:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Agency cannot be held accountable for the non-delivery of the Water Framework Directive requirements if other relevant authorities do not deliver on their responsibilities".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-21_para19"></a>
The regulations do not ask any other authorities directly to do anything.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para20"></a>There we have a quite a number of large worries. The Water Framework Directive considers persons to be consulted&#151;I remind the Minister that the European version refers to the active involvement of all interested parties. The UK regulations give a list of people needing to be consulted under Article 12.4. They are the usual suspects&#151;conservation bodies, water undertakers, fishery committees, harbour authorities&#151;everybody one would expect to be involved in the water environment, along with such other persons as "the Agency thinks fit". I suggest that everybody, whether be they communities, industrialists, farmers or landowners, needs to be fundamentally involved in how the framework will be implemented; otherwise, it simply will not work. By raising everyone's status in that way, the agency can tick the boxes&#151;there is restricted capacity, as I have mentioned&#151;and it will then be deemed to have involved the public. I cannot emphasise that point enough&#151;and it is that point that has impelled me to pray against the regulations this evening. The involvement of the public is critical to whether the regulations work.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para21"></a>It is ironic that the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill has just been discussed in your Lordships' House, because the implementation of the Water Framework Directive rests heavily on planning mechanisms. However, that Bill misses out any reference to the Water Framework Directive. The Government had a great chance to cross-reference the powers to which the Environment Agency referred and to bind local authorities into the Water Framework Directive. Local authorities, being such a fundamental part of the democratic process, would have been a good place to begin. I therefore suggest that the <P>


<a name="column_514"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 514</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government bring forward their own amendments to the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill in your Lordships' House to fill that glaringly obvious gap.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para22"></a>Regulation 2 lists the other Acts to which the Water Framework Directive might need to be cross-referenced. No reference is made to the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. I expect that the Minister can offer a reason, but perhaps it should be included.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para23"></a>As has been recognised by everybody, if transposed correctly, the Water Framework Directive offers cost-effective ways of delivering clean water and clean water environments without water bills having to rise enormously to achieve that. That is why the framework directive has such unexpectedly unanimous support from the water industry, consumer representatives and environmental organisations. The Government's support, however, was perceived by everybody to be a little late in coming. Ministers expressed a little more enthusiasm at the time of the issuing of the regulations. That lateness applies also to the nub of the issue; namely, the pricing of water.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para24"></a>We are in the middle of an Ofwat pricing round. That round is in full swing. Indeed, the Government should already have issued guidance on what Ofwat must allow for in the new pricing round. Where is that guidance? It was supposed to have been issued by the end of January. When will it be issued? It is impossible for any body to plan for the Water Framework Directive, particularly the water industry in this country, without knowing on what basis to proceed. Pricing is fundamental to that.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para25"></a>Of course, the characterisation to which the Water Framework Directive referred should have informed the pricing round, but now we are stuck with it being the other way round: the pricing round will happen and the characterisation process will take place afterwards. That is somewhat difficult.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para26"></a>The Government, however, appear to be stuck in the middle of a feud over the issue. No. 10 and Mr Blair, with an eye on the ballot box, have the short-term view that there must be a minimum rise in water bills, no matter what the long-term costs are. I am sure that the Minister, like me, read the article in the Observer on January 25 that stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Tony Blair is planning large cuts in Britain's pollution clean-up programme in a move that will invite a series of prosecutions of the Government in the European courts. The cuts will spare families a rise of only £2 over the next five years on the average £234 water bill".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-21_para27"></a>
I shall not read more from the article in the interests of time, but it goes on to make the point strongly that without some kind of recognition of the scale of work to be done in the current pricing round and of the scale of the environmental clean-up, the Water Framework Directive cannot even begin to be implemented. By 2015, the environmental investment will have a positive benefit for the country. During the passage of the Water Bill, the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, made it plain that industry could benefit from innovation; that the consumer could benefit from there being no need <P>


<a name="column_515"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 515</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to clean up water and from it being clean at the point of arrival. Those millions of pounds needed to clean up water will not be required.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para28"></a>I have another series of questions for the Minister. I realise that time is moving on. How are the river basin management plans to be integrated with other water conservation and management commitments? English Nature, the Government's own adviser, wonders how those plans will be integrated with the biodiversity action plans.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para29"></a>What is a significant water body? I believe that the regulations do not recognise it as being a stream. How then would the regulations work? Streams are a major source of diffuse pollution as they receive the run-off from agricultural land and they feed into rivers. Without addressing streams, we will have a problem.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para30"></a>I shall go through the regulations. Wales is perhaps lucky that its Assembly oversees Regulation 3. Like Scotland, it has a more holistic approach, whereas in England the Secretary of State has to bring all the other departments on board.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para31"></a>Who was consulted on what constitutes a river basin district? When did the consultation take place and was everybody happy? The drawing up of the districts was somewhat arbitrary.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para32"></a>If the Environment Agency must carry out a characterisation of each river basin district by December 2004, as specified by Regulation 5, how many of the optional characteristics from the Water Framework Directive list will be included? Will it be a minimal characterisation of only central features, leaving the amount of work to be allowed for as an unknown? I remind your Lordships that, also by December 2004, the Environment Agency must have assessed the impact of human activity on the area of water in every river basin district. That will be a tall order to meet by then. I again raise the question of the capacity of the Environment Agency to do so.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para33"></a>Regulation 8 refers to the register of protected areas. Does that include wetlands; and if not, why not? Environmental organisations are concerned that our regulations make no reference to wetlands, yet they are a vital part of our water system, not only because they mitigate droughts and floods, but also because they recharge groundwater. In the importance of their wildlife, they are unsurpassed. Wetlands are Britain's most significant wildlife habitats.
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para34"></a>The water industry would like to know what constitutes good water status. It is hard for it to move ahead with its plans without a clear definition. Who decides what it is? Is it the Secretary of State or the Environment Agency? If it is the latter, and it is unable to deliver the standard required, will it simply water down the definition of good status?
<P>

<a name="40202-21_para35"></a>Finally, I come back to the list of powers needed to implement the Water Framework Directive Regulations in the UK. I believe that they are lacking and that the Government will have to bring forward another set of regulations, which will make life very difficult for everybody. At this critical point we have a water pricing round that looks set to ignore a lot of the <P>

<A NAME="40202-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, like the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, I have some concerns about these regulations. However, I do not think that they are quite as deeply flawed as in the picture that she portrayed, although I agree that there are very significant questions about the adequacy of resourcing and the definition of what has to be done. I hope that if I ask some of these questions, the Minister will be able to respond to them. On balance, my preference is to see these regulations in place, rather than to have them held up on a technical disagreement, because we did not include them in a Bill, which we all argued should be done. I readily acknowledge that.
<P>

<a name="40202-22_para0"></a>One must consider the regulations. I start at Regulation 5. This requires the Environment Agency,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in accordance with Annex II . . . by 22nd December 2004 . . . [to] carry out an analysis of the characteristics of each river basin district and . . . conduct a review of the impact of human activity on the status of surface water and ground water in each river basin district".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-22_para1"></a>
The first, and obvious, question is whether the Environment Agency is equipped and funded to do that at the present time. I assume that it has not been doing this work in the past, but that may be incorrect. It may well be that this is subsumed into work that it already does. If that is so, then the additional employment burden would be commensurately less. If this is an additional burden, then it is one for a short period of time. Are the arrangements in place to enable qualified people to be taken on on a temporary basis to do this work? If so, for how long? That is an important issue and it goes to the heart of the noble Baroness's concerns.
<P>

<a name="40202-22_para2"></a>It is the agency that has to do this, not the water companies, which actually make use of the water. The agency must also carry out an economic analysis of water use in each river basin district by 22 December. I have an awful feeling that a piece of elastic ought to be attached to that date. It will be very difficult for the agency to attain it.
<P>

<a name="40202-22_para3"></a>In Regulation 7:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The agency must identify any bodies of water within each river basin district which . . . are used for the abstraction of water intended for human consumption and either . . . provide",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-22_para4"></a>
here we get into difficulties,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"more than 10 cubic metres of such water per day as an average".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-22_para5"></a>
When we were dealing with the Bill, the licensing quantity went down to a limit, I think, of 20 cubic metres per day, if my memory is correct.
<P>

<a name="40202-22_para6"></a>Of course, the agency and everybody else will have a record of all water abstraction at over 20 cubic metres per day. However, it will be another scale of <P>


<a name="column_517"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 517</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>development altogether if they have to take that figure down to those who might be abstracting 10 cubic metres per day and have to start recording all of those as well. The second qualification, all water that might,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"serve more than 50 persons",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-22_para7"></a>
could happen at less than 10 cubic metres per day. This will add yet another administrative burden to the Environment Agency and I wonder how it will do it. This increases the load over and above what was proposed in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40202-22_para8"></a>Over the page, in Regulation 9, I found I was getting into considerable difficulty and in the end I became completely lost. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain to me exactly what it means. It deals with what the agency must do. In the future:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Agency must . . . establish programmes for monitoring water status in order to establish a coherent and comprehensive overview of water status within each river basin district".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-22_para9"></a>
I wonder what that means, precisely. It goes on to say that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"programmes must cover . . . in relation to surface water . . . the volume and level or rate of flow to the extent relevant to ecological and chemical status and ecological potential".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-22_para10"></a>
What does that mean? It sounds wonderful but, as far as I can see, it is jargon. It goes on about,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the ecological and chemical status and ecological potential . . . in relation to groundwater, chemical and quantitative status".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-22_para11"></a>
Again, these are gloriously imprecise terms. The monitoring programmes must be operational by 22 December, but 2006 this time. There is a little bit more time on that one.
<P>

<a name="40202-22_para12"></a>It goes on&#151;and this is where I became completely lost:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the relevant monitoring provisions of the Directive referred to . . . are set out in the following provisions of Annex V to the Directive".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-22_para13"></a>
So I turned to the directive to see what it says. What it says is:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Quality elements for the classification of ecological status . . . rivers . . . lakes . . . transitional waters . . . coastal waters",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-22_para14"></a>
and so on. That is all right, just about. But:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Normative definitions of ecological status classifications".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-22_para15"></a>
This is where we are getting into things. A little bit later, we get:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Definitions for high, good and moderate ecological status in rivers".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-22_para16"></a>
We all know what a well-poisoned river is. We probably know what a good quality river is, but it starts to split them into high, good and moderate ecological status and does not even consider poor ecological status. Fortunately the number of poor rivers in the country has diminished, but there are still one or two. I have concerns about that. I am trying to relate this order to the requirements of the directive. It goes on:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The relevant monitoring provisions of the Directive . . . are set out in the following provisions of Annex V to the Directive . . . points 1.3 to 1.3.6".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-22_para17"></a><P>

<a name="40202-22_para18"></a>Points 1.3 to 1.3.6 say this:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Monitoring of ecological status and chemical status for surface waters . . . design of surveillance monitoring . . . design of operational monitoring . . . design of investigative monitoring . . . <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_518"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 518</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>frequency of monitoring . . . additional monitoring requirements for protected areas . . . standards for monitoring of quality elements".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-22_para19"></a><P>

<a name="40202-22_para20"></a>There are no standards there at all. Nobody knows, as a result of reading the directive, what anybody has to work to. We can set our national standards deeply differently from national standards set in every other country in Europe. The whole exercise is in danger of becoming completely meaningless, if that is the case. It goes on with all the other points; the directive continues in this gloriously open way, defining nothing.
<P>

<a name="40202-22_para21"></a>The job is left to the Government. Maybe that was what was intended. But the problem is that the Government in the order refer back to the directive, which tells us nothing. There is a dilemma and I would like the Minister to tell me how it is to be resolved.
<P>

<a name="40202-22_para22"></a>I turn to the other matter to which I wish to refer. When I looked at the list of persons and organisations to be consulted, I was amazed in a completely different way from the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. I have never seen such a long list of consultees in legislation or an order. I was not quite so concerned as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, as the list of consultees on the river basin plans includes all the planning authorities, all the local authorities and so on and so forth. The opportunity exists for everyone to be aware of what is going on. However, I am not sure what is going on. That is my concern. If the Minister can put my mind at rest by his response I shall be immensely grateful to him. At the moment the co-ordination between the order and the regulations seems to me to be inadequate, but the reason for that, of course, is that the directive is inadequate in its definitions.

<A NAME="40202-22_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  My Lords, I suppose that I am grateful for the interventions of the noble Baroness and the noble Lord. They asked rather a lot of questions that I hope to be able to answer in part. I had better deal with the nature of the regulations that are before the House. As the noble Baroness explained, we had lengthy debates during the course of the Water Bill on whether the whole of the Water Framework Directive, which was widely welcomed during the Committee and Report stages of the Bill, should be included on the face of a piece of primary legislation. We had some considerable arguments on whether the normal method of transposing European regulations under the European Communities Act was appropriate in this instance or whether the measure should be included in primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="40202-22_para23"></a>The noble Baroness takes a different view from me on the matter. She now seems to take a slightly different view from me on the value of the Water Framework Directive itself. Although the noble Lord started out by saying that the Water Framework Directive was welcomed all round, he ended up by saying that it was deeply deficient in many respects. One of the problems is that although the regulations <P>


<a name="column_519"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 519</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>implement those parts of the Water Framework Directive that we are obliged to implement, other parts of it, on which further regulations and guidelines will be issued, come into effect at much later stages. That was one of the reasons&#151;apart from the basic general approach to European legislation&#151;why it would not have been appropriate to provide those measures in a Water Bill which dealt primarily with the economic regulation of water.
<P>

<a name="40202-22_para24"></a>The question of environmental and quality regulation is getting mixed up to a degree with that of economic regulation. Clearly, there are areas of overlap in relation to the pricing round which I shall discuss later, but the discussion this evening indicates the wisdom of the Government's original determination that this issue should not be dealt with in primary legislation but should be approached through the more flexible method of transposition under the European Communities Act. That in no way diminishes the effect of the Water Framework Directive. It certainly in no way diminishes the degree of involvement and public participation in that process. Indeed, it probably enhances it. The degree of public involvement in the consultation prior to the publication of the regulations was substantial. That will be the case regarding further regulations and guidelines that will be needed later.
<P>

<a name="40202-22_para25"></a>For the first time we have a directive that integrates a large number of aspects of water regulation and the whole spectrum of inland and coastal waters, the management of river basins, the linkages between surface and ground water regulation and water quantity and water quality objectives. Those matters were all taken into account. I believe this is the first time that all of that is pooled together, as the directive achieves. Many different complicated aspects are involved. The noble Lord and the noble Baroness were right to question whether the Environment Agency and government as a whole have the ability and the resources to manage the issues. Every government agency always wants more money at any given time but the Environment Agency has increased its funding from £620 million in the year ending in 2000 to over £800 million in the financial year which is coming to an end. Much of that is for water management purposes of various kinds. The direct grant from the Government&#151;

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. Can he be a little more explicit on the matter of funding? He said that the funding had increased from some £600 million in 2000 to £800 million at the end of this financial year and that much of the money is allocated for water management purposes. The problem is that the end of this financial year is 31 March. We do not know what the provision is for next year. The question I want to ask, which it may not be entirely possible for the Minister to answer, is whether the provision that ends in the current financial year is sufficient for, or, indeed, could have taken account of, the potential additional costs that arise from the order.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the increase in the Government's allocation to the Environment Agency, as distinct from its other forms of income, indeed takes account of the increased duties as there is an agreed process between the Government and the agency whereby that happens. The resources for 2004&#150;05 to which the noble Lord referred are partly covered by the previous settlement. The agency will be adequately resourced; the agency's corporate plan makes that clear. I think that we are reasonably clear about what will happen in 2004&#150;05, but the allocation in 2005&#150;06 onwards will necessarily form part of the coming spending round. However, that spending round will obviously have to take into account the very substantial additional pressures on the Environment Agency in this and other fields.
<P>

<a name="40202-23_para0"></a>As regards whether new work is implied in the regulations, about 40 people are already working full time in the Environment Agency on these areas. They come within the resources allocated for the past financial year. Additional staff do not need to be taken on board to deal with those matters. Resources clearly do not present a serious problem; but the next spending round will have to take that forward into the coming years.
<P>

<a name="40202-23_para1"></a>As far as public involvement is concerned, there was a pretty widespread double consultation in relation to the Water Framework Directive, and the directive itself is very insistent on stakeholder involvement. We have established a Water Framework Directive stakeholder group for England specifically. There are a number of other bodies which feed into that. We have been through the whole of this consultation on the Water Framework Directive and involved as wide a range of stakeholders as we can. As far as the consultation in the regulations is concerned&#151;based on Article 12&#151;various regulations are not exclusive. They do not exclude other bodies; they lay down which bodies must be consulted, and there will be other regulations that also specify that other bodies, as the agency sees fit, must also be consulted. Likewise as far as the role of the Secretary of State or the National Assembly is concerned, there are other bodies which need to be consulted. Both in terms of resources and involvement, these regulations are quite robust.
<P>

<a name="40202-23_para2"></a>A number of quite specific questions arose during the discussion; some of which I may not be able to answer to the full satisfaction of noble Lords. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, asked what good status is, who decides it and how we know. The directive sets a process by which good status is established; river basin areas and others are assessed against that. The work is taken through the common implementation strategy and carried through by the Environment Agency. The statement that we made on these regulations in December indicates that the classification regulations will be brought forward by the end of 2006. There is therefore some clear timescale to build that up in more detail.
<P>

<a name="40202-23_para3"></a>As far as monitoring of those standards is concerned, the technical details are set out in Annex 5.
<P>


<a name="column_521"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 521</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-23_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister goes on to the point of good status, perhaps I may ask him again&#151;perhaps I did not hear him clearly&#151;who sets the good status. If it is the Environment Agency and the whole thing does not seem to be working, and status is not becoming good as quickly as possible, are they not going to be tempted to lower the standard at which good status can be said to exist?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I thought I had understood the noble Baroness on that. I do not think that is an imputation as to how the Environment Agency operates. If the Environment Agency sets standards in this and a whole range of other fields, it expects those standards to be followed. It does not then adjust the standards because the industry has failed to meet them; rather the opposite. I am sure that will be the case in relation to the Environment Agency itself; but it requires the Environment Agency continuously to monitor them. That is why, before the noble Baroness stood up, I was about to refer to the details in Annex 5 to the directive, which requires the technical details and monitoring to be carried out. There is already guidance on the way in which that monitoring will be carried out. Therefore the Environment Agency will be well aware if there is some serious shortfall in those standards. Noble Lords can be satisfied that the Environment Agency will operate in its normal way.
<P>

<a name="40202-23_para4"></a>Other issues were raised that will also take slightly longer to answer in detail than is available to me tonight. The noble Baroness asked about diffuse controls. The directive requires programmes and measures targeted at the needs of each district, which include diffuse controls, by 2009. Clearly we need another very substantial round of consultations in the development of those powers.
<P>

<a name="40202-23_para5"></a>The noble Baroness also asked whether the Water Framework Directive is linked sufficiently to other provisions, especially the Town and Country Planning Acts. Local authorities must be fully engaged in river basin management plans, and, as with land-use plans, these regulations require such plans to be taken into account. The Water Framework Directive will need to be adjusted in the light of some of these other plans, and if it shows that the river basin development planning process has a requirement for new land-use plans or other planning measures, then Regulation 3 requires those new controls to be developed.
<P>

<a name="40202-23_para6"></a>The noble Baroness also asked how river basin management plans will be integrated with other nature conservation plans. In this area the Environment Agency has discretion to produce supplementary plans&#151;that is under Regulation 17&#151;and therefore has the opportunity to make links between the WFD-generated plans and other policy areas on conservation, biodiversity, flood defence and so on. There is a linkage there as well.
<P>

<a name="40202-23_para7"></a>There is also the question of who will be consulted on the river basin districts. The noble Baroness asked whether they were all happy. We are not clear that everyone is happy, but both our predecessor department and our current department carried out <P>


<a name="column_522"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 522</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>three different rounds of consultation on the designation of districts. The end of the first consultation set out the initial proposals that were consulted on, and the final proposals will reflect the feedback that we received on those. Therefore, it is not as though we are suddenly springing a list of districts and river basins on all those who will be involved in managing them.
<P>

<a name="40202-23_para8"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, also asked whether the river basin planning process engaged other authorities in delivering the plans set out by the Environment Agency. The Secretary of State has overall responsibility for ensuring that the objectives are met and, under Regulations 19 and 20, the Secretary of State has significant new powers to ensure that the other authorities participate in the delivery of the plans' objectives.
<P>

<a name="40202-23_para9"></a>Concern was also expressed about wetlands. The noble Baroness mentioned this point as, I believe, did the noble Lord. I was asked whether wetlands are covered by the references to protected areas and so forth. Some wetlands will be protected areas if they are designated as such under other Community legislation. Generally, the Water Framework Directive will benefit the environment in wetlands because it contains sufficient provision relating to the quality and quantity of groundwater and the risk of significant damage. The regulations include obligations to take action if there is such a risk. Therefore, wetlands are protected under both the directive and the regulations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-23_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may press the Minister a little further on that point. Why do the UK regulations make no specific reference whatever to wetlands? They seem to be specifically excluded.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, they benefit from the regulations which cover all protected areas and they benefit from the controls which are introduced more generally. Therefore, I do not believe that wetlands are in any sense excluded from the effects of the regulations. The directive specifically contains wetlands-related powers and responsibilities, and we use the general powers in order to protect the wetlands.
<P>

<a name="40202-23_para10"></a>I was also asked whether the definition of a "significant water body" excluded streams and, thus, significant quantities of water going to rivers. The regulations precisely replicate the directive in this respect and there is no exclusion of streams. Where the directive requires the inclusion of streams, so do the regulations. Therefore, we have not diluted&#151;if that is the word to use in this context; I was trying to avoid water puns&#151;the intention of the directive here.
<P>

<a name="40202-23_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, asked about the register of protected areas&#151;that is, wetlands and others. That register is separate from the register of abstractors, and therefore the threshold is not related to the threshold for abstraction because we are dealing with protected areas in this respect.
<P>

<a name="40202-23_para12"></a>I believe that I have touched on many of the specific issues raised in connection with areas of protection and environmental controls. No doubt the noble <P>


<a name="column_523"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 523</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Baroness and the noble Lord will find ones that I have not completely answered. However, both also raised the issue of water pricing in the current price round. The noble Baroness asked when the final guidance will be produced. It should be available within the next few weeks, and it will indicate which policies are to be costed by water companies and included in water prices and which are not.
<P>

<a name="40202-23_para13"></a>Clearly, in the whole approach to water pricing in the long term, the Government are very concerned about the quality and availability of water. They are striving to continue the improvements that we have seen to date both through regulation&#151;that is, tackling the issue at source in terms of threats to water quality and availability&#151;and through the way in which we approach the water pricing system. Reports in the newspapers that we shall not take that into account and shall relent to pressure for improvements in the water system are erroneous. Timescale issues are involved here. Clearly one must recognise that both the underlying improvements in relation to water and the effects of the directive will have some effect on prices for consumers both in the short and the long term. We will take account of the current pricing round. In the longer term it is important that we recognise the importance of, and work with, Ofwat and with the Environment Agency to ensure that the total package reflects the need for investment in improvements in the water system.
<P>

<a name="40202-23_para14"></a>I believe that the complexity of some of the issues raised and the fact that different parts of the directive come into play at different periods, and have their impact both on water quality, and by whom and how things are regulated and on the pricing system, make this a particularly complicated form of regulation. But the beauty and benefit of the Water Framework Directive is that it brought together a large number of different aspects of water policy and gave a strategic approach to the way in which the national member states and their regulators are to operate to 2015. Some of the implications are not immediately reflected in the regulations before us. However, those which are before us reflect the requirements of the directive, fit in with the Government's policy as enunciated during the passage of the Water Bill and the agreement on the Water Framework Directive. They have been consulted on very widely. There is provision for adequate resources for the Environment Agency to enforce those regulations. There is very substantial further consultation with all parties envisaged in the process for further regulation and for the guidelines required under the directive.
<P>

<a name="40202-23_para15"></a>I therefore hope that the noble Baroness does not oppose the adoption of these regulations because I believe that they provide a very sound basis for our future strategy on water policy and regulation both to the benefit of consumers and the industry itself.

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 524</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the beginning of the debate. I would like to clarify one point. I was not in any way impugning the Environment Agency in suggesting that it might choose to lower standards. I recognise that it has a herculean task. Given the fact that it may have a lack of power, resources and a lack of help from the pricing round, I wondered whether lower standards would be forced on the agency as a matter of necessity.
<P>

<a name="40202-24_para0"></a>I look forward to seeing the regulations come into operation with some anxiety and to the result of the pricing round. I hope over the next year or two that the Government, as they consider the impact of the pricing round and the Water Framework Directive, decide to grasp the nettle of water affordability so that pricing rounds in future will not be such an issue and those who cannot pay will be properly recognised through the appropriate mechanism.

"( ) A local planning authority shall, in considering the matters referred to in subsection (3), have regard to the regional spatial strategy for the region or if the local planning authority is a London borough, the spatial development strategy and any supplementary guidance published by the Mayor of London." 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40202-24_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: We are still on Clause 46, but dealing with a slightly different issue. The amendment provides that a local authority shall have regard to the regional spatial strategy, or the spatial development strategy and supplementary guidance if the authority is in London, in considering matters that we debated at length under Clause 46(3).
<P>

<a name="40202-24_para9"></a>The Mayor of London has raised the matter with the Minister for Planning. I have said that I do not pretend, or wish, to speak for the Mayor of London, but the issue he has raised should be aired. I understand that the points he makes are supported by the South East England Regional Assembly&#151;SEERA. He is concerned that neither the consultation paper on planning obligations nor the new clauses reflect or refer to the regional planning context.
<P>

<a name="40202-24_para10"></a>The Government are focusing on the need for regional approaches to housing and planning. We have spent time on the draft PPS11 and the same <P>


<a name="column_525"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 525</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>applies to the proposed revisions to PPG3 on housing and the London housing strategy. It does not seem to fit with these approaches to give local authorities discretion to set their own tariff regime&#151;perhaps I should use that term in the widest, almost non-technical sense&#151;and to determine the use to which receipts are put with no regard for either the regional spatial or housing strategies.
<P>

<a name="40202-24_para11"></a>I do not argue with the Mayor's concern that the maximum community benefit is secured by, or perhaps from, high-value developments, while at the same time supporting rather than deterring development. The Mayor of London expresses concern about the risks to affordable housing numbers, which is something other noble Lords have touched on. The Mayor says there are major risks that London boroughs will not focus tariff receipts on affordable housing.
<P>

<a name="40202-24_para12"></a>Many noble Lords will have come up against the dilemma that boroughs do not necessarily sign up to a regional approach when they are faced with some of the detail. I talk about boroughs, although the point of the amendment is wider. I am sure I am not the only member of the Committee who has, for instance, seen boroughs arguing and agreeing that there should be averages for the percentage of affordable housing in new developments, without any borough apparently volunteering to go above what they say should be the average in order to allow for lower percentages to be compensated. The issue is relevant to other needs, particularly transport infrastructure which will often affect more than one borough.
<P>

<a name="40202-24_para13"></a>The Mayor of London also makes the point that developers are seeking a clear and consistent basis. In London, 33 different tariff regimes at different stages of the approval and review process will not meet that objective; that is, 32 boroughs plus the City of London. The mayor is concerned that there is a real danger that some boroughs might want to deter development rather than encourage it and will set their tariffs at an unacceptably high level.
<P>

<a name="40202-24_para14"></a>I slightly part company from the Mayor in that a top-down approach is implicit in this. I am sure what he really means to say is that there should be negotiation between the two levels to arrive at the correct answer. However, I sympathise with and support his concern that London as a whole should not suffer and in some ways needs to be treated as a whole.
<P>

<a name="40202-24_para15"></a>I inquired of the Mayor's office what response there had been from the Minister for Planning to these representations. I understand that the Mayor was told that the statement on planning obligation would give the necessary reassurances. It does not seem to me to do so. However, I accept that I may have missed something rather subtle. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40202-24_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I intervene to remind the Minister of an earlier debate we had in which there was concern about the relationship of the boroughs to the regional spatial strategy. The argument was that the regional spatial strategy for London was beyond what <P>


<a name="column_526"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 526</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was required. In her comments, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, takes us even further beyond what is required. I add that caveat.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   The answer is very simple. First, we believe that the amendment is unnecessary. Planning obligation policies will be included in local development documents. The Bill already states that local development documents must be in general conformity with the regional spatial strategy or, in the case of London, the spatial development strategy. So it is already the case that local planning authorities must have regard to regional policies in regional spatial strategies or the spatial development strategy. Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-24_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   The point did not come from me in the first instance. The Mayor's planning officers have expressed considerable concern over this matter. It is right that they should look at what the Minister has to say. It will not take them long to read that. I thank the Minister for that very clear answer. I hope that it satisfies them. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40202-24_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 119ZDA would prevent the planning contribution proposals being used as a land tax or a development land tax; that is, a tax on increases in value from the grant of planning permission. As it stands, the Bill seems to be capable of either use. We know the temptation for Labour governments to introduce a form of betterment levy or development land tax. Each Labour government have introduced one and every succeeding Conservative government have had to repeal it.
<P>

<a name="40202-24_para19"></a>Such taxes on development simply discourage useful development. But the Bill goes further than these general political objections. If Parliament is to allow taxation by taking a percentage of the increase in land values from the grant of planning permission, then it should do so explicitly, setting rates with a proper and accountable procedure. It should not use this scanty provision to do so. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-24_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   We are not going to do so, and it is not a scanty provision. I referred to the amendment earlier as it was originally linked in my speaking notes to another amendment.
<P>

<a name="40202-24_para20"></a>As the noble Baroness said, Amendment No. 119ZDA seeks to ensure that planning contributions are not made with reference to value uplift brought about by planning permission. As we made clear in our recent statement, the Government do not see value capture as a primary function of planning contributions. The main focus should be on addressing <P>


<a name="column_527"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>the impact of a development with a degree of flexibility to take account of its viability and of economic circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40202-24_para21"></a>We certainly do not want to see planning contributions used explicitly as a means of raising extra revenue unconnected with the development, so we have some sympathy with the amendment. It fits our concerns about inappropriate revenue raising through planning contributions. We still have some way to go in formulating our policy on planning contributions&#151;that is fairly self-evident from our previous debates&#151;and we want to give careful consideration to the principles we will set out on how the charge is calculated. However, we do not think it is right to set this down in primary legislation. I have made the point about regulations, but I hope I have been explicit enough in response to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, for her not to press the amendment.

"( ) A relevant requirement may include an obligation entered into without the consent of the local planning authority."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40202-25_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment retains existing provisions that allow developers to enter into an obligation without the consent of the local planning authority and for that to count as a relevant requirement. Developers may need to make contributions by requirements to address other issues. The Government appear to indicate that these will be agreements with the local planning authority.
<P>

<a name="40202-25_para3"></a>However, the present system allows developers to enter into unilateral obligations to which the local authority has not agreed. This is particularly important in planning appeals, where the authority will not&#151;probably understandably&#151;be prepared to sign an agreement. It is important that the ability to make unilateral obligations tailored to a particular scheme is retained. I beg to move.

In this case, my brief states that the purpose of the amendment is unclear, followed by either/or. I have speaking notes for each possibility, but the noble Baroness has been kind in making it absolutely clear that the amendment is aimed at retaining unilateral undertakings.

"( ) Provided the planning authority have complied with all the regulations relating to planning contributions, the Secretary of State may not cause a plan to be rejected or revised on the grounds that the authority have set the charge at too low a level."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40202-25_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment is designed to prevent an intervention by the Secretary of State after much work has been carried out at local level to reach a consensus on the level of planning contribution. As the Bill stands the Secretary of State has significant power to amend a plan. It would be a great shame and an insult to local democracy if the Secretary of State were able to revise or reject a plan on the grounds that the authority had set the charge at too low, or for that matter, too high a level.
<P>

<a name="40202-25_para8"></a>While intervention because the charge was too high would be equally bad, this is unlikely to occur because no developer would have come forward in those circumstances. Much effort at a local level will go into setting the charge. As I understand, it will be subject to community involvement and negotiation with developers. It will no doubt be a lengthy process and undergone at great cost to the local authority in resources and man hours. The Secretary of State should not be able to take matters into his own hands if the authority has complied with all regulations relating to planning contributions. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I fully understand why the amendment is there, but, as in one or two other areas of the Bill, it is necessary for the Secretary of State to reserve some powers. It is definitely the function of local planning authorities to determine the appropriate level of charges for their area in relation to the impact of development there. The Government do not wish to intervene in that process; we would do so only sparingly and as a last resort. We believe that it would be acceptable in certain circumstances for the Secretary of State to be able to intervene.
<P>

<a name="40202-25_para9"></a>If a planning charge were too low&#151;in a way that sounds subjective&#151;it could mean that the local authority had not properly considered the possible impacts of the development&#151;mistakes can happen&#151;or had disregarded them in setting out the policy in the first place. So it must be reasonable for the Secretary of State to have a power to require the local authority to change such a policy which is detrimental. The point is that the Government need to look out for the interests of local communities and ensure that sustainable patterns of development are delivered. I hope that local planning authorities will agree with that.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-25_para10"></a>In some cases, if the assessment of the impacts has been inadequate and the charge will clearly not cover the cost of the impacts, it may be appropriate for the Secretary of State to intervene. Without such intervention one could end up with a local authority granting planning permission for a whole range of various developments, leading to a lower quality of life for its community because it had not taken account of the impacts of the development. I repeat that, as with all the powers of intervention, it should be used sparingly as a last resort, after the local authority had had the error of its ways pointed out to it. One has to be factual. If the Secretary of State was thought to be abusing his powers and being unreasonable, one could go to my learned friends in the courts. However, that would be an issue of last resort, and not what we would expect to be a normal operation, although we feel that it needs to be there just in case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-25_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I am trying to imagine a scenario in which the Secretary of State would be involved and I am trying to imagine who would appeal to the Secretary of State because there would have to be an appeal about the charge. Presumably it has been negotiated against all these wonderful tariffs about which we spoke two or three amendments ago, and against the criteria that have been laid out so that the developers know exactly what they are signing up to. That is the power of this tariff system. If the charge were set at a level that was too low&#151;that would have been agreed against the criteria&#151;at what stage does the Secretary of State intervene? Does he intervene on the basis of the criteria, that we shall end up with a dog's breakfast, with far too little return for any planning obligation? Or will someone appeal to him, such as a residents' association, saying, "Look what the local authority has done; it has not even bothered to go by its own tariffs"? Or will a developer say, "Look, they have not taken enough money off me; they could have taken loads more"? It would be helpful if the Minister could set the scenario.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-25_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Without taking advice, I believe I know exactly what would happen. On the basis of such developments, the Government Offices of the Regions, who are our watchdogs in the areas, monitor planning applications and matters such as the density directive. Therefore, I suspect that through the Government Offices of the Regions there would be a call to arms that a piece of advice or a phone call has not worked, and therefore the Secretary of State needs to be informed about it. The noble Baroness is right that they would be able to levy that only if they have had regulations approved by the Secretary of State or the Secretary of State has produced regulations, as we debated earlier, setting out all the criteria. It is difficult to imagine precise circumstances, but they are considered remotely conceivable by the drafters of the Bill. I think the answer would be the Government Offices of the Regions&#151;they are the eyes and ears of the Government&#151;because Whitehall does not always know best.

Significant resources and man hours will have to go into setting up this new scheme. Will the Government provide local planning authorities with additional funding for the purpose of establishing the tariff system? Our amendment would make it clear in the Bill that where additional costs are incurred by local authorities in preparing these regulations, the Secretary of State shall fully reimburse them. The alternative is to further burden authorities, which are already stretched to breaking point. They would certainly not thank the Government for demanding that they use scarce planning officers and valuable resources to set up this system, without providing any additional funding.

<P>
<A NAME="40202-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   The effects of this wonderful policy are so great that there will not be lots of new burdens. In fact, local authorities will gain a lot from being released from certain aspects of red tape. We recognise the concern that people might see it as a burden on authorities, but there may be savings as well as costs. We also have a mechanism for dealing with substantially increased burdens on local authorities. I can assure the House that it is the case that where policy initiatives come from other departments, or there is discussion, and this point comes up about new burdens on local authorities, we constantly say to our colleagues elsewhere in the Government, "You cannot do this, you must pay for it". I say to people, "Look, I have to got to go to the House of Lords and face Lord Hanningfield, the leader of a key local authority, who will also tell me that there are new burdens". We have a mechanism for dealing with this.
<P>

<a name="40202-26_para0"></a>The new system, once it has bedded in, is likely to lead to less time and resource input in individual applications, particularly if people go down the charging tariff route. Once all the guidance is done, once the regulations are done, if it is a formula, it will be a case of fairly mechanical up-front calculation, and there ought to be less time spent on it.
<P>

<a name="40202-26_para1"></a>I remind the Committee that in this spending round the Government have made £350 million extra&#151;new money&#151;available to local authorities over three years. We are about to enter the second year of the three years. I do not know whether the decisions have been announced yet&#151;I have lost track&#151;but the first year was only £50 million to £60 million. The greater expenditure will come in years two and three. This is designed to put extra resources into local planning <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>authorities to support them in the reform programme. We are also reviewing planning fees to see whether they are adequate.
<P>

<a name="40202-26_para2"></a>There are some savings here, and a lot of new government resources are going directly into planning. The planning delivery grant is only paid out as a result of improvement in planning performance. When it is paid out, it is not ring fenced, and local authorities can use it for whatever they wish, because they will have already achieved the performance standard. If there is a new burden, I genuinely believe that we have the mechanism for taking care of it. In this case, the policy is so wonderful that there will be savings.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-26_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   The Minister can make himself believe anything. I do not agree with that response. The Minister listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Best, so he should understand that this is not something that is capable of being resolved equally easily by someone licking a pen and adding up a formula. It will be far more complicated than that. Whatever happens&#151;whether people continue to go for Section 106, or they go for this new tariff&#151;it is inevitable that there will be negotiation. People must be experienced in dealing with that, and those people are more expensive than those who are not able to deal with these areas.

<A NAME="40202-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cobbold: </B>   The arguments in favour of retaining and improving the existing Section 106 agreements and for rejecting this clause have been well rehearsed in our discussions. Some of the major problems associated with the new proposals were ably expressed by my noble friend Lord Best in an excellent speech. My concerns with the new proposals, which were outlined earlier, have been largely met. The Minister has confirmed that local authorities cannot impose planning contributions on developers. In paragraph 12 of the statement, which we were given the opportunity of reading in the short break, I have found a satisfactory answer to some of my other concerns. First:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is not the Government's intention, in reviewing planning obligations policy, to simply enable local authorities to raise extra revenue".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-26_para5"></a>
That is an important point.
<P>

<a name="40202-26_para6"></a>Secondly, it says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government's objective . . . is . . . not to enlarge the scope of planning obligations beyond current practice".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-26_para7"></a>
Therefore, they propose to stick within the broad line of the Section 106 arrangements. Thirdly, it says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a new policy would make clear that development proposals which are acceptable in planning terms should not be rendered unviable by the introduction of extraneous requirements unrelated to planning".

<a name="column_532"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 532</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
That deals with another problem. Finally, it says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the planning contribution offered, by whichever route, should be related to the impact of development and be relevant, proportionate and reasonable".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-26_para9"></a>
Those words are significant to the debate.
<P>

<a name="40202-26_para10"></a>In paragraph 24, there is another comment that, I thought, best summed up our deliberations and surprised me somewhat:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is also wrong to infer from the introduction of legislation that decisions on how to use that legislation have already been taken. They have not".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I also had the opportunity to read the document during the hour that we had for dinner. It seems to me that the Government's decision to shorten the period of consultation to nine weeks was not justified by the outcome of the consultation.
<P>

<a name="40202-26_para12"></a>In paragraph 5 of the document, the Government say that they consider that it was,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"better to supply Parliament with an output from that consultation as soon as possible, and whilst the Bill is still under consideration, than to have the consultation still going on as they consider it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-26_para13"></a>
As the Minister said, it made no difference to the amendments to the clause that we have been discussing. If we had not had the document&#151;we very nearly did not&#151;the outcome of those discussions would have been the same. In paragraph 25, the Government say that they will undertake,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"further . . . consultation. In the light of the consultation which has recently finished, and the conclusions of the Barker Review of housing supply, the Government will publish draft Regulations and a draft policy to replace Circular 1/97".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-26_para14"></a>
Was there any point in shortening the statutory consultation period from 12 weeks to nine weeks for the sake of producing such an inadequate document at this stage?
<P>

<a name="40202-26_para15"></a>The Government say that there will be an opportunity to comment on the draft regulations and draft policy that will replace circular 1/97 before the policy is finalised. It would have been useful to have that all in one bite, instead of having a partial document now, which is not much use to the Committee in its consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Best: </B>   I suggest that Clause 46 should not be in the Bill, partly because of the practical difficulties that we discussed and partly because of the dangers that, I fear, it poses to the provision of affordable housing, despite the Government's good intentions.
<P>

<a name="40202-26_para16"></a>It is certainly true that the current arrangements for Section 106 agreements are not working too well. A major research project by the universities of Cambridge and Sheffield, led by Professors Christine Whitehead and Tony Crook, showed that negotiations over the agreements lacked clarity, varied in effectiveness between authorities and suffered from shortages of planners with the skills to negotiate sophisticated deals with developers. I declare my interest in the research, which was largely funded by <P>

<P>

<a name="40202-26_para17"></a>The defects in the current system of negotiation are not so awful that they cannot be remedied. We should be careful about inventing alternatives before trying out ways of improving the present system. The good news from our research was that the use of negotiated Section 106 agreements had meant that housing associations had obtained 12,000 to 15,000 affordable homes each year on sites being developed by private house builders. In earlier times, house builders would only have built homes for sale on the land that they secured. A housing association would have produced segregated social housing and, perhaps, some shared ownership housing on whatever land was left for it to buy.
<P>

<a name="40202-26_para18"></a>That separation of house builders and housing associations led to stigmatised rented estates for poorer households on the worst sites&#151;between the gas works and the motorway, or on an unpopular council estate. That further marginalised those people on low incomes. The deals now being negotiated between developers and planners are enabling housing associations to secure homes on decent sites and to provide rented homes or low-cost home ownership in mixed communities, which raise, rather than diminish, the life chances of those households.
<P>

<a name="40202-26_para19"></a>Overall, the present system is benign and beginning to be accepted by all parties. As our research project concluded, Section 106 agreements have,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"changed the geography of new social housing"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-26_para20"></a>
to good effect. The Minister can properly suggest that the Bill includes many safeguards. Today's statement from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister covers some of those issues. It explains that a revised planning policy guidance note PPG3 will make clear that a financial contribution in lieu of affordable housing will be acceptable only in limited circumstances; for example, where the cash raised might be sufficient to produce a better development solution elsewhere. But my concerns are not just about the planning contribution, the tariff, being payable in cash rather than in kind. I accept that the intention is not to raise revenue for spending on unrelated purposes or even, usually, to subsidise social housing built on a separate site.
<P>

<a name="40202-26_para21"></a>There are more subtle dangers from that opening of a Pandora's Box, including intense pressures on politicians to minimise the amount of affordable housing built in anyone's back yard. I know from the work of the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust that people can feel real hatred for proposals to build what they believe, in the words of one of the anonymous poison-pen letters sent to my home, to be,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"squalid little houses for the poor";
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-26_para22"></a>
whereas in reality we are planning a mixed-income community to extremely high standards. The City of York will not succumb to such pressures. But in some places the chances to take the alternative, more electorally popular, benefits from a developer could be <P>


<a name="column_534"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 534</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>seized upon. Those people living beside a planned development will always have a shopping list of alternatives to affordable housing which tariff funds could cover&#151;local amenities and facilities, improvements to the roads around the site, environmental enhancements and so on.
<P>

<a name="40202-26_para23"></a>Perhaps pressures and temptations will be resisted and just as much affordable housing as now will result. But why risk any reduction when, as Kate Barker's interim report for the Chancellor suggests, we need a step change in output of affordable homes of at least 31,000 extra homes, just to keep pace with rising household numbers?
<P>

<a name="40202-26_para24"></a>I believe that Section 106 agreements can be redeemed. I refer your Lordships to the suggestions by the ODPM Select Committee and others for ways of making the current system work better. Obstructive practices could be outlawed and timetables set for Section 106 agreements to be negotiated. Systems could be put in place for arbitration and mediation to break deadlocks and see fair play for all parties. The planning improvement grant, mentioned by the Minister, to up the game for planners, should produce better skilled people, able to negotiate those deals. This week the Joseph Rowntree Foundation is publishing advice for house builders and housing associations on ways they can work better together using standard documents and clearer procedures for partnerships.
<P>

<a name="40202-26_para25"></a>Rather than risk the consequences of an untried scheme that could mean less affordable housing, or housing on the worst sites that are away from the mix and community balance of tenures and incomes that we all strive to create, it would seem preferable to test out the various opportunities to improve existing negotiated Section 106 agreements, as the ODPM Select Committee and others have suggested.

<P>

<a name="40202-27_para0"></a>The Minister will have the sense that not many noble Lords feel comfortable with planning tariffs. It is not really helped by the Deputy Prime Minister saying in paragraph 21 that the Government's

<a name="40202-27_para1"></a>
The Government's new policy on planning obligations is presumably part of the Bill. Therefore, one hopes, before we get anywhere near the publication of PPG3, the policy will have been made clear and defined in the course of further debate on the clause.

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 535</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Third Reading before we reach that stage. This whole question has highlighted the considerable reservations among everybody in the Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-27_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I also support the proposition that Clause 46 should not stand part of the Bill and the other propositions grouped with it.
<P>

<a name="40202-27_para3"></a>We have had quite a long discussion about this. The noble Lord, Lord Best, with his great expertise, put the case for concern about the provision of affordable housing very well. We are left with one or two questions which we will need to explore further and to which we need rather better answers. The Minister was fairly glib when he was tackled on how local authority planning departments would deal with this. Most of the people who replied to the consultation think this will be a problem. There will be a need for greater expertise, particularly on valuations. We know that planning departments are heavily pressed at the moment. I noticed at the weekend that my local authority, Berwick-upon-Tweed, cannot fill a senior planning post. It has upgraded the person who is currently in post and is desperately trying to get someone to fill it.
<P>

<a name="40202-27_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Best, touched on this issue. What worries me is that we do not know how this will work out. There have been no pilots, to the best of my knowledge. Perhaps the Government have done some role-play training and have some idea of what work will be involved&#151;I do not know. But it seems that much of this is supposition and the wish that it will go right when many people can see the problems that might ensue.
<P>

<a name="40202-27_para5"></a>I am still terribly concerned about housing. How will local authorities deal with windfall sites&#151;the large proportion of developments in urban areas&#151;and take into account development which is unknown when preparing their local development framework? It has become clear that in some cases we will still need Section 106 agreements&#151;we will still need that expertise. My noble friend Lady Hamwee asked about the repeal of Section 106. I hope the Minister will look further at that because we are still very worried about it.
<P>

<a name="40202-27_para6"></a>Reading the statement that came out on Friday on the results of the consultation, I find it even more confusing. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, referred to planning policy guidance on housing and how that will fit in. What worries me is how social landlords will procure money for development under this complicated process, especially where two processes may run side by side.
<P>

<a name="40202-27_para7"></a>We opened the debate this afternoon from these Benches with the proposition that we look at Section 106. As the noble Lord, Lord Best, said, it took time for people to get used to that. A lot of good work has been done. The section is by no means perfect, but at least people know what they are dealing with. There is a great deal to be said for looking at improving that. Although the Government did not follow them through, many respondees to the consultation had <P>


<a name="column_536"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 536</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proposals for improving the operation of the current regime. However, the Government have stated that they will launch another consultation and pass the suggestions to a consultant who will be employed to draft the best-practice guide.
<P>

<a name="40202-27_para8"></a>We have made a good case for improving Section 106. The consultation has showed that a lot of people are in favour of that. I know that we will return to it at a later stage, but I hope that we can persuade the Government to think again on the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   It appears to me that far too few in the development industry were brought up on AA Milne or they would have remembered "always keep a hold of nurse for fear of finding something worse". Indeed, they have on this occasion. Having put the Government to a great deal of trouble to develop an alternative to Section 106, they now wish that they had Section 106 back and did not have this new, uncertain beast in front of them.
<P>

<a name="40202-27_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has been extremely helpful today. I have learnt a lot and will doubtlessly learn more from Hansard. I wonder if I may ask him for one extra bit of help. Between now and Report, I would really like to speak with some of the consultees who have already supported the new arrangements, so that I can understand, particularly if they are developers, what advantage they see in it. I feel that I have missed in the people with whom I have spoken that side of the argument. I presume that the replies are public documents and that it should therefore be possible to acquire names and addresses in whatever way suits the Minister. I should be enormously grateful for that opportunity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-27_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I have one short question that follows on from the point of my noble friend. Have the Government worked through any examples of how formulae might operate? If they have, and feel they are fit to be shared, it would educate us all well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I have a more immediate question. Given the state of unpreparedness and the Minister's comments on how the beginning of Clause 46 has been drafted, and given the uncertainties and difficulties, can we hope that the idea might be piloted to see how it works before it is rolled out in a large way? I support the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, on the abolition of Section 106. It was frightening to find that in the Bill when we had been told that Section 106 would be twin-tracked and would not be lost.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-27_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   In this area, I have probably offered the House poorer responses than for any Bill I have put before it. I feel guilty about that. On the other hand, I do have some solutions. First, we are only in Committee, so time is on my side.
<P>

<a name="40202-27_para10"></a>In 18 years in opposition, we had about four days' training. That was in about 1995&#150;96. We had a couple of days at Templeton College. The course did not quite instruct us how to be Ministers, but how to be better <P>


<a name="column_537"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 537</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>than bad Ministers. Of all the lessons I learnt, and I have forgotten some of them seven years later, one stands out: if you are going to make a big change, pilot it if you can. That warning came from former Permanent Secretaries, former Ministers, from the private sector and&#151;dare I say it?&#151;from consultants too. "Pilot it if you can". That is always worth doing. We have done that as a government. An enormous number of policy initiatives since 1997 have been piloted. I do not know about this, but we have certainly had discussions about it as regards parts of other legislation at ODPM. I shall take back that suggestion.
<P>

<a name="40202-27_para11"></a>As to the other point, the two speeches given tonight by the noble Lord, Lord Best, were as disturbing as they were practical. That is a compliment, by the way; it is not intended as a criticism. I shall not, at any time in the future, be put in the position where all this is going down the plug hole and somebody observes that, on a dark winter's night at 9.20 p.m. in an empty House of Lords, the Government were warned about this and did not do anything. I am not going to be put in that position.
<P>

<a name="40202-27_para12"></a>I need to keep the clauses in the Bill and I would rather we did not have a vote on clause stand part. Therefore, I shall suggest to my colleague, the planning Minister, Mr Keith Hill, and to the Deputy Prime Minister, that the researchers to whom the noble Lord, Lord Best, referred, be contacted by the department, if they have not already been contacted. For Report, I want a precise answer to every one of the concerns that have been raised here tonight, particularly on affordable housing. I have some glib answers, but I shall not use them. They are not, to be honest, substantive to the issues that have been raised. It is absolutely crucial that that be done before we reach the Report stage. In so far as the consultees are concerned, all the consultations are public. I think there is a caveat if one does not want one's name and address given, but, generally speaking, if there is the slightest difficulty in making contact, we will correct it.
<P>

<a name="40202-27_para13"></a>This is a highly sensitive, controversial part of the Bill but it need not be a problem. There are solutions. To help the Committee, we could suggest that between now and Report the Minister creates an incident, if you like, in one of the committees rooms where some of the consultees from both sides could talk to noble Lords. This is not technical to the Bill, but technical to the policy of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40202-27_para14"></a>The Bill is not prescriptive: much can be done by regulations in these clauses. It is therefore important that as much information as possible is available to Peers. It is absolutely clear that the Government have had warnings of a highly practical nature tonight about these clauses. A noble Lord mentioned Kate Barker's review, which will be finalised by the Budget, and which calls for a substantial increase in affordable housing. It is absolutely right that we do not want to lose anything by changing.
<P>

<a name="40202-27_para15"></a>One of the other points we were told during those four days&#151;I had it typed up at some time&#151;was that big problems do not always need solutions, but <P>


<a name="column_538"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 538</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Ministers love big Bills. In other words, where there is a problem one does not have to look for a huge telephone directory to solve it if there are other ways of doing it. But it is the first thing Ministers go for. It is almost an ego trip to have a big Bill. That has never been my view. I think that we should have a year free of Bills and have a look at what the effects of the previous Bills have been. Part of the system is barmy, but that is not the issue here tonight.
<P>

<a name="40202-27_para16"></a>One of the points that was raised is one that I want to answer. I did a kind of clause stand part when I introduced the original amendments, before the adjournment. That is the issue&#151;I am sorry, I forget who raised it, I think it was more than one Peer&#151;of the reference to the final version of the revised PPG3. The Government expect that the final version of the updated PPG3 and the new policy on planning obligations will be issued simultaneously. This is in the statement that has come to the House today. The question&#151;it was the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham&#151;was whether this is in the Bill. The answer is, no. We shall finalise the policy in consultation with the stakeholders. By "policy", the Government mean the replacement for Circular 197, which will be issued in draft for full consultation. So, as we implied in the statement, there is much more consultation to take place.
<P>

<a name="40202-27_para17"></a>However, frankly, there must be a bit of consultation with me before I get "kebabbed" on Report. We need some answers. I take what has been said on these clauses extremely seriously. I shall ask my colleagues to consider seriously what has been said, to find solutions that do not have unintended consequences and to give serious consideration to the suggestions that have been made by the noble Lord, Lord Best, and in particular by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas.
<P>

<a name="40202-27_para18"></a>That is probably the best reply that I have given tonight; the rest have all been quite inadequate for which I apologise. I shall do better on Report.

<a name="40202-28_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: I believe that this matter has probably been covered by the Minister today. However, I shall ask him about it again just to make sure that my understanding is correct. If you have paid a planning contribution, there may be many things which you need the local planning authority to do. You may need access roads to the relevant site or flood defences. You may require local schools to be built before you can move families on to a site. There may be a lot of things that you think you are paying for with <P>


<a name="column_539"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 539</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that money. So how do you specify what you have bought with your planning contribution? How do you know what you will get and, indeed, when you have got it, how do you control the timing and specification of it? It is part of the operation of Clauses 46 to 48 that I do not understand. I should be grateful for some enlightenment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-28_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I have tabled Amendments Nos. 119C and 119D that follow on more or less from Amendment No. 119A in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas.
<P>

<a name="40202-28_para4"></a>Amendment No. 119C was tabled in the other place and I hope that it will receive a favourable reaction from the Minister today. It prevents the local authority altering the planning once planning permission has been granted and remains in force, and any condition relating to planning contribution has been agreed with the applicant. Effectively, once an applicant's agreement has been given, the local authority cannot then adjust that upwards. The Government surely cannot condone a situation where a developer had got planning permission and agreed the tariff with the local authority, that tariff was still in force, and it was then altered by periodic revision. It is important that once a sum is agreed, it is binding on both parties.
<P>

<a name="40202-28_para5"></a>Amendment No. 119D probes the Government on what they expect to be the relative sums attached to a Section 106 payment and a tariff set by the local authority. This is the type of detail that it would be easy for the Government to say must be left up to the authority in question, but I think it is important that we have some indication at this stage. Does the Minister anticipate that the tariff will be more than indicated in Section 106 because of the time and resources that a developer will save by not entering into negotiations&#151;except that we have all agreed that they will have to enter into negotiations&#151;and because the process will, at least in theory, be quicker? However, I am not sure that it will be quicker. The purpose of the amendment is to probe the question whether, if there was an adjustment to the planning application following the tariff having been negotiated, the original negotiations should be binding unless a major change had taken place. Further, will there be any relativity between Section 106 and the tariff?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-28_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   It did not occur to me until I saw Amendment No. 119C to wonder what happens when there is a fairly long gap between setting an amount and its payment. Do the Government anticipate that regulation will allow for some kind of inflation linking; or are local authorities and developers expected to be able to see well into the future regarding how much an amount agreed in year X will be worth in year Y?

Forgive me for the length&#151;it is important given the issues that have been raised.
<P>


<a name="column_540"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 540</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-28_para6"></a>I will deal with the amendments in order. Amendment No. 119A seeks to control the exercise by the local planning authority of its powers under the planning contribution provision, by ensuring the planning authority cannot require more benefits where a contribution is already paid. There is a concern here, but the Government think the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="40202-28_para7"></a>The existing provisions provide that the Secretary of State may by regulation determine the circumstances in which a planning contribution may be sought, and therefore by extension the circumstances in which a contribution may not be sought. This might include circumstances in which there was a danger of other statutory powers to charge being duplicated through a planning contribution. The Government do not want this duplication to occur, nor do we want duplication cases where some planning matters are dealt with by a charge and some by negotiation. These issues will be considered when we prepare the regulations; indeed, we will consult on this very point.
<P>

<a name="40202-28_para8"></a>The planning contributions are not intended to cover all possible costs relating to a new development. They are intended to cover planning matters. There may be non-planning matters raised by a development proposal from which it would not be appropriate to preclude other charges.
<P>

<a name="40202-28_para9"></a>Amendment No. 119C is unnecessary but we are sympathetic to the principle of seeking to ensure that the size of a charge does not increase once it has been agreed between a developer and a local authority. That is obviously in the context of a planning permission. One of the main objectives of the reform is to improve predictability for the developer about the scale and type of contributions&#151;that is, as an alternative to the long-drawn-out Section 106 provisions, which have taken many years in some cases. We will also want to ensure that developers have the benefit of certainty when they agree to a planning contribution with an authority. So once they have gone through and they have agreed, they can make their decision to proceed or not.
<P>

<a name="40202-28_para10"></a>The Government envisage that the local planning authority will be bound not to increase the charge under an agreement made with the developer at the point of planning permission. No developer will opt to pay the new charge unless it can be sure about that in the first place. They will not sign up to a charge if they think it can be varied. We believe that this should remain the case for as long as the permission remains in force. I cannot be clearer than that on the important issue of it being ratcheted up over a period.
<P>

<a name="40202-28_para11"></a>Benefits provided through a planning contribution, whether through the optional charge or negotiation, will be material considerations in decisions on whether to grant planning permission, just as benefits offered in planning obligations are at present. Once a planning permission is granted, the local authority cannot prevent the developer implementing permission if the contribution has been met. We cannot see any circumstances in which it would be reasonable to revise charges upwards other than where agreed by the <P>


<a name="column_541"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 541</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>developer at the point of planning permission, in the same way that occurs now through the existing negotiated system. It is down to the agreement by the developer at the point of planning permission.
<P>

<a name="40202-28_para12"></a>The other point that needs mentioning is about the reference to the Secretary of State in the amendment. We do not envisage the Secretary of State intervening at all in the case of individual planning contributions, since these are matters basically between local authorities and developers. In any event, after planning permission has been granted the Secretary of State would have no locus to reopen a legal agreement properly arrived at. I hope that puts that one to bed.
<P>

<a name="40202-28_para13"></a>The Government think Amendment No. 119D is unworkable and unnecessary, but we certainly sympathise with those colleagues who tabled it. The proposals in the amendment seek to ensure that the charge is not set at an excessively high level which extends beyond meeting the impact of the development and which would be prohibitive to developers. That is a view that the Government share and I believe I made that clear during debate on previous amendments.
<P>

<a name="40202-28_para14"></a>There are difficulties with the amendment. First, we do not believe that it would work in practice. It would set a limit on the charge compared with negotiated agreements. However, almost by definition, the outcome of a negotiation is uncertain. Therefore, it would be impossible to say what the cap on the charge should be in any particular case. The negotiated alternative would be hypothetical.
<P>

<a name="40202-28_para15"></a>As mentioned, the aim of the amendment is presumably to prevent the charge being ratcheted up beyond what is warranted by the circumstances of the development and what is fair and reasonable to the developer. I hope that the statement that we issued gives reassurances on this matter, and I shall repeat it for that purpose. It is not the Government's intention that the charge should be used to extract more benefit than is necessary to make the development anticipated by the local plan acceptable in planning terms. Local planning authorities will be required to set out their policy on how the charge will be calculated and therefore developers should know, before deciding whether to opt to pay the charge, how much it will be. Therefore, the charge is, indeed, optional. It is not a question of abandoning one system and imposing another. It is an optional way forward.
<P>

<a name="40202-28_para16"></a>I could say more on this subject but I believe that I have covered the main points raised. I hope that that has been useful for those who will be thinking about this matter and advising colleagues on Report.

When we discussed my amendments two or three groups further back concerning the Secretary of State being able to intervene if a charge was set at a level to which someone, such as the regional officer, drew his attention, it was clear from the Minister's reply that the Secretary of State would have the right to do that. However, from the Minister's response just now, I understood that the Secretary of <P>


<a name="column_542"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 542</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>State would not be able to intervene in what was a binding agreement. Are these different parts of the same story or are they two different stories?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I am working on the assumption that both are correct. Once a planning permission has been granted, the Secretary of State will have no locus to reopen a legal agreement properly arrived at. That sentence may hang on the words "properly arrived at". If it has not been properly arrived at&#151;that is, if the policy, guidelines and regulations have not been followed&#151;it will be possible to do that.
<P>

<a name="40202-29_para0"></a>On the other hand, returning to the answer that I gave in debate on the earlier amendment when I referred to the Government Offices for the Regions, I envisage that the Secretary of State would be alerted before the planning permission had been given. The Government Offices for the Regions would know about planning applications being submitted for big developments. I have discovered that they know far more than I had realised. Therefore, I believe that both are correct and the one does not contradict the other. However, as I said, I believe that the answer to the second part may hang on the words "properly arrived at".
<P>

<a name="40202-29_para1"></a>A note which has just arrived will tell me whether or not I am right. In relation to our previous discussion, obviously the Secretary of State cannot intervene once planning permission has been given. The right of intervention at that point relates to the development plan document policy and not to the individual agreements. Perhaps I did not make that clear. In other words, the Government Offices for the Regions would know about the development plan policy but not as it related to an individual agreement about a particular planning permission.
<P>

<a name="40202-29_para2"></a>However, that is not to say that we do not monitor planning permissions. We monitor matters such as the density directive and so on. There is also the question of how we know in Whitehall whether to call in one of the thousands of applications that exist. One reason that the Government Offices for the Regions were set up by the previous Conservative government, for which we are extremely grateful, is that they act as our eyes and ears in the region. Therefore, there is no contradiction between the two answers that I have given.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I am very grateful for that answer. I missed any reference to the abolition of Section 106. Perhaps it is already in Hansard and I have simply forgotten. However, if the Minister wanted to add anything, I should be very grateful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   No, I do not. I will get it wrong now. I have nothing to add to what I said previously in answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, who asked me why there was a reference to the matter in repeals. Nobody has contradicted what I said so I have to assume that the answer is correct.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-29_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, withdraws his amendment, my concern is that <P>


<a name="column_543"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 543</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>while I understood that several sections might be repealed in the future&#151;apparently, that can happen sequentially; it does not all have to happen on the same day&#151;that raises the issue that the system's life in parallel may be limited. That adds to some of the confusion and worry which is present at the moment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-29_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Perhaps I may reply to that. I reaffirm what I said about the abolition of Section 106. It will be repealed but reconstituted in regulations. That is what I said in the original debate earlier. In other words, we are rewriting Section 106 and learning from the best practice. It will be put into regulations while at the same time giving an optional alternative approach, not a replacement. I know that it sounds like a contradiction when I say that we are not replacing Section 106 but we are going to abolish it. We are abolishing it in one form only to put it back in regulations. As I have said repeatedly, anyone who wants to continue a negotiated way of planning obligations by the Section 106 route will be able to do so. That route is not being abandoned for any developer who wishes to use it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-29_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I am very grateful for that. If the noble Lord can produce for me a short letter saying where in the Bill the powers reside to do that&#151;that is, which particular clauses will be used to reproduce Section 106&#151;I shall be very grateful. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40202-29_para3"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-29_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Lucas </B>   moved Amendment No. 119B:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 35, line 28, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-29_para4"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"( ) Provision may be made requiring a local planning authority to provide promptly all the infrastructure for which they are responsible in respect of a development on which a planning contribution has been made. 
<br>
( ) Provision may be made requiring a local planning authority to consult the community affected by any development for which a planning contribution is to be paid as to the purposes for which that planning contribution shall be deployed."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40202-29_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: For some strange reason this amendment contains two entirely unrelated subsections. The first is merely to try to tease out how, if one paid a planning contribution which is meant to cover some kind of physical work, one is able to ensure that the work is done. Let us say that, as a major developer, one has given the delightful local authority £5 million or £10 million up front and part of it is supposed to pay for the access road, the new school or whatever it is, and it does not appear. What mechanisms are there, when one has a number of unsaleble houses because there is no road to them, to make sure that the money expended is put to good use?
<P>

<a name="40202-29_para6"></a>The second part of the amendment is much more serious. At the root of Section 106 there is the concept that the local community is suffering some pain from the development and a diminution of facilities, such as green space, which it used to enjoy and that its roads will become more crowded. Some of the benefit should appear locally. That is implicit in the way in which <P>


<a name="column_544"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 544</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Section 106 and the surrounding regulations are worded. Although it is often honoured in the breach, that is there at least as a principle. If Section 106 were better organised, perhaps we would see more of that.
<P>

<a name="40202-29_para7"></a>But the new arrangements seem to lose that entirely. One can pay a planning contribution and it can be used 50 miles away on the other side of the planning authority and none of the benefit is seen locally. I believe that that is a retrograde step, particularly in a Bill which is introducing an entirely desirable increased degree of community consultation.
<P>

<a name="40202-29_para8"></a>If something major is happening in a community, that community ought to see benefit from it and be able to know that some of the planning contribution is going to finish up in their immediate locality doing things which the community will enjoy as a quid pro quo for putting up for the several years of disruption which a major development entails. Perhaps it is there in the Bill, but I do not see it. I shall be grateful if the Minister can point out how it is all going to work. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-29_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am sympathetic to both paragraphs in the amendment. Simply put, this is not the right way to get there. We understand what the noble Lord is getting at. It is best that the matters in both paragraphs are dealt with in regulations, where the detail can be set out more fully. We intend that local authorities must say in their plans how they will spend the cash contributions. We intend that they should indicate the timescale within which that spending is likely to occur. Local authorities that claim to be sensibly planning the future of their areas should be doing this as a matter of course.
<P>

<a name="40202-29_para9"></a>The realism of that timescale can be tested as part of the plan-making process. The Bill requires that local authorities may only spend contributions on matters identified in planning obligation policies.
<P>

<a name="40202-29_para10"></a>We understand why the noble Lord wants the second limb of the amendment. It is better that the consultative framework is developed in regulations. In any event, the local planning authority should be required to consult the community in the same way it does in other policy areas. The Bill enables the Secretary of State to make regulations to require that local authorities spend contributions only on matters identified in planning obligations policies. Therefore, they will have to consult on those. Local authorities are already required to consult affected parties on individual applications under the General Development Procedure Order 1995.
<P>

<a name="40202-29_para11"></a>As part of the planning application process, local authorities and developers can develop planning measures implemented through a planning obligation that meets the concerns of the local community. Those measures should be consistent with the development plan. These procedures ensure local authorities devote contributions to the planning needs of local communities and not to extraneous non-planning matters. They will also ensure that developers can plan ahead for these contributions.
<P>


<a name="column_545"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 545</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-29_para12"></a>Consultation with local communities on the use of planning obligations should occur at the plan and the application stage, and not just at application. That means there will be a longer timeframe for the consultation so that details can be ironed out and problems sorted out. There will be wide consultation when drawing up the planning contribution policy. I hope that reassures the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="40202-29_para13"></a>From my local government experience, where there were Section 106 agreements as a product of major applications, we tried to develop good practice in making it clear at the outset where that money would go and why. We also worked with local communities to ensure that was what they wanted. There was a sensible way of making sure we delivered. I see that as good practice and I hope other local authorities have similar good practice. We want to see that sort of arrangement put in place. However, the noble Lord makes good points in both limbs of the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I am sure the Minister is right that this does not belong on the face of the Bill. I will read carefully what he has said. He said exactly what I feel, that is, that Section 106 agreements have evolved so that these things are dealt with well. There is community involvement and the benefit spread among the community. The agreements are negotiated individually, at the time, when the developer is interested in involving the local community and bringing them on-side in order to get planning permission.
<P>


<a name="column_546"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column 546</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-30_para0"></a>We are now faced with an untried, and in many ways unformed, procedure that potentially presents considerable dangers in people's minds. That is because when a developer has not entered a detailed agreement with a local authority, but just paid a sum of money, it is not clear how there is to be a detailed obligation, such as building an access road.
<P>

<a name="40202-30_para1"></a>If the developer has simply paid a sum of money, but not had a detailed involvement with the local planning authority and the local community, it is not clear how the local community will feel that it has been properly consulted and properly dealt with in spreading around the planning benefit.
<P>

<a name="40202-30_para2"></a>As the noble Lord said, Section 106 works very well. If the new arrangements are to work well these benefits need to be transferred. It is not at all clear how the basic nature of the mechanism will allow that to happen. Those are some of the concerns which lie at the root of the way that developers, or at least those with whom I have spoken, feel about the clause as drafted. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40202-30_para6"></a>Clause 6 [Establishment and conduct of reviews]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-30_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley </B>   moved Amendment No. 40:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 4, line 20, leave out "aged 16 or over" and insert "adult or child"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-30_para7"></a><P>

<a name="40202-30_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: As it states in the Bill on page 4 line 25, the main objective of the domestic homicide reviews is to learn lessons so that warning signs can be recognised and preventive measures taken. However, the clause misses an opportunity for a more joined-up approach to domestic violence, family homicide and suicide.
<P>

<a name="40202-30_para9"></a>I say that for three reasons. First, in many cases both the adults&#151;usually the mother&#151;and children are killed by the same family member within a very short period of time. Secondly, this is often linked to the subsequent suicide of the perpetrator. Statistics on this, unfortunately, are not recorded but the number of cases where such deaths occur are frequently publicised in the media. Only last weekend there was a very sad case in East Anglia where that may have been the situation in the deaths of a mother, a father and one of their children. Thirdly, child deaths are not always investigated through social services Part 8 reviews if there has been no history of child protection concerns. The impact or context of domestic violence is not scrutinised routinely within Part 8 reviews, so it could be that valuable lessons are being lost.
<P>

<a name="40202-30_para10"></a>Child abuse is often hidden, particularly in middle-class families. Unless the provision of the new clause is widened, some children will continue to slip through the net because there has been no previous involvement with social services&#151;and, therefore, no obvious child protection concerns&#151;even though domestic violence and child abuse has been occurring.
<P>

<a name="40202-30_para11"></a>There is also a need to examine the role of the coroner's courts and their failure to address domestic violence as a contributory or causal factor in female suicides, especially in Asian female suicides or suspicious deaths. Again, these cases may not be revealed because of the hidden nature of abuse in some cultures, where the honour of the family is being protected.
<P>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC224</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-30_para12"></a>For those reasons, the amendment represents an opportunity to scrutinise child death and suicide in the context of domestic violence and to incorporate Part 8 child death reviews into and within the process. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I find it necessary to support the amendment. It is quite absurd that until a child is 16 there can be no domestic homicide review. If a 13, 14 or 15 year-old child dies, what will happen? According to this, there will be no review. I agree with the noble Baroness who moved the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   I do not disagree with the noble Baroness. I have been looking through the amendments to find a peg on which I can hang a point I wish to make. Perhaps I may hang it on this one, even though it may not be the right one.
<P>

<a name="40202-30_para13"></a>If Clause 6 is to operate it will depend, as a matter of fact, upon there having been a death resulting from violence, abuse or neglect from&#151;and these words reduce the scope of the clause&#151;

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-30_para14"></a><P>

<a name="40202-30_para15"></a>Someone may well start judicial review proceedings to stop such a review on the grounds that the conditions precedent had not been met. I suggest, for the merit and consideration of the noble Baroness and the establishment, that words such as "appears to have been" should be included to widen-out the clause so that it does not act as a fetter on jurisdiction. Whether this is the appropriate moment to raise the point, I do not know&#151;but I have done so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-30_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  I understand the noble Baroness's anxiety, although it is misplaced. I appreciate that she seeks to extend the scope of the proposed domestic violence homicide reviews so as to cover adults and children. At present, the clause deals with the death of a person aged 16 or over.
<P>

<a name="40202-30_para16"></a>The Government's aim in putting together the proposal for reviews was to put in place a system for learning lessons from domestic violence homicides. No such system currently exists on a consistent, national basis. The noble Baroness previously raised that issue and we seek to plug that gap. However, in doing so, we have sought as far as possible to avoid duplicating other reviews or blurring their respective roles.
<P>

<a name="40202-30_para17"></a>As many Members of the Committee will know, there is already in place a system of serious case reviews when a child dies, including by suicide, and abuse or neglect are known or suspected to be a factor in the child's death. That system covers children under the age of 18. So, to take up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, the reviews of children under 18 are already covered in those circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40202-30_para18"></a>Our aim has therefore been to extend a similar scheme to adult victims of domestic violence. We have selected 16 or over as the limit to fit with the age of consent and legal age for marriage, as that is the point at which domestic relationships can take on the seriousness that can trigger serious violence. We <P>


<a name="column_GC225"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC225</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>recognise that the 16-or-over limit means that there will be some overlap with the under-18 scope of serious case reviews. But we believe that that overlap should be kept to a minimum.
<P>

<a name="40202-30_para19"></a>The amendment would largely duplicate existing arrangements for deaths of children and cause confusion at local level about which type of review should be used following the death of a child. For those reasons, we do not feel able to accept the amendment. In parenthesis, the amendment would also not bring suicide within the scope of the review. So, although I understand the noble Baroness's intent, our provision plugs the gap in a helpful way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-30_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   I support the intention behind the amendment. As a result of the Bill, will records be kept of deaths of children as well as of adults, so that those who are trying to advance policies that will enable better protection against domestic violence have the figures that they need?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-30_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Before the Minister replies, perhaps I may make a point closely linked with that made by the noble Baroness. When I was told that the death of a person under 16 was already covered, I naturally read the earlier clauses and found that an offence that results in the death of a child under 16 is indeed covered in Clause 4. But where is the obligation to hold a review?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-30_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The serious case review about which I speak is already present under, I think, a Department of Health provision. We seek to add to what is already there by including the review for domestic violence, which would include adults. We are talking about an additional review mechanism.
<P>

<a name="40202-30_para20"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, made a very valuable point in relation to collation of figures, because there may well be a correlation between the two at which we should look. May I answer her specifically by letter? I think that I will have a favourable response for her but I would simply like to clarify precisely the position that we expect, so that I can give her a full response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-30_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I have a question for the Minister on another point. What happened to the letters of 27 January to the Chairman, which were to be put in the Library? They are not in the Library. I would like to have a copy, because we have a meeting in about an hour's time.

<A NAME="40202-31_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I apologise if that is so; I had understood that the letter had been sent and placed in the Library.

<A NAME="40202-31_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I heard what the noble and learned Lord said. He was right to say that he did <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>not know whether this debate was the place for the matter, but the point was certainly right. Can I take the point away, look at it and come back to it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-31_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   I thank the Minister for her response. We very much welcome the domestic homicide reviews, of course. However, we wish to extend them and incorporate the existing system of serious case reviews into them because the current system allows some children to slip through the net. I have described cases where there has been no previous evidence of child abuse, and such cases are not necessarily reviewed under the current arrangements. That is the concern that led me to table the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40202-31_para0"></a>Bearing in mind what the Minister said, I shall go away and read her remarks carefully in Hansard. However, I suspect that I may not be satisfied that the hole that Women's Aid has identified is plugged, and I may very well return to the matter on Report. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40202-31_para1"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-31_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 41:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 4, line 25, after "held" insert "after the conclusion of a criminal trial"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-31_para2"></a><P>

<a name="40202-31_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment continues on the theme of the multi-agency homicide reviews. The reason why I tabled the amendment is very much in line with the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson. My amendment asks the Government when it is intended that the homicide reviews should take place. If a criminal trial is under way, is it the Government's intention that the reviews should take place only at the end of the conduct of such a trial? That would be the result of my amendment, but it is the peg on which to hang general questions about the timing of such reviews. Could they take place when someone is not to be prosecuted&#151;when it is proved or believed that a non-accidental death has occurred but someone has not been prosecuted for it? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-31_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I understand the way in which the noble Baroness has tabled the amendment, so I shall not say that it is a stalking horse, but&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-31_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I apologise for interrupting the noble Baroness at this early point, but I notice that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, sitting unobserved on her wing also wishes to say a word. It may be easier if he spoke now so that the noble Baroness can then complete her remarks.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-31_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   I am a little obscured by my distinguished companions. Perhaps I may register a small niggle: surely the answer is to change the amendment so that it reads as "any criminal trial". That would achieve the whole object of the exercise.

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC227</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>spend a little time pulling the amendment apart, as we usually do, but that is not what was intended by it and I shall not trouble the Committee.
<P>

<a name="40202-31_para4"></a>It is the Government's intention to issue guidance on the establishment and conduct of the reviews. We intend, as far as possible, to draw on the guidance already used for serious case reviews following child deaths and the guidance used currently by the Metropolitan Police for its domestic violence homicide reviews, which in turn draws heavily on the serious case review guidance.
<P>

<a name="40202-31_para5"></a>Both sets of guidance say that those conducting the review should discuss with the relevant criminal justice agencies how the review process should take account of criminal proceedings, considering, for example, timing, the way in which the review is conducted&#151;including interviews of relevant personnel&#151;who should contribute to the review and at what stage. The guidance takes the line that case reviews should not be delayed as a matter of course because of outstanding criminal proceedings or an outstanding decision on whether or not to prosecute. Much useful work to understand and learn from the features of the case can often proceed without the risk of contamination of witnesses in criminal proceedings. In some cases, it may not be possible to complete or publish a review until after criminal proceedings have been concluded, but that should not prevent early lessons being implemented. I believe that this is a sensible approach which can adequately be dealt with in guidance rather than in statute.
<P>

<a name="40202-31_para6"></a>The amendment would also have the effect of limiting reviews to those cases where there was sufficient evidence to bring a prosecution. The noble Baroness is aware, I know, that in many cases the lessons have to be learnt equally clearly when there is no realistic prospect of prosecution; sometimes, it may be argued, that may be even more the case. I believe that this would place an unnecessary restriction on the availability of reviews. For example, it would remove from the scope of reviews the particularly tragic cases where one partner murders the other, and sometimes the children too, and then commits suicide. There would be no prosecution here, but it is highly likely that there would be lessons to learn and the amendment would prevent that.
<P>

<a name="40202-31_para7"></a>I hope that I have given a sufficiently detailed outline of the Government's thinking to satisfy the noble Baroness so that she will not be troubled to come back with this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-31_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   May I ask the noble Baroness to confirm whether before a criminal trial or after its end the person who actually initiates such a review is the Secretary of State? Can she confirm that no one else can initiate it other than the Secretary of State? That is how I read the draft. However, I find it confusing&#151;I am not that good on construction.
<P>

<a name="40202-31_para8"></a>We have here the duties of persons and bodies set out in subsection (4), but on seeking to construe it as a whole, it seems that the only "person" is that listed in <P>


<a name="column_GC228"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC228</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>subsection (2)&#151;the Secretary of State&#151;who may institute the review. Can anyone else do so, and if not, why not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-31_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Clause 6(2) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may in a particular case direct a specified person or body within subsection (4) to establish, or to participate in, a domestic homicide review".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-31_para9"></a>
The Secretary of State will be the person responsible for issuing the guidance about which I have just spoken. That would indicate who, at the local level, may initiate reviews and there would be a reserve power to order a local agency to institute such a review if the agency failed to do so.
<P>

<a name="40202-31_para10"></a>Subsection (3) places a duty on,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any person or body within subsection (4)";
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-31_para11"></a>
that is, a specific duty is placed on those bodies,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"establishing or participating in a domestic homicide review (whether or not held pursuant to a direction".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-31_para12"></a>
That deals with a situation where the guidance sets out when a review should be undertaken and/or if the bodies should fail to follow that guidance, the Secretary of State may give specific direction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-31_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I am happy with following the guidance. I seek confirmation that only the Secretary of State may issue a direction, if he wants, to the persons listed in subsection (4). Will there be any implementing provisions governing the Secretary of State's powers to give such directions? The provision looks a bit naked and confusing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-31_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   With respect, we do not think that it is either naked or confusing. The Secretary of State will issue the guidance that will set out the parameters for the review regarding when it will be expected that the persons or bodies listed in subsection (4) should exercise their duty pursuant to subsection (3). If they fail to exercise that duty, properly or at all, the Secretary of State may direct them so to do. It is anticipated that, in the ordinary way, the persons and bodies in subsection (4) will of their own volition institute such reviews as appear to them proper and consistent with the number of deaths that occur in their area. We do not anticipate that it is likely that the Secretary of State will very often, or at all, have to direct such bodies to discharge their duty. I hope that that assists the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-31_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I am very much obliged to the noble Baroness. That still leaves the problem with the drafting; the bodies in subsection (4) do not appear to be given direct authority. But I shall not argue about the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-31_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. The purpose of our conversation sotto voce was to confirm that the Government have agreed today&#151;as a very special offer and not as a precedent, as I understand it&#151;that the Committee will be able to take a humanity break at around five o'clock for a quarter of an hour. I see a nod from the Government Whip, so that seems acceptable. I accept that that is not a precedent.

<a name="40202-31_para13"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for tying in the indication that the guidance will be based on serious case reviews. That is a matter on which I have had meetings since the previous Committee sitting last week. As a result of those discussions, I was able not to comment on Amendment No. 40 and will be able to go relatively quietly on this one.
<P>

<a name="40202-31_para14"></a>My concern is always that guidance in such matters should ensure that any homicide review initiated in no way affects the outcome of a criminal trial. That was one of the issues put to me. Although I shall return to those who have represented their concerns to me, I hope not to need to return to the matter on Report.

"(2A) The Secretary of State shall issue guidance as to the establishment, membership and conduct of domestic homicide reviews."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40202-32_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: The purpose of the amendment is to ask the Government to explain how they intend to establish homicide reviews. My noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway, having looked more closely at the drafting of the clause, directed us to the fact that only the Secretary of State may initiate the reviews. How will the Government determine who should serve on homicide reviews? Subsection (2) states that the Secretary of State may direct a "specified person or body" to take part in a review. The Explanatory Notes state that the authorities listed in subsection (4) will have a duty to have regard to the guidance.
<P>

<a name="40202-32_para2"></a>In drafting my amendment, I had in mind a briefing from Refuge, which supports the proposals to learn lessons for prevention by establishing the reviews. However, it believes that it is essential to include voluntary sector members on the review board, particularly those with expertise in domestic violence matters.
<P>

<a name="40202-32_para3"></a>We wish simply to ask the Government whether they intend to include voluntary agencies in the reviews, and to flesh out their thinking on who will participate in them. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-32_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I thank the noble Baroness for that. I certainly reassure her that, as I said, the Government fully intend to issue guidance on the reviews, so the requirement on the Secretary of State to do so is unnecessary, as I think she accepted. Neither is it necessary to provide a specific power for the Secretary of State to do so, as guidance can be issued without that.
<P>

<a name="40202-32_para4"></a>The guidance will, of course, cover issues of membership. That was the Government's intention in referring in Clause 6(3) to the guidance covering "the establishment and conduct" of the reviews, and in setting out a list of the principal people who will be compelled, as it were, to carry out that work. The <P>


<a name="column_GC230"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC230</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>guidance will refer predominantly to the role of statutory agencies, although there may be cases where those agencies wish to draw on the knowledge of the voluntary sector. The amendment is, therefore, unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="40202-32_para5"></a>Our problem with including voluntary agencies in subsection (4) as a matter of right is that all those listed in the subsection will be compellable, because the Secretary of State will be able to direct and/or compel them to take part in the reviews. The noble Baroness is right to emphasise the importance of voluntary agencies, which do enormously good work. It may often be appropriate for them to be included. However, we did not feel it proper to include them in the list of agencies which would be compellable as of right. They are, after all, voluntary bodies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-32_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   I think that the Minister agrees that, in certain cases, voluntary agencies may be highly desirable partners in such inquiries. Would it be feasible to include wording such as, "and such other persons as shall from time to time be appropriate", so that it is stated that such people may, on occasion, have to collaborate with such an inquiry?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-32_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I hear what the noble Baroness says. We may be able to do that through guidance, because there are a number of occasions on which the benefit of having a voluntary agency involved in the review is clear. In fact, local arrangements will often mean that they will become involved, as is proper.
<P>

<a name="40202-32_para6"></a>Members of the Committee will know that we are trying to encourage more and more partnership between voluntary and statutory agencies. That is taking place in the working of local criminal justice boards, crime and disorder partnerships and in many other spheres where joint, partnership working is most useful. Guidance may be the better place for such a provision. We did not think it proper to name any voluntary agency, not least because it would be wrong to make it compellable by the state when it is a voluntary agency, which may reconstitute itself in a different form.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-32_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   Was it not particularly valid to suggest that we should leave open who else could be included, and at least to state that? If we do not, it strongly appears to be a group of official people meeting and that anyone else would be a second-class citizen.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-32_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   There is already a power to amend the list of bodies in Clause 6(6), but it would not be appropriate to add named charities&#151;such as, say, Refuge&#151;as compulsory participants in the review. The import of what the noble Baronesses, Lady Anelay, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, and Lady Howe, said, is well taken. but Clause 6(6) already deals with that and we have the opportunity to deal with it in guidance. I hope that that satisfies the Committee that we have covered the situation appropriately.

<A NAME="40202-32_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. I accept entirely her point that the clause as drafted lists those bodies that are to be compellable, and that there is a very fine line that voluntary groups do not wish to cross. On the other hand, later in the Bill, we come to questions about the victims' code. Victim Support, of its own volition, will be taken as part of a statutory system that could, in a criminal justice process, have a very significant impact on the trial. There are always difficult decisions to be made regarding voluntary agencies.
<P>

<a name="40202-32_para7"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, put my point far more clearly than I did when she said that it was all a question of whether one is seen as a first or second-class citizen. Voluntary agencies wanted to achieve from the Government what they have today; that is to say, an assurance from the Minister that voluntary agencies will be taken seriously in these matters and that they will be involved in them. I would like to see the guidance in order to be reassured of that. It would be interesting if the Minister could give us a steer on when that guidance might be available.
<P>

<a name="40202-32_para8"></a>It is very much a matter of concern that statutory agencies may not always take the advice that is to hand and that could be relevant in these reviews. It may be convenient for the noble Baroness to write to me about the publication of the guidance. If it were a fraught matter one could return to it, but I hope that it will not be such. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

The Government have consulted the Probation Board of Northern Ireland, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. There is broad agreement within those bodies that homicide reviews should be introduced in Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales. If Members of the Committee would like, I would be happy to go through each amendment; otherwise, I beg to move.

<a name="40202-32_para23"></a>Amendment No. 49 is a minor drafting amendment, which is required in order to rectify an omission from the initial draft.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40202-33_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 51 is a little different. It is a Christmas tree, but a friendly Christmas tree, if there is such a thing. The objective is to make a non-partisan offer to the Government to resolve a problem highlighted recently in the Court of Appeal by Lord Justice Rose. I am not wedded to the drafting&#151;it is certainly not that of Lord Justice Rose; it is from another source&#151;but it is the principle that matters.
<P>

<a name="40202-33_para4"></a>The briefest explanation that I can give for the problem, before I go into the detail, is that there have been a number of cases where prosecutors and judges have overlooked the necessity of including a specific count of common assault if the jury is to be invited to consider that as an alternative verdict. As a result, convictions for common assault when no specific count was on the indictment have had to be quashed by the Court of Appeal and the defendant has gone scot free.
<P>

<a name="40202-33_para5"></a>The background justification for the amendment is as follows. By virtue of Section 6(3) of the Criminal Law Act 1967, where a person is tried on indictment for any offence except treason or murder and the jury find him not guilty of the offence specifically charged in the indictment, the jury may find him guilty of an alternative offence, if the allegations in the indictment expressly or by implication amount to, or include, an allegation of the alternative offence, provided that the alternative offence falls within the jurisdiction of the court of trial&#151;for example, the Crown Court.
<P>

<a name="40202-33_para6"></a>That has been referred to as the "blue pencil test"&#151;cross out the unproved parts of the allegation and see what proved parts are left. Do the proved parts amount to an alternative offence within the Crown Court's jurisdiction? Examples include robbery, where an alternative of theft is available if the element of force is not proved; and Section 18 GBH with intent to do grievous bodily harm, where a defendant can be convicted of a Section 20 grievous bodily harm offence if the intent is not proved.
<P>

<a name="40202-33_para7"></a>Prior to the Criminal Justice Act 1988, common assault was available as an alternative under Section 6(3) of the CLA 1967, where appropriate. Before the noble Baroness is tempted to say that it was a Conservative government that caused the problem in the first place, of course there can be unintended consequences in any legislation&#151;this, I freely recognise, is one. An example was that common assault was available as an alternative on a count of <P>


<a name="column_GC234"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC234</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>actual bodily harm because it was an indictable offence. By virtue of Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, common assault became a summary-only offence and, accordingly, was no longer an offence within the jurisdiction of the Crown Court. I remember it well because I was sitting as a magistrate at the time.
<P>

<a name="40202-33_para8"></a>By virtue of Section 40 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 a specific count of common assault&#151;notwithstanding that it is a summary offence&#151;can be included in the indictment if it is founded on the same facts or evidence as a count charging an indictable offence or is part of a series of offences of the same or similar character as a charged indictable offence. In practice, that means that if ABH or racially aggravated ABH is charged, it will also be possible to include a separate count of common assault. So the combined effect of Sections 39 and 40 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 is that common assault is only available as an alternative offence if a specific count of common assault is included in the indictment. As I said, that has sometimes simply gone wrong.
<P>

<a name="40202-33_para9"></a>The problem was first highlighted in the case of R v. Mearns in 1991. That decision was followed by different constitutions of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, in particular in R v. Burt and R v. Brownless. Commentators have suggested that there is a basis for arguing that Mearns was wrongly decided.
<P>

<a name="40202-33_para10"></a>A recent example of the problem came before the Court of Appeal in R v. Clifford and was reported in the Times on 27 November 2003. Lord Justice Rose, who gave the judgment of the court, stated that Mearns was binding on the court and could be overturned only by Parliament by legislation, by the House of Lords on appeal from the Court of Appeal, or by a five-judge Court of Appeal. He pointed out that he realised that there were more pressing and important matters to be addressed by all three routes, particularly as no difficulty arose if, in an appropriate case, a count of common assault was added to the indictment&#151;that is, if people along the way got it right.
<P>

<a name="40202-33_para11"></a>Lord Justice Rose was not aware at the time that the ideal opportunity to resolve the problem would arise with this Bill, as it had not at that stage been printed. I am aware that a further appeal is pending to the Court of Appeal where a conviction of common assault was entered by verdict of a jury, when no specific count was included in the indictment.
<P>

<a name="40202-33_para12"></a>I appreciate that it could be said that remedy is in the hands of prosecutors, the human beings who should get the matter right and ensure that, where appropriate, such specific counts of common assault are added to the indictment. However, human nature being what it is, naturally omissions occur sometimes. Mistakes have been made on occasions with the result that defendants who were, in the opinion of the jury, guilty of common assault have necessarily had their appeals allowed. That seems an expensive waste of <P>


<a name="column_GC235"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>costs and a denial of justice to the public. We have an ideal opportunity in the Bill to put the matter right, and I offer it to the Government. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40202-33_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I thank the noble Baroness for her generosity in giving us that opportunity. I must say that I am not entirely convinced. She will know that on a number of occasions prosecutors may decide not to add a specific count, because of the temptation that, if there is a lesser charge, the jury may be seduced into thinking that that is the easier option. Nevertheless, I see that there may be some advantage in allowing the jury, provided that it has been properly directed by the judge, automatically to consider the alternative offence of common assault where there is insufficient evidence to convict of a more serious charge.
<P>

<a name="40202-33_para13"></a>I also concede that the amendment might be helpful where the jury was trying an offence of racially or religiously aggravated common assault, and was not satisfied that the aggravating element had been proved, but nevertheless considered that the defendant's behaviour constituted a common assault. That point was well made by the noble Baroness. Because of the force of her comments, I shall certainly take the matter away and consider it, and may return to it on Report. She says, in her generous way, that the amendment is defective as it stands, and I respectfully agree. I may come back with a better answer for her next time, but I by no means guarantee that I shall do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-33_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   I speak only to try to educate myself. Is there an obstacle in the long title, or can we always alter it to cover the matter? I do not think that it covers it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-33_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I sought advice at the Public Bill office and was told that there was no obstacle. As always, I accept its advice. "Crime" is in the title of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40202-33_para14"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness. Having given an exhaustive explanation, I certainly would not seek to go back over any of it. The matter is one of principle. I accept her point that there may be occasions when the prosecution purposely does not charge common assault, for the reason of not wanting to let the jury think that it can make lesser decisions. Of course, we shall come to such an occasion on the next clause. I thank the noble Baroness for saying that she will consider the amendment. Perhaps we shall return to it on Report. I look forward to hearing the result of that, and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40202-33_para16"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 7, as amended, shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-33_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   Frankly, is the clause necessary at all? If it is necessary, is this the right Bill in which it should be found? We are dealing here with the general law and saying that, as a result of the <P>


<a name="column_GC236"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC236</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>addition of the clause, common assault, which never has been an arrestable offence without a warrant, should become one. We must all accept that arresting someone is an important matter. The power to arrest is important, and it is one that we should scrutinise with care.
<P>

<a name="40202-33_para17"></a>I question not only whether the clause should be in the Bill, but why the Government think it necessary to have it at this stage. I think that I am right in saying that arrestable offences are to be found in the schedule to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. They cover many offences but not common assault, which is not and never has been an arrestable offence. On the other hand, they cover assault occasioning actual bodily harm, so any assault would probably be covered. Further, one can arrest for intent to carry out any arrestable offence. In other words, if the police have reason to believe that someone intends to commit bodily harm, they already have the power to arrest that person without a warrant. I am sure that they do so in many cases.
<P>

<a name="40202-33_para18"></a>We must realise when we propose using the power to arrest without a warrant for the offence of common assault, we are mainly discussing a threat of violence rather than the act of striking, or any violence at all. The Minister will say, and I accept, that domestic violence is a serious matter and that we are trying to cope with it here. But if we read Section 25 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, we find the following:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The general arrest conditions are . . . that the constable has reasonable grounds for believing that arrest is necessary to protect a child or other vulnerable person from the relevant person".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-33_para19"></a>
Section 25(2) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'the relevant person' means any person whom the constable has reasonable grounds to suspect of having committed or having attempted to commit the offence or of being in the course of committing or attempting to commit it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-33_para20"></a>
So if the constable believes that he has reasonable grounds to suspect the relevant person, in this case, probably a relative of the child, wife or husband, of having committed or attempting to commit an offence&#151;namely, having attempted to strike that person&#151;and if he has reasonable grounds to believe that arrest is necessary to protect the child or other vulnerable person from abuse by the relevant person, the power to arrest already exists under that Act.
<P>

<a name="40202-33_para21"></a>Without taking unnecessary time, I return to my questions: is the Committee wise to make what is a fairly fundamental change by adding the offence of common assault to the list of arrestable offences? If we are, should we at least in some way limit it to what the rest of the Bill is about; or is the Bill not the right place for the provision? Do the police already have the necessary powers to protect the wife, woman or child from abuse without being given the power of arrest&#151;which is itself an important power?

<A NAME="40202-34_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   There seems to be some confusion about the propriety of speaking on clause stand part when one has not given notice. I am sure my noble friend is in the same position as I am. Having on previous occasions sought advice on this, I have <P>


<a name="column_GC237"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC237</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>always been advised that one can speak having not given notice&#151;although, of course, wherever one can, one does so.
<P>

<a name="40202-34_para0"></a>I said all that I had to say about the difficulty of common assault being an arrestable offence when we dealt with the training issue. I do not object to it per se.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-34_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   We sought advice on this issue from the Clerk of the Parliaments. We were given advice and shown the place in the Companion where it indicated that notice should be given. I know that my noble friend will wish to look carefully at the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle. She will write to him and perhaps allow other Members of the Committee to see a copy.
<P>

<a name="40202-34_para1"></a>We appear to have received two different pieces of advice. Clearly the matter needs to be sorted out so that everyone knows what is the actual position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-34_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I undertake to speak to the usual channels and to the Clerk of the Parliaments, but I hereby give notice that if that is indeed now the interpretation, I shall have to give clause stand part notice to every single clause in every single Bill. I do not believe that that would be helpful to anyone.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-34_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I am not very happy that the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, has given the full extent of his argument without restraint. He has given his argument in full and no doubt he was looking forward to the Minister responding. In the course of the noble Lord's remarks, I thought to myself that I would like to contribute to the debate, but I take it from what my noble friend Lady Farrington said that that would not be welcome.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-34_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I certainly was not wishing in any way to do anything improper, nor do I believe that I have done. I always understood that in Committee&#151;particularly in Grand Committee&#151;one was always entitled to speak on a Motion of clause stand part. That is what I have done. I was not able to move a Motion, but I was speaking on the clause. I looked to see whether an amendment on which I could hang my remarks had been tabled when I realised that I was too late to bring forward an amendment to leave out Clause 7. Having started the debate, I really cannot see why, if the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, who was occasionally nodding&#151;whether in agreement or otherwise we shall shortly know&#151;wishes to contribute and say something on what I consider to be an important legal issue, he should not be allowed to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-34_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I was not in any way seeking to inhibit debate or go against the rules. It is just possible&#151;I know it will shock the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, whom I regard as a friend, to hear me say this&#151;that this Government Whip is wrong. My noble friend will reply and allow all noble Lords to see <P>


<a name="column_GC238"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC238</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a copy of the correspondence. I apologise if I am in error in the advice I have given my noble friend. We all need to know where we stand on this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-34_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I do not know whether I may contribute to the debate briefly. If the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, saw me nodding, it was because I thought that it was absolutely right in principle&#151;not on the technical ground of whether it was in order, I do not claim any knowledge of that&#151;for him to raise the issue of whether something that has never been an arrestable offence should be, and whether a quite significant provision should be introduced in a Bill that ostensibly deals with a rather narrower field&#151;that is, not the law in general but the law relating to domestic violence.
<P>

<a name="40202-34_para2"></a>Having said that, however, I felt that I had heard and read sufficient in the past to realise that there have been many cases where the police have not taken as much note of domestic violence as they would have done of violence in the street. Furthermore, although the police in 2004 are much more up to date in these matters and are taking proper note of domestic violence, there will be some occasions when they are called to a house or arrive at a house for some reason and the only crime that will swiftly go through a constable's mind is common assault. He cannot establish or note anything else. Yet he also sees that there is a need to protect&#151;typically&#151;the child or the woman in the house and wants to arrest. It seems to me that the additional power of arrest which this clause would give to the constable in those circumstances could sometimes be useful. No doubt, it could sometimes be abused by the police. None the less, I think that the clause is useful and deserving of positive thought.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-34_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   Everyone is having great fun with this procedural point. However, I do not know whether it is said that any particular notice has to be given. If that is not within the rules, then the only error that the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, made was that, when he first got to his feet, he did not begin with the words, "I hereby give notice".

<P>
<A NAME="40202-34_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I rise in trepidation. Although I am perfectly happy to give a response, I do not wish to gain the ire of my Whip. I am entirely in the Committee's hands.
<P>

<a name="40202-34_para3"></a>Perhaps I can reassure the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, on certain matters. I realise that there is a huge issue as to whether we are casting the net too wide. Other offences are already arrestable. For example, the disturbance of wild birds and possession of wild animals and plants are arrestable offences under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. The mischief that we are discussing here is much more serious. Although the general arrest conditions under Section 25 of PACE will often give a power of arrest for <P>


<a name="column_GC239"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC239</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>common assault, they will not always do so. This provision will truly give the police an unequivocal power to act in cases of common assault.
<P>

<a name="40202-34_para4"></a>My noble friend Lord Borrie was right when he described the sorts of situations with which we are dealing. We often have a situation in which there is an injunction, the wife says that the person is breaching that injunction and there is a dispute as to whether the person is in breach. On the doorstep, however, the officer clearly sees a common assault take place whether by way of threats, actions or otherwise. We are seeking to enable the police to take immediate and effective action to assist the woman and often the children. We know that when the police can assist immediately, it can have very good results in terms of safety and discouraging the continuance of the behaviour.
<P>

<a name="40202-34_para5"></a>I acknowledge that we are doing something that we have not done before. That is the way in which these matters are dealt with. We have identified a mischief that has not been addressed effectively before, and we are looking for tools with which to do that. Currently, Section 25 of PACE gives a police officer general powers to arrest if there is evidence that common assault has occurred and, as the noble Lord said, he has,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"reasonable grounds for believing that arrest is necessary to prevent the relevant person . . . causing physical injury to himself or another person",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-34_para6"></a>
or necessary,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to protect a child or other vulnerable person".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-34_para7"></a>
Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 makes common assault a summary offence.
<P>

<a name="40202-34_para8"></a>It is not unusual for the alleged offender to have left the scene by the time that the police arrive and the victim may not be visibly injured. But common assault, by which we mean common assault and battery, covers a range of actions from threats of violence and striking to unlawful imprisonment. The police may feel that they need to take action, but may not be sure how to proceed in the circumstances. Where we do not believe that an arrest is necessary under Section 25 of PACE&#151;because the alleged offender had left, although a common assault had taken place&#151;the police would need to obtain an arrest warrant in order to proceed with an arrest.
<P>

<a name="40202-34_para9"></a>The purpose of the clause is to provide the police with a simple way to ensure that the alleged offender is removed from the scene of the incident, and that his immediate return is prevented, where there is no existing order under either the Family Law Act 1996 or the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. Although our focus is on tackling domestic violence, we acknowledge that the clause will have general application. Therefore, this will be of benefit to the police where they are dealing with situations of public disorder, where assaults have taken place in conditions that would not be considered as domestic violence, and where the police would have the same difficulty in identifying whether their general powers of arrest will apply. I hope that that will be sufficient to persuade the <P>


<a name="column_GC240"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC240</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Lord that these are appropriate steps to take. If we can protect wildlife, perhaps we can protect women and children too.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-34_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   Before the Minister completes her remarks, does she agree that really we are talking about balance and where the balance should be drawn? The Minister said that the man&#151;let us assume that it is a man&#151;having threatened or attempted to commit an act of common assault, because that is all it would need, perhaps after a threat on a doorstep or a big domestic row, storms off. At that stage, if the policeman does not believe that there is a need to protect a child or any vulnerable person, is it taking the balance too far to suggest that the policeman should have the power to arrest the man? As I say, it is very difficult to determine where the balance should be drawn.
<P>

<a name="40202-34_para10"></a>One must realise that in going as far as we are in this clause, we are saying that any domestic disagreement in strong language&#151;with threats of "I'll get you" and things of that nature&#151;could, after both parties have left the scene and perhaps had time to cool down, nevertheless lead to the arrest without warrant of one of the individuals concerned, who, the next morning, might regret bitterly what had happened the night before.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-35_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I hope to reassure the noble Lord. Of course, the clause gives discretion. It does not mean that the police have to exercise their discretion to arrest on every occasion. There may be very different histories. For example, sometimes there may be a history of a long series of abuse where the husband or partner does almost a hit and run; he disappears only to come back another day. There might be other occasions when it is the first explosive argument, and any involvement is at the beginning: it all depends.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para0"></a>The difference is that at the moment the police feel that they do not have the power to act on those occasions when women and, often, children are frightened and concerned. There may be a history of violence; the police may turn up a little too late; and the man may have gone away, having said to the woman, "I will be back". History indicates that it is likely that he will be back. At the moment, the police do not have a power to do anything about that. This gives them a discretion.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para1"></a>If it is felt right that those who disturb wild birds or are in possession of wild animals and plants&#151;even inanimate objects have protection and, thus, these matters are arrestable&#151;I do not think that it is going too far to say that women and children in a similar situation should be deprived of a similar amount of succour.

<FONT SIZE=3>remain mindful of that. If the Committee agrees, perhaps we may take the next group of amendments and see how we proceed.

<a name="40202-35_para3"></a>Clause 8 [Restraining orders]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-35_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood </B>   moved Amendment No. 51A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 5, line 19, after "heard" insert "on the making of an order under this Act"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-35_para4"></a><P>

<a name="40202-35_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: In the unfortunate absence of my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford&#151;I think that he is at a case in Winchester&#151;I shall move the amendments standing in his name and that of my noble friend Lord McNally. Amendment Nos. 51B and 52A would amend the provision on restraining orders on acquittal, which, as many know, have not been without controversy.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para6"></a>Amendment No. 51A relates to a separate matter. It would give a person, including someone in whose favour an order will be made, the right to be heard before the order is made. Such a person already has a right when the question is one of altering, amending or discharging an order. Currently, however, there is no provision for the person to be heard before an order is made. It is particularly important, because in criminal proceedings the person in whose favour the order has been made&#151;in almost all cases, the victim&#151;is not a party to the proceedings, which are brought by the CPS and not by that person, and would not otherwise be able to give his or her views on the appropriateness of an order or the terms in which it should be made.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para7"></a>The meaning of Amendment No. 51B is obvious. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Page 5, line 24, after 'offence' insert 'arising out of domestic violence'".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-35_para8"></a>
The object, therefore, is to limit the number of occasions on which orders can be made on acquittal to the single issue of where the order arises from domestic violence.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para9"></a>I am afraid that I cannot support this suggestion with case law as, no doubt, my noble friend could&#151;he is extremely familiar with the case law. However, one can choose between a broadly drawn Bill or a more narrowly drawn Bill. My noble friend suggests that a more narrowly drawn clause would be better in those circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para10"></a>Amendment No. 52A would also amend page 5, line 24, by substituting "concludes" for "considers". The amendment was proposed by Liberty in connection with concerns raised that Clause 8 blurs the distinction between the civil and criminal law. Again, that is a subject on which I am not equipped to give my own opinion. The point is that, in a criminal court, a criminal standard of proof should apply. Knowing my noble friend's brilliance, and knowing that the meaning of the amendment is obvious, rather than attempting to argue the case for the amendment myself, I shall leave it to the noble Baroness to answer. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-35_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   I am worried about Amendment No. 51A because, in the context of <P>


<a name="column_GC242"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC242</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>restraining orders&#151;about which I know absolutely nothing&#151;there may be occasions when it is desirable that what I would call an ex parte order should be made. If a man is entitled to be heard, he is undoubtedly entitled to have notice in order that he may be heard. It may be extremely difficult to get hold of the man or woman in question to make certain that he or she is heard. After all, where he really wants to be heard is on his application to have the order set aside. As long as he can make that application more or less straightaway, I see no problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-35_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   In the absence of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, I support the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, who is here rather than in Winchester. If the noble Lord is involved in the case in Winchester that I have heard about, I suspect that he will be there for a rather long time. That is perhaps why we have seen him in the mid-afternoon over the past nine months or so. I may be doing the noble Lord a disservice. If I am, I apologise to him through the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para11"></a>We seem to be giving judges a new power to make a restraining order even when the outcome of a trial is an acquittal. I do not say that we are not right, but it is important that we look at the burden of proof. I believe that that is the intention behind Amendment No. 52A, which would substitute the word "concludes" for "considers". Perhaps we should look at the normal words of the balance of proof as being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it is necessary, or something of that nature.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para12"></a>While I am on my feet and to save me standing up again&#151;certainly not during the clause stand part debate&#151;let me make a further point. If the power to impose such a restraining order is to lie in the hands of a judge in a case where a person is acquitted, the Committee should perhaps consider whether that power should be a general one that can also be applied to other parties to the issue. That may be covered already. It may not necessarily be the acquitted defendant who needs restraining but the unsuccessful complainant. One may need restraining more than the other and I hope that the power will be there for even-handed use between the parties, should it be necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-35_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   In response to the comment by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, although line 19 mentions "any person", my noble friend's concerns in tabling Amendment No. 51A were particularly for the victim. Either the victim or the perpetrator could be heard, but the noble Lord's main concern was for the victim whose personal life would be affected by any such order. He therefore he felt it desirable that victims should be heard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-35_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, on Amendment No. 51A. There must be expedition on those matters and an ex parte hearing may be needed. If someone has the power to delay such proceedings until they are aware of them and present, they could continue to do so until it became impossible to have proceedings. I <P>


<a name="column_GC243"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC243</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appreciate what the noble and learned Lord says, although I shall be very interested to hear the Minister's response.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para13"></a>I have just one question on Amendment No. 51B. I can understand entirely why the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, wants to narrow the scope of the new power. She is right to say that it has been very controversial in some quarters, but by no means all. Opinion seems to be split between those who represent the human rights or legal view and those who represent women's organisations such as Refuge. According to those briefing us, there is a divergence of view on the issue.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para14"></a>I can understand the view of women's organisations, but if one were to argue that the offence should be narrowed down to anything arising from domestic violence, my goodness, we would need a definition of domestic violence, which is exactly what the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, was trying to help us with at the beginning of the Bill. It is to her credit that she has led us on the matter. The difficulty is that, although we do not have an acceptable definition, I do not know how much she would then be narrowing the remit of the provision. My noble friend Lord Carlisle of Bucklow referred to that. We will come to the issue of burden of proof in some of my later amendments. It is an important issue that we need to consider.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para15"></a>A moment or two ago, after I dealt with the technical Lord Justice Rose amendment, the Minister said there was a danger in that scenario and that we could end up with the jury thinking, "Right, we'll get them on something. We will go for a lesser issue". The Family Law Bar Association tells me that there is a similar concern here. It says that if things go wrong, the problem could be most acute in a magistrates' court where a Bench will come to the conclusion that the evidence is insufficient to support a finding of guilt on the criminal standard, but will then be required to consider whether an injunction is satisfied on the civil standard of proof. There may be a temptation for the bench to "fudge" the issue on this. I say that simply in response to the comments of my noble friend Lord Carlisle of Bucklow. I am not trying to pre-empt what we will do with Clause 52.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para16"></a>In all of this, in introducing a new provision, there is the problem that we could end up with people who have been acquitted of an offence finding themselves hit by the clause because the court decides that it wants to get them on something. That is not what I believe, but that is certainly the concern of many organisations that are briefing us. The Government still have a job to do to be able to sell the new provision as something that will be both fair and effective.

<a name="40202-35_para17"></a>I hope that I will be able to do what the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has asked of me&#151;to set out why the Government think these provisions work as they do; why the points highlighted by the noble Baroness, particularly on behalf of the noble Lords, Lord Thomas of Gresford and Lord McNally, need not be the concerns they fear; and why the worry of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, about how they will operate for ex parte orders has been covered. I hope that I will then be able to deal with the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, about whether we need to be very specific on the burden of proof.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para18"></a>If I may, I shall do that by tracking through the Government's intention on the amendments. I hope that, for those who will read the Committee's deliberations, how we have arrived at our position will be clear. I can reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, that I had the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, very much in mind when going through these provisions.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para19"></a>The Government's intention when drafting subsection (2) of Clause 8 was to deal with one of the issues raised in the responses to Safety and Justice&#151;the need for victims to be kept informed when an application is made to vary or terminate a restraining order that is protecting them. As the Committee will know, that has been an issue for many victims who say they feel exposed and abandoned at that stage. As currently drafted, subsection (2) will give any person mentioned in the restraining order a right "to be heard"; that is, to make representations if an application is made to vary or terminate the order. The rules of court will place a duty on the court to inform anyone mentioned in the restraining order of an application to vary or terminate it, so they will be able to exercise their right to be heard. Both parties will therefore be present and able to participate in that application.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para20"></a>Amendment No. 51A, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, spoke, appears to be missing the word "and", but I believe that the intention is to extend the right to be heard to where courts make restraining orders in the first place, while leaving intact the Government's proposal. That is how I interpret it. That would change established procedure in cases where courts make restraining orders on conviction, because in such cases, the court makes its decision as part of the sentencing process and on the basis of the evidence that it has already heard.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para21"></a>In our plans to allow courts to make restraining orders on acquittal, new Section 5A would permit both the prosecution and the defence to present further evidence that would be admissible in civil proceedings. When the original order is made, the person to be protected by it will almost inevitably be in court for the proceedings and is likely to have been a material witness in the case. The Government are not convinced that a separate right to be heard is needed in such cases, because both parties should be there.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para22"></a>Amendment No. 52A would replace the word "considers" with "concludes". If I may respectfully say so, I do not believe that that would make much <P>


<a name="column_GC245"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC245</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>practical difference. The noble Lords, Lord McNally and Lord Thomas of Gresford, may be concerned that the mere act of consideration will give a court the power to make a restraining order, and feel that it is necessary to spell out that the court can make an order only when it concludes from the evidence that one is necessary. I must respectfully disagree; we believe that the current drafting is perfectly clear.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para23"></a>When deciding whether to make a restraining order, the court will already have found the defendant guilty or not guilty of the offence with which he was charged. Having considered the evidence it has heard and, in the case of an acquittal, any additional evidence that is admissible under the civil standard of proof, the court will then decide whether a restraining order is necessary to protect a person from harassment by the defendant. In deciding to make an order, the court will already have concluded that one is necessary.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para24"></a>Amendment No. 51B would limit the circumstances in which a restraining order on acquittal could be made to those cases where the offence charged had arisen out of domestic violence. I am aware that there are some concerns that the Government's proposal for restraining orders on acquittal is drawn too widely. For example, a recent article in the Times made that point.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para25"></a>Our intention is simple: to maximise protection for the victim, while in no way undermining the status of the acquittal. In Clause 8 we propose to extend the availability of restraining orders on conviction to any offence, as we believe that that will offer significant extra protection for domestic violence victims and other victims. As the Committee will be aware, we are proposing to extend the power to make restraining orders to cover acquittals to deal with those cases where there has been clear evidence during the proceedings that the victim needs protection, but insufficient evidence to convict.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para26"></a>We believe that that is a fair, proportionate and justifiable proposal. To seek to limit its availability to a particular type of case is extremely difficult to justify. It would create a lottery of protection, depending on the circumstances of the case and the relationship between the parties, rather than the need for protection of the victim. Beyond that important point of principle, there is also the practical problem that the amendment depends on a definition of domestic violence, as pointed out by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. We have already discussed the merits of that in previous sittings; the Government are clear that a statutory definition is unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="40202-35_para27"></a>The beauty of our proposal is that, because the parties are already in court and the court will have had the advantage of hearing the evidence and seeing how the parties behaved one to another, there may be sufficient evidence to substantiate the non-molestation injunction as a result of the behaviour of the parties, over and above whether the court is satisfied that the offences for which the parties are before the court apply.

I will fully understand if the Minister answers the points I raised when she replies to the next debate.

<P>

<a name="40202-36_para7"></a>Secondly, in the light of our discussions about giving notice for debates on clause stand part, perhaps I may say, at this stage and only for this Bill, that I have today given notice to the Public Bill Office that we shall make objections to clause stand part for every single remaining clause in the Bill. I do that for two reasons: first, out of courtesy to the rest of the Committee so that when the Marshalled List is produced, noble Lords will know that that has been done; and, secondly, to give the usual channels and the Clerk of the Parliaments an opportunity to discuss what will be the best procedure for us to follow. That will ensure that such notice is given as is compatible with the rights of Back Benchers and Front Benchers to operate effectively.
<P>

<a name="40202-36_para8"></a>I turn now to the amendments. We have already looked at how Clause 8 will extend the circumstances under which a restraining order can be made under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 following criminal proceedings. Reference has been made to the fact that subsection (3) introduces a new concept of restraining orders being imposed on a person who has been acquitted.
<P>

<a name="40202-36_para9"></a>Amendment No. 52 has been tabled as a result of questions that arose from the briefing meeting kindly arranged by the noble Baroness before proceedings on the Bill commenced. At the meeting the noble Baroness stated that the standard of proof involved here will be the civil standard, on the balance of probabilities. My concern is simply that the present drafting does not make that clear. I appreciate that others may say that the civil standard of proof is not the appropriate one.
<P>

<a name="40202-36_para10"></a>Amendment No. 53 seeks to put two questions to the Government. First, why have they not provided a power like the old "bind-over" which can apply to either party in the case. At the Government briefing it was said that the order could be made against either party, but that does not seem to be made clear in the drafting of this clause. Indeed, I would go further and say that it looks contrary to the intention of the clause. The drafting of paragraphs 48 to 54 of the Explanatory Notes implies throughout that the order can be made only against the defendant. In particular, paragraph 50, referring to Clause 8(2), states that it,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"gives the victim the right to make representations to the court about the terms of the order. This in turn, along with Rules of Court, will ensure that victims are notified of any application to vary or discharge an order".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-36_para11"></a><P>

<a name="40202-36_para12"></a>My second question is whether it is the Government's intention to leave the power of the court so wide that any limitation on the person's behaviour could be ordered. Here I refer to the phrase used in page 5, line 26,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"from doing anything described in the order".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-36_para13"></a>
While I can understand the kind of behaviour to which that might be aimed&#151;to ensure, for example, that a person could be prohibited from coming within a set distance of the family home&#151;what if the prohibition is so draconian that it damages the ability of the person, the acquitted person, to earn their living? Whose interests do the Government intend should be <P>


<a name="column_GC248"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC248</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>put first when the court makes the order? Will they be those of the acquitted defendant or the alleged victim? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-36_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I rise briefly to support my noble friend. This provision is far too wide and thus is wholly unacceptable. The words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"from doing anything prescribed in the order",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-36_para14"></a>
simply will not do. There is no object in giving descriptions further than those already given by my noble friend to make the point good. I hope that, at the least, the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, will take this matter back because I have never seen a power made on this kind of basis; that is, to order "anything" to be done.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-36_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I apologise for not being present when the amendment tabled in the name of my noble friend Lord McNally and myself was called. Put not your faith in princes or South West Trains.
<P>

<a name="40202-36_para15"></a>Clause 8(3) raises a serious argument. As drafted, the subsection will permit an order to be made against a person acquitted of any offence, be that a road traffic offence or any other offence completely unconnected with domestic violence. The basic principle addressed by the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, is the fundamental requirement that a person should know the nature of a case put against him or her and be given an opportunity to answer it. If a person is charged with an offence that has nothing to do with domestic violence and is acquitted of same, is it satisfactory that suddenly he should be faced with an order made against him that will prohibit him from doing "anything" described in the order when the court "considers"&#151;a word I have already attacked in earlier amendments&#151;that it is right to do so in order to protect a person from harassment by the defendant?
<P>

<a name="40202-36_para16"></a>That is totally wrong in principle and is a point I shall address in later amendments. If, in the course of one case, it should arise that there are circumstances where it is proper to make an order under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, then in a domestic violence case that order should be made in the family court where all the usual safeguards apply; that is, that a person is given notice of the allegations against him and then given the opportunity to address those allegations.
<P>

<a name="40202-36_para17"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said, the amendments at least introduce the requirement that facts be proved. The order cannot be made unless certain facts that go to the issues of harassment, not the offence of which the defendant was acquitted, must be proved on the balance of probabilities.
<P>

<a name="40202-36_para18"></a>Furthermore, as the noble Baroness points out, the clause as drafted applies to only one party. The binding-over powers that the court already has&#151;they have existed since the 14th century&#151;can be exercised widely in appropriate cases against both parties to a dispute, witnesses and whoever is before the court. This is a limited power in that it refers to the defendant, but an enormously wide power in that it can be made <P>


<a name="column_GC249"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC249</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>where the allegations are not specifically set out or proved, and where the order can contain anything whatsoever. I support the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, in these amendments with considerable pleasure.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-36_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I wish to comment on the remarks made by the noble Lords, Lord Campbell of Alloway and Lord Thomas of Gresford, before coming to the wording of the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40202-36_para19"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, said that the words at the end of Clause 8(3)(1),
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"prohibiting the defendant from doing anything described in the order",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-36_para20"></a>
were extraordinarily wide. Taken by themselves they certainly are, but I would have thought that some restraint is placed on the court because it must consider that it is "necessary" to make an order to protect a person from harassment. The word "necessary" surely must govern the rest of the provision so that, whatever the restriction on the defendant, the court must consider it necessary in order to protect a person from harassment.
<P>

<a name="40202-36_para21"></a>In response to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, surely as a matter of general common law relating to the rules of natural justice, everyone must have a right to be heard, certainly someone on whom a restraining order is to be made. One can very properly infer from this provision, as in so many, that no court will make a restraining order unless the person on whom the order is to be imposed has the opportunity to speak up about why the order, in both its general and particular form, has been made.
<P>

<a name="40202-36_para22"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, made a strong point that, from the wording of both the Explanatory Notes and Clause 8(3)(1), it appears as though we are talking entirely about restraining orders on the defendant. At present, I am not sure how it could be otherwise.
<P>

<a name="40202-36_para23"></a>The noble Baroness's amendment includes the words used to describe the civil burden of proof. I am glad to see their inclusion rather than those relating to the criminal burden of proof, which would put far too much hindrance on the court when seeking to protect someone from harassment by the defendant in circumstances where, admittedly, the defendant has been acquitted. I am not sure whether the amendment adds anything, because for the court to consider it necessary to protect a person from harassment and to make a restraining order, surely it would require what the noble Baroness proposes explicitly in her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-37_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   As on so many occasions, my noble friend Lord Borrie has put his finger on the reasons why we feel that the amendments are unnecessary. I agree with his reasoning.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para1"></a>The restraining orders made under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 are civil orders, using the civil standard of proof. That will remain so after the changes we are proposing in Clause 8 to allow restraining orders on conviction or acquittal for any offence. The purpose of a restraining order will remain preventive rather than punitive. That is an important distinction. It will be a matter for the courts to consider whether such an order is necessary to protect from harassment, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para2"></a>It is unusual in legislation to define the standard of proof that the court should adopt in making its decisions. I heard what the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said about new Section 5A(1) of the 1997 Act being too wide, and I acknowledge the support and endorsement for that view from the noble Lords, Lord Campbell of Alloway and Lord Renton. However, the amendment that would prescribe the standard of proof as the balance of probabilities would be unnecessary for the courts; it might also cause confusion.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para3"></a>As I hope that I made clear at Second Reading, there are cases where even though the court is making a civil order, it might have to apply a higher version of the civil standard in deciding whether past conduct is proved, depending on the nature and severity of the conduct alleged. As Members of the Committee will be aware, sometimes the difference between the civil standard and the criminal standard can be very small. The Government's view is that the courts should have the flexibility to decide on the appropriate standard of proof in relation to any past behaviour, before making the forward-looking decision on whether a protective order is necessary in the particular case before them.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para4"></a>The amendment would have one other important effect. At the moment, Clause 8 allows the court to make a restraining order that prohibits the defendant from doing anything described in the order. That is the same wording as in the existing Section 5 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which provides for restraining orders on conviction. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Renton, says about our never having taken such action before, but we did so quite successfully in 1997 and it has been well understood ever since.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para5"></a>We very much followed the spirit of the 1997 Act, in that the court must consider that it is necessary to make the order to protect the person from harassment by the defendant. The clear purpose of the order is to prevent future harassment, and a court can make an order only if it is satisfied that it is necessary for that purpose. My noble friend Lord Borrie made that point well. That is a significant safeguard for the defendant.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para6"></a>We are not convinced that we should go further and limit the terms of the order to prevent acts which each amount to harassment. Depending on the particular facts of the case it may be desirable, for example, to <P>


<a name="column_GC251"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC251</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>prohibit visits to the victim's house or telephone calls. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, made that plain. However, not all such visits or calls may themselves amount to harassment within the meaning of the Act, but they may form part of a pattern of behaviour that escalates into harassment. The purpose of the order is to prevent such harassment happening. It would be counterproductive to constrain the terms of the order in the way suggested by the amendment. We have the experience of 1997's harassment Act, which seems to have worked well.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para7"></a>The other amendment in the group would have the effect of allowing the court that makes a restraining order on a defendant following an acquittal to make a restraining order in respect of any person who is before the court at the time that it exercises its power. The noble Baroness is absolutely right when she says that the way in which we have phrased the Bill highlights the defendant's position, not that of the victim. I recognise that there is some concern about the effect of the power in Clause 8 to make restraining orders on acquittal.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para8"></a>However, as I hope that I made clear at Second Reading, we are not in any way undermining the presumption of innocence or the status of the acquittal. Rather we are trying to avoid the situation where there has been clear evidence during the criminal proceedings that the victim is at risk of harassment, but following an acquittal it is then left to the victim to go to the civil courts to obtain adequate protection.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para9"></a>As an example, let us suppose that someone is charged with an offence of grievous bodily harm with no alternative charge on the face of the indictment, and found not guilty. However, during the trial, while denying the grievous bodily harm, the defendant accepts that he may have pushed, verbally abused or dealt with the victim otherwise in such a manner. That does not amount to the grievous bodily harm with which he is charged, but certainly there is clear evidence of accepted domestic violence and/or harassment. The court would be in a position to deal with those circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para10"></a>As matters stand if that happens, there is often a delay before the victim can get relief. In some cases, the police are so concerned about the victim's safety that they escort the victim from the Crown Court round the corner to do just what the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said. They go through the county court door and get their injunction there, with the whole matter replayed. It is our hope that such a situation may be avoided. We do not expect that the power in Clause 8 will be used often by the courts, but it is a valuable protection none the less. It is important, however, that it is not extended so far that it blurs all distinction between the jurisdiction of the civil and criminal courts.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para11"></a>Where a prosecution has been brought, there will have been sufficient evidence against the defendant to justify bringing the case to court. It is the defendant's alleged conduct that is under close scrutiny by the court, and it might well be that actions amounting to harassment or violence by the defendant are admitted <P>


<a name="column_GC252"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC252</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>or proved during the case but are not in themselves sufficient to secure a conviction, as I have just indicated.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para12"></a>In contrast, a witness to the case&#151;that could include the alleged victim&#151;will not have had legal representation during the case, or the same notice that the conduct will be examined in detail. More importantly, if there was sufficient evidence that a witness or victim had committed an offence, there might be grounds for a prosecution. There are, therefore, fundamental differences between the position of the defendant and the witnesses to the case, which means that it would not be appropriate to extend the power in the way proposed in the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para13"></a>Amendment No. 53 is also unclear in its scope because,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any person who is before the court",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-37_para14"></a>
has no precise legal meaning. It is unclear whether it relates only to witnesses or ranges more widely to anyone present in the court at the time, such as friends or relations of the parties sitting in the public gallery or indeed the legal representatives. It may tempt some judges too far in terms of the use of the power. To grant a criminal court the power to make civil injunctions with such lack of precision on their scope or aim would be difficult to justify. It would also be an unjustifiable extension of the criminal courts' jurisdiction into that of the civil courts.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para15"></a>I think that it was the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, who asked, "What of a bind-over?", but it may have been the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. Bind-overs are still available to the court. The court can still bind over anyone, including counsel, of its own motion. It may do so at any time before the conclusion of the criminal proceedings&#151;on withdrawal of the case by the prosecution; on a decision by the prosecution to offer no evidence; on adjournment; or on acquittal by the defendant where it is believed or considered that the person's conduct is such that there might be a breach of the peace in future, whether committed by him or others. These powers are exercisable not by reason of any offence having been committed but as a measure of preventative justice. It would be perfectly possible for a court to bind over the victim or any other witness and deal with the defendant in a different way.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para16"></a>Where a court contemplates exercising its power against a person who has not been charged with an offence, it should of course ensure that the person concerned understands what the court has in mind and give that person an opportunity to be represented. That was held in Hendon Justices ex parte Roschen in 1973. So we do have the ability to regulate that part of the procedure.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para17"></a>We shall have to come back to the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow. We have sought to balance the interests of the respective parties in a proportionate and fair way and to enable defendants in these situations to have a clear understanding of what they may face, give them an opportunity to produce evidence as appropriate and for orders to be <P>


<a name="column_GC253"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC253</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>made where the court feels it is necessary to prevent future harassment. We believe that that will meet the needs of the situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-37_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I listened carefully to the noble Baroness as she explained her support for the clause. She gave as an example a case of where, in the course of the proceedings, there was an admission. I would go along with her if the defendant in the course of evidence admitted the kind of circumstance to which the noble Baroness referred; if he admits it, there would be no objection. However, if he denies it, it would be quite unfair to use what the noble Baroness said was evidence sufficient to bring a case. That cannot be an effective test or safeguard if the man is acquitted&#151;and we are dealing with an acquittal.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para18"></a>In those circumstances, if a court makes an order which, on the balance of probabilities, it believes is necessary to protect someone&#151;and if, in the process, the order requires him not to live at home, not to visit or call his wife or to leave the area where he has a job, for example&#151;that would be an incredible invasion of that man's privacy and quite beyond what is provided in a bind-over to keep the peace, which would be perfectly satisfactory.
<P>

<a name="40202-37_para19"></a>I believe that, apart from my noble friend's amendment, the drafting of the clause must receive further consideration. It cannot be supported by the argument advanced by the noble Baroness that it should be on the basis of admissions and evidence sufficient to bring the case. That cannot be fair. I would respectfully ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-37_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Before the noble Baroness replies, and following the comments of my noble friend, I should like to stress what I said earlier. The use of the expression "considers it necessary" seems too vague in the circumstances. The amendment put forward by my noble friend Lady Anelay says,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"proved on a balance of probabilities that it is necessary".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-37_para20"></a>
Of course, we are not using the burden of proof for conviction&#151;which is beyond reasonable doubt&#151;but working on a form of protection. I should have thought that it is much more necessary to use not merely the word "necessary", but to use the expression, "on a balance of probabilities it is necessary".

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-38_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   In my comments on the variable nature of the balance of probabilities and the burden that has to be discharged dependent on the nature of the facts alleged, I think that I answered as fully as I can the latter point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Renton.
<P>

<a name="40202-38_para0"></a>I turn to the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. Of course the court will have two species of evidence: the totality of the evidence heard before the conclusion of the trial; and then an opportunity given to the defendant to call further and other evidence if he or she should so choose in order <P>


<a name="column_GC254"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC254</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to establish or gainsay what is alleged against them in terms of the need for future protection. It would be quite wrong to say that the court would have to disregard all the evidence it heard during the trial in coming to its consideration of whether the application for an injunction or the relief sought is proper. We have to look again at the civil burden and ask&#151;for example, if this was a combined court and there was a court room next door&#151;whether they were facts upon which, applying the civil standard, one would be entitled to the relief sought. As I have tried to indicate, this is an attempt to be entirely practical in how protection is given, so that an alleged victim has an opportunity to obtain a court determination quickly, so they can obtain the protection that may be necessary if the court considers it to be so.
<P>

<a name="40202-38_para1"></a>We therefore think this a proportionate and proper  way of proceeding. A bind-over may be appropriate in certain circumstances. However, in these circumstances, if the facts are proven to justify a Clause 8 restraining order to protect the future of the parties, we think that this is an appropriate and proportionate action which should be taken.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-38_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friends and to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, for supporting my amendments in principle even if the drafting is not too wonderful. I appreciate what the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said with regard to his construction of the use of "necessary", in that it governs the rest of that subsection. However, I should like to look at that again because I am not totally convinced.
<P>

<a name="40202-38_para2"></a>I start from the premise that I want to be able to support the provisions of the clause. I think that the Government are properly searching for a way of dealing with a very real problem, but in specified circumstances of domestic violence. So I have much sympathy with what the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said about the fact that this is now a very wide power, having arisen from what was perceived to be a serious problem, but in a domestic arena.
<P>

<a name="40202-38_para3"></a>I was struck by the fact that the Minister said that this measure is intended to be preventive, not punitive. I perfectly accept that that is the Government's intention. However, I do not think that the current drafting achieves that objective. I am very sensitive to the briefings we have had from those who are concerned that provisions are being made to curtail the activity of those who have been acquitted. We can all sympathise with what the Government are trying to do, but these people have been acquitted as far as they are concerned. They should be able to walk free. Yet here we see their behaviour circumscribed within private circumstances. A bind-over is made as a matter of keeping the peace and public safety, not private safety.
<P>

<a name="40202-38_para4"></a>I am concerned about this provision. The Minister said that it is unusual to define the standard of proof in legislation. I do not have sufficiently wide experience, but during our consideration last year of the Extradition Bill the Government were kind enough to make clear on the face of that legislation what was <P>


<a name="column_GC255"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC255</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the standard of proof. Indeed, we faced a similar situation then to that we have before us now; that is, the line between the civil and criminal law is being smudged or fudged&#151;whichever is the appropriate term. However, we have a duty to ensure that the legislation is as clear as possible, not only for those who are supposed to implement it but also for those who will be subject to it.
<P>

<a name="40202-38_para5"></a>I will want to look again very carefully at the drafting because I may need to return to this point. I shall not necessarily do so with the same form of amendments because I accept the criticism made in particular about the phrase,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any person who is before the court".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-38_para6"></a>
It was pointed out over the weekend by someone close to me that that did not represent the most felicitous drafting. However, the serious issue here is to address what should be done to ensure that we do not smudge the line too much between the civil and the criminal law. However, at this point, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40202-38_para7"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<a name="40202-38_para8"></a>[Amendment No. 52ZA, re-tabled as Amendment No. 51B, not moved.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-38_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford </B>   moved Amendment No. 52B:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 5, line 25, leave out "an" and insert "a temporary"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-38_para10"></a><P>

<a name="40202-38_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 52B is to be considered with Amendment No. 53A and reverts to a theme I sought to expound at an earlier meeting of the Committee about the need for these orders in domestic violence cases to be dealt with in the civil court. I am concerned that there is a fudging or blurring of the differences between civil and criminal procedure.
<P>

<a name="40202-38_para12"></a>The "bind over" which the magistrates' court or any criminal court can apply is a very well known remedy. Only last Wednesday I was involved in a case of criminal damage where the prosecution offered no evidence. The defendant was found not guilty and was then bound over to keep the peace for some two years. That is a very recent example, citing a case in which I was involved. An order made by a criminal court is rather like a scatter gun in effect; it is not particularly refined. "Keeping the peace" is a broad statement and may not be too helpful to a person who is the victim of domestic violence.
<P>

<a name="40202-38_para13"></a>New Section 5A asks a magistrates' court or a Crown Court&#151;but more generally a magistrates' court&#151;to operate civil procedures and civil rules of evidence. Subsection (2), for example, reads as follows:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In proceedings under this section both the prosecution and the defence may lead, as further evidence, any evidence that would be admissible in proceedings for an injunction under section 3".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-38_para14"></a>
That means that in the magistrates' court evidence can be led by either side, but subject to civil procedure rules of evidence. That means that the magistrates, normally more used to dealing with criminal cases although they do have a civil jurisdiction, may not be in a position to appreciate the distinction between civil and criminal rules of evidence.
<P>


<a name="column_GC256"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC256</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-38_para15"></a>In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, on the last amendment, the Minister said that one needs to be practical. By way of illustration she referred to the possibility that the victim in a case where a person has been acquitted in a criminal court may be led by the police around to the county court, go in through another door and there make an application for a restraining or other appropriate order&#151;perhaps a non-molestation or occupation order.
<P>

<a name="40202-38_para16"></a>The suggestion behind the Minister's response was that there was something wrong in that. I do not think that there is anything wrong in the civil judge, who generally makes orders under the Protection from Harassment Act, using his experience and knowledge of family matters and the problems that arise with children, husband and wife, and so forth, to deal with the matter. Nor do I think that it is particularly disadvantageous for the procedural safeguards of the civil process to be in place. Those procedural safeguards are the safeguards to which I referred earlier. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, was good enough to point out that natural justice requires the formulation of allegations and the opportunity of a person to give a defence to those allegations, and so on. The procedural safeguards in the civil process should be used.
<P>

<a name="40202-38_para17"></a>Again, the Minister referred to the fact that the combined court could deal with both sets of issues. There are no combined courts. I know that there is an experiment going on in about four or five courts that sit one day as a domestic court and on another day as a criminal court. But that is not a combined court giving, at one and the same time, civil and criminal jurisdiction to that court.
<P>

<a name="40202-38_para18"></a>The net result of fudging the distinction between criminal and civil proceedings is that one is faced with the vague phrase, as the noble Lord, Lord Renton, said, of a court considering whether it is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"necessary to do so to protect a person from harassment",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-38_para19"></a>
and so forth. We are left with vague phrases, which do not import the procedural safeguards. I know that the Minister said that they do, but I do not agree. The matter must be spelt out along the lines of Amendment No. 52B. The vague words are used in the proposed new section because a fudge is going on. It is our view that protection of harassment orders, non-molestation orders or occupation orders should be ordered in the civil court.
<P>

<a name="40202-38_para20"></a>I finally get round to the amendments. If the criminal court thinks it necessary to do something straightaway because there is an imminent danger to a person who is before the court&#151;a person who is the victim of domestic violence&#151;we suggest that at the very least it should be a temporary order. On the making of that temporary order, the criminal court should refer the matter to the appropriate family court for urgent consideration. In our amendments, the instant protection is there, but the appropriate process is used for the making of the order. Those are the purposes behind the amendments. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-39_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I thank the Law Society for its briefing on these matters. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, takes us to the heart of the matter&#151;that is, the debate, which is also going on outside the House as well, as to whether we are going too far in blurring the dividing line between civil and criminal matters.
<P>

<a name="40202-39_para0"></a>My noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway is right to remind us of his earlier offer of an amendment which focussed our attention on combined courts. I can well understand why organisations such as the Family Law Bar Association, in its response to the Government's consultation on these matters, pointed out the difficulties highlighted by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and sought to resolve them by the establishment of a specialist court.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-39_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   When the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, was making his remarks I wondered whether he was concerned that, because magistrates are more used to applying the criminal standard, they would transport that into their assessment of the civil standard and that this would disadvantage the victim in some way. But something tells me that that was not within his contemplation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-39_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My objection is that it is the civil rules of evidence which are being applied, which are different from the criminal rules of evidence, as the noble Baroness knows.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-39_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I should preface my remarks by saying that we already have evidence of how this works by virtue of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. This procedure already takes place under that Act where, as a matter of course, criminal courts are dealing with civil orders. As I said earlier, they do not appear to have had any difficulty in so doing.
<P>

<a name="40202-39_para1"></a>I should also make clear that we do not accept that this is a fudging or that these are vague phrases. That is an unfortunate and inaccurate way of describing what we seek to do under this section.
<P>

<a name="40202-39_para2"></a>Also by way of precedent, Section 1 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 uses a similar test to that contained in new Section 5A(1) in relation to anti-social behaviour orders on conviction. It states there that a court may make an order under this section if it considers it necessary to protect a person. So it does not appear to have caused any difficulty or impediment under those two Acts. Indeed, the Acts appear to have gained compliments from those who have had the privilege of using them.
<P>

<a name="40202-39_para3"></a>The amendments tabled by the noble Lord would have two effects. First, Amendment No. 52B would make restraining orders made on acquittal have only <P>


<a name="column_GC258"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC258</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>temporary effect. Amendment No. 53A would require a court making such an order to refer the case to the appropriate family court for urgent consideration.
<P>

<a name="40202-39_para4"></a>It is important to bear in mind that restraining orders under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 are civil, preventative orders made by a criminal court at the conclusion of criminal proceedings. Under the current terms of the Act, the orders are not limited to family cases but can be made when a person is convicted for offences under Sections 2 and 4 of the Act, which are offences of harassment and putting people in fear of violence. That includes offences such as stalking by a stranger.
<P>

<a name="40202-39_para5"></a>The Government's aim under Clause 8 is to extend the protection offered by restraining orders to cover cases where someone has been convicted of any offence and also to allow the court to make a restraining order where there is insufficient evidence to convict but the court considers that it is necessary to make a restraining order to protect the victim.
<P>

<a name="40202-39_para6"></a>Our proposals will obviously help victims of domestic violence&#151;which is one of the key issues dealt with by the Bill&#151;but they will also help in other kinds of cases which would not come within the remit of the family court and where it would not be appropriate for the family court to consider the case.
<P>

<a name="40202-39_para7"></a>I understand that there might be concerns that Clause 8 is moving into the criminal courts matters which should more properly be dealt with in the family court, with judges and lawyers trained in family rather than criminal matters. But that is not so. As I have said, the Protection from Harassment Act has never dealt only with family matters and was built on the assumption that a criminal court could and should be able to make a civil order on conclusion of the criminal proceedings. Clause 8 continues the same principles, but the proposed amendments would undermine the criminal court's jurisdiction to make the order in the first place by remitting the case to the family court for further consideration.
<P>

<a name="40202-39_para8"></a>So the amendments also fail to address a number of very practical effects. They do not set out what should happen when a court makes an order in a case that would not fall within the family court's jurisdiction or for how long a temporary order would last, given that restraining orders are made either for a specified period or until further notice. More importantly, they do not set out what the family court could and should do. For example, could the court consider new evidence, or only that heard by the criminal court? If the latter, would there be any practical difference between the two courts' decision-making processes, unless different standards of proof were adopted? Could the family court overturn the criminal court's decision to make a restraining order? Where would the appeal route lie? A plethora of questions is left unanswered.
<P>

<a name="40202-39_para9"></a>Finally, if the case is one that raises family law issues, there should, in any event, be separate family proceedings to deal with them. To hand over a part of the criminal proceedings for the family court to reconsider would not offer any further protection for <P>


<a name="column_GC259"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC259</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>victims or defendants alike. For all those reasons, we think that the amendments do not do that which noble Lords seek to do. I absolutely know why the noble Lord has proposed the amendments. He says, "If it is temporary, we can sort it out later". In earlier sittings, I think we talked about the need for training, joint working, partnership and all that we are doing to ensure that the right cases go before properly trained members of the Bench, both lay and professional, so that we get the highest quality of decision making. So albeit that I understand why the noble Lord has proposed the amendments, I regret to say that I cannot agree with him that they are necessary or well founded.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-39_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   Orders made under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, I think, and certainly under the Protection from Harassment Act&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-39_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   It was the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-39_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I am grateful. Orders made under the Crime and Disorder Act and the Protection from Harassment Act follow conviction; not acquittal, but conviction. That is to say that the facts have been established in a particular case, on a criminal standard of proof, to the satisfaction of the court. Perhaps it is right that in circumstances where the court is then considering the appropriate thing to do, the word "consider" could be used. However, we are not dealing with that situation in this clause.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-39_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I hesitate to interrupt the noble Lord but I do not want him to misdirect himself. Under the harassment Act, what the criminal court is doing is making a civil order. That is what we are seeking to invite the court to do on this occasion. We are seeking to get a criminal court to make a civil order.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-39_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I understand that entirely. However, it is making a civil order as a consequence of a conviction. That is the point that I am seeking to make. The facts will have been established and the court will then consider what to do by way of disposal. It can deal with the disposal of a case following a conviction in a number of ways, one of which is to make a civil order. However, this clause is dealing with a situation after a person has been acquitted. The facts, therefore, have not been established to the appropriate standard of proof. The matter is then at large and governed by the words, "If the court considers it necessary to protect a person from harassment" as though there had been a conviction. That word is appropriate where there has been a conviction but not where there has been an acquittal.
<P>

<a name="40202-39_para10"></a>I have to make an apology to the noble Baroness in that I misunderstood the scope of the clause. Since this is a domestic violence Bill, I had assumed that the section would apply to domestic violence, not to every conviction of harassment. However, the wording of new Section 5A(1) shows that the noble Baroness is right. It does not deal only with domestic violence, but with any circumstance under which proceedings have <P>


<a name="column_GC260"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC260</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been brought for any offence where there is a danger of someone being harassed. It does not deal necessarily with a domestic situation at all.
<P>

<a name="40202-39_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said that there may be a case which does not fall within the jurisdiction of the family court. If it is the case that on an acquittal for anything a person may be made subject to an order under this new section&#151;outside the context of domestic violence, but simply because the court perceives a risk of some form of harassment&#151;and that the order can contain anything that the court seeks to put in it, then this is an enormously wide provision. I had not appreciated its scope. If that is what the Government intend, we must examine this new section with much greater scrutiny than that to which we have already put it.
<P>

<a name="40202-39_para12"></a>That will make the new section even more unacceptable. Were we dealing only with domestic violence and the matter could be referred to the family court as I suggest in my amendments, at least there would be some bounds to this provision. At the moment, however, it would apply for any offence, including those outside domestic violence. If the court "considers" it necessary, the court can make an order. I respectfully suggest that that is wrong in principle. Although for the moment I shall withdraw my amendment, we will come back to the matter on the basis that the whole section should be excluded.

<a name="40202-40_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: We have debated at length the provisions that relate to restraining orders. Those orders will give continued protection from harassment to victims in domestic violence cases, even on acquittal.
<P>

<a name="40202-40_para2"></a>The Government believe that victims of domestic violence in Northern Ireland should be afforded the same degree of protection as in England and Wales. That is why we have tabled Amendment No. 54, which would extend the provisions of Article 7 of the Protection from Harassment (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 to allow for restraining orders to be made on acquittal as well as on conviction and would apply these to all offences, not only those under the 1997 order. The provisions replicate for Northern Ireland the provisions of Clause 8, which apply only to England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40202-40_para3"></a>In deciding to extend the provisions to Northern Ireland, the Government have sought the views of both the Lord Chief Justice for Northern Ireland and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Both parties have expressed that they are content that the provisions should apply in Northern Ireland. Amendments Nos. 107 and 111 are consequential on Amendment No. 54.
<P>

<a name="40202-40_para4"></a>I do not know whether the amendments fall within the category of the other amendments for Northern Ireland addressed by the noble Baroness. I see that she has indicated that they do not, so I shall not press them today. However, I want to make clear our position in relation to a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. I shall say it again so that there will be no misunderstanding when we return to the matter. These provisions are similar to the anti-social behaviour orders and football banning orders that can be made either following conviction or following civil proceedings on complaint. So the comments of the noble Lord which sought to make the distinction are not, we feel, well founded.
<P>

<a name="40202-40_para5"></a>If the noble Baroness wishes to indicate her assent, I shall move the amendments. However, if she does not wish to do so, then I shall move them another day. I beg to move.

This category of amendments could be controversial&#151;indeed, they are controversial in the Committee. My concern is that we <P>


<a name="column_GC262"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>did not have sufficient opportunity to consult organisations in Northern Ireland on their understanding of what was happening.
<P>

<a name="40202-40_para6"></a>I am more convinced than ever that we are right not to agree to the amendments today, because, when the noble Baroness introduced them, she referred to the importance of protecting domestic violence victims in Northern Ireland. Like the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, I initially thought that the clause would only affect domestic violence offences. That is why, during our brief meeting with the Minister, I did not seek to ask questions more broadly. Had we done so, we would have been aware more quickly of the wider remit of the clause. It is certainly clear from the drafting of this amendment and the previous one how wide is the remit. We will need to consult in Northern Ireland and return to this and Clause 8 refreshed on Report.

<a name="40202-40_para9"></a><P>

<a name="40202-40_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 56, 57, 58, 58A, 58B and 58C. Also included in the group are Amendment No. 58ZA, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and Amendment No. 58BA, in the name of my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway.
<P>

<a name="40202-40_para11"></a>We now reach the Government's proposals to find a way to overcome the problem caused by the decision in the case of Kidd that precluded the practice of sentencing on the basis of specimen counts, where those counts are the only ones proved and/or admitted by a defendant. I note that some organisations, such as Liberty, oppose the proposals altogether. Liberty is not persuaded that the test set out in Clause 9(5)&#151;that it would need to be in the interests of justice for certain counts to be tried without a jury&#151;is ever likely to be met. I will keep that view carefully in mind during our debates.
<P>

<a name="40202-40_para12"></a>I and my honourable friends in another place have already made clear during debates on the Criminal Justice Act that we would look with favour on any sensible resolution of the Kidd problem. It should, however, be noted that at that stage none of us had seen the Government's amendments. We had received a letter from Judge Alan Wilkie QC, a Law Commissioner. That letter was circulated to Oliver Letwin, Simon Hughes, the noble Lords, Lord Thomas of Gresford and Lord Dholakia, my noble friend Lord Hunt of Wirral and me.
<P>

<a name="40202-40_para13"></a>Judge Alan Wilkie's concern was to highlight the view of the Law Commission that its proposals should not be seen in the same contentious light as those then under consideration in the Criminal Justice Bill. He made it clear that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is not our intention by our scheme to reduce the number of jury trials, or the number of counts on an indictment which will be the subject of jury trial".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<a name="column_GC263"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC263</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Our objective is exactly the same as his. Any proposals in the Bill should certainly not be an assault on jury trial; they should provide a sensible way forward by retaining jury trial in cases where there is such a large number of counts that there are too many to be accommodated in a single trial&#151;and, as a consequence, there would now be no jury trial at all. We also need to consider the Government's concern that proposals could lead to a jury trial on such a limited group of counts that the sentence would not be appropriate to reflect the extent or level of offending.
<P>

<a name="40202-40_para15"></a>My amendments, and those of my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway, provide the basis for debating whether the Government have chosen the most appropriate solution to the problem caused by Kidd and whether there are other solutions that would be more appropriate. I have divided my amendments into groups on that basis.
<P>

<a name="40202-40_para16"></a>I note that the Law Commission states in its report No. 277 at paragraph 7.6 that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"although it [this method of trial] will be available for use in certain cases which would attract the sobriquet of 'serious fraud' and will also be capable of being used in non 'serious' fraud and other cases, it will not be available for use in all cases of 'serious fraud'".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-40_para17"></a>
My objective is to ensure that the Government will not try to introduce through the back door the proposals that were rejected by this House in the Criminal Justice Act.
<P>

<a name="40202-40_para18"></a>Specific undertakings were given by the Home Secretary in another place with regard to the proposals for fraud trials in particular. I believe that the Minister should find it easy to give an answer to my question. Can the Minister give an assurance to members of the Committee that the proposals in this Bill do not undermine or encroach on those undertakings in any regard?
<P>

<a name="40202-40_para19"></a>My amendments are in groups. Amendments Nos. 55, 56 and 57 make it clear that the conditions set out in Clause 9 are conjunctive and not disjunctive. The amendment was prompted by a drafting complaint made by some of my noble friends and people outside the House. The conditions have to be met if an application by the prosecution for part of a trial on indictment in the Crown Court to proceed in the absence of a jury is to be successful. Can the Minister confirm that the Government intend that the conditions should be conjunctive?
<P>

<a name="40202-40_para20"></a>The amendments also introduce a new requirement that all the counts must be of the same type of offence. Does the Minister agree that it would not be acceptable to have dissimilar offences, nor to have offences that were simply in general terms about "dishonesty" or "violence"? The offences need to be closer in reference to each other than that.
<P>

<a name="40202-40_para21"></a>Amendment No. 58 alters the first condition in subsection (3) to probe the meaning of the Government's drafting. They say that the condition is that the number of counts included in the indictment is likely to mean that a trial by jury involving all the counts would be impracticable. I have replaced that by a stronger test&#151;the noble Baroness may say that it <P>


<a name="column_GC264"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC264</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>does not make any difference&#151;on which to peg my argument; that is, the number of counts is such that the trial would be so unmanageable that it would not be possible to proceed. How strong a condition does the Government intend subsection (3) to be? That question is at the heart of the matter.
<P>

<a name="40202-40_para22"></a>Amendments Nos. 58B and 58C put forward a Law Commission proposal that toughens up the drafting of subsections (8) and (9). At paragraph 7.4 of its report, the Law Commission stated that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the judge would decide the guilt or innocence of the defendant in respect only of offences linked to those upon which the jury has convicted. Those linked offences will have been pre-selected and placed in a schedule attached to the indictment. The schedule would reflect the full extent of alleged offending. The offences in the schedule will be listed, as appropriate, in groups and each group linked with a specified sample count in the indictment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-40_para23"></a>
That seems appropriate. Can the Minister explain how the provisions of the clause guarantee that that procedure proposed by the Law Commission will take place? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-41_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Amendments Nos. 58ZA and 58BA are grouped with these amendments, but they are a pale shadow of those proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. She has set out a far better safeguard in her amendments than proposed in my amendments. Since it is no longer possible to choose one particular count as a sample count in the way that we always used to, we accept that, as a matter of practicality, a solution to the problem must be found. What concerns us is that counts will be regarded as sample counts under the Government's proposals when they are not truly so. The definition of what is or is not a sample count requires to be tightened up precisely as it would under the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. I am hesitant in advancing my amendments as I entirely accept hers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-41_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   On the basis that the clause will stand part in a moment, which I suggest that it should not, I support all the amendments. One has to do something about the problem. The amendments are a step along the road that is very much better and provides a much more acceptable resolution than that proposed in the clause.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-41_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   Of course I accept that the case of Kidd has had considerable effect and made it impossible to proceed on specimen trials. However, one wants to stand back a moment and see what is the likely need for the new powers in the clause. Where one has a person charged with numerous offences of petty fraud, it is perfectly apparent that, unless one can use specimen charges, one is unlikely to have either indicted or convicted sufficient numbers on which to give an adequate sentence.
<P>

<a name="40202-41_para0"></a>Does that really apply in cases of such a nature? As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, suggested in the case of Kidd on assault, one would have thought a situation unlikely in which the number of counts that one had to add made it inappropriate to have one trial without the sentence being able to cover the gravity of <P>


<a name="column_GC265"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC265</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the whole. There are likely to be more separate and individual offences on separate occasions, probably all of a fairly serious nature. Therefore, I find it difficult to think that the effect in sexual cases will overburden the jury or overweigh the indictment to the extent that has been suggested in general discussion on these clauses.
<P>

<a name="40202-41_para1"></a>The problems are in areas wider than those of sexual abuse and assaults occasioning actual bodily harm. They are certainly wider than that of rapes, where even if one has a case of multiple rape I have no doubt that the choice of certain of the counts for trial would, on conviction, always give adequate power to the judge to pass the appropriate sentence. Therefore, while not suggesting that Kidd does not lead to problems that need to be addressed, I hope that, as with other clauses, we will be cautious when making major changes in the law that may not be necessary.
<P>

<a name="40202-41_time0"></a><H5>6.30 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-41_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I hope that I can deal relatively succinctly with the issues because I think I can reassure the Committee that the amendments are unnecessary, although I agree with their purport. First, I can tell the noble Baroness that nothing in this part is intended to encroach or encroaches on the undertakings given by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary during the passage of what is now the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Those remain separate and apart.
<P>

<a name="40202-41_para2"></a>The noble Baroness asked some direct questions. I have already dealt with the fact that there is no encroachment on Section 43 territory. On the nature of sentences, sentences would have to be similar&#151;so similar that evidence in the cases tried by the jury including the convictions would be applicable to the non-jury counts.
<P>

<a name="40202-41_para3"></a>If I may, I shall go through each amendment in the hope that I will clarify the issues sufficiently. Amendments Nos. 57 and 58 are concerned with the conditions that must be fulfilled before the court may make an order for the trial of some of the counts in the indictment to be conducted without a jury.
<P>

<a name="40202-41_para4"></a>Amendment No. 57 replaces subsections (3) to (5) with a revised set of conditions that are expressed in what is arguably a simpler way. The only change of substance is the addition of a requirement that the counts should be for,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the same or similar offences".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-41_para5"></a>
In fact, that is already a requirement of the indictment rules which would apply to these provisions. Including it here would therefore add nothing. I am happy to give the noble Baroness that assurance, so that she knows that the matter is covered. However, it would not be sufficient to engage the two-stage trial procedure&#151;that the offences were, for example, all burglaries or thefts; rather, it is intended to apply, as the Law Commission proposed, to repeated instances of the same type of behaviour.
<P>


<a name="column_GC266"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC266</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-41_para6"></a>Amendments Nos. 58 and 58ZA would raise the threshold for an order for non-jury trial by requiring that trial by jury should be not merely "impracticable", which is the present wording, but so unmanageable that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it would not be possible to proceed",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-41_para7"></a>
or that it would "not be possible", which is the wording of Amendment No. 58ZA. Again, I understand what the noble Baroness seeks.
<P>

<a name="40202-41_para8"></a>"Not possible" is on the face of it a sterner test than "impracticable", but it is not clear what the practical impact of such a change would be. It is, I suggest, already fairly clear from the current wording that the number of counts included in the indictment must be such as to render trial by jury on all of them out of the question. The total number of counts in the cases for which we envisage that the procedure would be used is likely to be so great that it will be clear enough where the test has been met.
<P>

<a name="40202-41_para9"></a>Amendment No. 58A would introduce, in respect of the requirement in subsection (4) that some counts should be regarded as samples of others, a test that the judge must have determined at the preparatory hearing that they must be,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"sufficiently related to the other counts . . . as to be a sample".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-41_para10"></a>
That seems to us to add little as the existing requirement that a count must be a sample of other counts could hardly be satisfied unless it was related to them. The amendment also requires the judge to identify which counts are related to which sample counts, and Amendment No. 58C provides that non-jury trial of counts in the indictment may proceed only where the sample count has been linked to them.
<P>

<a name="40202-41_para11"></a>The requirement for the judge to identify which counts are related to which does not form part of the clause, but it accurately reflects what we would expect to happen. Clause 9(8) requires the judge, in making an order under subsection (2), to specify which counts are to be tried without a jury, and it is intended that he or she should also make clear to which sample counts&#151;if there are more than one&#151;those counts, or groups of counts, are related. It does not seem necessary to provide for this in primary legislation, although it may be appropriate for rules to cover the point.
<P>

<a name="40202-41_para12"></a>Amendment No. 58B provides that an application under Clause 9(l) can be made only before the defendant has been tried for any of the related counts. If that is designed to prevent ex-post facto applications after a trial has taken place on the basis of a limited indictment, it is superfluous because an application for an order under Clause 9 can be made only at a preparatory hearing. The idea is that at the preparatory hearing, the decision is made about how the trial is to be managed.
<P>

<a name="40202-41_para13"></a>Amendment No. 58BA removes subsection (7). Subsection (7) provides that the steps that might be taken to facilitate trial by jury, to which the court is to have regard in deciding whether to make an order under Clause 9, do not include steps that might lead to the defendant receiving a lower sentence. The provision in subsection (7) is essential, because it will inevitably be true in such cases that jury trial could <P>


<a name="column_GC267"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC267</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proceed if the number of counts in the indictment was reduced; the point is that doing so would prevent the clauses from achieving their objective of enabling convicted defendants to be sentenced for the whole range of their offending.
<P>

<a name="40202-41_para14"></a>We therefore think that we understand the exact import of what the noble Baroness has in mind. We think that the current drafting covers those concerns, especially when it is married with the rules that will support it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-41_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   Perhaps I may respond on Amendments Nos. 58ZA and 58. The feeling behind the amendments is that the use of "impracticable" rather than "not be possible" or "not be possible to proceed" may simply be a cost-saving exercise; and that "impracticable" may mean, "We cannot be bothered to spend the money and use the court time", whereas "not be possible to proceed" means something different. There is significance in that. If the Minister can give us an assurance that questions of cost do not come into consideration, I shall be happy; if they are the basis of the use of "impracticable", I shall be extremely unhappy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-41_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Let me make it absolutely plain that this is not a cost-saving exercise. The noble Lord will know from his involvement in cases where there is a large number of offences, prior to Kidd, that we have been able to take a sample of each species, as it were. For instance, in a case involving images taken from a computer, there may be 10 different types of images but thousands of images taken.
<P>

<a name="40202-41_para15"></a>What may be envisaged is that the 10 species&#151;one of each sample&#151;may be on the indictment, so that the court can test with a jury whether it is satisfied that the issues are made out. The samples would then be a proper representative of the other counts that follow. That makes the trial manageable, because one can identify the extent of the culpability in a way that is comprehensive&#151;that enables the jury to have its say&#151;but that puts off until the second stage the volume of offences.
<P>

<a name="40202-41_para16"></a>It would be impracticable, if not impossible&#151;and, we would argue, probably unnecessary&#151;to have a jury trial on the possibly thousands of similar cases that would fall within the different categories. Increasingly, there are repeat sample counts, but there must be a clear determination by the jury whether it thinks that the fundamental issues on each type of offence are or are not made out. That is what we are trying to catch.
<P>

<a name="40202-41_para17"></a>So will it be cheaper to have one trial with 10 counts than a series of trials dealing with 97,000 cases? Of course it will. But that will not be a cost-cutting exercise, although costs may be saved by not holding those trials. I hope that that satisfies the noble Lord.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-42_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I am most grateful for that assurance, which satisfies me. Further to the Minister's remarks, can she confirm that a sample count is a count where all the other counts of which it is a sample could amount to similar fact, for the <P>


<a name="column_GC268"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC268</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>purposes of a trial? That would at least place some limit on what is meant by a sample case. That is the usual situation with a sample count. Often, a sample count is taken but all the evidence relating to a course of conduct is introduced to prove that particular count. If we can confine a sample count to a situation where all the other counts are admissible on the similar fact principle, I should be grateful. Can the Minister give that assurance?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-42_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I am tempted to say yes, but the noble Lord and I know that the case law that clarifies what does or does not constitute similar fact has grown. If I say yes, as of today's date, 1 February, I think&#151;no, 2 February, 2003; no, 2004. I think I am a year and a day behind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-42_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   It is getting late.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-42_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The noble Lord is quite right; it is getting late, and I am getting older by the second.
<P>

<a name="40202-42_para0"></a>That is why I am uncomfortable about saying an unequivocal yes. We think that the current provision and what I said sufficiently clarifies the position to make plain that we are talking about similar offences, not using the provision as anything other than a sample. It may be unwise to limit it to similar fact only, because I am sure that at some stage, when there is a case under Pepper v Hart, people will say, "The noble Baroness surely meant similar fact as was determined by the jurisprudence that prevailed on this day; it does not include all the jurisprudence that has flowed thereafter". On a Pepper v Hart basis, I do include any such future developments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-42_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   It is always a pleasure to hear the noble Baroness say, "I do". Perhaps we can reconsider the point. It is important. It would not necessarily limit the position to the law today. If the law relating to similar fact is altered in future, what is today not a sample count could become one. Similar fact is rather a good test to determine exactly what order should be applied for and what order should be made.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-42_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I will certainly consider the matter. I may return with a similar response but more arguments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-42_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful for the support of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and my noble friends Lord Campbell of Alloway and Lord Carlisle of Bucklow for the objective of the amendments. I shall be brief on the various points, because it is clear that we will need to return to them constructively to ensure that we achieve our common objective.
<P>

<a name="40202-42_para1"></a>On sample counts, I am grateful for the Minister's assurances about the definition of same or similar being covered by indictment rules. I will not say that that is a reminder to me, because it is new to me&#151;this is not my field of operation. I will need carefully to <P>


<a name="column_GC269"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC269</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consider the definition of sample counts, because the Law Commission was careful in its handling of the definition, and we must be equally careful.
<P>

<a name="40202-42_para2"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for her outright assurance that the provisions for jury trials in no way encroach on the previous assurances given regarding Section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. However, I shall have to return to the issue of impracticability. I heard with great pleasure the Minister's examples of what could and could not be impracticable and ensuring that we are not considering a cost-saving exercise, because we all want to ensure that trials that would not take place at present do so.
<P>

<a name="40202-42_para3"></a>I was interested to note that when the Minister talked about definitions of sample counts, she earlier said that they were to be repeated instances of the same type of behaviour; and referred later to the downloading of computer images. I refer to that at this point only to give advance warning of what I shall say when speaking to Amendment No. 61A. The Minister has repeatedly drawn our attention to the appalling crime of commissioning the downloading of images of child pornography. That immediately elicits the support of all noble Lords for the Government. However, on reading the report from the Law Commission, I note that it states specifically that that is the kind of offence for which the multiple offending provisions set out in Clauses 9 to 12 are not necessary.

<A NAME="40202-42_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Before the noble Baroness withdraws her amendment, when she refers to "compound allegations" I should say that there is a real argument about whether such cases would not be better dealt with on a compound basis. No doubt we shall return to the matter, but for the moment this could be a route.

<FONT SIZE=3>agreement. Basically, the reason why I am opposing Clause 9 is set out in Amendment No. 61. It is an attempt to solve the problem in a simple way; that is, resorting to an extension of existing procedures. However, what is set out in Clauses 9, 10, 11 and 12 is a very complex approach to the problem. There are provisions for jury trials, non-jury trials and so forth. Without pre-empting the merits of my own amendment, to which I hope that I shall have leave to speak on another occasion, perhaps I may withdraw my Motion to oppose that Clause 9 should stand part of the Bill. Perhaps I may also register my intention not to oppose the Motion that Clauses 10 to 12 should stand part. I wished formally to make the point here.

"(7) Nothing in this Part permits the prosecution to proceed with a new prosecution on linked allegations on the basis that the trial judge considers that an acquittal by a jury was perverse or erroneous."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40202-42_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment moves on to another nuance of the provisions of the multiple offending clauses. Its objective is to ask the Minister to explain how the Government's proposals overcome the concern expressed by the Law Commission in paragraph 7.11 of its report. It points out that, following an acquittal on a sample count, there would be a presumption in favour of a directed acquittal on the linked counts. It states that there should be a presumption rather than an invariable rule because it is possible in certain cases that an acquittal on a sample count may be returned without a true investigation of the facts. It gives some practical examples of that with which I shall not weary the Committee.
<P>

<a name="40202-42_para14"></a>The Law Commission goes on to state that the trial judge should not be permitted to allow the prosecution to proceed with a new prosecution on linked allegations on the basis that he or she considers that the acquittal by the jury was either perverse or erroneous. It then states, in emboldened print, that express provision should be made to this effect. My amendment makes that express provision and simply asks the Government why they decided not to follow such a clear indication by the Law Commission. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-42_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I support the amendment if the clause is to stand part. In this context, I support the sample count being identified with the concept of a similar fact situation. I see no difficulty. The law starts with a chap wearing feathers&#151;it always does&#151;but it will develop within the same mode relating to the concept of a sample count. I see no worry about the law developing; I see <P>


<a name="column_GC271"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>every advantage, evidentially and otherwise. As the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, suggested, it should relate to the concept of similar fact.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-42_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   One would hope that a trial judge would not demand that the prosecution proceed with linked allegations following an acquittal. On the other hand, even today, trial judges cannot sometimes resist the temptation to indicate their displeasure. I heard recently of a judge who demands that, following an acquittal, the convictions of the acquitted person are read to the jury before he discharges them, indicating thereby his displeasure at their result. I consider that to be shocking behaviour. It takes us back 30, 40 or 50 years and I hope that it is not repeated. A safeguard of this nature is desirable in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-43_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I can reassure noble Lords that nothing in the clauses as currently drafted is intended to permit, or could be interpreted as permitting, a prosecution to take place in these circumstances. It is clear that a non-jury trial can proceed only where the jury has convicted the defendant of a relevant sample count. If there is an acquittal the presumption would be that the judge would direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty of the related counts still on the indictment.
<P>

<a name="40202-43_para0"></a>The Law Commission recommended that it should be open to the Crown, as it is now in such circumstances, to try to persuade the judge that the outstanding counts could or should be ordered to lie on the file. That would be done only in exceptional circumstances. The example cited by the Law Commission is where the acquittal was due to the absence through ill health of a leading prosecution witness. We have concluded, however, that it would be better not to make specific provision for what should happen to the remaining counts but to rely on the established law. It is clear that a directed acquittal will normally be the right outcome. However, there may be the odd case where the Crown chooses to ask that a count should lie on the file, as it already has the power to do. The Law Commission accepted that it should retain such a power.
<P>

<a name="40202-43_para1"></a>Our view is that we do not need to make a specific provision about the matter in the Bill. It follows from that decision about ordering counts to lie on the file that there is no need to give effect to the Law Commission's recommendation that a judge should not be permitted to order a count to lie on the file where he considered the acquittal to be perverse or erroneous. That delivers what the Law Commission wanted to see in an appropriate way. I hope that I have been able to reassure members of the Committee through the unequivocal way in which I have expressed the Government's view.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-43_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, for his support. I was trying to ensure a desirable safeguard, as he called it. However, I hear very clearly the Minister's assurance that it would be right to have a directed acquittal as a normal outcome. I understand <P>


<a name="column_GC272"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC272</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>exactly what she says&#151;that in some circumstances there would still be a requirement that the CPS should be able to leave matters to lie on the file&#151;but that is normal in current jury trials. However, we are now going into a judge-alone trial and we need to consider how much of a matter of practice that might become.
<P>

<a name="40202-43_para2"></a>The Law Commission refers to the example cited by the noble Baroness where, due to ill health, one might have a trial limp on in the absence of a witness, which is not very satisfactory in terms of hearing the evidence. I understand that. I am grateful to her.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-43_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   Did my noble friend understand the Minister to say that it would be normal that, if the person had been acquitted on the selected count, the judge would direct an acquittal on the rest of the counts of that nature? Is she satisfied that that is in the Bill at the moment? If so, perhaps she could persuade the Minister to tell us where that is in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-43_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I seek clarification. Let us suppose that an application were made for a count to lie on the file and, for some reason, the prosecution wished to proceed with that count at some later stage. I take it that the Minister can assure us that the ordinary procedure would apply and that it would not be subject at that stage to a trial by judge alone.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-43_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   In response to my noble friend, I am still not convinced that the information that we seek is clearly in the Bill, which is why I need to come back to the matter later. However, I want to be as open as I can in accepting the assurances of the Minister. When we go into such uncharted waters, although we are all trying to achieve the same good outcome, we need to be sure that along the way we do not let things slide through lack of proper scrutiny. I assure my noble friend that I will return to the matter. I also heard what the Minister said about rules of court&#151;that there are some occasions when one needs something on the face of the Bill which cannot be left to rules of court. We shall have to consider that issue. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40202-43_para3"></a>We are quite unequivocal that, before one can move on to deal with the second stage of the trial, one needs a conviction. So if there was no conviction of that sample but the court had exceptionally permitted to lie on the file&#151;because of, for example, the illness of a witness who may become well&#151;we would expect there to be a jury trial on a new sample count before one could then move on to the remainder. That is what we would expect to happen. The usual rules in regard to reactivating offences that lie on the file would also apply.

<a name="40202-43_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: Paragraph 60 of the Explanatory Notes states that Clause 10,
<P>
<br>

<P>

<a name="40202-43_para9"></a>
The intriguing issue is that the Explanatory Notes state that the provision is "likely" to be supplemented. The noble Baroness will of course be expecting the usual question&#151;that is, can she explain the circumstances in which the Government would envisage that rules of court would not be made? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-43_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I accept the spirit in which the question is teasingly asked. Clause 12 provides, as such provisions usually do, that rules of court may make such provision as appears necessary. In practice, rules will need to be made, but I am not persuaded that there is any advantage in departing from the customary formula. But, if it reassures the noble Baroness, I cannot at the moment think of any circumstances in which rules would not be made in accordance with the normal practice.

 "MULTI-COUNT INDICTMENTS
<br>
(1) A procedure to reduce complexity and length of trial on multi-count indictments in the interests of due and expeditious dispensation of justice on implementation of these provisions shall be introduced by Rules of Court to ensure that appropriate directions as to the form of indictment and on other matters arising on the depositions shall be given by a judge of the Crown Court at a pre-trial hearing, subject to review by the trial judge before arraignment.
<br>
(2) Before the pre-trial hearing, a judge of the Crown Court shall have considered whether on the depositions the form of indictment is appropriate in the interests of due and expeditious dispensation of justice, and whether certain directions such as set out in subsection (3) should be given, and if he is of such provisional opinion shall so inform the prosecution and the defence in writing when a date is given for the pre-trial hearing.
<br>
(3) At the pre-trial hearing, or at the trial before arraignment, the judge having entertained representations from the prosecution and the defence may give such directions which may include&#151;
<br>
(a) severance of certain counts with directions for trial on such other counts;
<br>
(b) designation of sample counts with directions that other counts lie on the file;
<br>
(c) election as to whether to proceed on substantive counts or on conspiracy counts which replicate the substance;
<br>
(d) provision of particulars of any count;
<br>
(e) amendment of indictment;

(f) such other directions as may be appropriate in the interests of due and expeditious dispensation of justice.

<a name="40202-43_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: I am much obliged to the Committee.

One must be extremely careful, when considering a provision of general application, to get it right. One accepts, of course, that something must be done about sample <P>


<a name="column_GC275"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC275</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>counts, but the procedure proposed in Clauses 9 to 11 is extremely complex and cumbersome&#151;unnecessarily so.
<P>

<a name="40202-43_para14"></a>I have sought, in this probing amendment, to amend the existing procedures to deal with the problem of multi-count indictments and the decision about not taking into account matters left on the file. It would introduce a procedure to reduce complexity and length of trial on a multi-count indictment, in the interests of expedition and dispensation of justice. The provisions of this amendment would be introduced by rules of court to ensure that appropriate directions as to the form of indictment and on other matters arising on the depositions should be given by a judge of the Crown Court at a pre-trial hearing. Pre-trial hearings take place at present. It is right to use that machinery for that purpose, subject to review by the trial judge.
<P>

<a name="40202-43_para15"></a>Using the pre-trial hearing, a judge of the Crown Court must consider whether on the depositions the form of indictment is appropriate in the interests of due and expeditious dispensation of justice, and whether certain directions should be given. The proposed new clause provides that, if he is of that opinion, he shall so inform the prosecution and the defence in writing when a date is given for the pre-trial hearing.
<P>

<a name="40202-43_para16"></a>This is a novel proposal, extending the extant procedure. At the pre-trial hearing, or at the trial before arraignment, directions given may include those given at present on a pre-trial hearing: severance of certain counts with directions for trial on other counts, and designation of sample counts with directions that other counts lie on the file, which is accepted as a procedure by the commission. Another possible direction is election as to whether to proceed on substantive counts or on conspiracy counts which replicate the substance. That can save a lot of time and do away with the length and complexity of jury trial. The judge can also order the provision of particulars; amendments to the indictment; or give other directions. Finally, the panel could be appointed by the Lord Chancellor or judges designated to conduct the hearings.
<P>

<a name="40202-43_para17"></a>That is the proposition which I have moved. I am grateful for having been allowed to do so. I hope that Members of the Committee may consider that, at all events, in principle, this is a simpler and more appropriate way to proceed, by using extant procedure and extending it to meet the circumstance.
<P>

<a name="40202-43_para18"></a>Of course, it will not appeal to the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, but there it is. I would suggest that it is a matter worthy of consideration as a fairly simple and straightforward means of resolution of the problem that has to be faced. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40202-44_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   Perhaps I may support my noble friend Lord Campbell on what he said at the beginning of his remarks. It is something that has been disturbing me, as I said earlier&#151;on Clause 6, I think. In a Bill described as the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill, we are inserting clauses that go far wider than domestic violence and affect and change the whole basic law in certain areas of the country.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-44_para0"></a>This is another classic example where, to deal with the problem of Kidd, which I accept exists, we are using a domestic violence Bill to answer the problem of Kidd, when, in fact, the Law Commission says that it is really fraud cases that give it concern.
<P>

<a name="40202-44_para1"></a>I have now found the quotation that I could not find when I was last on my feet. Paragraph 2.9 of the Law Commission report, dealing with the case of Kidd and the comments made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The logic and correctness in principle of this decision"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-44_para2"></a>
that is, the earlier decision&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"cannot be faulted and we do not seek to do so".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-44_para3"></a>
That is, of course, the decision that we cannot sentence on offences for which a person has not been convicted or has asked to be taken into consideration. It continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"However, at a stroke it created major problems for dealing with much high volume offending. Lord Bingham pointed out that: Prosecution authorities will wish, in the light of this decision and the Reg. v. Clark, to include more counts in some indictments. We do not think this need be unduly burdensome or render the trial unmanageable. The indictment in Reg. v. Kidd&#151;

<a name="40202-44_para4"></a>
that was a case of sexual offences&#151;

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-44_para5"></a>
That was what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, said.
<P>

<a name="40202-44_para6"></a>In paragraph 2.10 of the report, the Law Commission states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"While this is unlikely to create an insurmountable problem in sexual offence cases, the decision creates obvious problems in cases of multiple theft and deception where the total sum involved is highly relevant to sentence. In such cases, the decision of Kidd"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-44_para7"></a>
and then it deals with that. In other words, the Law Commission says that the problem is not so much in the area of domestic violence. The problem is mainly to be found in the area of fraud. We must be careful that we do not insert into the Bill matters which should be in a wider criminal justice Bill and which do not directly involve the issues in this Bill.

He was the first of us to come forward with the proposal that we should be able to explore alternative solutions to the problem of Kidd. He has brought his considerable experience and expertise over many years at the Bar and as a judge to bear on the amendment. As he says, it provides a simpler alternative.
<P>

<a name="40202-44_para8"></a>As my noble friend Lord Carlisle said, my noble friend Lord Campbell also directs our attention very properly to the fact that the Bill goes far broader than domestic violence. It is a Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill, so no doubt the Minister will say, "The matter is within the title; we've told you it's about crime. Crime covers just about everything, so you've been warned. We could 'Christmas-tree' it until kingdom come if we wanted to". Indeed, we know that <P>

My noble friends were right to direct us to the broad application of the Bill. My noble friend Lord Carlisle may have more to say on the Christmas tree than on almost anything else in the Bill, if and when we see the part of it to which he has a deep objection.
<P>

<a name="40202-44_para9"></a>My noble friend Lord Campbell made it clear that he is trying to make very good use of the pre-trial hearing. That is a very interesting way to direct our attention. I shall be interested to hear how the Minister responds on that, as it is a relatively new development and has been lauded as trying to make the system more efficient. I am not so sure whether all practitioners quite believe that all the time.

<a name="40202-44_para10"></a>The real question has to be whether the Government considered a proposal such as that put forward by my noble friend. I would have hoped that they did before deciding to go down the avenue that they chose. If they considered his solution, why did they reject it? What were their reasons? If they did not, will they do so now?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-44_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   When the then Criminal Justice Bill was before us last Session, I supported the Government on the proposition that in fraud cases the defence had the right either to apply to or agree with the court to dispense with the jury for the rest of the case. However, it worries me that this Bill deals with a far wider sphere in which juries can be dispensed with. Also, it is a bit too vague, so I very much support what my noble friends have said. I hope that the Minister will realise that the matter is very important. She should keep an open mind about it at the moment. She needs to make the provisions of the Bill more precise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-44_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I really want to assure the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, that the problem is not that the provisions would not attract me. However, if one looks at Kidd and how it was decided, one sees that the old way of dealing with such cases&#151;quite frankly, it was very practical and solicitous&#151;did not attract the Court of Appeal. That is the reality of our position as a result of Kidd. Although it has impeccable logic in terms of the legal construct that it propounds, it has presented us all with some practical difficulties.
<P>

<a name="40202-44_para11"></a>What I shall say in answer to the noble Baroness is this. Was this type of approach considered? Yes, it was. Was it disregarded for falling foul of similar objections to that which were evidenced in Kidd? The answer to that is also yes. Can we reasonably anticipate that it will find favour with the courts? The answer is no. Therefore we have to think about what will find favour, and that is why the Law Commission spent a considerable time crafting the scheme we have set out.
<P>

<a name="40202-44_para12"></a>Let me say at once that I do not think this clause would be of much assistance in the kind of case for which Clauses 9 to 12 have been designed. We are concerned here with offending conduct which is repeated so many times that there are far too many <P>


<a name="column_GC278"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC278</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>individual offences to be accommodated in a single jury trial. This kind of offending would once have been dealt with by trying a defendant on "specimen counts" and, where there was a conviction, sentencing for a wider range of offending.
<P>

<a name="40202-44_para13"></a>The kind of scheme put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, is very similar to that which we used to have. Perhaps, quite naturally, it is attractive to me as a practitioner familiar with that type of regime, but in practice it has implicitly been disapproved of in Kidd and Others on the ground that it involved sentencing an offender for offences of which he had not been convicted, had not pleaded guilty to, and had not agreed to have taken into consideration. This decision creates a particular problem in cases such as multiple theft and multiple fraud.
<P>

<a name="40202-44_para14"></a>I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, as foreshadowed by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, that the Long Title of the Bill includes an opportunity to deal with this matter. That was obviously evidenced by the noble Baroness when she introduced her provisions in relation to common assault. She would have said to me then that she had taken advice and it could be included. We need to grapple with the fact that this is a perfectly proper place. To that end, when this matter was considered during the passage of the criminal justice Bill it was thought that if it did not go through in that Bill, it would find a new and soon-to-arrive vehicle on which it could hitch a ride.
<P>

<a name="40202-44_para15"></a>The clause moved by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, unfortunately would not solve any of the problems with which we are now faced as a result of Kidd: the problems of manageability, cost and sentencing which arise in cases of this kind remain. Where there are dozens, or possibly hundreds, of counts, severance is basically of no use. The type of sample counts as provided for in subsection (3)(b) will no longer work, and conspiracy may not be relevant.
<P>

<a name="40202-44_para16"></a>As much as I would have loved to have been able to say yes to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, as a practical pragmatist, I have to say no because although this proposal may persuade me, I doubt whether it would find favour with the Court of Appeal, which has already expressed its view fairly unequivocally.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-44_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I thank all noble Lords who have spoken, in particular my noble friends Lady Anelay and Lord Carlisle, and most of all the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, who I knew would not be able to accept the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40202-44_para17"></a>But the Minister is wrong about her cardinal point that the amendment would run into trouble and not in effect give credence to Kidd. This is not the time of day or night to begin that argument in any depth, but I do not accept for one moment that that is the situation. Indeed, it was crafted to deal with it precisely in the way identified by the noble Baroness&#151;and that was the way in which matters were run in the days of the assize.

<A NAME="40202-45_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 61A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 12, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202-45_para0"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 COMPOUND ALLEGATIONS
<br>
(1) The Crown Court Rule Committee shall make rules of court under section 84 of the Supreme Court 1981 (c. 54) (power to make rules of court) to make provision for the trial of compound allegations and, in particular, the rules shall provide&#151;
<br>
(a) a definition of "continuous activity" suitable to be tried as a compound allegation;
<br>
(b) a procedure for informing the sentencer in the Crown Court of the true extent of the guilt of a defendant who is found guilty by the jury of the compound allegation.
<br>
(2) The definition referred to in subsection (1)(a) shall include the same conduct occurring on series of separate occasions or the same repeated conduct which, looked at in the round, may properly be regarded as one activity.
<br>
(3) The procedure referred to in subsection (1)(b) shall provide that the procedure may only be applied&#151;
<br>
(a) where the allegation involves&#151;
<br>
(i) two or more similar offences;
<br>
(ii) connected by time and place of commission or common purpose (typically, the same act committed against the same victim), so that;
<br>
(iii) they can fairly be recognised as forming part of the same transaction or criminal enterprise; and
<br>
(iv) having regard to the allegations made and the defence put forward that, save for particular marginal issues, it may fairly be said to be an all or nothing case; and
<br>
(b) where the case has been identified at a preparatory hearing as appropriate for the use of a compound allegation.
<br>
(4) The procedure referred to in subsection (1)(b) shall include provision that&#151;
<br>
(a) in order to convict of the count containing the compound allegation, all (or at least 10) of the jury must agree that they are sure that the defendant committed the alleged offending on at least one (the same) occasion;
<br>
(b) in order to acquit, all (or at least 10) of the jury must agree that they are less than sure that the defendant committed the alleged offence on any occasion at all;
<br>
(c) if the jury is unable to attain the level of agreement either to convict or acquit, then there may be a retrial;
<br>
(d) if, but only if, the jury has convicted in accordance with paragraph (a) then the jury must be asked, for sentencing purposes, to clarify the extent of that offending by identifying any occasion or occasions of alleged offending where it is unable, by a sufficient majority, to agree that it is sure of guilt, and any occasion so identified is to be discounted by the judge in measuring the appropriate sentence.
<br>
(5) The rules to be made under subsection (1) may also provide&#151;
<br>
(a) directions for the judge to follow at a preparatory hearing under subsection (3)(b), including but not limited to the appropriate scope and form of an indictment for a compound allegation; and
<br>
(b) directions for the judge as to the summing up and direction of the jury at the end of a trial of a compound allegation.
<br>
(6) The Crown Court Rule Committee shall make rules of court under section 2 of the Indictments Act 1915 (c. 90) (powers of rule committee) and section 84 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (c. 54) <P>

<FONT SIZE=2>to provide that offences under the Protection of Children Act 1978 (c. 37) may be tried as compound allegations, and for the purpose of this subsection, the Rule Committee may by order amend or repeal provisions of the 1915 Act."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40202-45_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am willing to move the amendment but I put on the record now that I was disturbed last week that, as a result of agreeing to the Government's request that I should continue with the last group on the Energy Bill, I then received a round robin e-mail from the Government Chief Whip's office, directed to all Opposition Front-Benchers, stating that representations had been made by Hansard to the Government objecting to my and other people's agreements to continuation. I shall obey the Government Whip's injunction that we should continue beyond 7.30 p.m. but I apologise completely and utterly to Hansard. It's not me, guv.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-45_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My response will be pithy and short. If the noble Baroness takes two minutes and I take one&#151;and noble Lords are content with that&#151;we can probably complete it by half-past seven.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-45_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I shall be as brief as possible within the context of not insulting the Law Commission by omitting its arguments. I shall do my best.
<P>

<a name="40202-45_para2"></a>At the risk of using up another 30 seconds, Opposition Front Bench spokesmen are concerned that the Government circulated that message. I know that the Minister will have had no cognisance of it but we on the Front Benches do not have governance of the business of the House. We always side with Hansard, which is much tested and tried&#151; particularly by me going on now.
<P>

<a name="40202-45_para3"></a>I have tabled the amendments because I believe it is important to ask the Government to put on record why they have rejected the Law Commission's recommendations in paragraph 6.9 of their report No. 277, The Effective Prosecution of Multiple Offending. I am particularly grateful to the Public Bill Office for its drafting of the amendment because it was not part of the draft Bill produced by the Law Commission. However, it faithfully mirrors the recommendations made in the report.
<P>

<a name="40202-45_para4"></a>I referred earlier, at Second Reading and subsequently today, to the fact that the Government have stressed the importance of their multiple offending trial without jury proposals for the effective prosecution and sentencing of offences such as the downloading of large quantities of child pornography. I shall not repeat what I said earlier. The Law Commission states that these multiple offending proposals are specifically not necessary for those offences of downloading of pornographic material involving children.
<P>

<a name="40202-45_para5"></a>Paragraph 6.9 of the report states that in its view such offences are capable of being charged under the present law by way of a compound allegation. It goes on to say that if it is thought appropriate to crystallise these principles so as to make them clearly applicable to offending rather than theft or fraud, it may be achieved by a change in the indictment rules.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40202-45_para6"></a>Can the Minister explain what advice the Government received that persuaded them that the Law Commission was wrong?
<P>

<a name="40202-45_para7"></a>Turning to the text of the amendment, it gives direction to the Crown Court Rule Committee to make rules of court to provide for the trial of compound allegations. The rules should define what is meant by "continuous activity". The intention is that, as a result, it would be possible for a host of offences of downloading child pornography and other such matters to be described as a "continuous activity". So, for example, the allegation would need to involve offences that were connected by time and place of action or were connected by purpose.
<P>

<a name="40202-45_para8"></a>The amendment follows the argument of the Law Commission as to the procedure to be followed regarding the effective communication of the jury's decision to the judge, at paragraphs 6.10 to 6.14&#151;I shall not go into those now&#151;and the procedure at preliminary hearings, at paragraphs 6.15 to 6.17, which I also will not summarise due to time. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-45_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I hope that I will be as telegraphic as the noble Baroness. She is quite correct that, in addition to its proposals for the two-stage trials in certain cases, the Law Commission made recommendations for dealing with what it refers to as "compound allegations"; that is, cases involving offences so similar that they can be regarded as part of the same transaction. The examples it used included false expenses claimed repeatedly and regularly by an employee against his employer.
<P>

<a name="40202-45_para9"></a>This clause makes statutory provision for the scheme proposed by the Law Commission and closely follows the Law Commission's recommendations. I <P>


<a name="column_GC282"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column GC282</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>commend the noble Baroness on doing that. However, it is not clear that statutory provision is in fact required. The Law Commission thought not. But we are still considering the detail of the recommendations and will consider further the extent to which, if at all, it might be necessary to resort to primary legislation. I hope that that makes the comment worth waiting for.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-45_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   It does&#151;and we are not late by much. That sounds very flippant, but I am grateful to the Minister for letting us know that the Government are considering the detail of those proposals. I certainly have meetings arranged, between the Committee and Report stages, with organisations interested in the Law Commission's solution to the problem of multiple offending and I will look carefully at their proposals at that stage. It may well be that the Government will not tell us the outcome for a considerable time. Perhaps I will have to re-table the amendment on Report to give them a chance to respond. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40202-45_para10"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-45_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I pay tribute to the Committee and thank everyone for their co-operation. I reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, that I would not have dreamed of going on until eight o'clock and upsetting Hansard a second time. I was with her on that objective. I think that she will recognise that we have concluded the Committee's proceedings at a convenient point. I look forward to the Committee's next sitting on Thursday 5 February at 3.15 p.m.

<A NAME="40202-46_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  Following consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry recently approved a further licence to export military list goods to Iraq. The arms embargo against Iraq remains in place under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 (2003), with the exception of "arms and other related material required by the (Coalition Provisional) Authority to serve the purposes of this and other related resolutions". Accordingly, Her Majesty's Government consider it appropriate to grant exemptions for the export of riot shields which are to be used by Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) peacekeeping forces in Iraq. The export is consistent with the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria. Future applications will continue to be assessed on a case-by-case basis against the UN embargo and consolidated criteria, taking into account the circumstances prevailing at the time.

<P>
<P>
<UL><P></UL>




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-46_spmin2"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  I am pleased to be able to announce today the Government's initial response to <i>The New and the Old</i>, the report of the Life in the United Kingdom advisory group, chaired by Professor Sir Bernard Crick, which was published on 3 September 2003. The group was established in order to advise the Government on the best way of implementing the provisions in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which would require prospective British citizens to demonstrate knowledge of English, Welsh or Gaelic and of life in the United Kingdom. I repeat today the warm welcome we gave to the report on its appearance and my thanks to Sir Bernard and his fellow members of the advisory group.
<P>

<a name="40202-46_para0"></a>I will be placing in the Library of the House our responses to each of the recommendations; I summarise below our conclusions on what we consider to be the most important of the report's recommendations.
<P>

<a name="40202-46_para1"></a>We agree that the programme of citizenship studies should be drawn up under the six broad headings of British national institutions in recent historical context, Britain as a diverse society, knowing the law, employment, sources of help and information, and everyday needs. We also accept that a bilingual handbook on life in the United Kingdom should be prepared for the information of all who apply at posts abroad for entry clearance in a category which leads to <P>


<a name="column_WS14"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column WS14</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>settlement, and work on the preparation of such a handbook is already well advanced under the auspices of the advisory group.
<P>

<a name="40202-46_para2"></a>We accept the group's reasons for concluding that the language criterion for citizenship should be satisfied by evidence that a person has made measurable progress in his or her studies, rather than insisting on a single standard for everyone. For most applicants who are not already fluent, this would mean that they would be required to progress by one English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) level. As a minimum, those with no workable English, or one of the other UK languages, would be expected to progress at least to a basic level of competence.
<P>

<a name="40202-46_para3"></a>The advisory group also recommended that free assessments and tuition should be made available to all who have a route to indefinite leave to remain. The report points out that knowledge of English in particular greatly increases employment prospects, leading to less welfare dependence and greater integration into society. At the same time, the potential cost of full implementation is very high, and the Government cannot undertake to fund it in full in advance of the outcome of next year's spending review. We will study further both the possibility of full implementation of this recommendation and possible alternative ways of targeting our resources on those most in need of help in acquiring linguistic skills, and we will announce our conclusions as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="40202-46_para4"></a>In addition, and in advance of the spending review, we are continuing with development work on possible means of assessment, delivery mechanisms, and the programmes of study themselves. We will explore the practicalities of piloting language with citizenship programmes from within existing resources in some areas.
<P>

<a name="40202-46_para5"></a>Finally, the advisory group proposed that an advisory board on preparation for naturalisation should be set up. The functions of such an advisory board would expand over time, as the 2002 legislation is implemented, but its early tasks would be to advise on the development of resources for the citizenship curriculum and to oversee the process of implementation of the 2002 legislation. The board may have a role in negotiations with the devolved areas of the UK on how they would wish these proposals to be implemented there. We have agreed in principle to the setting up of the board.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202-46_spmin4"></A><B>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Lord Rooker): </B>  My right honourable friend the First Secretary of State and Deputy Prime Minister has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
<P>

<a name="40202-46_para8"></a>I have published today a second progress report on the &#163;22 billion Sustainable Communities Plan, titled <i>Making it Happen: The Northern Way</i>. It looks at the successes since the Communities Plan was published in February 2003, and at the challenges still to come. This follows on from the first statement, published in July 2003 on the Thames Gateway and the growth areas.
<P>

<a name="40202-46_para9"></a>The statement reports on the action being taken to regenerate our established urban and rural communities in the north and the midlands. It recognises the new confidence and energy that can be found in many of our northern and midland towns and cities, and seeks to build on this.
<P>

<a name="40202-46_para10"></a>We recognise that establishing sustainable communities in the north is as much about economic growth and employment as it is in the rest of the country. The statement makes clear that the north needs a long-term vision to exploit fully the economic and transport corridors connecting it&#151;a "Northern Way", which looks east to west as well as north to south.
<P>

<a name="40202-46_para11"></a>This idea of a Northern Way&#151;a bold vision that exploits the economic and transport corridors that bind the north&#151;is an example of the new ways of thinking that we need to tap the potential of the north.
<P>

<a name="40202-46_para12"></a>We are convinced of the potential for an economic renaissance in the north, and we have pledged to work <P>


<a name="column_WS16"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column WS16</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with the RDAs and the regional planning bodies to develop this vision, together with other key partners. This is alongside the other work that the Government are already doing to improve the relative economic performance of the north.
<P>

<a name="40202-46_para13"></a>The report I am launching today offers a vision for renewal and growth that will bring the jobs, investment and renewed housing that can create truly sustainable communities across the northern regions.
<P>

<a name="40202-46_para14"></a>We are working to revive communities, renew the homes and rebuild the streets in the areas most affected by abandonment and decay. I am announcing today that the Merseyside market renewal pathfinder will receive &#163;86 million and that the Newcastle/Gateshead market renewal pathfinder will receive &#163;69 million until March 2006 to help to tackle the terrible problems caused by low demand. This is in addition to an allocation of &#163;4 million each for an early action programme.
<P>

<a name="40202-46_para15"></a>By March 2006, Merseyside expects to deliver: the demolition of over 2,700 redundant and obsolete homes, the refurbishment of 325 homes, over 1,600 new homes built and the widespread delivery of additional management measures designed to overcome the problems of low demand.
<P>

<a name="40202-46_para16"></a>By March 2006, Newcastle/Gateshead expects to deliver: the demolition of almost 2,000 redundant and obsolete properties, 100 new homes built, over 2,000 homes refurbished, and around seven hectares of land acquired for potential later development.
<P>

<a name="40202-46_para17"></a>Other announcements today include:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="40202-46_para18"></a>27 pilot areas have been identified to receive a share of the &#163;89 million Liveability Fund, and these are listed in the progress report. This will help them to develop innovative models for delivering a high quality local environment.


<P>

<a name="40202-46_para19"></a>We are creating a 16th urban regeneration company in Gloucester. Initial targets are to provide 3,000 new homes and 2,000 new jobs and to attract up to &#163;400 million of private sector investment over 10 years.


<P>

<A NAME="40202-47_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Lord Filkin): </B>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, David Lammy, has today announced a package of measures, which will help to achieve better value for money in the legal aid system while ensuring that help continues to go to those who need it most.
<P>

<a name="40202-47_para23"></a>The package draws upon proposals contained in the consultation paper on the Criminal Defence Service (CDS) <i>Delivering Value for Money in the Criminal Defence Service</i>, which was published last year. After considering the responses to the consultation my honourable friend intends to introduce the following changes to the CDS:

<A NAME="40202w01_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What has been the progress on the development of a tertiary education campus on the Springvale site in North West Belfast.[HL691]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202w01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   The Springvale Project was to be a joint venture between the University of Ulster and the Belfast Institute of Further and Higher Education, comprising a joint further education/higher education campus, an outreach facility and an applied research centre to promote the economic, social, cultural and educational regeneration of North and West Belfast. The Outreach and Applied Research Centres were to be delivered by conventional procurement means with the joint campus being procured via a private finance initiative project.
<P>

<a name="40202w01_para0"></a>The Outreach Facility has been delivered with funding from the Millennium Commission and the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>International Fund for Ireland. It has been operational since May 2002.
<P>

<a name="40202w01_para1"></a>Difficulties arose in the preparation of the outline business case for the main campus with the University of Ulster declaring the project unaffordable in capital and recurrent terms. The university declared its intention to withdraw from the project, following which further development of the Applied Research Centre was put on hold.
<P>

<a name="40202w01_para2"></a>Following the university's withdrawal, the Springvale Board was asked to carry out a review of the project. The review has just been completed and endorsed by the Springvale Board. The report was forwarded to Jane Kennedy, Minister with Responsibility for Employment and Learning, on 13 January 2004. As part of the review process, the Belfast Institute has put forward proposals for a centre, adjacent to the Outreach Centre, that will focus on workforce development and business start-up. The Minister will consider the proposals brought forward in the review and will make a statement in due course.

<P>
<A NAME="40202w01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Amos:  </B>  The Government are committed to improving security for older people in Northern Ireland. The Minister with responsibility for Criminal Justice issues in Northern Ireland, John Spellar, launched two initiatives in October 2003. The Lock Out Crime Scheme will supply and fit free of charge over the next two years, physical security measures for people aged 75 and over in receipt of benefits, living in areas of high domestic burglary. A television advertisement giving information to older people about the most appropriate way to answer their doors to unknown callers was screened, also in October 2003.
<P>

<a name="40202w01_para3"></a>In addition, a community safety strategy for older people will be issued for consultation in February 2004. Already through the Community Safety Challenge competition, 14 projects have been funded within local areas which include improving security for older people as one of their key themes. These projects are valued at &#163;400,000.
<P>

<a name="40202w01_para4"></a>Finally, the police have developed a number of initiatives to tackle crime against older people including, holding a conference in early March 2004 which will focus on crime issues relating to older people, the development of a control strategy covering crimes against older persons, the introduction of vulnerable persons registers in some district command units, the analysis of crime patterns to improve information about those criminals targeting older people and supplying advice as required.

Also, consultees urged government to take action to reduce tension and conflict at interface areas and support the development of integrated/shared communities where people wish to learn, live, work and play together.
<P>

<a name="40202w02_para0"></a>Government are considering the outcome of the consultation and will bring forward proposals later this year on a new policy for improving relations in Northern Ireland.

<A NAME="40202w02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   A cohesive community is a peaceful, inclusive, stable and fair society, firmly founded on the achievement of reconciliation, tolerance, mutual trust and the protection and vindication of human rights for all. It is based on partnership, equality and mutual respect as the basis of good relationships. A cohesive community is one in which everyone has the chance to fulfil their potential.

<a name="40202w02_para1"></a>Northern Ireland remains a deeply divided society with patterns of fear that have become ingrained. However, promoting equality of opportunity and justice for all, building trust and confidence between and within communities, developing social capital and tackling racism and sectarianism remain key priorities for government.
<P>

<a name="40202w02_para2"></a>The Government will pursue these priorities through a broad range of policies and programmes which are set out in the published document Priorities and Budget 2004&#150;06. These include the putting in place of a new policy and strategy to promote good relations, further measures to combat poverty and social exclusion, a neighbourhood renewal programme, the development of targeted employment initiatives tailored to meet local needs through partnership working and steps to facilitate the growth of the community and voluntary sector to increase its business strength and create a supportive enabling environment.

<P>
<UL>Further to the Written Statement by the Lord President on 13 January (WS 19&#150;24) on Northern Ireland priorities and budget 2004&#150;06, what extra resources they will provide to the voluntary and community sector.[HL885]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202w02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   The Government recognise the key contribution of the voluntary and community sector in Northern Ireland. It is not possible to identify the specific allocations that all departments may make to the voluntary and community sector, but the Government will continue to work in partnership with the voluntary and community sector in the development of public services. Additional funding amounting to &#163;7 million has been made available for 2004&#150;05, through the Voluntary and Community Unit in the Department for Social Development, to support capacity building in the voluntary and community sector and to support essential services delivered by the sector. This includes &#163;3 million per annum available through the Local Community Fund. This fund was established in 2003 to help build trust and confidence and develop community capacity and leadership.
<P>

<a name="40202w02_para3"></a>The Government await the recommendations of the Task Force on Resourcing the Voluntary and Community Sector, to be available in June 2004, to guide future policy and resourcing considerations.

<UL>Further to their response to the Report from the Science and Technology Committee&#151;Cannabis (HL Paper 39, Session 1998&#150;99) (9th Report, Session 1997&#150;98), whether they will respond directly to paragraph 4.11 of the report.[HL878]<P></UL>
<P>

<A NAME="40202w03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   The Department of Health would broadly agree with the description of the psychiatric effects of cannabis described in paragraph 4.11 of the Report from the Science and Technology Committee&#151;Cannabis (HL Paper 39, Session 1998&#150;99). We recognise that while a causative link between early cannabis use and later development of schizophrenia is not conclusively proven, recent epidemiological research has shown a stronger association than was evident at the time of the report.
<P>

<a name="40202w03_para2"></a>The department recognises that confirming a clinical diagnosis in the context of continuing psychosis and persistent cannabis use can be a complex process. This needs to be made on a case-by-case basis by consultant psychiatrists and the multi-professional clinical teams involved with the care of particular patients to minimise any risk of mis-diagnosis.
<P>

<a name="40202w03_para3"></a>The department notes that neither antipsychotic medication nor the provisions of the Mental Health Act (1983) are exclusively used for the management of schizophrenia. These interventions, in certain circumstances, are used to manage symptoms of psychosis or to detain a patient with "psychosis", so <P>


<a name="column_WA73"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>that use of these interventions does not itself equate with misdiagnosis. In fact use of powers under the Mental Health Act does not depend on identifying specific diagnoses (such as schizophrenia) but rather on the presence of "mental disorder".

<P>
<A NAME="40202w04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland:  </B>  If the 16 Catholic sixth-form colleges wish to give preference to Catholics as regards the employment of staff, they will need to demonstrate that this is a genuine occupational requirement for the particular position under Regulation 7 (Exception for genuine occupational requirement) of the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/1660) in the same way as other employers. The proposed amendment in respect of the admission of students to the colleges does not impact on matters connected with the employment of staff.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202w04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bach:  </B>  In the past two years reservists have served in the UK, Germany, Turkey, USA, Canada, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Afghanistan, Cyprus, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, Kosovo and the Falklands.
<P>

<a name="40202w04_para1"></a>Generally, reservists supporting operations have been mobilised between seven and a half and eight months. This usually equates to six months in theatre plus a further one and a half to two months made up of pre-deployment training and post-deployment administration and leave. For those serving on full-time reserve service (FTRS), the length of service overseas is dependent on the terms of their FTRS commitment.

There is, therefore, no comprehensive record of the number of reservists who may have lost their civilian job.

<P>
<UL>Further to the Written Answer by the Lord Davies of Oldham on 27 June 2003 (WA 49&#150;50), whether the travelators at Heathrow Airport fell below the required standard in 2003; and, if so, in how many months of 2003; and by how much they did not meet the required standard.[HL933]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202w04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham:  </B>  The performance of travelators at Heathrow is primarily a matter for the airport operator. However, following an adverse finding by the Competition Commission, the Civil Aviation Authority imposed last year a scheme of standards and rebates for a number of services and facilities at Heathrow, including travelators. The standard for travelators is that in each month they should be available for 98 per cent of the time during the core period of the day from 05:00 to 23:00. The scheme came into effect in July 2003 and applies to each of the four terminals at Heathrow. For the six months from July to December, the airport met the standard in Terminal One, but failed to achieve it in two of the months in Terminal Two, in all six of the months in Terminal Three and in one of the months in Terminal Four. Where the terminals failed to reach the standard, travelator availability was above 90 per cent on seven occasions and above 80 per cent on the other two.

<P>
<UL>What plans they have to address the reduction in size of the manufacturing workforce by 116,000 workers in the three months to November 2003.[HL835]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202w04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville:  </B>  A trend of declining manufacturing employment has been a feature of advanced economies over the past 30 years. Even so, new jobs are created all the time. Around 250,000 manufacturing vacancies were reported to Jobcentre Plus in the past year. Where there are signficant redundancies in the manufacturing sector, the Rapid Response Service works to move people quickly into new jobs, preventing them becoming detached from the labour market. Overall the UK labour market is performing well, with total employment rising by nearly 1.7 million since spring 1997, and unemployment falling in every region in Britain over the past year.
<P>

<a name="40202w04_para5"></a>We published the Government's manufacturing strategy in May 2002&#151;the first such strategy for 30 years&#151;which we developed in partnership with industry, trade unions and other stakeholders, following a summit meeting on the challenges facing manufacturing held in December 2001. The manufacturing strategy aims to create a high value manufacturing sector in the UK with a highly skilled well paid workforce, moving away from competing on the basis of low skill and low wages.

Further to my Answer to the noble Lord of 18 December, (WA 182&#150;83) the figures given refer to 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06 rather than 2005&#150;06 as stated, I apologise to the noble Lord for this confusion.<P>

<UL>Further to the Written Answer by the Lord McIntosh of Haringey on 15 December 2003 (WA 111) on the regional offices of Sport England, what are the reasons for (a) the increase in staff costs from 2001&#150;02 to 2002&#150;03; and (b) the differences in staff costs between the different regions.[HL901]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202w05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey:  </B>  The increase in staff costs at Sport England's regional offices from 2001&#150;02 to 2002&#150;03 is predominantly due to an increase in the number of externally funded posts to deliver the regional Green Spaces programme.
<P>

<a name="40202w05_para4"></a>Sport England operates a standard pay policy across the organisation and the differences in costs between the regions are due to different local staffing structures.

<P>
<A NAME="40202w06_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Avebury </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Why the Home Office is sending letters to some of the 15,000 heads of families who applied for asylum before 2 October 2000 advising them to withdraw their pending asylum claim, when they are not guaranteed indefinite leave to remain after consideration of their cases: and[HL720]
<P>
Why the Home Office is depriving the 15,000 families who applied for asylum before 2 October 2000 of the right to pursue their claims for full refugee status, when this would confer benefits on them additional to the status of indefinite leave to remain; and[HL721]
<P>
Whether an asylum claimant who applied before 2 October 2000 and who agrees to abandon his claim on the basis of advice from the Home Office or the Legal Services Commission would lose his entitlement to National Asylum Support Service support pending a decision on his eligibility for the concession announced by the Home Secretary on 24 October 2003; and, if so, whether they will write to all those who have already been advised to withdraw their claims warning them of financial disadvantages of doing so.[HL722]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202w06_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  Families who appear eligible under the one-off exercise to grant indefinite leave to remain to families who applied for asylum before 2 October 2000 are being sent a questionnaire which includes a declaration they are invited to sign. The declaration says:
<P>

<a name="40202w06_para0"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I wish to withdraw my outstanding applications if I am granted Indefinite Leave to Enter or Remain in the United Kingdom."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40202w06_para1"></a>Therefore, if an applicant chooses not to sign this declaration, or if having signed the declaration they are not in fact granted indefinite leave to enter or remain, then their asylum status will not be changed. <P>


<a name="column_WA84"></a>

<B>2 Feb 2004 : Column WA84</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The Government are not, therefore, depriving families of the opportunity to pursue asylum claims.
<P>

<a name="40202w06_para2"></a>If the declaration is signed and the family is granted ILR, any outstanding asylum or human rights claim will be treated as withdrawn only once they have received ILR and the family will continue to be supported by National Asylum Support Service (NASS) until then.
<P>

<a name="40202w06_para3"></a>Since applicants will not lose entitlement to support pending a decision on eligibility under the concession, the issue of writing a warning letter to applicants simply does not arise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202w06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The total cost of developing and piloting the Integrated Domestic Abuse Programme (IDAP) for male perpetrators of domestic violence is estimated to be &#163;200,000. The programme was developed from the "Duluth Programme&#151;Tactics of Men who Batter" and was piloted in West Yorkshire and London.
<P>

<a name="40202w06_para4"></a>The Integrated Domestic Abuse Programme will be rolled out to probation areas from April 2004 and will replace and enhance current provision. The central costs of the roll out are estimated to be &#163;75,000. We expect there to be sufficient funds for this.

<a name="40202w06_para5"></a>The costs to areas will largely be met from the transfer of resources from the existing programmes and interventions that IDAP will replace.

<A NAME="40202w06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal:  </B>  On 11 November my right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced the Government's decision to build a base for a compulsory national identity cards scheme, for all British citizens resident in the United Kingdom, including in Northern Ireland, and all foreign nationals resident in the United Kingdom for more than three months.

<P>

<a name="40202w06_para7"></a>The Government's announcement set out a two-stage approach to implementing a scheme. It would be compulsory to obtain a card only in the second stage which would require full debate and a vote in both Houses of Parliament following a rigorous evaluation of the first stage. A compulsory scheme would not allow for any group to opt out of its requirements.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202w06_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal:  </B>  The Government have no plans to introduce such a moratorium. There are important Bills currently before Parliament that create new and necessary criminal offences. One such Bill is the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill, which proposes a new offence of causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable adult. The Government do not create new criminal offences without full consideration. All proposed offences are subject to careful scrutiny to ensure that they are necessary and appropriately formulated.

<A NAME="40202w06_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal:  </B>  The Government's decision to seek to reclassify cannabis as a class C drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 was taken in the light of the advice we received from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs on the harmfulness of <P>

<P>

<a name="40202w06_para8"></a>The advisory council considered in some depth possible links with mental illness, and concluded that a clear causal link between cannabis use and the development of mental illness, particularly schizophrenia, has not been established. However, cannabis use can unquestionably worsen a mental illness which already exists. We continue to monitor the situation carefully.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40202w06_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal:  </B>  The impact of population pressures is kept under careful review and we continue to investigate options for providing further increases in capacity over the coming years as part of the Government's modernisation strategy. There are currently a number of projects under way to increase the operational capacity of the prison estate.
<P>

<a name="40202w06_para9"></a>Funding has been provided for around 3,000 additional public sector prison places to be built at existing prisons by 2006. Two new private sector prisons providing 1,290 places are also due to be opened at Ashford (near Heathrow) and Peterborough in June 2004 and March 2005 respectively. Together with building programmes in progress, and new accommodation such as 450 additional places at Birmingham, this will increase the total useable capacity of the prison estate to around 78,700 by 2006.
<P>

<a name="40202w06_para10"></a>However, the Government are alert to the risk of a growing population and aim to minimise the effects through the provision of additional places and the reforms announced on 6 January in the Reducing Crime, Changing Lives document which aim to improve the management of offenders and reduce re-offending. Offenders for whom prison is the right penalty should continue to be sent to prison. But there are many offenders for whom tough non-custodial penalties will be more appropriate.

The police service, Her Majesty's Customs and the intelligence agencies undertake around 95 per cent of all communications data acquisition by public authorities. Training of their "single points of contact" is well established. Delivery of training to "single points of contact" in additional public authorities is underway.
