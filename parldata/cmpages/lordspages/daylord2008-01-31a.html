First, I appreciate the point he makes about the Lewes/Uckfield line. I know that there has been continuing pressure for the reopening of that part of a railway line which probably should never have been closed. I can well understand that, and of course refranchising will enable some discussion of that possibility to take place. It has already happened once when the franchise was let some years ago. On the noble Lord&#146;s second issue about Gatwick and the route utilisation strategies, improvements are being made to timetabling, and from the end of this year there will be additional London to Brighton services created through extra running-on from Gatwick down to Brighton from the Victoria to Gatwick service.</p>

If it is abolished, we, together with thousands of others, I suspect, will revert to going by road with all the implications for traffic congestion and pollution that that implies. No one wants to hump heavy luggage up and down the numerous steps at the overcrowded Clapham Junction interchange. Is the noble Lord aware that in my experience this service is never less than half full and more often than not three-quarters full? Is it not the height of folly to think of abolishing such a useful service?</p>

The noble Lord makes a point, but the service operates only once an hour outside the peak period. More adequate services will be provided so that the important link he spoke of between Watford and Gatwick can be maintained, and many other services that come through Clapham Junction stop at Gatwick. My understanding is that consideration is being given to reviewing whether it would be practicable to extend the Watford journey further south from Clapham, perhaps to Croydon.</p>

What consideration is being given to other investments to help Thameslink? For example, I gather that there are single voltage trains which could be converted to dual voltage and thus might solve the Thameslink problem. There are also 422 series trains which are lying idle in sidings at Eastleigh that could have been converted. Would it not have been better to have invested in those trains rather than cut a service that is so popular?</p>

It is on a very steep curve and passengers getting off the train have to step down a considerable distance to get onto the platform. There is no lift and the staircase is narrow and bends twice. It is the most dreadful station if one is carrying luggage, particularly if one is on the way to the airport.

It is a cultural issue as well. For most residents of this country, the horse is a companion animal rather than a food production animal&#151;it is as simple as that. There is no great measure of whether they travel well or not. Fewer than 4,000 horses are slaughtered in this country, and most of those are for pet food. The reality is that we have to do what we can to improve the trade and the transport welfare arrangements. While the trade is legal, there is no reason why the welfare conditions should not be improved and more hurdles erected that will make people think, &#147;It&#146;s not worth continuing this trade because we&#146;ve got to look after the horses so well&#148;.</p>

It is rampant in parts of Europe and was in fact rampant before it was discovered. The incidence was low at the end of last year and when it comes back&#151;there is no question about that&#151;we will potentially have enough vaccine for animal keepers in the protection zone.

We are not doing anything as if it is coming down from Defra; we want to take the industry along with us, in partnership, so it will be voluntary. The vaccine is to deal with serotype 8 of bluetongue. There are 23 other serotypes, and we almost have to hope that the one which comes back will be number 8, as that is our vaccine. I think that Spain and Portugal deal with three different versions of bluetongue, and other countries deal with different numbers.

If the disease comes back on a different scale, it may be possible to make the whole country a protection zone, because that would be good for internal trade. We fixed the figure for doses on the basis of it being a voluntary vaccination in the protection zone. I do not think that there will be a shortage.

I understand that the Netherlands ordered vaccines last week. Until then, the United Kingdom was the only country in the EU which had ordered any vaccines for serotype 8, which we did some weeks ago. If the EU offers help, it may make loads of rules. It may demand compulsory vaccination. It may demand vaccination only by vets, which would vastly increase the cost.

<p><a name="08013156000506">In a democracy, it is surely desirable that decisions by Governments to use Armed Forces extensively and substantially be taken on the basis of thorough and accurate information made publicly available, and of candid and consistent explanation by Governments, fully involving Parliament in advice and decision. However, although it is highly desirable, can it be fully entrenched in our constitutional practice?</p>

<a name="80131-0002.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="08013156000083">We should be cautious in letting the experience of the Iraq war, which has undoubtedly given impetus to the debate, overinfluence our deliberations. Recent armed conflict has taken many forms. The background and run-up to the Korean War, Suez, the Falklands, the Balkans, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Iraq and Special Force operations have all been different. Often, the nature of the conflict has quickly and dramatically changed, and the rules and objectives of our forces have had to be amended. What I think is certain is that historically it has not been easy to predict armed conflicts far in advance of hostilities, and I do not think it will become easier in the future. New threats can emerge very quickly.</p>

Parliament&#146;s stamp of approval is important but Parliament must not run the risk of hazarding the lives of service men and women. Secrecy, security and surprise are critical to many operations and if, for instance, one day it became necessary militarily to pre-empt an enemy attack&#151;and that is not inconceivable&#151;how would Parliament debate the actions in advance? Parliament is unlikely to have all the necessary intelligence to have a fully informed debate. This, of course, may not always be essential and this problem may well be solved by the existing or a new parliamentary committee or committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="08013156000086">The deployment of a military force for armed conflict is complex and takes&#151;as it did for Iraq or Afghanistan&#151;considerable time. Of course, the very deployment before hostilities can be a deterrent in itself but our current arrangements allow quick decisions to be made and we have been able to act quickly, often before the situation on the ground has deteriorated. The armies of other countries, notably Germany and the Netherlands, are envious of our current procedures. We are likely to work in a coalition or alliance. When I was Chief of the Defence Staff in the Kosovo crisis in 2005, it was very noticeable how the United Kingdom forces could be assembled and deployed quickly in circumstances in which other countries&#146; forces could not respond because of their parliamentary procedures, which had to be observed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="08013156000087">As a member of NATO we are committed to aid other members who are attacked, and the United Nations charter mandates countries to undertake operations should the Security Council require them. As a signatory of NATO and UN treaties we are expected to commit troops quickly when called upon to do so. We also have to recognise the difficulties that arise once a force is deployed. Circumstances change. Humanitarian and peacekeeping operations can suddenly become peace enforcement and develop into armed conflict. All four of these states can take place in a theatre at the same time. Deployments lead to unforeseen consequences and mission creep. I well remember visiting troops delivering cups of tea and medical assistance to elderly ladies at one end of a village when suddenly their comrades at the other end were attacked with great ferocity. Afghanistan is an interesting example. Many failed to predict the intensity of operations there and I suspect that some would not have been so keen on deployment if they had realised what that commitment was going to be.</p>

One template would rarely work for all situations. I see the best solution being a formal but non-statutory convention. It would be necessary, whenever it was possible and sensible, to seek parliamentary approval for deployment before service men and women were committed, but there is a need for some flexibility and it would not always be wise or practical to debate prior to deployment, even though government parliamentary debate and approval would be highly desirable. It would also be reassuring for the Armed Forces. I do not see it as particularly helpful for us in the House voting but it would be of immense value if we were to debate, preferably before the House of Commons had their debate, and were able to inform them and the Government of our views. There is much experience in this House which  should be used.</p>

I also see a necessity for Parliament to watch and discuss the progress of a campaign from time to time, always bearing in mind the effect such a debate would have on our troops in the field. It is almost inconceivable for the Prime Minister and Government to commit troops without thinking they had the backing of Parliament. We should be concerned that parliamentary oversight could, unless we are careful, lead to pressure to debate how operations should be conducted. Parliamentarians are not qualified to do this and they must avoid micromanaging and taking tactical decisions. These are the province of the commanders on the ground. What Parliament should debate are the objectives, the legality of what our forces are being asked to do, and in very general terms the size of a deployment and likely direction. These last two are notoriously difficult to predict, depending very greatly on the actions of the ill intentioned that are causing the problem in the first place. We are not in control of what their reaction to us will be.</p>

The Prime Minister&#146;s Statement last July begged many questions, some of which were raised in the consultation document, and others were in the valuable response from your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on the Constitution with its emphasis on flexibility rather than the rigid statutory framework. Those questions were also emphasised in the excellent opening speech by the noble and gallant Lord, who spoke from experience, stressing caution, the diverse nature of conflicts and the problems of legal advice, in that the Attorney-General would have drawn on a very wide range of legal opinion before giving his own view.</p>

The starting point is the need to rebalance the great accretion of power to the Executive and the extension of prerogative power, partly as a result of two world wars. This is felt in the domestic sphere but very much in the field of international affairs. It is properly said that during the Iraq conflict the Cabinet became virtually a dignified part of the constitution and many of the decisions were made by the Prime Minister and his entourage. The specific problems in international affairs include the information revolution and the need for increasing specialisation at a time when Parliament, alas&#151;certainly the other place&#151;is becoming more parochial and where the pathway to Parliament is so often through local government, which is very proper, or through being a research assistant to another Member. Yet this House is where there are people with direct military experience. Indeed, as one saw in the US during the Iraq war, Richard Armitage and Colin Powell at the head of the State Department were far less bellicose than the non-military men at the head of the Department of Defense&#151;the management experts Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="08013156000096">Another factor is the speed of change, where, as the noble and gallant Lord said, there can be a sudden worsening of the situation, an internal coup or whatever. Also, one is dealing with allies and, in any event, there are international obligations under the NATO treaty, as there will be under the Lisbon treaty, and there is Article 51 of the UN charter. Perhaps the most fundamental problem is that of intelligence, which I shall come to later. Whatever the formal positions, as one saw in the United States on Vietnam, the role of the legislature may be quite limited. There is the problem of definition. For example, would the very successful intervention in Sierra Leone have required parliamentary endorsement?</p>

Fundamental to informed parliamentary debate is access to intelligence. Certainly we have not solved that problem, as the Foreign Affairs Committee in the other place has frequently said. I went often to Langley to talk to members of the Central Intelligence Agency prior to the Iraq war. At least we were made to feel as parliamentarians that we were on their side. I did not have that same feeling when talking to our own intelligence people, who have a certain institutional mistrust of parliamentarians.</p>

It is clear that the problem of pre-emptive strikes would be ruled out by a formal vote, giving advance notice to any potential enemy. It is also true that your Lordships&#146; House has considerable expertise. I adopt what the noble and gallant Lord has said about at least having a debate here prior to any decision and vote in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="08013156000099">I shall make some brief conclusions. There is general agreement&#151;which democrat could be against it?&#151;that Parliament should have a greater say, and that the presumption should be that Parliament should be given information unless there are clear interests of national security to the contrary. The problem is to devise mechanisms to inform Parliament, and those mechanisms need to be flexible. Therefore I would favour the evolution of conventions, rather than statutory duties. Much depends on mutual respect and understanding to redress the balance between the Executive and Parliament. But overall, this debate is a welcome initiative by the Government and they deserve our congratulation.</p>

We in Parliament have a parallel duty. It is relevant especially to conservatives like myself. By temperament and experience, we have a strong attachment to constitutional arrangements of long standing. But if today&#146;s and tomorrow&#146;s circumstances are different, we have to look closely, and with the caution enjoined by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Guthrie, at whether our constitutional arrangements will continue to serve. We have to anticipate as best we can the unintended consequences of keeping them.</p>

Of course, the classical military advantages are easily identified&#151;they have been before and were again today by the noble and gallant Lord. For example, flexibility, surprise and overall national security are all well served by our present arrangements. However, it is not just the propriety, but the overall utility of this central prerogative power that nowadays is called vigorously into question, and it behoves us to understand why. I think the driving reason is that the international polity has changed abruptly and profoundly since the end of the last war. The founders of the United Nations meant it to do so. From that time, we have increasingly accepted the growth of supranational obligations enforced by supranational jurisdictions. Thus, for example, the long arm of the International Criminal Court can reach out to every individual in every participating member state, including our own.</p>

Describing the three points that he said the Armed Forces need to be reassured of before being committed to a large-scale military operation, he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"><a name="08013156000539">&#147;First, they would like to know that they had the support of the country, secondly, that they had the support of Parliament and, thirdly, that what they had been asked to do was legal, not just within the law of the land but if possible within a wider international context which would put the legality of the use of force beyond doubt&#148;.</p>

I believe we can foresee an increasing propensity among our servicepeople to question the chain of command as to the legality of an operation, and even to mark their uncertainty and anxiety by refusing to take part in it. If the Chief of the Defence Staff can ask that question, we might expect them to ask why they should not ask it too.</p>

By whatever means, however, I am now persuaded, with your Lordships&#146; Select Committee, that a change of this character in our constitutional arrangements must be made.</p>

Last May, in the debate on the Constitution Committee&#146;s report, <I>Waging War</I>, the then noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor put up a spirited Government defence for the Prime Minister&#146;s royal prerogative. Mine was a lone voice in support. All other speakers advocated parliamentary involvement. The consultation paper before us&#151;signed by three senior members of the Government and echoing remarks made by the present Prime Minister last July&#151;turns on its head the view espoused by this Government only eight months ago. Am I now also persuaded to do a somersault?</p>

<a name="80131-0003.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="08013156000109">The issues are complex and some key factors are barely mentioned. First, are there not two broad categories of conflict in which we might become involved? As shorthand, I class these as &#147;wars of necessity&#148; and &#147;wars of choice&#148;. In the former, the country or key national interests are directly threatened or even under hostile attack. The international right of self-defence can be invoked. It would be a formality&#151;were it to be required&#151;to have parliamentary approval. Our forces would act to defend themselves and our interests. So I confine my remarks to wars of choice: that is, to offensive operations overseas on which the Government wish to embark.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="08013156000110">I question whether this is to be the norm, rather than the rare exception of the past few years, when this Government have so actively engaged in wars of choice. For any British Government, the use of force in a war of choice should be a last resort; not the first, nor even an early, action to be taken to achieve a strategic aim. What preparations have the Armed Forces put in hand for this war of choice? The paper pays too little attention to this and to prior parliamentary scrutiny and challenge in the pre-deployment phase and to the backdrop of diplomatic and economic treaty obligations and other relevant leverages. The paper does not deal adequately with what might be termed the deterrent use of forces or prolonged campaigns&#151;for example, by deploying part way to the theatre, or even threatening to do so with the object of persuading the adversary that they should back off and so deterring conflict; or remaining poised over  the horizon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="08013156000112">There is some confusion, it seems. Governments must distinguish between the principle or aim of a deployment abroad; the order to prepare to deploy abroad; the actual movement overseas and its scale, but not its employment, in an overseas operation; and the use or threat of use of force in conflict. The document merely proposes that it would be for the Prime Minister to decide at what stage of the above he must seek parliamentary approval. Is this approval to be confined to British boots on the ground abroad, or to the use of force against an overseas opponent? That force could be delivered by aircraft or UAVs operating from home or friendly bases&#151;the RAF has been involved in operations over Iraq almost continuously since the first Gulf War in 1991&#151;or force could come from naval vessels on the high seas. On top of this lack of clarity, the Government foresee a series of situations when pre-clearance by Parliament would not be sought&#151;in recess or dissolution and even if Parliament were sitting, on grounds of security. In such situations, it would be for the Prime Minister to decide. Would not decisions to withdraw or reduce force levels, even to surrender, also remain with the Prime Minister? Parliament&#146;s sovereignty could only be partial and the Prime Minister would in effect continue to use his royal prerogative. Even in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when the Commons took a pre-combat vote, Parliament was given to understand that it was not regime change but the threat from WMDs that justified and made legal our invasion.</p>

<a name="80131-0003.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="08013156000113">The proposals before us, though superficially attractive, are still flawed. Parliament will be attempting to judge and formally approve a difficult and dangerous situation, possibly misled over and/or in ignorance of key facts. More critically, there are too many ways in which the Prime Minister of the day might choose to disadvantage the timing of a formal vote or even sidestep it altogether. Is there, in fact, any greater assurance of parliamentary sovereignty over the prerogative than can be exercised by the normal, well tried and tested means of votes of confidence and other methods of challenging the Executive?</p>

<a name="80131-0003.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="08013156000114">Noble Lords should be clear on this point: the Government propose that there could be occasions when the Prime Minister continues to use the royal prerogative and bypasses Parliament and that thereafter it will not be necessary to seek retrospective approval. That negates the argument that parliamentary approval is a necessary precursor to conferring legality. It should remain the Prime Minister&#146;s responsibility to give clear direction to the Armed Forces; he should not look to Parliament to absolve him of that responsibility and so possibly avoid the political dangers of facing a vote of confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="08013156000115">How often in future will we be embarking on offensive wars of choice? Have we not had enough of them? We are not arming ourselves to carry them out at such a rate in the future as we have done in the past decade; we are even now sending ill-prepared troops into operations in Afghanistan. Is not the whole concept rather too academic and devoid of realism? I have not somersaulted and, on reflection, nor should the Government.</p>

I am extremely grateful to the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Guthrie, for giving us the opportunity to debate this crucial moment in our constitutional evolution, because it is nothing less than that. I also congratulate the Government on their courage in getting hold of the issue of the royal prerogative in two of the most important areas that can affect the role of Parliament and on recognising the need to empower Parliament to be part of that decision-making process. I listened with great interest to the points raised by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, but to my mind the arguments made by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Guthrie, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, are conclusive. We live in a different world and we cannot commit our troops without a much wider process of decision-making than the one on which we have rested for so many centuries.</p>

On this, there is quite a long history. My noble friend Lord Lester of Herne Hill proposed that Parliament should be involved in the ratification of treaties as long ago as his 2003 Bill and he repeated the proposal in 2006. In another place, Kenneth Clarke, leading the Conservative Party&#146;s study of the changing constitution, proposed that there should be parliamentary accountability in respect of the ratification of treaties. I am delighted that we have now reached something very close to consensus.</p>

<a name="80131-0003.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="08013156000118">In our society today, treaties are of the greatest possible significance. Let me mention just two groups of them so as not to take up too much time. There is a whole group of treaties concerned with climate change, becoming more and more important and likely to grow in significance in the next few years. We no longer talk about the thinness of the ozone layer because, in the words of the former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the Montreal protocol was one of the most successful treaties ever passed and actually managed to push back that threat a long way. Since then, we have had the Kyoto treaty, about which I need say little more except that up to now it is the only international treaty with force across the whole global pattern of climate change. Even now, as we sit, there is a major discussion about the renewal of that treaty, and it could not be of more significance for our citizens and the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="08013156000119">There is another group of treaties of great significance, on arms. Even now, there is wrangling over the cluster bomb treaty between those who wish to weaken it by excluding what are called &#147;clever&#148; cluster bombs, and the wish of most of our fellow citizens throughout the world to have an effective cluster bomb treaty. It is still under discussion.</p>

<a name="80131-0003.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="08013156000121">I could go on, but will just mention one other treaty which has so far not been put into practice at all, although passed by the General Assembly of the United Nations as long ago as 1993: the proposed treaty for the fair treatment and recognition of the human rights of migrants. Our country is today deeply caught up in a discussion about the rights of migrants, but there has never been a debate in this House on the issues raised by the treaty, which is now nearly 20 years old.</p>

<a name="80131-0003.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="08013156000122">How can we look at accountability for treaties? I am clear that there must be more to it&#151;in this respect it is very different from war powers&#151;than simply agreeing that Parliament should approve the ratification of treaties. It is essential, in as complex an area as this, that it be matched by a parliamentary Select Committee which would look into treaties and decide which ones were so significant for our citizens, in this country and beyond, to be discussed and debated in Parliament before the Government finally give their approval. In this respect, the Ponsonby rules, to which the noble Lord, Lord Anderson of Swansea, referred, while impressive in their day&#151;laying treaties for 21 days and leaving it for the House to decide which ones should be debated&#151;are simply no longer adequate machinery. There must be a much more careful look at treaties, and a decision made by the House itself about which ones should be debated before they can be agreed to.</p>

<a name="80131-0003.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="08013156000123">We therefore need a combination of those two things. To that end, I recently submitted a memorandum to the Liaison Committee, asking that it should seriously consider the possibility of a Select Committee on treaties. The committee said that this was a major issue which rather went beyond, in its view, its own competence and jurisdiction. Long ago, the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, also proposed, in his well known report on the reform of the House of Lords, that there should be a careful look at treaties and that they should become part of the responsibilities of this House&#151;possibly jointly with the other House; that is a matter for discussion which I shall not go into right now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="08013156000124">This is the moment for Parliament to seize this opportunity. It is particularly appropriate for this House, with its responsibilities and experience. That has been matched in other parts of the world, such as Germany, Canada and the United States, where the upper House has a special responsibility in this field. However, I strongly urge that, as a result of this debate, the Government, as part of their reform of the constitution of the United Kingdom and their exciting proposals, look closely at treaties and consider whether there should not be some form of Select Committee of Parliament, linked to&#151;I stress that&#151;a decision by the Government to accept that there should be parliamentary approval before major treaties are ratified. That would very much strengthen

It is not easy to decide how the royal prerogative should be constitutionally changed because, as has been said, the whole issue is complicated and there are many divergent factors. At the outset, I should make it clear that I am enthusiastic about what the Government are now seeking to do to involve Parliament more in it.</p>

<a name="80131-0003.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="08013156000126">It is unthinkable that in this day and age our democratic Government should commit armed forces to a substantial war without the prior and manifest assent of Parliament. Only in this way can it be properly established that the country, which after all will have to see the war through to its conclusion, and at least the law of our land are formally behind such an enterprise, which may have many quite unpredictable international consequences. Such authority is also necessary both to sustain the highest morale of our Armed Forces, who have to carry out these operations and want to know that the country is fully behind them, and as a guarantee of some legal basis and authority for the war, for which further international authority may also be required.</p>

<a name="80131-0003.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="08013156000127">At the same time, the responsibility for deploying forces, which is quite separate from commitment&#151;in accordance with, say, treaty obligations, initially perhaps in a deterrent or a warning posture&#151;and for actually carrying out war-like operations once they are embarked on, must for obvious reasons remain with the Executive and the chain of command that they set up or inherit. Nor must anything be done to compromise the secrecy and security of operations still in their planning stage, as this might remove the element of tactical surprise that is often so vital for any success in battle. This would be particularly applicable in operations to rescue British hostages or to pre-empt terrorism of the sort that occurred in Sierra Leone; then there would be no alternative but to act first and inform Parliament later. Moreover, any force deployed to put pressure on a potential adversary to comply with or not break international law would hardly want its impact weakened by a debate that might throw doubt on whether such force would ever be used in practice.</p>

<a name="80131-0003.htm_para25">

This could easily have been achieved in the Falklands War before the landings, before the Anglo-American advance to recapture Kuwait, and before the coalition invasion of Iraq. In the latter case, there was an assenting vote in the other place, but it was on the wrong premise; otherwise, the result might have been different. It might not have been easy to get a

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="08013156000129">It comes down to a question of timing and the leadership of the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister cannot persuade Parliament, either the country is embarking on the wrong war or there is something adrift in the Prime Minister&#146;s leadership. It is of course a matter for the Government to decide whether what they seek can be achieved within the royal prerogative by parliamentary convention or whether legislation is needed that combines the essential requirement of parliamentary authority with some flexibility to meet a wide range of circumstances. The views expressed in this debate will no doubt be helpful to the Government in making up their mind. The important thing is that the principle of Parliament having the final say must be paramount. Wars in which this country gets involved fall broadly into one of two categories: those of survival and those of choice. If it is one of survival, parliamentary approval is no problem; indeed, Parliament might well be in the lead. If it is one of choice, it is even more necessary that Parliament and the country have the final say, otherwise hideous errors may occur and the best interests of the country may not be served, particularly if the royal prerogative has ever been abused. If noble Lords think that all this may make it more difficult to &#147;slide&#148; into war&#151;to make no declaration of war is now our tendency&#151;I would find that infinitely reassuring.</p>

The concept that a state can improve things by charging into the middle of alien territory to rearrange the pieces according to its own political philosophy, however desirable that philosophy may appear, seems to me wholly out of keeping with the age. As the great Duke of Wellington, a man of such infinite common sense, put it two centuries ago, at another time when British Governments were not backward in indulging in wild assaults here, there and everywhere:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="08013156000132">But I do have some experience of dealing with treaties as a result of my involvement in the recent disputes over the United Kingdom/USA treaty on extradition. That is probably the most controversial treaty in recent years. It is controversial because it is unequal. The standard of evidence required for extradition from the United States to the United Kingdom is higher than that required for extradition in the other direction. It is a classic example of the defects of the system and plainly shows the inadequacy of the involvement of Parliament in the treaty-making process. This treaty was in fact signed before Parliament knew anything about it. The Ponsonby rule or convention is, I believe, inadequate, and the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, was unduly complacent in thinking that it was of any significant value. The Ponsonby rule or convention confers no power on Parliament to do anything whatever except hold a debate. Not surprisingly, very few Ponsonby debates have been held in recent years.</p>

<a name="80131-0004.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="08013156000133">Parliament does have powers where changes in United Kingdom law are needed before a treaty can become effective because the Government, quite rightly, do not ratify a treaty unless any necessary changes in United Kingdom law have been enacted. That was the case in relation to the extradition treaty with the USA. That treaty needed an Order in Council under the Extradition Act 2003 to enable the United Kingdom to ratify it. Either House could have blocked the treaty by rejecting the Order in Council. Neither did so, although we on these Benches voted against the Order in Council in your Lordships&#146; House. One problem that applies to this is that once a treaty has been signed by a representative of the Government, they come under an obligation to use their best efforts to ratify it. If amendments or changes are needed to a treaty, it is very difficult to reopen negotiations which have already been concluded and have resulted in a signed treaty. It is essential, therefore, that parliamentary scrutiny should take place and, further, should begin even before a treaty is signed. Had that happened with the extradition treaty, the problem could&#151;and very probably would&#151;have been solved simply by the omission of six words from the text. The omission of those words would have converted it into an equal treaty.</p>

It follows that the Government should send a draft of a proposed treaty to that committee before the Government sign it. The committee could then take evidence, if it wished to do so, and publish a report on whether there were likely to be serious objections to it. The committee could also at that stage decide whether the treaty is one which needs the consent of Parliament or, as a considerable number of them are, is a relatively unimportant or uncontroversial treaty which does not need further parliamentary consideration. Treaties which

At a time when there appears to be a worrying decline in the level of engagement between many in this country and the political process, it is surely right to look for ways in which the Executive can be made more accountable to Parliament and so make the Government less remote from people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="08013156000142">That said, we should always approach constitutional change with caution, precisely because our constitution has evolved over the centuries rather than being the careful construct of constitutional lawyers. The law of unintended consequences, to which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, referred, seems to apply all the more. Moreover, in a constitution which allows for change through evolving convention, better governance may not always be best served by more statutes, more rules and more regulations; nor is it necessarily right to limit flexibility in the name of greater clarity.</p>

<a name="80131-0004.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="08013156000143">On the first issue of war-making powers it is difficult to disagree with the House of Lords Constitution Committee report which proposed that the formal role of Parliament in this area should be strengthened, both in the interests of greater accountability and ensuring that those committed to armed conflict know they have the support of Parliament. I could not possibly state that with more eloquence than the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall. But this should be by way of the general acceptance of a new convention rather than by statute. I wonder whether there is a danger, if there is any strict statutory provision, that this could lead to uncertainty over the legality of the actions of our service men and women. This would surely put them in an impossible position and be unacceptable.</p>

<a name="80131-0004.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="08013156000144">Moreover, flexibility and discretion are required for the many reasons which the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Guthrie, and others have pointed out. We do not want to be in a situation where parliamentary involvement might for some reason delay or distort decisions in an emergency; or constrain the Executive when great secrecy or surprise is required; or when intelligence could be compromised; or where the precise nature of the deployment might change. Such discretion and flexibility would be more appropriately provided in a convention which allows that flexibility, particularly on the timing of the debate and the timing of parliamentary involvement.</p>

<a name="80131-0004.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="08013156000145">It would nevertheless be worth giving further thought to the extent of any convention which finds acceptance. For example, when I was listening to the debate of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, last week about the call for an inquiry into the lessons learnt from Iraq, I found myself wondering whether a convention setting out the obligations on the Executive at the start of an armed conflict might also encompass an obligation for a report to Parliament on lessons learnt after an armed conflict.</p>

I welcomed the notion that Parliament should be involved. However, I raised a number of queries. If I may dare to say so, as they were not answered on that occasion, I shall put them again very briefly. What should be the consequences of a Government not acting with parliamentary approval given either in advance or retrospectively? What information must be given to Parliament to enable it to perform its functions? It is clearly of no use for Parliament to have functions without having information put in front of it that it can sensibly and usefully debate. Those questions are still important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="08013156000151">Having thought about the matter since then, I believe the time is ripe to put into statute the principle that parliamentary authority should be sought before our Armed Forces are sent into armed conflict, except in cases made out to Parliament by the Government that there is a situation of clear emergency. The value of establishing such a general principle is evident from the seriously mistaken Suez adventure of 1956. A leading constitutional expert, the late Professor Robert Houston, said that,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="08013156000152">Eighty years ago, in the aftermath of the massive slaughter of World War 1, President Woodrow Wilson said that wars are more than anything the result of secret machinations of statesmen. Wars are much less likely to be entered into by a properly functioning democracy because young men cannot be asked to die for reasons that are not made public. If the Government are accountable to Parliament for their decision to go to war&#151;I am talking about &#147;wars of choice&#148;, to use the phrase uttered earlier today&#151;and have to explain themselves to Parliament, the media and the public, the Government&#146;s reasons will need to be pretty convincing.</p>

<a name="80131-0004.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="08013156000153">I shall say a little more on the subject of treaties, although I followed and agree with the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. If I may make a party-political point, it is most appropriate that a Labour Government should wish to extend the principle of the Ponsonby rule, which of course was named after the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs in the first Labour Government of 1924. His great-grandson, my noble friend Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede, may not be in his place today, but he is a valued colleague. If that has been a useful rule, in my view it has not gone quite far enough. If Parliament has insisted on a debate and it has seen the Government&#146;s explanatory memoranda that are now so often produced in relation to treaties, it does not have any real say in whether the treaty is to be ratified. I venture to say, although this may be even less popular with my Front Bench than the remark I have just made, that unless the Government have made out a special case&#151;unless there is a certificate for the Secretary of State, or something of that sort&#151;no treaty should be ratified unless both Houses of Parliament have approved it. I say both Houses because of the point that is frequently made&#151;that in this House there is a lot of expertise. We are seeing it today, in defence and foreign affairs matters. It seems somewhat perverse to say that all that is needed is the approval of the House of Commons.</p>

I therefore greatly welcome the initiative taken by my noble and gallant friend Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank for this debate on the consultation paper. It is a bit odd that the first debate should be taking place in Cross-Bench time and not at the initiative of the Government and in their own time, but it is none the less welcome for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="08013156000156">I intend to limit my remarks on this occasion to the issue of war powers, by far the more important of the two fields covered by the consultation paper and the one in which the most significant changes to current practice are proposed. As I said at the outset, it would seem hard to gainsay the case for giving Parliament a determining voice on this matter, but it would be unwise to think that this will be a simple open or shut decision; it simply bristles with complexities, of which some can be solved in advance but some will find responses only when new procedures are put into practice. Among the latter, I would identify the need for our armed forces to feel that they have the full legitimacy of parliamentary support when they are asked to risk their lives and those of others. Unfortunately, the nature of our highly adversarial parliamentary system and the fact that a majority in Parliament often does not represent anything like a majority of the electorate will make that objective pretty hard to achieve in practice.</p>

<a name="80131-0004.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="08013156000157">A second major complexity is the question of the information basis on which Parliament will reach its decisions. It is fashionable to claim that if we had known in March 2003 what we now know about Iraq&#146;s weapons of mass destruction&#151;or, rather, the lack of them&#151;the large majority supporting military action would have been reversed. That cannot in fact be proved, but we should have no illusions; these decisions will always have to be taken on the basis of incomplete and imperfect information. Adversaries, particularly if they are authoritarian or totalitarian regimes, do not willingly reveal their assets or their future intentions. Intelligence is one way of remedying that lack of knowledge, but it never provides the whole picture.</p>

In so doing, I declare a non-pecuniary interest as chair of the board of the United Nations Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which has submitted some separate observations on the consultation paper. These areas arise as a result of our membership of a number of international organisations and alliances, which are committed to taking action in common to achieve collective security. The UN and NATO are the most significant of these, although in future the European Union may, too, come to play a bigger role in that field.</p>

If, as I believe, it is in our national interest to make those organisations more effective, not less, we are going to

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="08013156000160">The case of UN peacekeeping operations is likely to be particularly complex. In many of those, it is simply not possible to say in advance with any certainty whether such an operation is going to take place with a full ceasefire in operation, or whether it might, at an indeterminate later stage, involve hostilities and the use of military force. On many occasions, British involvement in a particular UN peace operation will be extremely modest; a few observers, perhaps, or some logistical or specialist personnel. On which side of the parliamentary authorisation line will such examples fall? Nothing has damaged UN peacekeeping operations more in the past than the slowness and delays in deploying forces authorised by the Security Council. Remedying that, by developing a better rapid reaction capability for the UN, must surely be a high priority, otherwise the field is left open to spoilers. We will need to ensure that our national parliamentary procedures are fully consistent with that objective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="08013156000161">How are those UN complexities best handled? In theory, there are at least two ways in which we could proceed, and probably more. One would be to limit the scope of the parliamentary authorisation procedure so as to exclude certain scales or types of UN activity. The other would be to have what I call a light option procedure for handling such deployments. That second possibility is the one being operated in Germany; it is described on pages 66 and 67 of the consultation paper. Under it, the Government inform the key parliamentary chairmen of action that they plan to take, but no full parliamentary authorisation procedure is required.</p>

The bland recognition in paragraph 40 of the consultation paper that these NATO and UN complications exist, without the slightest indication  of how to address them, will simply not suffice. Can the Minister give some indication of how the Government intend to respond on those matters?</p>

My views there coincide precisely with those of my noble and gallant friend Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank, who said that this House should have an opportunity to debate the matter in government time before the other place takes the decision on the matter. That is how it should be, but the decision should not be for this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="08013156000164">I conclude as I began by indicating my broad support for the Government&#146;s intention, in bringing forward this consultation paper, to move our constitutional practice on to a sounder basis where Parliament plays a full and decisive role. In so doing, however, let us not forget the virtues of pragmatism and flexibility or fall victim to the law of unintended consequences that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, referred to so eloquently in his contribution.

I, too, thank my noble and gallant friend Lord Guthrie for introducing an extremely important debate.</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="08013156000166">As the consultation paper makes clear, the decision to send armed forces into conflict is one of the most important that a Government can be asked to make. It is important to remember, as the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Guthrie, reminded us, that few armed conflicts turn out as expected. They usually last longer, take unforeseen directions and demand greater sacrifice. Therefore, given the seriousness of the decision to commit our Armed Forces to conflict, it is clearly right that the House of Commons should be involved. The key question, for me, is: how involved?</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="08013156000167">Different phrases have been used in different documents about this issue. The Prime Minister said, in July 2007, that</p>
<ul><a name="08013156000561">&#147;the Government will now consult on a resolution to guarantee that on the grave issue of peace and war ... this House of Commons ... will make the decision&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 3/7/07; col. 816.]</ul>
<a name="80131-0005.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="08013156000168">We need clearer definition of what we want this new convention&#151;and I hope that it will be a convention&#151;to say. That grave issue of peace and war is rather different to some people talking about sending armed forces into conflict, or the words used by the report of the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution, called <I>Waging </I><I>W</I><I>ar: Parliament&#146;s </I><I>R</I><I>ole and </I><I>R</I><I>esponsibility</I>.</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="08013156000169">I rather agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, that we must be careful not to be too restrictive on this, because if we look, for example, at the operation in Sierra Leone, and its need not only for urgency but for secrecy, it would have been difficult for Parliament to be consulted in that instance. As I have said, I am certainly much more in favour of a convention than a statutory requirement, which could be too restrictive. Let me also make it quite clear that I am strongly in favour of Parliament being involved to debate any significant military deployment.</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="08013156000170">As noble Lords have said, in preparing for war and complex military operations it is important for the Armed Forces to have clear decisions, and to get them in a timely manner. Whatever we put in place will remain of paramount importance. That preparation is normally fraught with difficulties, and it needs to be made in good time. If there is any delay in getting the support of Parliament for the Armed Forces it is bound to affect not only planning but, much more importantly, their morale. I need hardly add that it would be fatal for Parliament to dabble in the planning detail, and for the Executive to have to refer back continually for guidance on key issues.</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="08013156000171">I noted that in its report, <I>Waging War</I>, the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution stated clearly on Parliament&#146;s role and responsibility that,</p>
<ul><a name="08013156000562">&#147;our enquiry should not extend to any aspect of operational decision-making once force has been deployed&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08013156000512">Later, it went on to say, in what I read as a major caveat, that,</p>

<p><a name="08013156000513">It quoted Afghanistan as a possible example. I would be very cautious about allowing Parliament to dabble in that sort of military planning. As I mentioned earlier, each operational situation, no matter how careful one&#146;s planning, writes its own individual script, and it usually gets worse before its gets better. We need to be careful, for example in Afghanistan, not to dabble in that detail.</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="08013156000172">However, I recognise that it is enormously important that soldiers, sailors and airmen deployed on military operations feel that they have the support of the nation behind them. When the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Guthrie, and I visited troops in the desert in Iraq just before the first Iraq war, it was interesting how many of them asked us: &#147;The nation is behind us, isn&#146;t it?&#148;. It is terribly important that we never forget that.</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="08013156000173">The report of the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution suggested the excellent idea of a joint parliamentary committee to assume strategic oversight of international defence and foreign policy. It deserves serious consideration. I realise that such a committee could not resolve the underlying issue of parliamentary sovereignty over the deployment of military power, but it could play an important role in educating both Houses of Parliament about the implications of the use of military force. It is a sine qua non that any important issue is considered by all Cabinet Ministers and not just by the Prime Minister and a few key advisers. The commitment of Armed Forces on operations is certainly such an issue.</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="08013156000174">A key part of that process&#151;it may be teaching my grandmother to suck eggs&#151;will be the proper preparation of papers by departments such as the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence, the Treasury and others. For any dangerous complex military operation, the Cabinet should be formally briefed by the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office and the Chiefs of Staff. We know that, at times, that has not happened in the past. I would not be opposed to key opposition party members being included in those war Cabinet briefings. I need hardly add that, in presenting the facts to the nation, we should not try to produce dossiers that are &#147;improved&#148; to justify the case of war.</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="08013156000175">When I was in the Ministry of Defence, I often felt that it would have encouraged the MoD and the Armed Forces if an annual briefing were given by the Cabinet about the Armed Forces, their capabilities, their training, their strengths and weaknesses, and what it would mean if they were committed to operations, because ever fewer people have a real understanding about what the commitment of Armed Forces to conflict entails.</p>

I am glad to see that three other members of the committee, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, and the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, are participating in this debate.</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="08013156000177">The committee welcomes the consultation paper, <I>W</I><I>ar </I><I>P</I><I>owers and </I><I>T</I><I>reaties</I>, and is grateful for its recognition of the conclusions of the report produced under the chairmanship of my predecessor, the noble Lord, Lord Holme of Cheltenham. The paper takes account of a number of the key recommendations. We welcome, first, the Government&#146;s commitment to investigate ways of,</p>
<ul><a name="08013156000564">&#147;seeking to give Parliament the final say in decisions to commit UK troops to armed conflict overseas&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08013156000514">It is a central point. I trust that the Government, in framing a resolution for the House of Commons, will find a way to take account of the concerns expressed by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, because they are extremely serious and were considered in detail by the committee. The essential flexibility of the armed services to which the noble and gallant Lord gave reference, and considerations of security and surprise, must be maintained. The essential proposition seems now to have the assent of noble Lords on all sides of the House.</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="08013156000178">Secondly, the committee welcomes the Government&#146;s view that is &#147;entirely appropriate&#148; that the House of Lords should have a role in the process. I agree with the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Guthrie, that any debate in this place should precede that in the Commons; it is clear that immense expertise is here. It would be a problem if this House took a different view from that of the other place. It would particularly acute if, at some future date, we had a wholly or predominantly elected House of Lords&#151;but that argument is for another day.</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="08013156000179">Thirdly, we welcome the commitment to ensure that service personnel are protected from criminal prosecution for actions taken in good faith. Fourthly, we welcome the Government&#146;s recognition that the committee&#146;s favoured option of a parliamentary convention,</p>
<ul><a name="08013156000565">&#147;has the advantages of being more flexible and adaptable&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08013156000515">We welcomed the Lord Chancellor&#146;s comment in his evidence to the committee in October that,</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="08013156000180">However, the committee is disappointed at the Government&#146;s preference for a requirement merely to inform Parliament, rather than to seek retrospective approval for deployment, in cases where forces have been deployed without prior parliamentary approval for reasons of urgency or national security. The committee&#146;s preferred option is that if, for reasons of emergency or security, prior application for parliamentary approval is impossible,</p>
<ul><a name="08013156000567">&#147;the Government should provide retrospective information within seven days of [the deployment's] commencement or as soon as it is feasible&#148;,</ul>

<p><a name="08013156000516">at which point, parliamentary approval should be sought.</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="08013156000181">The committee is concerned also at the Government&#146;s proposal that,</p>
<ul><a name="08013156000568">&#147;Parliament's involvement should be limited to approving the initial engagement&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08013156000517">Your Lordships&#146; committee would prefer that, in addition to keeping Parliament informed of the progress of deployments, the Government should be required to seek a renewal of parliamentary approval if a deployment&#146;s nature or objectives alter significantly. Such a requirement is vital to ensure that mission creep does not become a problem. It is possible to argue that the House of Commons can do anything that it decides. There was a large number of debates during the Falklands conflict; there have been a large number of debates about Iraq; but it is argued that this would be far better spelt out in a convention agreed by the Government in Parliament.</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="08013156000182">There is currently no agreed definition in the Geneva Convention of the term, &#147;armed conflict&#148;. It will therefore be necessary for the Government to look elsewhere for a meaningful definition, as we all know that there has been no declaration of war by this country since that on Thailand in the Second World War. I am strongly convinced that it will be possible for the Government and Parliament to agree a resolution that enshrines an appropriate convention reflecting the concerns that have been expressed today. The military covenant, which has been so much discussed in recent months, demands no less.</p>

I welcome the consultation paper. It is a very useful basis on which to pursue the discussion of the very important matters it raises. I thank and congratulate my noble friend Lord Janvrin on his maiden speech which demonstrated his knowledge, experience and wisdom.

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="08013156000184">Committing the armed services to conflict action is the supreme example of the exercise of Executive authority. The ultimate decision has to be that of the Government, the Prime Minister and his or&#151;your Lordships will understand why I add this&#151;her colleagues. The political reality is that any Government faced with having to take the decision will want, if possible, to be reasonably confident that they have, or believe that they can secure, a sufficient measure of parliamentary and public support. Because of the circumstances in which the need for such a decision arises, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to be prescriptive and specific enough to cover every possible circumstance, and it would be a mistake to try. It is quite likely that the need for a decision could arise in circumstances which had not, and could not have, been foreseen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="08013156000185">So whatever provision is to be made to involve Parliament and the public more closely in the decision, whether before or after the event, needs in my view to be general and not too specific, and is best

If Governments are to be accountable to Parliament&#151;as, of course, they are for the decisions in this field, as in others&#151;it is equally important that Parliament should be as well informed as possible. Attention should be given to that need and how it can best be fulfilled without prejudicing the security, intelligence and safety of our Armed Forces.</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="08013156000186">It seems to me that for many of the treaties entered into by Governments, the Ponsonby rules are both acceptable and sufficient because they are very technical and not controversial. However, some treaties&#151;not necessarily all that small in number but great in importance&#151;will increasingly merit further thought, as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, emphasised; for instance, treaties which commit the United Kingdom to membership of international organisations or treaties which have global implications such as climate change measures. This globalisation of affairs means that some of the treaties into which this country enters will become increasingly important.</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="08013156000187">Again, the decision to commit to a treaty is essentially one of executive power. But if it is a treaty of major importance, not only Government but Parliament and the interested public will see it coming and there will be opportunities for parliamentary and public discussion without that having to be specifically provided for in advance. Again, the political reality is that Governments will need to be reasonably confident that they can secure a sufficient measure of parliamentary support. I believe that public input in our system should normally be mediated through Parliament. Referendums tend to be unsatisfactory means of expressing public opinion for a number of reasons, including the difficulty of defining the question and of preventing a referendum from straying into areas where voters express views on matters not directly related to the question on the paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="08013156000188">I very much respect the Government&#146;s decision to open these subjects up for consultation. But the more one seeks to arrange and manage these issues, the more it seems to me that we need to stick to three main conclusions. First, we should not lose sight of the impact of political reality on what happens&#151;the force of events which will determine what the Government do and their need for parliamentary and political support. Secondly, as was fairly generally agreed this afternoon, whatever provision we make should be general and not specific. Thirdly, we should rely on convention, including, of course, new conventions if that seems desirable, and avoid the over-rigid framework of statutory prescription.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Holme of Cheltenham, and his committee graciously got the maximum out of us. There were two questions. First, was there a need for change? Secondly, if so, how was that to be effected? It was a particular pleasure to me that your Lordships' committee rejected statutory control of the deployment of British forces outside the UK into armed conflict and preferred a convention that parliamentary approval should be sought. I fear that the response of the Government then was very negative in the persons of three Ministers who preferred the status quo. I very much welcome the consultative paper, which echoes the attitude of the Prime Minister as far back as January 2006 when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and which was quite different from that of his colleagues who gave evidence. The consultative paper echoes the Select Committee&#146;s observations.</p>

<a name="80131-0005.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="08013156000191">The royal prerogative is a misnomer. It has been progressively reduced since 1688. In reality it is the Executive prerogative, exercised by the Prime Minister with or without consultation with his Cabinet. It was Churchill who said it was no longer a royal prerogative, but the privilege of the people. That brings me to the question of how the privilege should now be controlled. My immediate answer as a democrat is that it should be by the elected House of Commons. The House of Lords should have an input and the House of Commons would be well advised to consider the contribution of this House. But at the end of the day there should be no uncertain sound of the trumpet, nor two tunes played at the same time. The body that controls supply should democratically control the decision-taking. Ministers, civil servants and the Armed Forces are enjoined to obey the rule of law, both domestic and international. It is written into their rules. Now there are additional hazards in the form of the International Criminal Court.</p>

There was unanimity before the committee that there should be no interference by Parliament on operational matters once commenced. I agree. When I was asked to give evidence, I started off with a blank sheet of paper, grappling with an issue that I had not previously given much thought to. After reading all the available material, I came to the conclusion as a democrat, a former Attorney-General and a former Defence Minister a long time ago that the status quo allowing unfettered control to the Executive without democratic involvement was outdated and crying out for reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="08013156000194">In what circumstances should Parliament be involved? The concept of a formal declaration of war is outdated for a host of legal reasons. We last went to war&#151;as we were reminded by the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad&#151;in 1942 against Siam. The modern version is armed conflict. The Geneva conventions and protocol are not very helpful in defining it, but we all have some idea what it is when we see it. We cannot cater for all eventualities. A convention should cater for most eventualities and should stand the test of time. The consultative paper prefers a convention to statutory control. It states, and I cannot improve  on this:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"><a name="08013156000541">&#147;A Parliamentary convention in the form of a resolution has the advantages of being more flexible and adaptable. The interpretation of the resolution would lie clearly in the hands of Parliament rather than the courts. It could be framed in more general terms than is possible with statute. It is therefore less likely to interfere with the operational freedoms and responsibilities of commanders in the field&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08013156000518">The Select Committee agreed that a convention is better able to anticipate what might happen in 20, 30 or 40 years&#146; time. In my view, the more generally it is drafted the better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="08013156000195">There remains the problem when troops have to be committed urgently and secretly. I believe that the Government should then, at the earliest practical opportunity, seek Parliament&#146;s approval. Informing Parliament is not enough. There are obvious difficulties. The egg cannot be unscrambled. Even if what has been done is perfectly legal, if there is overwhelming dissent, it would hardly be feasible for the Government to continue with it, or in reality to continue in office at all. We are reminded of the realpolitik of what happened in the Norway debate. This consultative paper augurs well for the future.</p>

The document giving the agenda for the debate seems to be well written, although as a pedant of many years&#146; standing I cannot avoid noting that the Secretary of State for Defence and for Scotland on page 8 spells his name in two ways&#151;once with an &#147;e&#148; at the end and once without. Can we assume that the &#147;e&#148;-less Brown is for the Scots, or the Picts perhaps? Paragraph 44 refers to the fact that this country last declared war in 1942. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, told us that the declaration was against Thailand but the Library assured me it was against Romania. That is of no great importance now, except to note that a formal declaration of war has not been made since the Second World War.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="08013156000198">On the first matter of the legal requirement, like the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Guthrie, and many others, I think we would be better served by a convention. Parliament depends for its good working on convention as much as on legal requirements. No two international threats are quite the same. Iraq was different from Suez, even though both were put forward as issues for international intervention on what my noble and gallant friend Lord Bramall rightly described as false premises. I do not see that a legal requirement to consult Parliament would remove the risk of false premises but I could be convinced of the benefit of a legal requirement if it were successfully argued that the armed services desired or needed it.</p>

<a name="80131-0006.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="08013156000199">The second matter is the consultation of your Lordships&#146; House. The Government think this is unnecessary but I think that view is mistaken. The other place is still known for its great debates but on important issues, as we in this House know only too well, it is usually easy enough for the Government of the day to secure a majority. The great change experienced in the other place in the last century has been the lamentable vast increase in the number of members of the Government who are Members of that other place&#151;98 last week before the reshuffle. There also are about 50 Parliamentary Private Secretaries and I dare say at least another 50 Members of Parliament are hoping to catch the Whip&#146;s eye so that they might one day become Parliamentary Private Secretaries themselves. The Government&#146;s strength is perhaps 200. With that number it must be always easy for good Whips to secure good majorities. One subject many of us would like to see treated in the context of a future discussion on the governance of Britain would be the reform of the other place. The noble Lord, Lord Anderson, implied that that would be desirable, perhaps by cutting the number of Members, as was once suggested by a distinguished Labour Foreign Secretary, the late Mr Anthony Crosland.</p>

<a name="80131-0006.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="08013156000200">It is also worth mentioning that this House has one or two important residual powers. For example, we are legally obliged to approve any plan by the other place to extend the life of a Parliament, as happened in 1939. Because the other place is not&#151;and I hope this remark is in order&#151;in an especially independent stage of its history, there would be a great benefit to requiring that this House be always consulted on matters of war and peace. It is generally admitted that this House is in rather good shape and always has had among its Members persons of military experience. Let us hope that whatever reforms are afoot, we will always have them. Our noble and gallant friends in this House are in a strong position in our legislature, considering that there are few Members of the other place with military experience, as was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, in a fine speech in this House on 22 November.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="08013156000201">If there is to be a legal requirement, my preference would be for the constitutional reform Bill introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, in January 2006, which is described on page 20 of the consultative document, whereby, unless there is overwhelming urgency, the Government would before an international armed conflict require backing from

That is, in fact, close to the present position, for there was an important debate on Iraq in this House&#151;without a vote, it is true&#151;on 18 March 2003, two days before the other place voted on 20 March.</p>

He and I have served and are serving on a number of bodies together and I have good reason from time to time to be grateful for his judgment and wisdom. However, I have some hesitation in speaking as my military experience was as a subaltern doing my national service more than 50 years ago.</p>

<a name="80131-0006.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="08013156000203">This was during the Suez crisis and it has already been mentioned that there is an echo from that time in some of the issues of today. Since then I served in the war Cabinet during the first Gulf conflict, which gave me some practical experience in these matters. It is that experience as a member of a war Cabinet that emboldens me to say something. I have seen a Prime Minister and her senior colleagues faced with some of these major issues.</p>

<a name="80131-0006.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="08013156000204">With that in mind, I have read all the statutory options set out in the Government&#146;s consultation paper and my feeling is that each of them has difficulties. I would not want procedural matters to get in the way of effective decision-making in this difficult area. My view is that the Government of the day are the Executive with all the information and intelligence, and the Government have to make the decisions with, at times, awesome consequences. I would accept a convention, but in reality that is practically what we have now. No Government worth their salt would attempt a war without seeking to take Parliament along with them in whatever way seemed most effective.</p>

<a name="80131-0006.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="08013156000205">I very much agreed with the evidence that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, gave to your Lordships&#146; Constitution Committee some time ago, when he emphasised that Governments decide and Parliament approves, but that the arrangements were best settled on a case-by-case basis. I am not sure that those are the views of the current Government, but in my view no Government could stay in office if they sought to prosecute a war without the support of Parliament. I cannot conceive of a Minister or a Government staying in office for a single day without the support of the House of Commons. My long experience of the usual channels has shown me to what lengths a Government will go both publicly and privately to maintain understanding and support for their policies in this area. Obviously I shall not reveal examples of my experience of where that was a very important part of the way that the Government pursued their interests&#151;making sure that they had the maximum support that they could get, because that is key for a successful operation. So the heart of my argument in this respect is: the House of Commons has either to back the Government or sack them. No other option is worthwhile in the end.</p>

<a name="80131-0006.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="08013156000206">Turning to the other half of the consultation paper, the role of Parliament in relation to treaties should be more significant. Of course any treaty that affects our  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_775"><b>31 Jan 2008 : Column 775</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>domestic law cannot be brought into effect without legislation, but treaties themselves do not need to be approved by Parliament. Successive Governments have invited consideration under the Ponsonby rule. As a number of noble Lords have said, those arrangements are not sufficient. I am not convinced that the 21-day period provided is long enough and the Royal Commission of which I had the honour to be chairman suggested that a Select Committee of your Lordships&#146; House would be an ideal way for Parliament to scrutinise treaties and to draw its attention to matters of concern and importance, so that if necessary debates and votes could take place before ratification. The committee has not been set up and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, indicated, a number of your Lordships know that the Liaison Committee has on more than one occasion turned such a proposal down. This is not the moment, nor am I the person, to question that, but such a committee should have a significant place in a reformed House of Lords.</p>

<a name="80131-0006.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="08013156000207">I would not expect the Select Committee to have special powers, but the sort of expertise that this House can command would make it of great value to Parliament as a whole. I see no great advantage in setting up the committee in a bureaucratic way and thus would favour a convention as the best way forward. If for any reason the Government of the day failed to honour that convention or ignored any vote in the House of Commons, Parliament has the remedy&#151;it should sack the Government. That applies to both the issues we are considering. Parliament cannot have its cake and eat it. Governments need the support of Parliament to stay in office. What they do not need are lap dogs barking at their ankles but refusing to bite.</p>

<a name="80131-0006.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="08013156000209">In today&#146;s changing world, with its complex and far less predictable security environment, these matters need to be considered further. I am mindful that when I received my national service commission in 1951 we were required to study a&#151;then&#151;War Office publication entitled, <I>The Conduct of War</I>. Not surprisingly, after two world wars in the previous 37 years, that document tended to focus on armed conflict between nations and such things as the Geneva conventions, the United Nations charter and Article 5 of the Washington treaty which established NATO. All of those determined our legal approach to the initiation and conduct of war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="08013156000210">Today our security has to be achieved in a far less predictable environment, particularly with the growing risks that have arisen from state-sponsored and other sources of international terrorism. Under these circumstances, it is becoming less straightforward to define &#147;war&#148; and &#147;armed conflict&#148;, and even the

<a name="80131-0006.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="08013156000211">These changes have been further apparent in the approval of operations by the United Nations which have ranged from humanitarian aid, through peacekeeping and peace enforcement to fully fledged armed conflict. There is always the possibility that after we have committed our Armed Forces to a particular operation, it will escalate from one category to another for which different objectives, capabilities and rules of engagement will be required. In addition&#151;as has already been mentioned&#151;in operations such as the rescue of hostages in Sierra Leone, absolute security and surprise are needed, together with the authority at the outset to use the force necessary in order to achieve success in the face of uncertainties and risks that cannot prudently be debated, or even revealed, before such operations are launched. The Select Committee emphasised that the Government, in seeking parliamentary approval, should define the military objectives of an operation. This is essential if it is to be effectively planned and resourced, though some objectives may have to be protected initially for security reasons.</p>

<a name="80131-0006.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="08013156000212">There is a wider dimension to this definition of objectives that also needs to be addressed at the outset if such operations are to come to a satisfactory conclusion. Military operations are a means to an end, not an end in themselves. It therefore behoves Governments to address at the outset the post-military phase of such operations, covering all other objectives&#151;with the provision of adequate resources to achieve them, if necessary on a wider international basis, in order to rebuild the country or the society concerned. Several of us in this House asked that specific question about Iraq before our forces were committed in 2003. We received no adequate response and have, since then, seen all too clearly the consequences of that serious omission. Nor, in seeking to redefine our war-making powers, should we forget that in coalition operations, other nations can each have their own legal basis for organising such deployments. In terms of timescales and security, these can be difficult to reconcile with our own national procedures without undermining the effectiveness of the whole operation. As chairman of the NATO Military Committee when NATO was preparing to go into Bosnia and take over from the UN, I confirm what has already been said&#151;that many other nations admired the straightforwardness and speed with which our decisions were taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="08013156000213">None of what I have been saying is intended to be negative about the review of war-making powers. I understand how the events in 2003, resulting in the invasion of Iraq, led to relevant concerns. But in today&#146;s less-clear-cut security environment, this can be an immensely complicated matter that needs to be considered further before, for example, we abandon completely the royal prerogative, or something equivalent to it. Nor, I believe, in this review&#151;as again has been referred to&#151;should we forget the effect of such war-making procedures on our Armed Forces. Having accepted the unique commitment of going whenever and wherever they are directed and, if necessary, placing themselves in harm&#146;s way, they need to believe that these important issues have been

The underlying theme of his lectures was the belief that ultimately the dissenters were always right and their views were ultimately confirmed. So it was to prove, I believe, over Suez and also over Iraq. Now it has been endorsed admirably&#151;and I congratulate them&#151;by the Government of Gordon Brown. They restate in their consultative document what the Union of Democratic Control, including the good Lord Ponsonby, stated in 1914&#151;that no treaty arrangement or undertaking should be entered into without the sanction of Parliament, and that there should be democratic control over the war power. This excellent consultation paper carries the support not only of Gordon Brown but, more indirectly, of David Cameron and Mr Nick Clegg&#151;all providing a consensus in favour of old radicalism. Cobden, Bright, Lloyd George, Keir Hardie and Nye Bevan, you should be living at this hour.</p>

<a name="80131-0006.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="08013156000216">The present situation is an undemocratic absurdity. The royal prerogative is a symbol of the fact that the people of this country are not citizens&#151;they do not have an organic relationship with the process of supreme decision-making that, for example, the Americans or, in some respects, the French do. Since time is limited, I do not want to say anything particularly about treaty-making powers. We have heard, notably from the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, how the royal prerogative can be effectively nullified in relation to treaties and that, for all their other merits, the rules of Lord Ponsonby are not significantly robust in this connection. But above all, there is the prerogative of the war power. This is the supreme area where citizenship should be exercised. It is extraordinary that the procedures have altered hardly at all over the centuries&#151;nor would they ever, frankly, if some views expressed in this admirable debate were accepted. There happened to be a vote over Iraq, but that was entirely due to the fortuitous influence of the late Robin Cook, and is not a binding convention.</p>

It should be a standard and statutory procedure. If there is armed conflict, Parliament should automatically be recalled if there is a recess&#151;as it was not, for example, after the attack on the Lebanon in 2006. There should automatically be regular reports on military action to Parliament, in case there is what has been called mission creep. Parliament should have the same rights as the Government to call upon legal advice to consider the legal aspects of military action. After all, the Government do this&#151;the Attorney-General is not commonly an expert in international law and he&#151;or perhaps she&#151;calls on legal advice, so Parliament should do so. This would also ensure that our conduct in any war observes the rules of war as well as human rights legislation, conventions and international law.</p>

<a name="80131-0006.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="08013156000218">I firmly believe that the legal justification by the Attorney-General should be given in full to Parliament. It was not in the case of the Iraq war&#151;it was like getting blood out of a stone, and that was one of the many regrettable features of the situation. Even worse was the situation in 1956, when the then Attorney-General, Manningham-Buller, advised that the action was unlawful, but his view was superseded and the slapdash view of Lord Kilmuir, the then Lord Chancellor, was taken instead. Manningham-Buller might have resigned, but did not, and indeed in due course became Lord Chancellor. It is important that there should be a full legal statement and if this is not observed, Parliament should simply refuse to authorise supplies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="08013156000219">The Constitution Committee argued against a statutory basis and called for a parliamentary convention. During a previous debate in May&#151;unfortunately, I was abroad at the time&#151;an extraordinarily wise and sensible observation was made by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, who said that a convention is not created but evolves over a long period. I do not think that a convention can be created. It can easily be too permissive and too vague and can easily be evaded by the Executive. Not that legislation is necessarily perfect either: we should always remember the 1973 war powers treaty in the United States, which was legislation. It has also been commonly evaded and has given undue authority to the president.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="08013156000220">However, to be effective and meaningful, there has to be a legislative and statutory context for these matters. I should have thought that we could have a compromise between specific resolutions on particular emergencies and a broad context of legislative sanction to ensure that processes are followed and not evaded, as they have been century after century. Without Parliament&#146;s statutory approval of war-making powers, we will not be a democracy. We should have the information and it should be in the public domain. In the era of a technological revolution, frankly Parliament should have the same rights as those held by the press&#151;the information and media authorities. Secrecy has been the curse of our constitution and we saw it here long before the era of sofa government.</p>

As we know, religion can be a force for peace or war, it can heal or hurt, and it can create or destroy on a scale unimaginable to previous generations.

I want the radicals and extremists in all faiths, but especially among my own co-religionists, to understand clearly that strapping oneself with explosives to kill others in an act of suicide in search of martyrdom is totally un-Islamic and against the instructions of the Koran&#151;the holy book which all Muslims must obey.

I want to draw the attention of the House to the peculiar and particular contribution that war itself has played in the development of our parliamentary processes. If we go back to the 17th century, we see that if the king or the crown could avoid war, they also avoided calling Parliaments. It was war that eventually, and fatefully, forced Charles I to summon Parliament, with all the consequences that flowed from that. His son, Charles II, governed the last four years of his life without any Parliament at all; he stayed out of war and conflict. From five years after that&#151;1690&#151;to the present day, this House and the other place have sat every year. That is a unique record of representation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="08013156000235">Why is there such a tradition of representation, meeting and scrutiny? The prolonged conflicts and war between 1690 and 1715 ensured a permanent place for Parliament as a central institution of the state&#151;as opposed to an event, which it had been before. War has played a significant part in the way in which our parliamentary processes have evolved. It was involved in the birth of the demand for scrutiny of estimates, in the beginning of the Public Accounts Commission and, above all, in the introduction of annual Sessions, with which came debates and inquiries. There was no squeamishness in the 1690s about debating war&#151;strategy, cost and conduct of war was debated with vehemence and passion. That was the legacy for us from that post-Revolution Parliament.</p>

I have noticed in my parliamentary lifetime in the other place an increasing lack of interest in or concern about the details of estimates. I am one of the last veterans of the old &#147;jumbo&#148; estimates committee of the Commons, which at least tried to tie its inquiry to a vote. The noble Lord opposite was also a member.

I draw the attention of the House to evidence supplied by the Ministry of Defence. We could not publish it in full, but it is summarised in paragraph 27 of our report. Since 1990, there have been 60 military operations. It would have been absurd and dangerous to suggest that parliamentary approval could apply to each and every one of those operations. When members of the committee analysed those 60 operations, we saw that they flowed from a series of initial mission decisions: repelling the Iraq invasion of Kuwait; the enforcement of no-fly zones in Iraq; the coalition operations in Iraq from March 1993; our contributions to the Balkans in the UN Protection Force and the NATO-led Implementation Force; Sierra Leone; and, finally, Afghanistan.</p>

It would have given an additional degree of authority, particularly with regard to international legal obligations, legal rights and so forth; I refer in particular to the need for understanding and appreciating the legal basis of any such decision.</p>

A parliamentary convention can be created by the powerful all-party consensus that seems to be emerging as a result of discussions and debates. I believe that we will have the force of Parliament behind that. Governments will constantly err on the side of coming to Parliament for approval rather than trying to avoid it. If we established such a convention, that would involve not doing something radically new or dangerous, but restoring and renewing a degree of parliamentary accountability&#151;our predecessors began that more than 300 years ago.</p>

The post-conflict reconstruction plan was not properly executed or drafted, despite it being the legal responsibility of the occupying power to do so. How did this come to pass? The noble Lord, Lord Butler, in his excellent report tells us that the answer involved sofa government rather than Cabinet government and a dodgy dossier that could be torn to shreds in classified briefings with officials. Will the proposed changes prevent a recurrence? I suggest not, because they would not change the deeply flawed government decision-making process of the sofa government of the time. Also, it is not possible for 650 MPs to forensically examine a dodgy dossier or other classified documents. The fact is we have to rely upon the collective judgment of the Cabinet and the rest of the Government. I am afraid the Cabinet has been a miserable failure. The rest of the Government did not do very well, with the notable exception of the noble Lord the Minister on the Front Bench, who took a very honourable position at the time.</p>

Unless parliamentarians have seen the grand strategic plan for the operations, which I suspect would be a little bit classified, they cannot possibly know the answer to the question of whether the unintended consequences have been properly dealt with. I recall during the debates in February 2003 that your Lordships, while confident of the military outcome, were asking about post-conflict reconstruction. We asked the right questions. Apparently all had been considered, but of course we now find out that it had not.</p>

There is an argument that the changes will bring us into line with similar democratic states. That may be true, but many of those states do not engage in military operations to the extent that the UK does and, because of their procedures, do not have the utility that the UK forces have; many noble Lords focused on that. In addition, they normally have secrecy and urgency provisions in their arrangements, which means that a malign or incompetent Government can easily circumvent the requirements.</p>

If a significant proportion of the Members of another place are against government policy in a crisis, a vote of confidence can be called. An adverse vote would stop any military operation in its tracks. In practice, such a situation would never arise because the government Chief Whip in another place would report the views of Members of the House in confidence to the Prime Minister long before any vote took place. Of course, the view of Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition would be crucial. In 2003, the Government were confident of the support of the

When I arrived in HQ 1 (UK) Armoured Division in March 2003, I had the words of the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, ringing in my ears that war was neither imminent nor inevitable. I confidently expected a month of intensive exercises before we started operations, so I was a little surprised when I got to headquarters and the question was, &#147;Will we be going this week or next week?&#148;.</p>

However, we would also as a nation have experienced immediate, catastrophic and permanent failure in our strategic relations with the United States, which no UK Government could afford to allow to happen. The noble Lord, Lord Anderson, articulated similar concerns, but I thought that he was rather muted when he talked about a &#147;stabbing&#148; in the back.</p>

These actions cannot be done easily without our opponent becoming aware of them through other intelligence agencies, but they would be taken early enough in the process not to affect the negotiating position of Her Majesty&#146;s Government and the diplomatic efforts. The difficulty with an early vote is that not all the diplomatic solutions will have been fully exhausted; therefore, it could not be the final decision.</p>

We all think that we know an armed conflict when we see one, but it would be difficult to define precisely in statutory words the ambit of what was or was not such an armed conflict as to require prior parliamentary authorisation. That is the principal, although by no means only, reason why I was and remain firmly convinced, like the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Guthrie, and many other speakers, that the right way forward is to impose parliamentary control by means of a binding&#151;in my notes I had written &#147;convention&#148;, but in deference to the noble Lord, Lord Morgan, I shall not use that word&#151;resolution based on a clear undertaking, accepted and endorsed by the other party, that the Government will not involve the nation in an armed conflict without a clear vote of the House of Commons. I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, that that can be binding, although I do not mind whether it is binding as a convention or as an undertaking by everyone. This is clearly preferable to a statutory obligation, which would present almost impossible obstacles to drafting and definition and which would afford an open invitation to litigation.

In practice, it will almost always be clear whether a particular deployment of forces is or is not of the kind that Parliament intended to control.

It was interesting that the majority of the conflicts mentioned by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Guthrie, did not fall in the category of emergency or, indeed, surprise. But if that did occur, what, then, should be required of the Government by way of parliamentary endorsement?

But that is not the point. It is probably pretty unlikely, but even if you ask for parliamentary approval in advance, the Commons will vote by a majority against even a prospective deployment recommended by the Government.

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="08013156000265">The Prime Minister has indicated his Government&#146;s intention that Parliament&#146;s right to ratify international treaties should be put on a statutory footing. That is immensely welcome. A number of questions were raised in the Government&#146;s paper which merit close attention. We were helpfully advised by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, not to regard this as a conclusive debate&#151;many more matters need to be fleshed out and we may need further detailed papers from the Government on both topics. In particular, I noted the proposal that a statutory provision might allow the Secretary of State discretion on the need for flexibility. I would like to see what that provides before assenting to such a proposal&#151;it might operate as a manner of getting out of the significant parliamentary obligation.</p>

There have been a number of recommendations from this House in particular that it would be a very suitable role for the second Chamber to consider treaties. Although I recognise the difficulty of doing so in all circumstances, I put in a plea for the prior consideration of treaties; it should not simply be ex post facto, when the consequences of rejection can be very serious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="08013156000268">The central focus of this debate has been the exercise of the war powers and the inappropriateness&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Morgan, said, the historical anachronism&#151;of the prerogative controlling their exercise. Once again, the general principle to which the Government have given voice&#151;that the ultimate decision on the use of war powers should be for the House of Commons&#151;is admirable, although I will have something to say about the role of this House before concluding.</p>

<a name="80131-0008.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="08013156000269">There was a general acceptance in the debate that our troops have the right to expect three things when they are committed to armed conflict: first, the support of the country; secondly, the support of Parliament; and thirdly, the assurance that they are supported by the law&#151;particularly international law. These arguments seem compelling for bringing decision-making about the exercise of war powers to Parliament. We have seen a quite disturbing, growing questioning of the legitimacy of interventions within the armed services at all ranks and levels. We must have a means of preventing such a debilitating occurrence.</p>

<a name="80131-0008.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="08013156000270">A number of questions were raised on how this general principle would be operated, some of which could be answered quite straightforwardly. It is clear that operational flexibility in the field must be retained, and we cannot&#151;as the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, powerfully said&#151;second-guess commanders on the ground. We must also address the morale of the troops. The risk of the perception of the war being unjustified, addressed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, can best be handled by the parliamentary debate preceding the commitment.</p>

<a name="80131-0008.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="08013156000271">What would be the consequences of a failure to obtain parliamentary approval? The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Guthrie, among a number of other distinguished noble and gallant Lords, made the clear point that individual members of the armed services should not be put at legal risk as a result of the failure of Parliament to authorise or approve, either in advance or retrospectively, the action. That, of course, does not discharge them from their obligation to observe the rules of international law, particularly human rights; the defence of superior orders is very limited indeed.</p>

<a name="80131-0008.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="08013156000272">Other questions were raised about definitions of &#147;armed conflict&#148;. Again, the Government have asked for our views on that. Mine is that it should be very wide. Similarly, the definition of &#147;Armed Forces&#148; should include the Reserve Forces, as specifically asked about by the Government.</p>

<a name="80131-0008.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="08013156000273">The need for information to inform the debates before decisions are taken is clearly paramount. The extent of that information provided by the Government is a matter of some controversy. The Government have only committed themselves to providing statements on the objectives, places of troop deployment and the legal basis. I am bound to say that that would be the bare minimum of information required to justify a war or commitment of troops to armed conflict. It is clearly of paramount importance that the legal opinion should be seen to be comprehensive and independent.

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="08013156000282">There is the importance of accountability, not just as a constitutional principle but as a strong incentive to responsible ministerial behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="08013156000283">Throughout the time that the Select Committee report was being drafted, the noble Lord, Lord Holme of Cheltenham, was constantly reminding us that the royal prerogative nowadays operates not in the context of the 17th century but in that of a living, working democracy.

<a name="80131-0008.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="08013156000284">Many noble and gallant Lords also drew attention to the importance of morale in warfare. Almost every military manual&#151;certainly the Royal Armoured Corps military manual&#151;states that morale is the single most important factor in victory. It is crucial that any soldier engaged in operations is confident that not just Parliament but the nation is behind him. </p>

<a name="80131-0008.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="08013156000285">There is another important question: that of legality. As a result of the international criminal convention, as your Lordships will know, an individual soldier can now be prosecuted for a war crime. He will need to be assured, before he goes into operations, that the war he is about to fight is indeed legal. He must be told that. The Attorney-General must take a view, and that view must be stated in public.</p>

<a name="80131-0008.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="08013156000286">One matter that has not been addressed is resources. Parliament is the source of supply. We all know from the operation in Afghanistan that there have been many hesitations about whether our soldiers are properly equipped to fight the battle that they must fight there. Parliament, essentially the House of Commons, is responsible for authorising supply. That, surely, is another underlying constitutional reason for taking the approach favoured by your Lordships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="08013156000287">Of course it is true, as many noble and gallant Lords have said, that the operation of any convention, especially if it is to be enshrined in a resolution, must be in context. I recall the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, saying that each operational situation writes its own particular script; so the operation of the convention must depend on the circumstances. Sometimes we will be engaged in operations because of a treaty obligation or because we are a member of a coalition, or we may have to act very quickly in circumstances of surprise. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Vincent, reminded us of the operation in Sierra Leone. The convention must have sufficient flexibility to cope with all these different realities. That provides no difficulty; all constitutional conventions evolve and adapt to circumstances; and as our experience of these situations develops, so our application of the convention becomes more sophisticated and gives Parliament increased opportunities to exercise control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="08013156000288">The greatest difficulty is that Parliament will always operate in circumstances of imperfect knowledge. It cannot possibly know all the facts that are known to the non-parliamentary parts of the constitution: to the Cabinet, to the intelligence services and to the Chiefs of Staff. Indeed, it would be inappropriate for Parliament to know those things because they might adversely affect military operations. Here is the crux of the problem, and one that we investigated last year in our debate, as my noble friend Lord Attlee reminded us. What went wrong in Iraq was that there was a breakdown of the non-parliamentary parts of our constitution. The great departments of state, the intelligence services and the Chiefs of Staff were not engaged in the way they were in the Second World War, or I hope in all operations up to Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="08013156000289">The devastating indictment by the noble Lord, Lord Butler, of the operation of government during the Iraq period is a graphic illustration of why it is absolutely essential that the main changes that the Government make to the convention can give Parliament the assurance that this part of our constitution is operating effectively, so that we can trust the decisions taken by these different component parts. Parliament must trust the judgment of people who know more than it does; we cannot operate in this theatre otherwise. I suggest that the Government have got a lot of work to do here; and they will have to convince us that the necessary changes have now been made in the light of the Iraq affair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="08013156000294">The noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said that this was a most significant moment in the constitutional evolution in this country. I share that view. The key element of the paper that we are debating that runs through all of it is the need to limit the powers of the Executive and to subject them to greater scrutiny and control. That stems from a conviction that, in our democracy, the freedom of the Executive should be more formally constrained in order to respect their obligations to Parliament. This is especially true when the Executive derive their powers from the ancient prerogatives under the Crown, rather than those explicitly granted to them by Parliament&#151;the context of which my noble friend Lord Rowlands put so well. </p>

<a name="80131-0008.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="08013156000295">The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Guthrie, emphasised that the power to send the Armed Forces into conflict and to commit the country to international obligations through the conclusion of treaties are two of the most important powers that a Government can wield. It is axiomatic for a democracy rooted in the sovereignty of Parliament, as we are, that it should be Parliament that has the final say in such grave matters. I very much endorse the remarks of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, when he talked of troops in the field needing the support of country and Parliament, as well as understanding that what they are doing is legal. I also entirely endorse the view that it is unthinkable that action could be taken without parliamentary approval.</p>

<a name="80131-0008.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="08013156000296">We are in a very different world. The existing arrangements need to change, and the consultation paper, as noble Lords know, sets out a number of matters that will need to be fully discussed and worked through to effect those changes. The consultation closed on 17 January, but I assure noble Lords that today&#146;s debate will be taken fully into account. It is clear that there is widespread support in your Lordships&#146; House for the direction of travel. Equally, it is also very clear, as a number of noble Lords have said&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, was particularly forceful about this&#151;that the Government must have a degree of latitude in considering whether the Armed Forces should be deployed or engaged, and if and when they are, how to prosecute any conflict. We need to strike a balance here to guarantee the flexibility and members of the Armed Forces, and we are very much attuned to the need for reform to take into account the impact on the Armed Forces in the field. I hope that the consultation paper makes that clear, and certainly paragraphs 38 and 39 make the point that the impact on the morale of members of the Armed Forces themselves is critical, and that by providing a mechanism for explicit parliamentary approval of relevant deployment decisions, the intention is to show the Armed Forces that Parliament, and through it the nation, is fully behind them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="08013156000297">I understand the concerns of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, but there is no intention in any of our proposals discussed in the document to interfere in any way with the operational decisions of commanders in the field.

<a name="80131-0008.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="08013156000298">The options set out in the paper have been referred to. Again, they seek to strike a balance between approval by Parliament and flexibility. The paper sets out four options and we have yet to take a firm view on them. On the one hand, it makes clear the advantages of putting in place a structure around parliamentary resolutions so that they can be created with less formality and are more easily amended, but that failure to comply is not automatically unlawful and its interpretation is a matter for Parliament rather than the courts. On the other hand, however, there are disadvantages. It might appear to provide a weaker assurance of compliance by the Government and it does not formally constrain the prerogative. As the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, pointed out, the Constitution Committee came out firmly against the idea of the legislative route, and that view seems to be supported by many noble Lords. We recognise the various concerns that have been cited and we will look carefully at these matters. I also accept, as my noble friend Lord Morgan suggested, that conventions evolve and are not made.</p>

<a name="80131-0008.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="08013156000299">I turn to the definition of a conflict. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Vincent, described some of the challenges here with changes in the nature of conflict. He will know that the consultation paper proposes that the meaning of &#147;armed conflict&#148; is that used in international humanitarian law and sets out an example in draft as Option B of Annex A. It is worth remarking that this is linked to the issue of how the Government would continue to fulfil their international obligations and their ability to participate in any multinational obligations that would form part of those very obligations. The Government will have to continue to work with coalition partners and any procedure would need to reflect those continuing obligations. Similarly, the consultation paper sets out where there should be an exemption for exceptional circumstances, when in order to maintain operational security and effectiveness it may be necessary to allow deployments without parliamentary approval.</p>

<a name="80131-0008.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="08013156000300">I thank the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, for his kind remarks. He discussed Cabinet government and its loss. I do not agree, but I would say to him that parliamentary scrutiny is the best answer to his issues and concerns. Of course the information supplied to Parliament is critical, and the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, was right to say that there will be limits to the information that can be provided. There is and has to be a question of trust, but I am confident that the current arrangements which have been put in place will respond to the question he raises. I would also say to my noble friend Lord Morgan that the advice given by the Attorney-General is a matter that is being considered as part of the current consultation process being undertaken by the Attorney-General.</p>

<a name="80131-0008.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="08013156000301">The information may be imperfect, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, suggested, because any information supplied should not put the Armed Forces in jeopardy or compromise the effectiveness of operations. One of the suggestions put forward in the consultation paper to allow Parliament greater access to some information would be for Parliament and the Government to agree the way in which sensitive information could be presented. There might, for instance, be a Joint Committee of both Houses, and the views of noble Lords on that proposal would be extremely interesting.</p>

<a name="80131-0008.htm_para28">
<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="08013156000302">That leads to the question of when. I am grateful to the Constitution Committee for its very interesting comments on that. Sometimes, for reasons of urgency or national security, it would not be possible for Parliament to give prior approval. The Constitution Committee does not favour a requirement put forward in the consultation paper that it would be the duty of the Government merely to inform Parliament rather than to seek retrospective approval for deployment. The committee&#146;s preferred option is that in regard to such an application, if it were not possible to seek prior approval, the Government should provide retrospective information within seven days or as soon as was feasible, at which point parliamentary approval should be sought. I should say on this that there are a number of issues on which to reflect. If Parliament did not then provide retrospective approval, there would be an expectation that forces would be withdrawn or remain in theatre as part of a coalition but under different terms. That might involve a breach of international obligations or damage international relations, and to take action quickly might put the Armed Forces at risk. The Government consider that the preferable alternative would be to introduce a procedure under which the Prime Minister would be obliged to inform Parliament when Armed Forces had been committed under exceptional circumstances with no further proceedings. Indeed, I think that that was the approach favoured by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, in his Private Member&#146;s Bill.</p>

<a name="80131-0008.htm_para29">
<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="08013156000303">The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, asked a series of interesting questions about the impact of delays and constraints in making decisions by international organisations. He asked how one could ensure that parliamentary exchanges do not cut across or undermine the procedures leading to agreement among international organisations. That is a very important question that we will need to consider. Again, the question of what has been described as mission creep is also something that will need very careful consideration. The Constitution Committee made clear its concern at the Government&#146;s proposal that Parliament&#146;s involvement should be limited to approving the initial engagement. The committee would prefer that in addition to keeping Parliament informed of the progress of deployments, the Government should be required to seek a renewal of parliamentary approval if a deployment&#146;s nature or objectives were to alter significantly. It went on to say that such a requirement is vital to ensure that mission creep does not become a problem. As several noble Lords have pointed out, recent experience has shown us that military operations often change in size, scope and nature as situations develop, so it is important that the mechanism is

I noted the caution of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, on this and here operational flexibility is of vital importance. It is important that any processes or procedures do not hold up an operation or compromise operational effectiveness, so we have to ensure that we get the balance right.</p>

The terminology &#147;low intensity and importance&#148; applies if the number of soldiers is small and the deployment does not involve participation in a conflict. That might include reconnaissance, armed missions for the purpose of self-defence, and where individual soldiers are deployed in the framework of personnel exchanges in a UN, NATO or EU mission. The Government will give further consideration to those matters.</p>

I am particularly concerned with one of the principles of war&#151;the maintenance of momentum&#151;and, as I detect that a window of opportunity has opened with the announcement by the Secretary of State for Justice of reforms to the National Offender Management Service and the announcement of an action plan on the treatment of women within six months, it is appropriate that we should address ourselves to how the momentum that is needed is to be changed.</p>

She said that there would be a debate on it later, and that was endorsed by the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, who could not have been here on that day. In the event, however, in June neither the Home Office nor the noble and learned Baroness had any further interest in the report. It then became the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice, and it was not until December, long after the statutory three months&#146; response, that the response to the Corston report was published. The Minister, Mr David Hanson, in effect accepted 39 and a half of the 43 recommendations and recommended in particular the importance of improved governance. Central to that, he said, was the appointment of a ministerial champion for women and criminal justice who would ensure that the actions to address issues for women were given the necessary priority and that commitments were delivered, as well as the appointment of a cross-departmental unit responsible for women and criminal justice, headed by a senior civil servant, to co-ordinate, drive forward and monitor the work on behalf of the Minister. It is on that proposal&#151;a Minister as champion&#151;that I am declaring war, without doubting in any way the commitment of the nominated Minister, Maria Eagle, whom I know to be totally dedicated to the task, as indeed are her ministerial colleagues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="08013156000321">My interest in this subject began two minutes after I entered the Home Office on 1 December 1995 as the new Chief Inspector of Prisons. I was met by my then deputy, who had been a governor of Holloway, the largest women&#146;s prison in the country at the time. There he had defeated a strike by the POA, as a result of which he was removed from being governor and made an inspector, which struck me as being very silly. He told me I had to make an immediate decision because conditions in Holloway were so bad that the board of visitors had been making reports for six months to Ministers and the Prison Service and nothing had happened. He endorsed the idea of us going in and asked me when we would go. I said that

The reason for that was that no diagrams of women&#146;s bodies were printed by the Prison Service, which told me that something was wrong in the direction. When I went to see the director-general of the Prison Service and asked to see the director of women who was responsible for treatment and conditions everywhere, he said that there was not one. I said, &#147;Who is responsible for telling people what to do?&#148; and he said, &#147;A civil servant in the policy department&#148;. I asked who was responsible for going out and seeing that treatment was consistent everywhere, so that women in Kent were treated in the same way as those in Lancashire.

I decided that something had to be done and that the inspectorate could play a part. In 1997, I published a paper entitled <I>Women in Prison</I>, recommending that a director should be appointed, responsible and accountable for what happened to all women anywhere, with budgetary and other responsibilities. I also recommended that instead of these monster places like Holloway, to which women were brought from all over England, there should be smaller units all over the country. I described one in Minneapolis that seemed to be the sort of model that we could follow. Recommendations accepted; nothing happened.</p>

Also in 2004, the Fawcett Society published the report of a commission on women in the criminal justice system, calling again for someone

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="08013156000329">We then have the Government supporting the appointment of a commission&#151;in principle only&#151;but wanting to appoint a champion Minister. Why do I object to that? First, you only have to go onto the Ministry of Justice website to see all the other responsibilities that Maria Eagle has. Therefore, with all the best intentions that she might have, how much time will she be able to give to being the champion? Secondly, we all know how frightfully busy Ministers are anyway with all the other demands on them. We also know that Ministers seem to change with bewildering rapidity, so for how long is she likely to be in post? The record shows that Ministers come with their own ideas; there is no reason why they should not, but that is no way to achieve consistent development of anything like an action plan.</p>

There have been publications by the Home Office and the Howard League; there have been initiatives and intentions. Yet so far, while there have been individual improvements in certain places, all that has been inconsistent because what is lacking is someone with direct responsibility for maintaining consistent improvement. In any week, if one intercepts this situation one finds inconsistent delivery all over England between all of the prisons, because nobody is responsible. Yesterday, in her annual report, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons drew attention to that yet again. She pointed to the inconsistencies that existed, the lack of appropriate treatment for women and the failure of people to listen to the reports made by the inspectorate, year after year, saying exactly the same thing and for exactly the same reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="08013156000331">Today, the Children&#146;s Commissioner has published a report on mother and baby units, a most important aspect, drawing attention to the fact that there are too few of them and that they are very thinly spread around the country. That means that far too many women who are going to have a baby in prison are miles away from where they come from. There is only one unit&#151;at Rugby in Warwickshire&#151;for girls under 18. It is in the Rainsbrook secure training centre, and it only has three beds. That is another aspect that has been ignored, but again the Prison Service was directed to&#151;and promised to&#151;carry out a review of

I have said that there is a window of opportunity, and my purpose in putting down this motion is to suggest ways in which that window can be used. The Ministry of Justice has announced, really, a reversion to the situation in 2001, when there was the equivalent of a commissioner of corrections&#146; responsibility for the prison and probation services&#151;I do not argue with that. However, where I do argue with the Ministry of Justice is in its making probation subordinate to prisons. That is a most regrettable step. One of the keystones of the Corston report is that, to reduce the appalling number of women in prison who should not be there and whose situation so dismayed the noble Baroness when she started her report, one needs proper community sentences and programmes to provide a satisfactory alternative to the sentencer. Therefore, the Probation Service must be right up in the hunt: not subordinate to but equal with the Prison Service, because it has an equal responsibility for what is going on. Today, another report has been published by the National Audit Office, drawing attention to the poor quality of community supervision and stating that there are all kinds of reasons for it, not least the lack of direction and resources in the Probation Service. It is all very well saying that we accept the recommendation for greater use of probation and community sentencing, but, if the resources do not exist, one will not get it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="08013156000333">The Minister should realise that the reason that nothing has happened for so long is that nobody has been responsible for doing it. Until one makes somebody responsible and accountable to the Minister for implementing the plan, it will not happen. The tragedy of that is that all the wonderful stuff in Corston, which is her regurgitation of what many of us and others have been saying for years, will join those reports as paving stones on a road to the future that is littered with good intentions. None of us wants that. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

We are told that we do not have a separate framework in law for women because we have a different structure for them. We are further told that to go down the route of a women&#146;s justice board could risk marginalising women further, when what is needed is to mainstream provision for women and ensure that, under the national offender management structure, sufficient priority is given to service provision for, and management of, women offenders.</p>

<a name="80131-0009.htm_para31">
<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="08013156000338">This is absurd. The Government&#146;s approach, taken at face value, is at variance with other policy areas. For example, if women do not have special and specific issues to face, why do we need a Women&#146;s Minister? Why did we put on statute the Sex Discrimination Act 1975? Why do we have a Commission for Equality and Human Rights which tackles women&#146;s issues as part of its overall brief? We do so because the fact remains that there are shared issues, special issues and specific issues that affect women. If the mainstream provision cannot meet these&#151;and the evidence is that it cannot&#151;there is no reason why we should not look at alternatives, and a women&#146;s justice board is a viable option open to us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="08013156000340">I should spell out in what ways women offenders&#146; characteristics and needs differ from those of male offenders. First, a much higher proportion of women prisoners have mental health problems than male prisoners. Surveys show that more women prisoners have a psychiatric history before entering prison. Many more have histories of self-harm than male prisoners. More have personality disorders, neurotic disorders, learning disabilities and problems of substance abuse&#151;and more have more than one diagnosis. Many more women prisoners have suffered past physical or sexual abuse at the hands of adults or partners.</p>

<a name="80131-0009.htm_para34">
<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="08013156000341">Secondly, a much higher proportion of women prisoners are sole carers of young children. In most cases where male prisoners are parents of young children, the child&#146;s mother is looking after them on the outside, but in only a quarter of cases of mothers in prison are the children looked after by their current or former partner. Thirdly, because there are far fewer prisons holding female prisoners, women are much more likely to be in prison a long way from their home areas. This makes visits from their children and other relatives more difficult and reduces the practicality of visits by probation officers from their home areas. With the mounting pressure of numbers, this problem has increased as women are increasingly transferred to whichever prison anywhere in the country has a vacancy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="08013156000342">Over the last 15 years the courts have responded to the growing mood of toughness in penal policy by adopting a more punitive stance towards women offenders. During that time the number of women prisoners has risen more than twice as fast as the male prison population. Yet most women sent to prison are neither violent nor dangerous and the majority have few previous convictions. Against this background we should look seriously at the case for establishing a women&#146;s justice board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="08013156000343">There is no doubt that the Youth Justice Board has significantly improved the arrangements for dealing with juvenile offenders. It has done this by setting standards for provision for young offenders. There is an equally strong case for the establishment of a women&#146;s justice board. The needs of women offenders are sufficiently distinct to justify establishing a board with the task of ensuring that provision for them meets their special needs. Because women offenders are a minority of those coming before the courts&#151;and a smaller minority of those in prison&#151;their special needs are much more likely to be overlooked if they remain an afterthought, tacked on to a system which is largely geared to the needs of men.</p>

We are faced with confused thinking on the part of policy-makers. Today&#146;s announcement seems to be a knee-jerk reaction to a serious crisis emerging in our prisons. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, identified a way forward. My advice to the Minister is to take up the challenge and advise his policy-makers to come up with a rational approach to women offenders.</p>

It is widely accepted that women who have committed crimes are doubly punished. They have broken not only the law, but the accepted societal norms of feminine behaviour. This experience of punishment is then multiplied within the female prison estate, which is an adapted male model. The one-size-fits-all approach is inappropriate for women and operates in a system where the male prison population predominates. The family and social backgrounds of women who are sent to prison display significant problems with relation to mental health, drug use and a history of violence and sexual abuse. There is a broad consensus that women in prisons

Sending women to prison usually is a highly damaging and destructive way of dealing with female offenders, who in most cases have committed non-violent crimes and are not a risk to the public. I am indebted to the Centre for Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Hull, where I serve as chancellor, for the advice it has given me in synthesising some of the literature, and in particular to Dr Helen Johnston. I also add my congratulations to Chris Clarke on his Library note.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="08013156000348">Up to 50 per cent of women report having experienced violence at home compared with a quarter of men. One in three women in prison has suffered sexual abuse. Some of the most deprived women in society end up in prison. If their needs had been identified earlier, incarceration should and could have been avoided. Most worryingly, the incarceration of women compounds the problems for their children. If ever the sins of the parent were being visited on the child, it is the case for women in custody. Many of the women are relatively young&#151;only 16 per cent are over 40. Two-thirds are mothers and 45 per cent had children living with them when they were imprisoned. According to the Prison Reform Trust, 17,700 children are separated from their mother by imprisonment each year. Only 5 per cent of children&#151;one in 20&#151;remain in their own home when their mother receives a sentence. They are losing not only their mother, but their surroundings&#151;the context in which they live. Is it surprising that those children, according to the evidence from Action for Prisoners&#146; Families and the Howard League, face disruption to their education and have difficulties coping at school? They end up being cared for outside their immediate families. The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, made the point about the difficulty in visiting. Recent evidence suggested that at HMP Cookham Wood 33 per cent of mothers were not receiving visits from their children. That is appalling. A quarter of mothers are held more than 100 miles away. The children lose their mother and their home, and it is almost impossible for them to visit the mother.</p>

The Minister&#146;s evidence was that it was 80 per cent. This is not an acceptable state of affairs. Women face appalling problems on their release from prison. A third of women lose their home when they go into prison, so are we surprised about the difficulties they have resettling in the community? I pay tribute to the Surrey Community Development Trust. It organises an excellent post-release scheme but it is minute. It is a beacon&#151;a centre of excellence&#151;but it is inadequately funded and not available to the vast number of women. It is time for us to act. I am encouraged by the activities of the shadow justice team which, as is right in opposition, is having a programme of re-evaluation and thought. I shall ensure that Nick Herbert, the Member for Arundel and South Downs, sees our deliberations today and I shall speak to him about what we believe now needs to happen&#151;and needs to happen fast.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="08013156000350">Yesterday&#146;s report by the Chief Inspector of Prisons, Ann Owers, was a wake-up call if ever there were one. Suicide and self-harm in women&#146;s prisons remains a significant problem. It is troubling that the number of self-inflicted deaths among women more than doubled from three to seven last year, reversing the trend of previous years. Women make up only  5 per cent of the prison population but account for  11 per cent of self-inflicted deaths. Women are 16 times more likely to self-harm than men and account for nearly half of all self-harm incidents. Some 31 per cent of women in custody had self-harmed, compared with 6 per cent of men. The statistics for young women are particularly shocking&#151;89 per cent of girls and 69 per cent of young adult women had harmed themselves. As we all know, in the wider population, the suicide rate for men is twice that for women. That shows the way that the prison environment exacerbates the difficulties that these women face.</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="08013156000351">It was of course the high number of suicides at Styal prison in 2003 that at last forced the Government to act and set up the Corston inquiry. We are really disappointed that the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, is not with us today. We have just seen the evidence on another female inmate&#151;Lisa Marley, aged 32, took her own life at Styal. I would be interested to know whether the Minister could confirm that she had been recommended for parole.</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="08013156000352">The figures go up and up. They have almost doubled in the past 10 years, and can now be seen in the context of a prison crisis that Ann Owers said was predicted, predictable and fuelled by legislation and policies that ignored consequences, cost or effectiveness, together with an absence of coherent strategic direction.</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="08013156000353">We have to act. We want clarification about the Titan prisons&#151;great warehouses for prisoners&#151;that go in totally the opposite direction to small, accessible prisons. Furthermore, women&#146;s prisons are being reroled for men because the crisis in men&#146;s prisons will always take precedence, as we all know.</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="08013156000354">I share the noble Lord&#146;s problems regarding the machinery of government. Ministerial groups, interdepartmental groups and official-led groups come and go. If I were told that an official group would be led by Helen Edwards, I might have some confidence. She worked with me many years ago when she was at Nacro and I was chairing a committee for the Children&#146;s Society on alternatives to justice fo r 14 year-olds. I have been involved in these matters for more than 30 years, led by the speaker who will follow me, the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="08013156000355">As the noble Lord said, we knew then that alternatives to prison would be the ideal way of avoiding incarceration. I speak rarely in this place and only when I have a profound conviction. We need a champion, such as my late aunt, the former mother-in-law of the noble Baroness, Lady Jay. On Monday, we went to the funeral of Peggy Jay on what would have been her 95th birthday.</p>

As she said, we have spent a lot of time in this area of juvenile courts, among other things. I thank my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham for bringing this important issue before us. He is an inspiration in the whole of this area, The excellent Corston report is the latest document to stress the need for a radical change of approach in this area. As we know, it is not the first. The case for change was crystal clear well over 10 years ago and we have heard about my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham&#146;s two thematic reports&#151;one published under one Government and another under the following Government. Both Governments who have been in charge of this system have failed to do what needs to be done.</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="08013156000359">There have been many reports since then, including the Wedderburn report of the Prison Reform Trust which made a major call for a women&#146;s justice board. In 2004, the Fawcett Society examined the problems faced by women throughout the criminal justice system. I must say that I have become tired of seeing this matter brought to debate again and again, but taken no further. Despite all this, the Government have failed to begin making the changes that are desperately needed. Continual delay has certainly reinforced my noble friend&#146;s case for the establishment of a thoroughly independent&#151;I stress, independent&#151;board to ensure action. I have no objection to any ministerial team doing its stuff, too, but we need an outside board to ensure action.</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="08013156000360">A prison system designed on military lines by men and for men is, as we all know, inappropriate for women. The crimes committed by women are largely non-violent&#151;30 per cent of female inmates are being held for drug offences&#151;and their sentences are correspondingly shorter. Sixty-three per cent are serving sentences of six months or less. What meaningful, rehabilitative work can be done in such a time, even without the catastrophic overcrowding referred to in Anne Owers&#146;s annual report, published yesterday?</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="08013156000361">Secondly, as we heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley, women are far more likely to be the primary carers of children. More than half of women in prison have a child under 16, more than a third have a child under five and 20 per cent are lone parents. The social cost of imprisoning women in terms of family breakdown is incalculable. I am glad that a number of organisations are trying to work out what some of the more preventive measures would save the nation.</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="08013156000362">Women in prison are disproportionately vulnerable. Many are victims themselves. I suspect that the true percentage is much higher than is recorded. I have mentioned drug offences. Among the foreign women imprisoned in this country, a high percentage are serving very long sentences for acting as mules&#151;bringing in drugs, no doubt under the auspices of organisers who are paying no penalty at all. Seventy per cent

More worryingly, up to 80 per cent have diagnosable mental health problems. So it is unsurprising that the rates of self-harm and suicide among women in prison are far higher than those among men.</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="08013156000363">The increasing severity of sentencing under this Government has caused the number of women in prison to rise. On 20 November 2007, the number of women in prison was 4,510. In the past decade, that figure has more than doubled. It is in this light that the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, has argued for a radical restructuring of the way that women are treated in the penal system. It is good news that the Government are committed to implementing the gender equality duty and that there is more enthusiasm among Ministers for community sentencing. But, as other noble Lords have said, it is hugely disappointing that the Government have so far failed to commit themselves to the central proposal of the noble Baroness, Lady Corston. It took the Government nine months to respond to the noble Baroness&#146;s report.</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="08013156000364">In contrast, the review by the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, published in December 2007, was met with immediate endorsement and the promise of a huge sum of money for the construction of three Titan prisons, each designed to hold up to 2,500 inmates. Surely this is quite the wrong direction&#151;not just for women, but for all members of the prison estate. Men today are increasingly playing a role in their children&#146;s upbringing. This should be encouraged in the penal system as well. There are good examples of where this is beginning to happen&#151;Wandsworth is one of them. Placing prisoners, whether male or female, in enormous prisons far from home can be only detrimental to the maintenance of family ties and to the possibility of reintegration into the community. More resources for projects to prevent offending and early help for vulnerable families are crucial. Where that fails, more help is required to prevent reoffending.</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="08013156000365">The recommendations of the noble Baroness must, for all our sakes, be given the attention and funding they deserve. I hope that the Minister will at last be able to reassure us on this point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="08013156000367">The facts about women, who constitute only 5.5 per cent of the total prison population, are extremely alarming and they underline the need for rapid reform. That is why the report of the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, is so important. It made three radical&#151;one might say almost visionary&#151;recommendations. It proposed multi-purpose women&#146;s day centres in our main cities. Through voluntary attendance at such centres, much would be done to prevent crime among women. The centres would provide for early diagnosis of addictions and mental ill-health, and they would provide help with debt and housing problems. Attendance

This would enable a whole range of community sentences to be properly supervised and enforced. Such centres would support women at risk of offending and others who had actually offended. They would link both categories with the existing services that they need.</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="08013156000368">The second proposal was for residential women&#146;s centres. These would provide for &#147;conditions of residence&#148;, curfews and tagging during non-custodial sentences. In addition, they would accommodate women remanded in custody or given short prison sentences. Once again, they would connect their residents directly to much needed services and training. Such residential centres would probably need to be semi-secure but should also have provision for small children to remain with their mothers.</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="08013156000369">Women&#146;s centres of the kind I have mentioned would allow for professional assessments of women in trouble. They would also allow women to do their own self-assessment in a place of safety with a modicum of support. Such self-assessment can be crucial when life seems to be going wrong. It is a first step to finding meaning and purpose and to discovering a person&#146;s hidden talents. In the centres, there would be much scope for reformed ex-offenders, whether as volunteers or staff members.</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="08013156000370">Finally, for really serious violent or dangerous convicted women, there should be small local custodial units holding perhaps 30 people each.

Of course, there will be implications for resources. These, however, should be seen in the context of the huge cost of conventional prisons, the current 64 per cent reoffending rate among women and in the light of the costs of childcare for mothers in prison, not to speak of the risk of prisoners&#146; children themselves taking to crime.</p>

Many of us who are here today participated in both these events. We are now in 2008 and we have someone else to thank. I refer to the noble Baroness, Lady Corston. Her report is very good, a model among such reports, and it is already seen as a standard text around the world.</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="08013156000375">First, it is a model because of its starting point. It starts by finding out what is the purpose of the service being analysed. Who is it for? The noble Baroness started her work by finding out about the women who are imprisoned. She also sought the views of those who are doing the imprisoning and she builds up her conclusions from them.</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="08013156000376">Secondly, she consulted widely and looked at all the research that has been done over many years. I am sure we are all very grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley, for speaking in the debate and for so ably summarising the research for us. Thirdly, the noble Baroness&#146;s report is imbued with a strong sense of justice and a very strong dislike of injustice. She accepts that efficiency and good administration are important, but in the Corston report justice is the bedrock. Would that others who produce reports for the Government bore in mind these three essential points. First, what is this service being provided for? Who are its recipients and does it serve them and society well? Secondly, what is already known about it? Thirdly, what are the ethical values that should underpin it?</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="08013156000377">It was through that process that the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, reached the conclusions that are common knowledge and widely accepted by all those who have studied this subject. These conclusions are, first, that imprisonment as an intervention in women&#146;s lives is often highly damaging; secondly, that the separation from their children that this often entails is, to use the noble Baroness&#146;s own word, &#147;catastrophic&#148;; thirdly, that most of these women are highly vulnerable and they should be getting the help they need, particularly for mental health and substance abuse in the places where they live; and, fourthly, that there should be more of the centres whose work is already proven that can help them. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, described very clearly a model of such a centre. Finally, when they have to go to prison, they should be held in small units near their homes.</p>

<a name="80131-0010.htm_para28">
<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="08013156000378">As the noble Baroness said, those conclusions are not new. They are what every report on the subject concludes. One has to ask the Government what the problem is with reforming the way we deal with women in prison. Or, if I may put it another way, why is it that when we want now local centres to which women can go to be helped, we get a &#147;cross-departmental unit&#148;? When we want now better access to local services, we get a &#147;ministerial subgroup&#148;. When we want as soon as possible small custodial units, we get a &#147;project to examine&#148;. When will another centre like the Asha Women&#146;s Centre in Worcester, so much praised by the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, open? Will it be this year or next year?

He and all the other speakers have brought great statistical insights to the debate and have helped us to understand how dreadful and compellingly awful the problem is. I had not intended to speak in the House this afternoon; it was not until I heard the excellent Julian Dee in the Cross-Benchers&#146; office regale us with some of the facts that my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham would use in his opening speech that I felt that I wanted to add my voice to those championing and campaigning voices that we have heard today.</p>

Between 5.5 per cent and 5.8 per cent of prisoners in the English prison system are women; the figure is 4.4 per cent in Scotland and 2.2 per cent in Ireland. I do not want to distract us in any way from the subject of the debate, which is unbelievably important and must be acted on. Nor do I want to diminish the significance of focusing entirely on the need for a women&#146;s justice board, to which I add my voice and my intention to give support. However, I will highlight just one sub-statistic. Behind the 5.5 per cent figure of women in prison, most of whom come from the majority population, is the fact that 21 per cent of women prisoners are black, even though black women make up just 1 per cent of the total population. About  13 per cent to 15 per cent, depending on the statistics that you read, of male prisoners are black, but 21 per cent of women prisoners are black.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="08013156000391">As everybody who has spoken has said, in particular the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, many of us have long advocated a women&#146;s justice board, as proposed in the Wedderburn report in 2000. Now the Wedderburn report has been supplanted by the Corston report of March last year. At the heart of this report, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said, lies the proposal for a commission for women who offend or are at risk of offending. My noble friend Lady Corston says,</p>
<ul><a name="08013156000575">&#147;there needs to be a strategic top level cross-departmental commission, headed by someone very senior&#151; director level&#148;&#151;</ul>

<ul><a name="08013156000577">&#147;been central in shaping and coordinating the complex web of agencies involved and has brought leadership, coherence and consistency to youth justice&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08013156000530">It is now time to do the same for women, by establishing a strategic commission with the power to make things happen&#151;I stress those words.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="08013156000392">My noble friend Lady Corston&#146;s formal recommendation about the commission begins:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"><a name="08013156000546">&#147;I recommend the immediate establishment of a Commission for women who offend or are at risk of offending, led at director level, with a remit of care and support for women who offend or are at risk of offending&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08013156000531">The Government&#146;s response of December 2007 accepts this recommendation in principle, and continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"><a name="08013156000547">&#147;The Government has agreed to the establishment of a new cross-departmental Criminal Justice Women&#146;s Unit headed by a senior civil servant&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08013156000532">I stress that last phrase. I applaud that the criminal justice women&#146;s unit is already being drawn together, as I am informed.

However, the Government have downgraded this to &#147;a senior civil servant&#148;. That could mean a grade 5 civil servant who simply would not have the clout or authority to make things happen, where a director-level civil servant would have.

<a name="80131-0011.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="08013156000395">I was put in mind of the Government&#146;s decision in 1998 to appoint Louise Casey as the tsar for homelessness. The Government set her a clear target: to reduce homelessness to one-third within three years. Louise Casey was absolutely ruthless: she knocked together the heads of all the organisations involved. I spent time in a winter hostel for homeless young people. Before her arrival, much was to be demanded and better was to be expected of it. A year after she had been in post, it had been transformed: the best professionals were looking after these vulnerable young people. The Government are much to be commended on this.</p>

<a name="80131-0011.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="08013156000396">It was clear in this case that a large amount of political capital was laid on the outcome of achieving this reduction in homelessness. Louise Casey is quite an exception as a civil servant because she is prepared to be so outspoken. I think that the Government have recognised her unique qualities by placing her at the head of the Anti-Social Behaviour Unit. That is one reflection on what has been said so far.</p>

<a name="80131-0011.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="08013156000397">My second reflection is on two related things: one is sentence inflation, to which my noble friend Lady Howe alluded. I remember being in your Lordships&#146; House as we debated increasing the tariff for adults who commit murder&#151;I hope I have that right. It was argued that by doing so one would ratchet up sentence lengths throughout the system&#151;I hope I have that right, too. The question then was: since we are raising the tariff for adults, should we not raise the tariff for children? The Government were very serious about increasing the length of sentences for children who kill. The psychiatrists and other experts working in this area told me that if this was done, all the good work that they do with children under 18 in special provision would be undone when they entered adult provision. We had to try to prevent this from happening. Fortunately, we were successful. Two things come from that; if there is a separate arrangement for women, there is at least a chance that they might be separated from any further ratcheting-up of sentencing for men. This is another example of what the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley, said; women are lumped together with men and treated as if they had the same issues, and it is just not right to do so.</p>

During my time in prison I was fortunate enough to be able to call my son every other night and write to him the days I didn&#146;t speak to him. His father brought him to visit me once a month but best of all we had children&#146;s visits in prison every school holidays. These allowed us to spend time together as mum and son, to talk, to play, to hug and just to be. These were so important to me but I could never express in words the extent of the importance of these days to my son Maxy. He would count down the days between these children&#146;s visits and would actually save up things to tell me and to talk about. These were Maxy&#146;s special time, his time to know and feel my love for him, his time to recharge his self esteem and security, his time to be my little boy.</p>

Today there are tens of thousands of children with a parent in jail hurting just as much as Maxy if not more so, there are likely to be even more children in this position tomorrow, many have no one to hear them and no one to love them, we need to help these children for they have done nothing wrong&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="08013156000402">We cannot take away the tragedy of the abusive and unloving childhoods that often precede addiction, chronic distress and inadequate personal relationships. We do not have any miracle cures for many of the mental health problems these women face, but we can at least try to stop making them worse. We can take seriously the notion that we need to innovate and find different ways of intervening, and then evaluate them properly. Perhaps I may describe a handful of problems that have been mentioned to me in the past few days. As we try to tackle them, we realise that we know far less than sometimes we pretend about the research into what works. The recommendations of the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, are very sensible and are based on the current evaluations of small and community units, but I want to stress that we need far more co-ordinated research into interventions.</p>

<a name="80131-0011.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="08013156000403">A huge amount of thinking and considerable investment by both the Department of Health and the Ministry of Justice, and before that the Home Office, have gone into initiatives to reduce harm. Yesterday I talked about some of these issues with my colleague at St George&#146;s University of London, Dr Annie Bartlett, the lead clinician on mental health at Holloway prison&#151;not perhaps the most typical prison; indeed, it is a rather unusual one&#151;where serious efforts have been made to try to address some of the most difficult issues. Among many of the overarching problems, she pointed out the difficulties of engaging these women in treatment programmes. It is no easy matter. For some women, the comfort zone of abusive relationships is as addictive as the drugs they have come to depend on. The drop-out rate on the outside from what start out as good counselling relationships inside prison is very high. It is a difficult problem. More investment in extra time and places in the community with increased numbers of staff are required to try to engage with and keep these women in treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="08013156000404">We know that half the women leaving prison have no GP and that GPs are reluctant to take women on after their release from prison, yet they desperately need that supportive primary care which is now available to quite a lot of women inside prison. Perhaps we have to coerce GPs to take them on with direct funding, as we so often do in other areas.</p>

But we must also remember how we approach seriously addicted drug misusers who at present often get an opportunity to detox in prison. We must think about what kind of appropriate residential treatment facilities are needed to help at that point. Creative thinking is required about needle exchange programmes, which have been successfully introduced in a number of women&#146;s prisons on the continent. I believe that Hindelbank prison in

We know, too, that we need a whole-prison approach for the prevention of suicide. That means the engagement of every single member of staff, not only those in the mental health units. Tinkering around the edges and trying to establish therapeutic regimes in an alienating punitive environment is unlikely to make much headway.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and I are uncertain about this. He would like to see the Mental Health Act recommendations implemented in prisons; I am ambivalent about that. Far better, it seems to me, would be to get them out into proper units where they can be treated in a therapeutic regime. A custodial environment cannot be right for someone with a psychosis. That is what forensic units are for. They must accept not only Crown Court cases but women who have a psychosis, however it was determined that they should receive treatment.</p>

The answer is quite simple but it will not be welcomed by the Minister. In my book, there is a distinct lack of will within government to address this issue, and that is why we are having the two debates. Let me spell it out: the evidence is in the chronology of that excellent Library note to which the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has already paid tribute. It bears repeating, so I shall repeat it. Wedderburn came out in 2000 and various Ministers and senior judges gave their endorsement,

There were consultations but they led nowhere. The increasing numbers of women in prison&#151;and the increasing numbers of women dying in prison&#151;then brought the issue to the forefront. That is the way it happened.</p>

<a name="80131-0011.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="08013156000412">The result was that the Corston review was commissioned in 2006, was asked to report by the end of that year and did so in early 2007; the Government&#146;s response, as many noble Lord&#146;s have commented, came out nine months after the report was published. Now, nearly a year after the Corston report, we will have a debate next week&#151;instigated, I understand, by the noble Baroness herself and not as part of the Government&#146;s priorities for action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="08013156000413">After 10 years of power, after eight years of obfuscation on the calls for a women&#146;s justice board, after 19 months spent before we have a debate on the proposals that are on the table now, one does not have to be a genius to work out that there is little will here to do something about one of the most vulnerable groups in society&#151;women in prison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="08013156000414">As we have a debate on the Corston report next week, I shall save my detailed observations until then and concentrate here on some broad-brush reasons for why we must move forward to a separate, stand-alone body to deal with women in the criminal justice system. We have heard compelling accounts from some of the most eminent experts in the country today&#151;most of them in this Chamber&#151;about why this step is necessary. The facts speak for themselves but are wholly counterintuitive; for example, more women are incarcerated in penal institutions than men, yet considerably fewer commit crimes. We are frequently told that crime is going down but, at the same time, that we need more prisons for more people to be locked up. We are told that the rights of the child are paramount&#151;as the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, just said&#151;yet we see 18,000 of them separated from their mothers who are sent to prison, many to be made homeless as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="08013156000415">It is as if that simple strand of logic, cause and effect, is completely suspended in this area of government policy. It is as if the recognition that women have separate, specific personal and environmental factors that bring them into the criminal justice system&#151;it runs through the Corston report&#151;did not exist. It is often the case that they have drawn the short straw in life. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, drew our attention to the severity of sentences for foreign women. It is a mixture of gullibility and poverty that makes them become criminals. Locking them up far from home cannot be the answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="08013156000416">The noble Lord, Lord Hastings, told us about the levels of prejudice that result in the large numbers of ethnic minority women prisoners. A further problem faced by some ethnic minority women&#151;those from Asian communities&#151;is that within those cultures there is real stigma attached to imprisonment, hence the almost inevitable break-up of family as they are spurned by those nearest and dearest to them on release.</p>

For me, the argument of principle that gender equality and mainstreaming are the answer is profoundly wrong. It is rare for me to call for special treatment for women as I am a champion of equality, and I wish there were no need to do so. I wish we had a situation where equality of respect, as identified by the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, was sufficient, but it is not.</p>

<a name="80131-0012.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="08013156000418">Women need different treatment because of who they are. The profile is substantively different in terms of their offences, their personal circumstances and the effects on them of incarceration. They may be broadly similar to male prisoners in socio-economic terms, their education or even their drug dependence and alcoholism, but broad similarities of that nature do not address the profound emotional, psychological and physiological differences that affect the outcome of a mainstreaming regime. Hence the need for different approaches, all the way from risk of offending, through court systems, to probation and resettlement.</p>

<a name="80131-0012.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="08013156000419">The noble Baroness, Lady Corston, appears to believe that these substantive differences call for a different approach. So far, so good. The problem arises not with her diagnosis, which is insightful, but with the therapy advocated. The logic of leaving the strategic direction in the control of politicians through myriad interdepartmental committees and sub-committees is flawed. No strategic change can be delivered by the same people in the same position but now sitting in different rooms and on different chairs. That is not to say that there is a flaw in having interdepartmental oversight and direction per se; an interdepartmental committee formed to work through the practical implementation of change, which is needed through different government departments, makes complete sense, and an action plan is entirely welcome. It cannot, however, substitute for a properly resourced, independent body that reports annually and comprises independent people rather than political representatives of the day. The flaws of that have been highlighted so adequately by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. I say that in the particular recognition that criminal justice is not a popular cause; it does not affect large numbers of the population in any positive way, and delivers few bouquets to those who work in it. This area is, therefore, most susceptible to Treasury belt-tightening, to departmental atrophy and to reactive rather than proactive policy.</p>

<a name="80131-0012.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="08013156000420">The Minister is, no doubt, going to tell us that setting up a separate women&#146;s justice board would entail significant time and effort, and that the system advocated by the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, provides a more suitable alternative. I am sure that we will hear that that alternative will be easily implemented, and be able to get to grips with the matter almost immediately. That may well be true, which is why we welcome the establishment of an interdepartmental committee. That committee will give political direction to an area badly in need of new policy solutions, many of which, as we have heard throughout our debate, have indeed been on the table for a long time. Yet it will not substitute for the stand-alone, independent voice that a women&#146;s justice board would provide; that is the best long-term solution to a problem that will be with us for a long time, if experience is anything to go by.</p>

He has come on to this debate on prison matters, which has also produced some of the House&#146;s best experts, and next week alone he has two days in Committee on the criminal justice Bill, as well as a repeat of this debate next Thursday, when we come to debate the report of the noble Baroness, Lady Corston. That debate will follow a fairly similar line to this one, although we shall no doubt see the noble Baroness herself there, since it is her debate.</p>

<a name="80131-0012.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="08013156000422">Secondly, I offer my congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, on bringing in this debate, initially because of its timely nature, being only the day after the launch of the annual report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons. I trust that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, will also welcome a debate on that report in due course&#151;he nods sagely at that suggestion. In touching on that, what response will his Secretary of State, the Lord Chancellor, be making to that report and when? Will we have to wait another six months?</p>

<a name="80131-0012.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="08013156000423">This debate is also timely because it comes so soon after the delayed government response, which came in December, to the report by the noble Baroness, Lady Corston. I have already touched on the second point on which I wanted to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, which was the very quality of those that he has attracted to speak in this debate. It is welcome, for those of us who are relatively new to penal matters, to have quite such expertise in your Lordships&#146; House, and he has brought that before us. </p>

<a name="80131-0012.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="08013156000424">I also congratulate the noble Lord on his persistence&#151;or tenacity, as my noble friend Lady Bottomley put it&#151;in taking on this matter and in continuing to do so. He went through the history of it, some of it dating back before 1997, but I think that his first suggestion of a women&#146;s justice board came some time later, in 1998 or 1999. That takes me on to the Government&#146;s position. Like the noble Lord, I congratulate the Library on its excellent briefing Note, by Chris Clarke, for this debate. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, I think that it is worth repeating where the Government have, or have not been, over the years in this matter. Reference was made to the Minister&#146;s noble friend, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, and to statements that he made at an earlier stage. We all know that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, is a free spirit in his responses if ever there were one. We remember what he said back in 2004, when he was a Minister in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Referring to these matters, he said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08013156000534">Well, some pudding. Perhaps the Minister can let us know a bit more about the development of that pudding in due course when he responds. Two years later, another Home Office Minister&#151;she was in the

</ul>
<p><a name="08013156000535">We then had the Corston report and the Government&#146;s response to it. As has been made clear, the Government have responded relatively positively in a number of ways, although they have left out some of the more crucial aspects, to which I shall come when I deal with the few questions that I want to put to the Minister. If I cannot get through them all, I have no doubt that I can repeat some of them in a week&#146;s time when we have the same debate again, and when the Minister will, I presume, have a little more time to respond to all those who have spoken.</p>

<a name="80131-0012.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="08013156000425">I was grateful to my noble friend Lady Bottomley not only for stressing the importance of the debate but for offering to relay it to my colleague, Nick Herbert, the shadow Secretary of State for Justice. I also will make sure that he is fully aware of it, and of the Government&#146;s response to it and to the debate next week. I have no doubt that he will take note of it in the review of prisons and sentencing that he is conducting within our shadow team.</p>

<a name="80131-0012.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="08013156000426">I turn to the questions. As has been made clear to the Minister, there has been a large increase&#151;some have estimated it to be threefold&#151;in the number of women imprisoned during the past 10 years. Women now represent a significant minority inside our jails. What factors do the Government think have contributed to this large increase? Does the rise not demonstrate that a distinct, women-centred approach might be necessary given the obvious and peculiar vulnerabilities of women in prison? The Minister can respond to those questions either today or next week, when we deal with the recommendations of the Corston report which his department has accepted.</p>

<a name="80131-0012.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="08013156000427">My second question relates to Titan prisons and women prisoners, and follows on from the questions of my noble friend Lady Bottomley. It has been reported that, in 2004, around half of all women in prison were held more than 50 miles from their home town, and a quarter of them were held more than  100 miles away. Does the Minister concur with the Corston report&#146;s recommendation&#151;to which the Government were strangely silent in their response&#151;that female offenders be housed in small, local jails connected to their communities and families, where they would have a better chance of turning their lives around? What plan do the Government have to implement that strategy now that they are talking about introducing the three, huge, 2,500-inmate so-called Titan prisons? Where are we in relation to the Titan prisons, given the comments made by the Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellor only yesterday or the day before? All of us would like to know. Initially, the Government responded very rapidly to the Carter recommendations for Titan prisons. However, they seem to be&#151;dare I say it?&#151;watering themselves down by the minute.</p>

If the Government implement the Corston recommendation that community-based punishment for non-violent offenders should be the norm, how do they intend that magistrates will deal with persistent petty offenders? Why is it that despite the Government having been in power for 10 years, community sentences are still so ineffective that very often magistrates have no alternative but to imprison very persistent female offenders? Again, is this not a matter of lack of resources provided by the Government?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="08013156000435">What has come through in this debate, as I am sure it will next week, is something of the vulnerabilities which characterise many women offenders. We have heard about mental health problems, histories of violent or sexual abuse, drug misuse and anxieties about the care of children. I am acutely aware of the tragic consequences if those vulnerabilities are not properly addressed, not only for those women who self-harm or take their own lives but also for their children. The overall philosophy of the Government is that prison should be reserved for serious and violent offenders. This is particularly true for women. The overall thrust of our response to the Corston report is to improve community provision to make it more appropriate for women and to deal with problems earlier before these women end up in prison. There is no distance whatever between the Government and other noble Lords in this.</p>

My experience in the months that I have held this position is that there are many examples where community sentencing can work very effectively. We just have to build on that.</p>

I want to make that clear to noble Lords. It is much more about pulling the services together and giving the kind of integrated provision that noble Lords want. If there is an opportunity to debate the question of NOMS, I will be very happy to do so. I pay tribute to Phil Wheatley for his work with which I have been very impressed. I also acknowledge the very kind remarks of my noble friend Lord Acton about staff. He mentioned working in Holloway but also in other parts of the Prison Service. I know that we all have concerns about issues such as quality of service and the availability of particular provision, but there has been a vast improvement over the years in the contribution that staff have been able to make. We must acknowledge this whenever we can.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Henley, asked me about the distance from home of women prisoners. He is right to acknowledge that this is a major concern. I have data showing that the average distance from home of female prisoners is 58 miles. Obviously, that has a considerable impact on prisoners and their families. That is the very reason why my noble friend Lady Corston made her proposals in relation to the women&#146;s custodial estate, particularly the question of small local custodial units.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="08013156000439">The Government have set up a project to consider this because inevitably there are considerable challenges in establishing those units. My noble friend is recommending a really significant change in the way that the women&#146;s custodial estate should be organised. She suggests that it should be implemented over the next 10 years, so we have to see how this can be done and look at the resource implications, but we are taking it forward. I believe that we are doing that in a way that is consistent with the reports of the noble Lord, Lord Carter. Of course I have read with interest the comments of the chief inspector. We gave our initial response yesterday, but we will respond further in due course, although I cannot give the noble Lord the date&#151;he would not expect me to, but he always asks me these things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="08013156000440">I realise that the concept of Titan prisons has perhaps not gone down well with Members of your Lordships&#146; House. It feels like we are debating the Mental Health Act again; one feels rather lonely here. But, as I explained, the development of Titan prisons offers some considerable advantages in being able to develop quickly in areas where there is a population shortage. We see that as building on the success of clustering small prisons together; for example, at the Isle of Sheppey. I have said previously that it is perfectly possible to have smaller units within a campus with the advantage of efficient use of resources and design to get the best of both worlds. I fear another debate on Titans coming one Thursday. We are committed to the Titan project. We will be developing our plans. We hope that we can do it speedily, but that has to be seen in parallel with the review we will undertake in relation to small local custodial units for women prisoners.</p>

Those were valid points. Like me, she will probably look at the research budget of the NHS and compare it with research in other parts. It would be very good to get access to more research funds.

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="08013156000443">I ought to address the question that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, raised on the organisation of government to ensure that the recommendations that we have accepted are put into practice. I have no doubt whatever that we have to produce a set of arrangements to make sure that action takes place. I assure noble Lords that although we may disagree on whether we have a women&#146;s justice board or not, the need for action is not in doubt. Since I have long experience of restructuring in another part of the public sector, it is not a question of structures that counts here, it is a question of will and determination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="08013156000444">My noble friend Lady Corston did not recommend the creation of a women&#146;s justice board&#151;she said it was neither necessary nor desirable. Noble Lords will know that the Government have previously argued against the need for a women&#146;s justice board. That remains our position, based on the fact that there is no separate framework in law for women, as there is for young offenders. I was very interested in the comment of the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, on the question of gender equality. I understand what she said, but I am not sure that the Government can go along with her. We believe that the gender equality duty of April 2007 does not allow for any system to be established that would create inequalities in the treatment of men and women. We believe that the creation of a separate sentencing system, with different responses for women who have committed similar offences to men, could not be justified under the gender equality duty. But we do know, as the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, has identified, that inequalities exist because the criminal justice system is designed primarily for men. This point was made very well by the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley. The gender equality duty should be used to redress that imbalance. This will be done partly through governance arrangements but also by the publication of a gender equality plan, backed up by a performance-management structure.</p>

I know that cross-government working sometimes produces frustrating cross-departmental meetings and there is some doubt about what it delivers. I understand those concerns, but it can be made to work and anyone who knows my honourable friend Maria Eagle will know that she is an extremely good and determined person who will make it work. The point about having different government departments involved is that nothing will work effectively unless the relevant government departments are all committed. I think that ministerial leadership here is an essential ingredient of success. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, disagrees,

I hope that that meets another point that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has often raised with me&#151;it is important to get the right balance between the local autonomy of those running the various services and the national policy and national framework. The noble Lord will recognise that national service frameworks are well known to us in the health sector. They have been extremely useful in getting a very clear picture of what services should be provided locally and in allowing people at the local level a certain degree of autonomy in putting them into practice. I think that that combination, alongside ministerial leadership and a committed group of officials, will lead to implementation of the Corston report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="08013156000455">In analysing what has been said, probably five general themes have come out of the debate. First, there is a general welcome for the excellence of the content of the report of the noble Baroness, Lady Corston. Secondly, there is a feeling of frustration that this is not a new issue but something that has been raised over and over again by different people, and the frustration is that it is still having to be raised. Thirdly, I detect a universal desire that something must happen to change the situation but, fourthly, a slight feeling of despair that, yet again, it has been suggested that the Minister in charge and the groups of civil servants&#151;we have already had Ministers in charge and groups of civil servants&#151;will deliver.

<a name="80131-0013.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="08013156000456">I conclude by mentioning a precedent to the Minister. In 1994, there were escapes from the high-security Whitemoor and Parkhurst prisons. The then Home Secretary employed two outsiders, Sir John Woodcock, a former Chief Inspector of Constabulary, and Sir John Learmont, who was a general, to write a report. They recommended that the situation that existed in the high-security prisons&#151;it was the same sort of situation that we have been debating&#151;could be solved with the appointment of a director responsible and accountable for what went on in those prisons. The Home Secretary accepted the recommendation and the director was appointed, and there is absolutely no doubt that there is a coherence and a consistency in the high-security prisons that exists in no other part of the system. It is interesting to note what developed in that system as a result of that appointment. I merely point that out because I think it is a precedent for what we are all seeking for this very vulnerable group which concerns us all.</p>

<a name="80131-0013.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="08013156000460">The noble Lord said: My Lords, we are here today to debate three sets of regulations to be made under the Companies Act 2006&#151;the Small Companies and Groups (Accounts and Directors&#146; Report) Regulations 2008, the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, and the Companies Act 2006 (Amendment) (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.</p>

<a name="80131-0013.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="08013156000461">I begin by setting these draft regulations in some sort of context. The Companies Act 2006&#151;which a number of noble Lords will remember with affection&#151;will help business reap the rewards of simpler, clearer and more cost-effective legislation in more modern language. It is a major part of the Government&#146;s better regulation simplification plan and will reduce annual administrative burdens on business by over &#163;300 million. It has been necessary to put back final implementation of the Act from October 2008 to October 2009. Needless to say, the Government regret that this has been necessary, but I am certain we took the right decision in the light of the advice from the Registrar of Companies that he could not be absolutely confident that the necessary changes to Companies House systems and processes could be made in time.</p>

<a name="80131-0013.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="08013156000462">Businesses need to be able to plan ahead with certainty. We have learnt the lessons from other major IT projects, both within and outside government, that delays in decisions can greatly increase costs and inconvenience for users. It is also important to emphasise that many of the key provisions of the Companies Act 2006 will be commenced in line with the timetable announced in February last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="08013156000463">A large number of important provisions, including most of the statutory statement of the director-general&#146;s duties and the enhanced business review, were commenced in October 2007. Another important tranche, including the accounting reporting provisions, will be commenced with effect from 6 April 2008. I am also pleased that it will still be possible to commence some provisions, of particular importance to business, in October 2008, including the new solvency statement route for capital reduction by private companies. Part 15 of the 2006 Act concerns company accounts and reports. It will come into force on 6 April this year, applying to financial years beginning on or after that date. Part 15 confers powers on the Secretary of State to make regulations as to the detailed form and content of the accounts and reports of companies.</p>

These schedules to the 1985 Act and the 1986 order set out

They cover specific types of disclosures or apply to certain categories of companies. Not all schedules apply to all companies.</p>

<a name="80131-0013.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="08013156000465">There is a logic in separating out the requirements in this way, so that each schedule deals with a different subject. Companies have got used to it over the years, but there is no denying it can be confusing, particularly for a small company. To work out what its accounts must contain, a small company must look at a minimum of four accounting schedules to the 1985 Act and possibly six. It will not to have to make all the disclosures required by some of those schedules, so it will need to look at the relevant section of the 1985 Act to work out which parts of those schedules are relevant to it.</p>

<a name="80131-0013.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="08013156000466">When it came to restating the detailed requirements on the format and content of accounts and reports under the 2006 Act, we wanted to make things easier for all companies but particularly for small companies. Therefore, we have taken a different approach. We have proposed a single set of regulations for small companies. This gathers together in a single document all the requirements from the six accounting schedules to the 1985 Act that are applicable to small companies. This approach means that small companies will have to look in only one place to establish what they are required to include in their account and reports. They will not have to look through regulations that also apply to large companies and work out which parts apply to them and which parts do not. We believe that this approach has clear benefits for small companies. Indeed, stakeholders agreed; when we consulted, all those who commented supported the proposal.</p>

<a name="80131-0013.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="08013156000467">We followed the same approach for all other companies, with a single set of regulations applying to large and medium-sized companies. This sets out the basic requirements applying to all companies other than small ones. It also contains the exemptions for medium-sized companies and the additional requirements for quoted companies, banking and insurance companies and group accounts. This approach has less obvious benefits for large and medium-sized companies and we considered other approaches, such as replicating the existing structure of the accounting schedules or making a separate set of regulations for each category of company. However, we believe that, in the long run, a single set of regulations with all the requirements in a single place will be easier for companies to use. When we consulted, the majority of those who commented supported this approach. Among those who did not, there was no consensus on a preferred option.</p>

<a name="80131-0013.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="08013156000468">These two sets of regulations largely restate the requirements in the accounting schedules to the 1985 Act and the 1986 Northern Ireland order without changing the substance of those requirements. However, the regulations make a small number of substantive changes to the accounting requirements.

<a name="80131-0013.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="08013156000469">For all companies that prepare consolidated accounts, a few minor technical amendments have been made to address the potential for differences in the context of UK accounting standards being converged with international financial reporting standards by increasing flexibility. For medium-sized companies preparing abbreviated accounts for filing at Companies House, the exemption from disclosing turnover in the abbreviated profit and loss account that they file with the Registrar of Companies has been removed. However, there is still exemption from disclosing detailed particulars of turnover in the notes to such accounts. For quoted companies, there is a new requirement to report in their directors&#146; remuneration report on how they have taken pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the group into account when setting directors&#146; pay. This requirement will be applicable to reports for financial years beginning on or after 6 April 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="08013156000470">These two sets of regulations also have a function beyond restating the accounting schedules to the  1985 Act. Together with the third set of regulations that we are debating&#151;the Companies Act 2006 (Amendment) (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008&#151;they implement European directive 2006/46/EC, which amends the European accounting directives. The measures in this directive are intended to contribute to EU market confidence, encourage cross-border investment and facilitate cross-border access to capital. It is important to get the right balance between ensuring that proper disclosures are made and not imposing undue burdens on business. We believe that we have done this.</p>

<a name="80131-0013.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="08013156000471">To that end, these two sets of regulations give all companies&#151;small, medium and large&#151;the option of including a wider category of financial instruments in their accounts at fair value than is permitted under the 1985 Act. They also impose a new requirement on large companies to make certain disclosures about transactions with related parties; small and medium-sized companies are exempt from this disclosure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="08013156000472">The Companies Act 2006 (Amendment) (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 contain further implementing measures for the directive. They increase the thresholds defining small and medium-sized companies for accounting and reporting purposes and the audit exemption threshold for small companies. They also impose a new requirement for companies to make certain disclosures about off-balance-sheet arrangements in the notes to their accounts. Small companies are exempted from this requirement and medium-sized companies may limit disclosure to information about the nature and business purpose of such arrangements. Finally, this set of regulations makes a number of technical improvements and corrections to Part 15 of the 2006 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="08013156000477">Let me start with some support for some aspects of the regulations. When dealing with the Companies Act 2006, the Government undertook to think small.

I can remember when the small company thresholds were first raised eight or nine years ago. There were predictions that great harm would ensue in various ways but, as far as I am aware, no harm has ever ensued. So it is entirely right that we should continue to increase the thresholds. The Government estimate that this will produce an annual benefit of around &#163;37 million, largely through reduced audit fees, as more companies fall below the threshold for obligatory audit. I was never convinced that the earlier changes produced much in the way of cost savings to companies, and I am not much convinced by these figures. The Government assume that fees called &#147;audit&#148; will not be incurred as accountancy or other fees. However, I shall not object to the regulations on the basis that the department has over-egged the savings figure because I do not see audit as a value-adding activity for the majority of small companies below the threshold.</p>

But it is clear that the volume of new material has overwhelmed bodies which are usually expected to contribute at a high level on such drafts and consultations. If the anoraks cannot cope, there is certainly no hope for mere parliamentarians.</p>

<a name="80131-0013.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="08013156000480">More seriously, the overwhelming volume raises the issue of unintended consequences. I am sure that the Minister is aware of some of the gremlins that are starting to emerge from the Companies Act where the sheer scale of the Act meant that his officials and outside commentators were stretched and missed things. I believe that the Minister said that one set of regulations contains some corrections to the Companies Act 2006. Issues have arisen outside the accounts parts of the Companies Act 1996. They are not large in number so far, as I understand it. Where they have arisen, however, some have caused genuine problems, so it is quite possible that these orders will have missed something or got something wrong. My purpose in raising this is not to berate the Minister or his officials, but to ask him to confirm that, if issues arise when they are actually translated into practice, the Government stand ready to make further orders if necessary.</p>

<a name="80131-0013.htm_para28">
<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="08013156000481">The Institute of Chartered Accountants has also raised with me the issue of gold-plating. This is not a new point for these regulations, but perpetuates the fact that the existing accounting regulations go beyond those required by EU law. It is often far from clear that, if there ever was a justification for the gold-plating, there continues to be one. The institute would like to see a commitment from BERR to review the accounting requirements of the Act and the regulations, to identify and hopefully eliminate any excessive requirements. I assure the Minister that these Benches would give any order reducing gold-plating the warmest of welcomes.</p>

<a name="80131-0013.htm_para29">
<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="08013156000482">The Government&#146;s response to the consultation on the corporate governance directive was published in July last year. In that document, the Government noted that they would be having discussions with the standard setters to agree what action needs to be taken in respect of UK accounting standards or the changes implemented in these orders for related party disclosures and off-balance-sheet transactions. Will the Minister now say whether any actions are required on UK standards? Will they require additional disclosures? Does that have implications for the relationship between UK accounting standards and international ones? I am sure that the Minister will agree that it would be undesirable for this order to open up new gaps between UK accounting standards and international reporting standards.</p>

<a name="80131-0013.htm_para30">
<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="08013156000483">Lastly, I shall come to the one aspect of these orders that is unnecessary. As the Minister said in his introductory remarks, in the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations, the Government have introduced an additional requirement for the remuneration report of listed companies to say how they have taken pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the group into account when setting directors&#146; pay. This issue was raised during in Committee during the passage of the Companies Bill in 2006. The noble Lord, Lord Lea of

The Government wisely resisted that and the other suggestion that they get further involved in remuneration disclosures&#151;for example, on the ratios between directors&#146; pay and that of the rest of the workforce. We supported them on that in Committee.</p>

<a name="80131-0013.htm_para31">
<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="08013156000484">The new requirement in this order will add nothing to UK plc. It will add nothing of value to shareholders. It might satisfy the anti-corporate pay lobby which exists on the Government's Back Benches. I am afraid that it bears all the hallmarks of a concession made to the Labour Party's paymasters, the trade unions.</p>

<a name="80131-0014.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="08013156000485">In fact, the particular issue is not of huge importance. Remuneration committees will devise some boilerplate wording to satisfy the new requirement. My concern is with the principle that the Government are legislating for some half-baked political reason rather than something which will help to create shareholder value. Whatever the new reporting requirement, the task of remuneration committees will still be to set pay for directors in a way that reflects market conditions for them and, more importantly, incentivises them to deliver profits and shareholder value. Of course remuneration committees keep an eye on the prevailing rates of increase for the workforce overall, but directors&#146; pay is driven primarily by the items that are not basic pay&#151;bonuses, LTIPs, STIFs and so on&#151;which are, in turn, dependent on business success. Anything that interferes in the hugely difficult process of creating an executive pay system which is based on rewarding success is at best a distraction. I end my remarks on this order on the unhappy note that the Government have, in this one respect, let themselves down.</p>

Interestingly, he reminded us about the lifting of thresholds and that the thresholds in the Companies Act 2006 are now lifted, and lifted quite seriously, in 2008. Yet he also referred to the thresholds for listing donations, whether political or charitable, and said that they were being lifted after 28 years. This gives one the opportunity to say that the Government are looking at thresholds in terms of regulatory reform and considering whether it should be someone&#146;s job to look out across the field of government and decide whether they should be lifted. I was concerned, and still am concerned, about the threshold in the intestacy regulations, which has not been lifted for years. I asked a question in this House about this, and a committee has looked at it, but nothing has happened. Thresholds are important, and they should be part of regulatory reform.</p>

This means what it says; if it is not there, you cannot see it. It comes down to this: is the company exposed to something that is not being made clear? Does everyone who has to prepare accounts and put notes on them see these things in a similar way? That is the institute&#146;s problem, and I think it is saying, &#147;Help!&#148;, because it wants a level playing field for the reader of accounts.</p>

<a name="80131-0014.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="08013156000488">My third point is that, as the Minister indicated, the documentation helpfully sets out in one place what has to be disclosed in accounts. Does he believe that it is the department&#146;s job to set out a pro forma, or several pro formas or templates, of how this work should be done? That would be very helpful, but the Minister may say, &#147;We&#146;ll leave that to commercial sources&#148;. If it is clear how accounts should be produced in accordance with the Act, it seems reasonable that a pro forma or template is produced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="08013156000489">I happened to spot in both sets of accounting regulations that if there were such a pro forma&#151;or indeed if we look at the required formats&#151;Regulation 7 for the small companies and Regulation 9 for the large companies state that you must not have a heading or sub-heading if there are no numbers on either side. You can have the heading if you had it the previous year, but otherwise you do not have a heading. I wonder how sinful it would be if, for example, you said in your accounts, &#147;Land and buildings, nil; last year, nil; plant machinery, nil; last year, nil&#148;. That does not seem too sinful. Indeed, it might be helpful because people think, &#147;I am amazed that that company does not have any plant or any land and buildings&#148;. I am surprised that it says that a company must not have a heading or sub-heading in those circumstances. It struck me as rather strange that that is so prescriptive.</p>

It must have been very great for them, but they managed to resist and for that they deserve some congratulation. But I am more grateful for the general support given across the House to these regulations, particularly for the way in which the regulations are now set out under the new Act and for the raising of thresholds. I know that both noble Lords will be looking carefully to see how this works out in practice. Indeed, the noble Baroness asked whether, if in practice things do not work out as we hope they will, we will come back and make sure that they do. The answer is of course yes, although that will be subject to time and legislative ability. Everyone is in the business of trying to make these detailed and complex matters work for businesses and, I stress again, particularly for small concerns.</p>

Recital (9) of the directive provides useful examples such as the creation or use of special purpose entities and securitisation. The department intends to publish guidance on its website drawing attention to recital (9), and the Accounting Standards Board is keeping the relevant accounting standards under review. We think that this less prescriptive approach gives companies some more flexibility and therefore decreases the burden on them, and they can consider what is most appropriate for their circumstances.</p>

<a name="80131-0014.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="08013156000492">The noble Baroness was also concerned about accounting standards in relation to balance sheets, both UK and international standards. The standards are likely to have to keep changing in order to deal with off-balance-sheet arrangements, because those arrangements keep changing as the regulations change. We feel that it is best if the law remains at a principles-based level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"><a name="08013156000493">We understand what the noble Baroness is saying about gold-plating. The 2006 Act as a whole introduced a range of deregulatory measures that have been widely welcomed by business. Annual administrative burdens on business will be reduced by over &#163;300 million. It is a huge task to implement the Act and the secondary legislation under it, and we have to get it right. In the mid-1990s the then Government carried out an extensive review of statutory accounting requirements and a number of changes were made to simplify them where the UK had gone beyond what was required by EU accounting directives. The European Commission is currently working on proposals to simplify company law requirements, in particular the accounting requirements for small and medium-sized businesses. As a country we have been actively involved with the Commission on the work it is doing. When the EU proposals have been finalised and the Government come to implement the changes, there will be an opportunity for us to look at the few remaining areas where the accounting requirements could be more closely aligned with the EU accounting directives. We think it makes more sense to look at accounting simplification as a package rather than take a piecemeal approach, and we hope very much that all interested parties will help in this by bringing forward suggestions.</p>

We are giving them the opportunity to look at how they do that over the next year so that they are ready to report on it when the requirement is implemented for financial years beginning on or after 6 April 2009.

I hope that he and business will be pleased by what I am about to say. In general, figures that are zero will not be reported. This generally does not cause any problems at all. Companies House already allows electronic filing on a template for dormant company accounts and small company abbreviated accounts, so I do not think this is likely to be a large issue, if one at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="08013156000497">The noble Lord referred to thresholds and said that someone should look at them across the board. We appreciate his concern. Thresholds arise from different places so it is difficult to take a common approach to them. Company law thresholds are determined by EU directives, as are these rises in the thresholds. The consequence, of course, will be that more companies fall into the small company bracket. That must be a good thing because it means that they will have less regulation to fulfil and should aid them in being successful companies.</p>

He has an enormous set of advisers behind him, but he is looking lonely over there. I am glad to say that I am not lonely as my noble friend Lady Verma, who sometimes keeps me on the straight and narrow, is beside me.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08013172000011">Amendment No. 26 is investigatory. It seems to me that the legal framework for CMEC, as set out in Clause 2, imposes an express bias on the objectives of the commission towards encouraging the private ordering of maintenance as opposed to the use of the statutory scheme. I am sure that the Minister will say straightaway that that is not intended and that it does not do that at all. He will have to work quite hard to persuade me. I have tabled Amendments Nos. 26 and 32 to suggest a redress of the bias and to reinstate the statutory route as a viable option.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08013172000012">These two amendments are attempts to make CMEC and its statutory scheme more accessible and to convince parents that the CMEC route is the most efficient and effective route to negotiate and to realise child maintenance arrangements. I use them to ask the noble Lord whether this bias will work in the interests of parents with care and their children. Surely the statutory system should be available and accessible as a measure to protect vulnerable parents with care from being forced into unequal bargaining positions when negotiating voluntary arrangements. The statutory system, therefore, should never be tarred as being inferior or somehow substandard in comparison with private ordering.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08013172000013">To encourage that, CMEC needs a friendly human face&#151;much more friendly than that which was exhibited, certainly towards the end, by the CSA. Arguably, I suppose, it never had a friendly face, or was never seen to have had one, by the parents we are talking about. Without such encouragement, there is a danger that the parent will not claim child maintenance at all or will feel obliged to settle for unsatisfactory, low amounts.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000014">I am pleased to say that this amendment was prompted by the lobby group, Gingerbread. As I suspect that the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, comes from the same source, it is hardly surprising that it chimes in with my own. His amendment is perhaps slightly different. Although much of the Bill is committed to promoting the voluntary side of CMEC which orchestrates mediation and negotiation between the two parents, his amendment seems to enforce the superiority of the statutory scheme. Parents must have faith that, in either system, there will be an adequate resolution and that children, therefore, will be protected either way. I beg to move.</p>

Clause 2 is the core and kernel of the Bill. It enshrines the objectives of the commission and therefore, if we get that wrong, the commission will have less chance in succeeding in producing the policy outcomes to which we aspire. We have four important groups of amendments on that. There was one in our last Committee day on debt, here we are looking at voluntary agreements, and we will go on to discuss child poverty and definitions of key terms in Amendments Nos. 31 and 37. This is part of what I consider to be an important probing of what is in the Government&#146;s mind on the setting of objectives for the commission.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08013172000016">I concur with everything that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said on Amendment No. 26, but this is also an opportunity to allow us to test the claims that are in the regulatory impact assessment. In particular, I would like further information, if there is any extant, on the estimated rise of 40 per cent in the number of parents making voluntary arrangements. It is anticipated to rise from 500,000 to 700,000. That is a key part of the business plan. I guess the Minister will cleave to the view that the business plan is for the commission, but it is important and significant, and we need to get some confirmation that the figures that have been there for some time are still robust. In particular, is it the currently held view in the department that there will be a saving in administrative costs of something like &#163;200 million? That is an important part that lies behind the amendment moved so ably by the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08013172000017">The noble Lord is right to stress that poorer parents are those who will have to struggle most to come to a satisfactory voluntary agreement, if anyone does at all. Yet, that is the group that will pose the most difficultly to the statutory administration and that is where the cost of collection of the maintenance is disproportionate to the amount that it wins back by way of the amount recovered. Therefore, there is a predisposition to think that there is other, lower-hanging fruit that the commission could access more easily, thereby meeting targets faster, and there is obviously, rightly, a temptation to strive to do that.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000018">If CMEC and the commission are doing what we hope they will, the Section 6 client group&#151;the people who will be invited to contemplate voluntary arrangements for the first time&#151;are almost certainly going to be better off if CMEC is working properly. It will act as an intermediary, and it will have a firm hand, especially

Often relationships stabilise after a breakdown and then, after some months, if not years, the relationship turns hostile again and the two parents have to do some reconciliation of their respective financial positions. It is not just once and for all; we could be contemplating a pretty continuous process.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08013172000019">I have looked at the Bill&#146;s wording carefully, upside, downside and sideways, and it demonstrates what I consider to be a deliberate bias in the duty to encourage appropriate voluntary arrangements. That is obviously part of the Government&#146;s policy, but no such equivalent duty exists to encourage statutory arrangements. I cannot understand what it will cost the Minister to resist this kind of amendment, if he is going to do so. If he were disposed to accept the amendment, he could have the satisfaction that it would deal with the power imbalance in the relationship, which we all understand is likely to be the case in these circumstances. He will understand too that parents with care will very often settle for less than what they are due, because they will do anything for a quiet life. There may be violence at the end of any continued and sustained objection against a potentially violent non-resident parent.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08013172000020">The Child Support Agency is in any case a pretty unpopular organisation, so staying out of its grasp is something that people may want to do if all other things are equal&#151;again, for a quiet life. Finally, non-resident parents need to be sent a very strong signal that the Child Maintenance Enforcement Commission understands that they have a duty, knows where they live and will come to look for them if they do not do what is expected of them. The amendments in the group that suggest some changes and some rethinking there are essential.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08013172000021">I will quote again from my favourite Australian of the month, Professor Patrick Parkinson, in the <I>Times</I> of 19 January, when he talked about the danger of our whole system becoming essentially voluntary. He said that was the gravest danger; that was the first thing that he pointed out. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08013172000337">&#147;The second danger is that the resident parent, usually the mother, ends up acquiescing to the first offer made [by the father] on the grounds that at least they will get it&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08013172000327">That is what we are facing. There has to be a duty on the commission to encourage the use of the statutory scheme. Amendments Nos. 26 and 32, if not perfect in their drafting, raise the question in a clear and stark way and I hope that the Minister will respond positively to them.</p>

Forgive me, I was caught on the telephone and was not diligent enough to get off it quickly enough. I support the push of the noble Lords in the amendment, which I think is very wise. Many of us have what I hope are ill-founded reservations about the efficacy of a voluntary system. I understand that in Scandinavia, for example, the parents with care could not even claim good cause to allow them to remain anonymous. The reason for that, which was not the path that we followed in Britain in either 1991

If it appeared to be discretionary as to what she sought and how much she would settle for, it was more likely that she would be at the end of harassment, bullying or even violence.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08013172000023">I remember seeing a NACSA website which said, &#147;Go and break the window of your ex and tell her that if she pleads good cause, that she is afraid of you, you will pay her &#163;10 or &#163;15&#148;. I saw that website; it was then taken off when it was realised that I had had access to it. One should not underestimate not just the fecklessness of some payers but the reluctance of men who feel that they have no continuing relationship with the parent with care and no continuing relationship with the child. Anything that sends agreements into the voluntary sector encourages him&#151;I say him; I accept that some parents with care will be fathers, but 90 or 95 per cent will be mothers&#151;to seek always to press down on the payments that he would otherwise make. That is especially true, from my experience, when he moves into a second relationship in which there is another player, possibly a woman with children of her own in a fairly tight financial situation, who is seeking all the time, understandably, to maximise the second family's income.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08013172000024">My first point is that I have very deep worries about a voluntary system, given the inequity of bargaining power. A lot of European experience suggests that that is an unwise path to go down. My second concern is that, if we are going down that path, we must ensure that there is at least some way to give her some muscle. I know that she can come back to CMEC and the statutory system, but that will be discouraged, because the whole of the business case is based on trying to get as many individuals into the voluntary sector as possible. At the very least, I would like my noble friend to see whether it is worth exploring, alongside the amendment, reinforcing it by making it possible to have a registration system, as I understand there is in Scotland, so that voluntary agreements can be registered. They will not have statutory force, but will appear to stiffen and formalise the situation. If then by consent she seeks to depart voluntarily from the minute that she has registered&#151;perhaps because she is trading a reduced sum for extra money for school trips or trains and so on&#151;that is fine. At least it may balance some of the imbalance of power that may result.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08013172000025">The third thing that worries me about a voluntary arrangement relates to an amendment to be moved by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, later, with which I have some sympathy, although, again, I am not sure that it should be in the Bill. I am confident that my noble friend says in his speeches to staff and to public organisations all the time that getting child maintenance flow, along with getting lone parents back into work, is one of the most effective ways of tackling child poverty. That is undeniable.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para16">
<p><a name="08013172000026">However, if we have voluntary arrangements, how do we know what money is going to children? How do we know, as a result, how many lone parents with  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC383"><b>31 Jan 2008 : Column GC383</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>children are above the 60 per cent median line? We would know the benefit income, but we would not know what additional income she is getting from the father if there is no way even to register it. I accept that a registration system is somewhat flaky and that it may be more observed in its absence than in its presence. But at least it gives us a benchmark which allows us to track what is happening to children who may or may not be just on the poverty line. If that money is flowing, at least we could see whether we are beginning to meet our targets, including the extremely challenging target of trying to reduce by half the number of children in poverty by 2010.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08013172000027">For those reasons, I am worried about any voluntary system. First, it increases the father&#146;s potential all the time to negotiate the money down because he has the power and the knowledge. He knows what he is earning, whereas the mother almost certainly does not. Secondly, we should at the very least stiffen it with a registration system, as in Scotland. Thirdly, I also want to see that registration system or a version of, it if at all possible, in order to track what is happening to child poverty. If we do not concern ourselves with this, we will not achieve one of the main outcomes that we are striving for in this Bill. We want to ensure that child maintenance flows to children, not just so that biological fathers rather than taxpayer fathers bear a proper responsibility for their child&#146;s well-being, but so that we can tackle what is really a scar on the face of the nation&#151;too many children bumping along at the very bottom level of income support.</p>

I want to be very clear on this. However, all other things being equal, we want to encourage people into voluntary arrangements as opposed to statutory ones where that is appropriate. It is not a question of a voluntary arrangement being superior to the statutory system and the statutory system being somehow second-class. That is not how we approach it. A key part of our reforms is based on the evidence that many parents would prefer to have a voluntary arrangement and that where this can be agreed between themselves, it is the best way forward. Voluntary arrangements can be tailored to the unique circumstances of the parents in question and are associated with higher compliance rates. But that is not to say that we do not recognise that for many parents arriving at voluntary arrangements will not be desirable or even possible. Certainly, in the specific circumstances that my noble friend Lady Hollis described, no one would wish to encourage voluntary arrangements in those situations.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08013172000030">Furthermore, I also confirm that the objectives, as drafted, do not require the commission to encourage voluntary arrangements when they are against either parent&#146;s wishes or their best interests. We have built in two safeguards against this. First, as I have said, the commission can only encourage appropriate voluntary arrangements which are suitable to the circumstances of both parents, particularly in terms of the level of any arrangements.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para20">
<p><a name="08013172000031">Secondly, everything the commission does must contribute to the achievement of its main objective to maximise the number of effective maintenance arrangements. Were the commission to encourage an arrangement that either party was unhappy with, it would be unlikely to work. In other words, it would not result in an effective arrangement. To encourage such an arrangement would put the commission in breach of its objectives.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para21">
<p><a name="08013172000032">More specifically on some of the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, and my noble friend Lady Hollis, none of us wants to push parents into arrangements that do not meet their needs. We want to encourage as many people as possible to have maintenance arrangements in place. It will be for parents to decide what sort of maintenance arrangement is most effective in meeting their responsibility for the maintenance of their children, and for the commission to provide information and guidance to help parents to do so.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para22">
<p><a name="08013172000033">We recognise that pressure on one parent by the other is a potential risk in some cases. That is why we are establishing a service to provide both parents with impartial high-quality information to ensure that both parents can make informed choices about their child&#146;s maintenance. If a separating parent feels that an enforceable arrangement is appropriate to their needs, they could go straight to the statutory scheme where they would be guided and supported to make a formal maintenance arrangement.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para23">
<p><a name="08013172000034">My noble friend raised the issue of a registration system for voluntary arrangements. She will be aware that the plans for the new arrangements have been discussed. Such a system might be appropriate in the future, but we leave it to the commission to look at the possibility and to advise on it, possibly on some sort of piloting basis. It is not something which under the legislation we wish to impose from day one.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08013172000035">Unequal bargaining power is a very real issue, and we recognise the risks involved. That is why the information and support services will be so important. As we discussed on Tuesday, if the parent with care has no idea what the income of the non-resident parent is, the automatic starting point would be an engagement with the statutory system.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para25">
<p><a name="08013172000036">My noble friend asked how we know whether our child poverty targets are being met or contributed to by voluntary arrangements. We would use the various family surveys for that information, which are the same sources that we currently use for voluntary arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000037">The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, suggested that the strategy system was being portrayed almost as a second-rate service, to be used only if everything else fails. That is not how we approach it. We want a high-quality service and to make sure that it is available to parents if that is their end choice and they do not feel that voluntary arrangements are best for them.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0001.htm_para27">
<p><a name="08013172000038">The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked about figures for the increase in voluntary arrangements. The current business plan retains the increase of 200,000 to which he referred. Obviously the business plan is being refined as time progresses. We recognise that there are judgments in all this and in some of the underlying assumptions about how people will react to the new system and what their responses to it will be. On that basis, in steady state there would be an administrative saving of the order of &#163;200 million. That figure is still in the system.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000039">The noble Lord referred to Professor Parkinson and his article in the <I>Times</I>. I, too, met him. He said that he did not think the article entirely reflected the view that he had expressed. In particular, I talked to him about his view of a voluntary system. I do not think he would maintain with the force that that article seemed to suggest that we should make the system entirely voluntary. That is absolutely not what we are doing. At the centre of these reforms is a determination to get an increased number of maintenance arrangements. That is the overriding objective of the commission and the Government. I hope that that has covered the issues that have been raised, but I am happy to have another go if noble Lords think that it has not.</p>

My spies tell me that he has been moved from having responsibility for this subject and actually has nothing to do with this amendment. That is annoying. His 15 months are obviously up; he is just beginning to get hold of this important subject at a key time, and now some other Minister is doing it. That is completely bad timing and no reward for merit, competence or any damn thing. If that is true, the Committee commiserates with him. If it is anything to do with Mr James Purnell, who used to serve under me on a Select Committee in another place, if I find him in the House of Commons locker room and he is to blame, I will wait until he is in his Marks and Spencer&#146;s best, and I will poke him in the ribs and complain because I cannot think who else to complain to. If the Minister has been moved, that is not at all helpful for the Committee, the policy or anything else, and I commiserate with him, but perhaps he has better things to do with his time.

The statistics are difficult enough. I understand the case that is being made, but the noble Baroness&#146;s point continues to obtain until the Government can find some way of giving us assurance. I fear that they will lose control and will not be able to monitor the situation in the way that enables us to take account of the policy objectives in the long term.</p>

She then usually moves into work or a new relationship, and if she moves into a new relationship, she also moves into work. That means that she will be dependent on a voluntary arrangement by virtue of being a benefit case for a relatively short time. That is an average; therefore many lone parents will be lone parents for far less. I cannot help preferring a system in which when people become lone parents they are automatically within CMEC. We know that if maintenance does not flow from the father within six weeks, it is not likely to flow at all. We also know from the Australian experience that after about 12 months to two years, his maintenance has often fallen off or fallen away, often because he has moved out of the area and no longer sees the kids or he is in a new relationship. Sustaining it is then very difficult. I would like a register at the very least, but I would be much more confident if we had a system in which for the first year or two they were in the statutory system, and then if both agree because regular payments have been made, they go into a voluntary arrangement.</p>

I do not disagree with that at all, but I have absolutely no confidence that we will get the outcomes that we want by allowing an immediate movement into a voluntary system in the way that is proposed. The other option would be to require people to go through the portal of a statutory system for at least the first 12 months and then after that if they wished move into a voluntary arrangement, by which time maintenance payments should be flowing regularly, she will know what she is entitled to and we can hope that with any luck a stable state will be maintained. I am very worried that if we do not put some safeguards in, other than just leaving it to the commission to see whether it is working a year or two or three down the line&#151;because a pilot would take a year to set up and another year to get results from and another two years to roll out&#151;it will be too late.</p>

What is new is that those people who are on benefits have the choice, as everyone else has had, to have a voluntary arrangement or use the statutory system. I am a little nervous about the underlying assumption here that poorer people who rely on benefits are innately more feckless in their arrangements. We need to be a little cautious in that regard.</p>

When you come out of a divorce situation, questions of child maintenance are regulated by the courts and in the shadow of the CSA; there is often a long period of bonding with the children and he is anxious as a committed father to continue that relationship of parenting. The problem is, surely, that when she is on benefit and he is too, and being recycled between JSA and work, at best there may have been a fairly tenuous cohabitation and quite possibly they have never even lived under the same roof together. So there is a real distinction between the types of couple. We know that there is a 25 per cent overlap or churning between the two categories every year, but none the less there is a real distinction, in broad terms, between the commitments to their children of those fathers who have come out of a divorce.</p>

We do that at a macro level, through the various surveys that take place routinely, but we also have the information and support service. Right at the start of these arrangements, we envisage that that service will explain to parents what the statutory system might produce and the sort of factors that they might take into account in a negotiation. A pro forma standard maintenance would be offered as part of that discussion and there would be reference to the need to comply with the arrangements.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0002.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08013172000048">Moreover, the information and support service is being designed so that when people enter the benefit system there is a clear link to align them so that the service can make contact with them. There is another route into that service for people who claim tax credits. Again, there will be an arrangement with HMRC of referrals into that information and support service, providing another link for those parents. If people are in and out of benefits and tax credits, and their lives are as my noble friend suggests, already loops are being built into that information and support service to enable them to be reached on an ongoing basis. So I think that there are protections.</p>

I envisage that a significant number of them would and should use the statutory service, which is why we also need to make sure that it is effective and is delivering. There are a number of routes on an ongoing basis to keep contact with that group. It is an important issue, and the information support service, as it is being built, will particularly have to focus on that.</p>

The Minister says, &#147;There is this wonderful new system up in Sheffield of advice and support, and we will know exactly what is going on because they will be giving advice&#148;. Who will they be giving advice to? The person who is going to go to Ventura is almost certainly the parent with care on their own. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, would know better than me, having been responsible in this area. I imagine that where advice is being sought, it is very much applied for on one side or the other. Surely to goodness it is most likely to be the parent with care of the child or children who will want to seek advice.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0002.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08013172000051">There is a sort of self-policing mechanism in the Bill, because as the Minister has rightly said, if the parent with care fails to strike an agreement with the absent parent, or does so but the money is not forthcoming, they can always turn to the statutory system. We know that, on average, absent parents lose contact with their children after about three years. By the time the parent with care has gone to seek advice for moving to the statutory system, she will have been out of pocket on behalf of her children for a considerable length of time.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0002.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08013172000052">A registration of voluntary agreements looks to me to be a good idea, but it would only tell us in the broadest terms&#151;like any of the statutory bodies that produce research and figures&#151;whether the voluntary service is contributing to poverty among children, the reduction of which is, rightly, a stated aim of the Government. When the Minister talked about information flowing because of tax credits, I was very surprised because, yes, tax credits are applied for because of a level of income, but maintenance arrangements have a 100 per cent disregard in tax credits, whereas these arrangements go only to a maximum of &#163;40 disregard. Unlike the noble Lord, I am no mathematician so I do not know the answer. However, there must be a difference in those two arrangements for the money which ultimately flows to the children.</p>

Obviously, in theory, there is access to HMT records. However, let us suppose that there has been a two or three-year voluntary agreement during which time CMAC has had no contact with the non-resident parent, and that then he moves away and the mother comes to CMAC saying, &#147;I now want to come into the statutory system&#148;.

If that situation arose, there would be no reason why the parent with care must wait for three years. If a voluntary arrangement is not working, there can be immediate recourse to the statutory system.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0002.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08013172000057">The issue with regard to tax credits is not that they feature in the calculations, but that when it is clear that an applicant for tax credit is a parent with care, there is a route down which they can be referred to the information and support service on a direct or indirect basis.

<a name="80131-gc0002.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08013172000058">Is the noble Lord suggesting that we should not allow everyone the choice of a voluntary arrangement, but that we should continue to have a category of people who will be forced to use the statutory system? Ultimately, that is the nub of the issue. If we are going to say that there is a category of people who must use the system, what are the criteria for that? Whatever the challenges of allowing people the choice&#151;and I accept that there are some&#151;if we do not do so, we in part stick with the current system.

What I am suspicious of is those cases where violence might be involved; and those cases in which for some reason a much lower amount is struck in the voluntary system, even though, presumably, the advice and support service would say what the statutory-system amount was. But there might be all kinds of reasons, as the Minister predicated, why in a voluntary system the two parents might come to a much lower figure.</p>

Amendment No. 29 requires an open competition to replace the Child Support Agency information system when the current contract ends. I wonder whether I could be allowed to start with a cheap shot at the Minister because his computer statistics do not add up. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and I did not meet over breakfast, but no doubt, like me, he has looked at the quarterly statistics from the computer. Table 19.5 is wrong. How do I know that? Because the summary of the statistics shows that in December 2007 maintenance collected or arranged for the year ending 31 March was higher than the next year&#146;s target by quite a margin&#151;&#163;5 million. That cannot be right because it is hard for a target to be reached, never mind for the next year&#146;s target to be reached. Table 19.5 should read &#163;741.7 million not &#163;975 million, but maybe someone will check that. What I think has happened is that the period over which that maintenance has been collected has been misallocated not as April to December but as December 06 to December 07. Maybe someone will put me out of my misery about that. One would think that after spending that amount of money on a computer it would be able to add columns up right. No doubt someone will tell me whether that is right.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000065">These two amendments are important. We have to look at the history and at the information technology relationship with EDS. On Tuesday, I referred to the National Audit Office report, which is an important precursor for understanding what has gone on in the past. I had it mind to go in some detail into how we came to be here, but I shall not as that would tax colleagues&#146; patience. Suffice it to say that in August 2000, the information technology services agency, which retained all the corporate knowledge within the department, was outsourced to EDS. EDS then got the contract, and the contract has never worked. It was fundamentally reworked in 2005, and it still has not been fully developed. It has two years to run and, as far as I am concerned, the development work is still ongoing. I think there are a number of important questions around it. A lot of them were raised in the National Audit Office report. Apart from anything else, we spent &#163;91 million on external advice&#151;

<p><a name="08013172000066">The Child Support Agency computer system may not be running after 1 April because the contract is due to run out in April 2008. If that is the case, I do not know who is going to be running the old cases after that date, unless there has been a roll-on of the contract. There are still 600 manual worker rounds. The computer is not producing management information that is fit for purpose. It is a contract with the department and I do not know how that will be transferred cleanly to the commission&#151;I assume that the commission will be responsible for all the contracts that deal with technology in future&#151;and how it will manage to disentangle the relationship that is already done through the Accord/EDS system of contracts without making it difficult for what is left of the department. I do not understand. I would like to be told a little more about that.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0002.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08013172000067">Obviously, there is a key decision to be made&#151;and it is looming&#151;by the commission when it is put into place. We have the prospect of the operational improvement plan being completed by March 2009. Only then will the National Audit Office be able to look at how effective the operational improvement plan has been in terms of its objectives. There will probably be a Public Accounts Committee report in 2010; there will probably be an election in 2010; and it will probably be around 2010 or 2011 before we really see how effective the operational improvement plan has been.

<p><a name="08013172000068">The new commission has two years to make a decision about what it does next in terms of sustaining the EDS contract. The EDS contract is a contract for services; it is worth &#163;1 million per week. We do not have a big shiny Apache server with terabytes of memory in the Minister&#146;s office; we have a service agreement. We can use the services of the contract. If the contract stopped for some reason on Monday, there would be nothing left that would be tangible by way of systems, software or anything else. It is a service only contract. It is a very big ask to leave. The Minister regularly suggests to the committee that we should leave all this to the commission. I do not believe that we can.</p>

There are genuinely difficult questions about commercial confidentiality, which Ministers are protected from. I understand why that is important. Ministers for their own safety often cannot be told what is going on in case they go around to the pub and speak to somebody who is a competitor. Then you have a class action against you in the courts, and all that stuff. It is not easy. Ministers find it difficult to stay on top of what is happening in current circumstances. We went through the CS2 reform. The whole policy platform that was put together in 2003 suffered and has never really recovered from the fact that the computer is not fit for purpose.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000070">The two suggestions I make here are based on lessons&#151;and I promise I can speak without hesitation and deviation and not even with repetition about all this for a much longer time&#151;that we really need to learn in terms of what went wrong in 2003, and to make sure that we do not make the same mistakes again. The Commons Select Committee, which I had the privilege to chair, produced a report on this in 2003. One of its recommendations was that there should be a full-blown review of CS2 at the earliest possible time, as soon as it had settled down and become stable. We are not there yet, so we cannot do that. As I say, it will probably be 2009 or 2010 before we get the results of that. It would only then be safe for Parliament to make a decision about which route to take. We do not have that time. The commission that we are creating in the Bill does not have that time. </p>

<a name="80131-gc0002.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08013172000071">Therefore, we are faced with what Parliament is asking the commission to do. These two amendments in very simple terms say that it is not safe in 2010 merely to continue the contract without going back to the marketplace with an open tender for contracts, and all the rest of that. It is complicated. It may take time and cost money as you may have to encourage alternative contractors to take part in the competition because it may not be what they want because it is so troubled.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0002.htm_para20">
<p><a name="08013172000072">I do not see how else we can get any satisfaction in Parliament. We were kept in the dark last time around. The only way I can think of getting any kind of influence over what is happening with the decision the commission will have to take&#151;and take very soon&#151;is that it should engage in an open process of tendering before it makes that decision.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0002.htm_para21">
<p><a name="08013172000073">Amendment No. 204 simply seeks to get what comfort we can. The full OGC gateway reviews are now part of the established way of doing these things, partly as a result of the disastrous consequences of the EDS experience earlier with the IT for the CSA. There is now quite a lot of corporate knowledge within the Office of Government Commerce. It has got, if not full-blown gateways, health checks and access to Gartner which can do reviews and give assurance on some of the things and try to get a handle on what the risks really are before we actually get the commission to take the big decision that it will have to take about what platform it uses for technology in the future.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0002.htm_para22">
<p><a name="08013172000074">My personal suspicion is that it has no choice. I would be very surprised if it was not just tied, hook, line and sinker, into this contract. The people who entered into this contract in the department deserve to go to gaol. It is a proprietary contract, which ties people to the suppliers with no room for manoeuvre. We may have to go with another version of an EDS contract. I hope that once it has finished being developed, it will be fully compliant and all the other bugs and defects will have been rung out of it.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0002.htm_para23">
<p><a name="08013172000075">However, I say seriously to the Committee that, if Parliament does not have a method of getting assurance that we will not make the same mistake as in 2003, there must be something in the Bill. Otherwise, it will be left to whatever operational decisions force it to take decisions that have to be made very quickly.

We spoke briefly of the trials and tribulations of the CSA computer problems, and the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, and I referred to them at Second Reading. For the noble Lord to accuse me then of the pot calling the kettle black&#151;or, as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, might say, were she here, &#147;du&#148;&#151;as he did on that occasion, was somewhat over the top. Neither I nor my party have had the 10-odd years to do anything about those undoubted problems that the Government have had.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0002.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08013172000077">On Tuesday, yet again we heard from the Minister that the EDS computer system is now expected by the end of the financial year&#151;I think that he said the end of March, which would be about right. He keeps making these assurances. A few months ago, in a discussion on an order, the Minister assured me that proper contractual and tendering arrangements are now in place across government, which includes the CSA, the DWP, HM Revenue and Customs and so on. We have yet to have proof that that is correct. We will await the new computer at the CSA by the end of March with great interest. But, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, that the prognosis is far from good.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0002.htm_para25">
<p><a name="08013172000078">However, this Bill forces the promotion of an open competition to replace it, should it then need replacing because it is yet again defective, overdue, perhaps again over-budget and either under or over specification, but until it is up and running none of us can make any judgment about it whatever.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0002.htm_para26">
<p><a name="08013172000079">Promoting an open competition is what should have happened throughout the past 10 years; it certainly happened under a Conservative Government. Sometimes, I freely admit, the open competition did not produce the results that one expected and desired. I cannot see that putting such a condition in the Bill will make the situation any better now. What is necessary is for the people with knowledge to take a grip on the situation.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000082">Amendment No. 29 is intended to ensure that, once the current contract for the CSA IT system ends, the system should be replaced by a new one, with the development work done through a new contract awarded following open competition. IT services within the CSA are, as the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, identified, currently provided through department-wide contracts. These contracts contain clauses that cover the possibility of future changes in our organisation.

Obviously, that was always impossible. Is that still the case, or did I misunderstand the situation? I am perfectly willing to believe that I did misunderstand it, as I claim no expertise at all in computers or contracts.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0003.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08013172000086">As I was saying, at the highest level, there are two questions that the commission must resolve. The first is whether to seek provision of IT services independently, or whether to remain within the scope of DWP contracts and negotiate in conjunction with the department. The second is whether to replace or maintain the existing CSA computer system.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0003.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08013172000087">These are obviously hugely important matters and I believe that it would be wrong to impose a solution, as would the amendment, on the commission.

<p><a name="08013172000088">Furthermore, on perhaps a more technical point, I believe that the amendment oversimplifies the range of potential options.

<a name="80131-gc0003.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08013172000089">Amendment No. 204 would require the Office of Government Commerce to provide assurances that the information technology system meets all the standards and specifications in the contract to supply information before the HMRC data are supplied to the commission, or to a person providing services to the commission in relation to its child support functions. As I am sure we are all aware, the intention in Schedule 6 is for the commission to benefit from the information gateways which already exist between the Department for Work and Pensions, the Northern Ireland Department and HMRC. So it has access to all the necessary information required to carry out its child support functions. We are all aware that the information provided by HMRC will be essential to the operation of the commission, and so we will take all precautions necessary to ensure the smooth and effective establishment of systems suitable for this purpose.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0003.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08013172000090">I want to inform Members of the Committee that we are currently investigating, and I am in discussion with HMRC on the details of the HMRC data transfer. Additionally, the Office of Government Commerce is already involved and is providing assurances on the overall child maintenance redesign programme within the department that oversees the establishment of the commission. For those reasons, I believe that the proposed risk assessment from the Office of Government Commerce is not necessary. I would also want the commission carefully to consider and make decisions in its IT requirements, clearly undertaking appropriate reviews, and in time before the planned maintenance system comes into operation in 2010.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0003.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08013172000091">Perhaps I may pick up on a couple of comments that were made about EDS and the existing system. Clearly, there have been problems with it. A great deal of work has been carried out to improve the stability of the new computer system&#151;CS2&#151;and operational performance has improved to the point where contracted service levels are consistently being met. The agency is planning a major IT release by the end of this financial year, which will resolve many of the remaining performance issues. Of the 506 system defects agreed in 2005, 219 of the most critical were resolved as of October 2007. The enhanced systems will establish a more stable IT platform on which the commission will be able to build. In particular, the agency&#146;s telephony has shown tremendous levels of improvement. The average time taken to answer calls from the queue fell from one minute 40 seconds in 2005 to only 21 seconds in September 2007. So progress has been made.</p>

If the Office of Government Commerce is involved, is there not some way that, with the commercially sensitive parts of the reports removed, Parliament can be given first sight of the assurance about the gateway and other processes that are going through as the reletting process unfolds?</p>

As my noble friend said at the start of today&#146;s proceedings, the heart of the Bill or the driving focus seems to be in Clause 2. The aim of a reduction in child poverty should be seen upfront in the Bill. Why is that seen to be necessary? Probably because it is nowhere else. As we go through the names of the clauses we see the objectives, the functions, promotion of child maintenance and the provision of information and fees. It is conceivable that certain types of activity will be prioritised because they are administratively more rewarding and easier to fulfil than ones that might actually assist with child poverty. For instance, there may be areas in which the amount of effort and resources required to deal with cases can become difficult. Those cases may be at the edge, involving those who are closest to the poverty line, when smaller amounts of money are pushed into the budget to ensure that children are maintained properly, to give the greatest benefit to the children and the caring parent. Those may be areas that take up an inordinate amount of resources and it might be decided that they are outside the box.</p>

I am not sure that it is appropriate to put words such as this in a Bill such as this. We all know why child maintenance is important; it is to ensure that a child who lives with one parent has sufficient financial support so that at least financially they are not disadvantaged in comparison with their counterparts in two-parent family homes. However, I wonder how and why the amendment is useful, and whether the reduction of child poverty needs to be stated as one of the objectives of CMEC. Not every case of child separation necessarily means child poverty. Does the noble Lord, Lord Addington, not agree with me that in a situation demanding the allocation of funds what is needed is fairness, which is the prerequisite for trust? Positive discrimination is not needed, as there are always some who object to the discrimination no matter how virtuous it seems.</p>

One could put forward all sorts of arguments. There is a body of academic evidence. I was looking at some work done by the University of York, which has recently produced an analysis of poverty in England. It is a very thorough study, talking about the challenges of families living on low incomes being aggravated by the experience of abuse, domestic violence, relationship breakdown and so on. I am certain that there is a very clear link between family breakdown and poverty.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0003.htm_para16">
<p><a name="08013172000106">However, that is not the reason why I believe the amendment is important. It is important because the next three years of the public spend in the Comprehensive Spending Review will rightly be focused on child poverty. If that is the grade of public policy at strategic level, it makes sense in this Bill to focus on some of the lines of attack to try to bear down on the poverty experienced by parents with care&#151;with non-resident parents elsewhere&#151;so as to try to shoehorn them into the Government&#146;s direction of travel. I would put money on the fact that, between now and the end of the Comprehensive Spending Review, the Government will start to look more seriously at this route for driving down child poverty to reach their targets by 2010. They will have to do something. They have done a lot, which is acknowledged, but they will have to do more. How will they do more? What options are open to them? This is one of them.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000107">If the Bill gives the commission more authority in the heart of Clause 2, as my noble friend says, that will enable the Minister, or his heirs and successors, whoever they may be, to go to the Treasury and say, &#147;Here is a way forward; this commission, with a little help from its friends, could get to a government target more easily&#148;. So, if we take it, we are staring an advantage in the face. By putting child poverty into Clause 2 as one of the objectives of the commission, that will make it easier for the commission and the Government to get to where we all want to be in 2010. </p>

<p><a name="08013172000108">Even if one does not accept the academic, the political or the philosophical basis, there is a pragmatic, practical reason for doing this right now, because if we do not, we will not get the money that we might otherwise get. If people do not understand that, they need only look at the public service agreements that have just been published in the 2007 Pre-Budget Report, because they are very focused on child poverty. There used to be a PSA target for child support, but that has gone, so where will we get the purchase on the Treasury if we do not use child poverty as a lever to get extra money, to get the resources that the commission needs and to get the job done properly by 2010?</p>

I am not sure how my noble friend will respond to this amendment, but my first reason is a philosophical point. I would be amazed if in the number of speeches that my noble friend has made about the Child Support Agency to staff, at conferences, to voluntary groups, he has not emphasised the ability of child maintenance to make a huge difference to the number of children in poverty. I would guarantee that one of his key arguments in his speeches is about the need to address child poverty and that the staff are not debt collection agents, but are in the forefront of trying to overcome child poverty. I would guarantee that my noble friend has made that speech on a number of occasions and that is where I believe it belongs&#151;in speeches made by Ministers on the wider context of the Bill. While I do not dissent from one word of the wishes or outcomes addressed by the noble Lords who have spoken in support of the amendment, like the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, I am, however, wary of what I call rhetoric in Bills as opposed to the practical things that Bills seek to change and to effect by legislation.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0003.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08013172000110">My second point is a practical concern. Perhaps the noble Lords, Lord Addington and Lord Kirkwood, can help me on this point before my noble friend responds. Is the implication of this amendment that CMEC would be expected to distinguish between parents to ensure that it helps the poorest parents first at the expense of other parents, irrespective of the cost? For example, to overcome child poverty and to get an extra &#163;5 to a child, it is legitimate to spend &#163;10 or &#163;15 chasing that child who is poorer, as opposed to giving &#163;20 to another child for which one would need to spend only &#163;10 chasing it up. I understand the honourable nature of that intent, but that brings one up against the constraints of the business and value-for-money contexts within which the agency may work. At that level, it may be more appropriate to deal with

I have the gravest doubts that the Treasury would take such great interest in the fact that the commission is under an obligation, according to this amendment, to reduce child poverty. I wonder how on earth it is thought that the commission could do that. It does not seem to me to be part of the commission's job to do that, although clearly it is part of the commission's job to try to get money from absent parents.

It cannot reasonably have a broader contribution to touch on all the issues and

<a name="80131-gc0003.htm_para22">
<p><a name="08013172000116">By working towards its main objective, to maximise the number of effective&#151;that is, working&#151;arrangements in place, the commission will already be making a significant contribution to the reduction of child poverty. It is difficult to see how, in regard to the payment of child maintenance, the proposed amendment would help to reduce poverty among children who live apart from one or both parents to any greater extent than the main objective. The noble Lord will be aware that this main objective is supported through two subsidiary objectives. These supporting objectives require the commission to encourage and support appropriate voluntary arrangements, as we have discussed, and to support applications to, and compliance of, the statutory maintenance service.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000117">All the functions and services for which the commission has responsibility will be shaped to meet the commission&#146;s main and supporting objectives. As part of this, we would expect the commission to focus resources on those groups most in need of support, particularly those on benefits who will be taking their own decisions about child support matters for the first time. For example, while the information and support service will be available to all parents, we are working closely with Jobcentre Plus and HMRC, as I outlined earlier, to ensure that separating parents on low incomes can be identified and proactively referred to the information and support service.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0003.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08013172000118">However, the commission does not have responsibility for the many other matters that have a bearing on child poverty. The level of the maintenance disregard, for example, is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, as is the New Deal for Lone Parents, while the tax credit system is a matter for HMRC. As a result, we do not consider a wider objective on child poverty to be appropriate for the commission. Therefore, I urge the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This takes us to the definitions. Earlier in the Grand Committee, we had discussions on that. The Public Bill Committee in another place also looked at some of these matters. The amendment seeks further clarification of what is meant by words such as &#147;effective&#148; and &#147;appropriate&#148; at their respective places in the Bill as it stands. We know from what Mr Plaskitt said in the Public Bill Committee in another place on 19 July that &#147;effective&#148; means an arrangement that works and &#147;appropriate&#148; means an arrangement that is suitable to the circumstances of the parents in question. It is the right type of arrangement at the right level and it is sustainable. There was further discussion about that on Report and at Third Reading in the other place.</p>

In seeking to meet its objectives, to maximise the number of effective maintenance arrangements, an arrangement that &#147;works&#148; is a crucial part of the consideration of the way in which the process will work. It will determine what information the commission will need to gather to check that it is meeting its main objective, which is important, and how its action in ensuring that it is an arrangement that works stems back to what an &#147;arrangement that works&#148; means. Given that the voluntary agreements are just that&#151;voluntary&#151;there is no duty to report such arrangements to the commission. We talked about a little earlier. Neither is there one to say how they compare with the amount available under the statutory scheme. How will the commission establish whether voluntary arrangements reach the right type or level and are sustainable? Those are all words that have been used by Ministers at earlier stages.</p>

They are fairly innocuous words, taken by themselves, but in the context of the Bill and where they are in the Bill, they could be quite crucial factors in ensuring that the policy works successfully.

Words of such a subjective nature in Acts of Parliament are far from helpful. Clearly, it is Parliament&#146;s role to debate Bills, which cannot be very easily achieved if they are expressed in vague allusions as to what will happen in practice, or what is expected to happen, and what will actually happen. What will actually happen is not very often&#151;especially under this Government&#151;expressed in Bills; it is expressed in orders, which we cannot amend, although we can discuss them and argue for or against them. It takes a very rare Minister to withdraw an order after a debate; in the past few years there have been three&#151;no, four, because the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, did it the other day. But in the general scheme of things it is very rare indeed. This is why as early in the legislative process as possible we need absolute clarity on what in this case the commission is intended to achieve.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0004.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08013172000129">I hope that the Minister will agree that objectives are a necessary and useful yardstick against which we may in hindsight judge CMEC&#146;s performance, in this case. It is important that the Bill contains as many checks and balances as it can to prevent a failing body continuing to fail. I know that the Minister will say straightaway that this is a new body, but I have already given my point of view on that. I would be very much interested in just what is the criteria for judging, &#147;effective maintenance arrangements&#148;. Will it be quantified by a cash amount or reliability or what?</p>

<a name="80131-gc0004.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08013172000130">Equally, what is meant by that slippery and frequently overused term, &#147;appropriate&#148; when positioned as it is here in the context of voluntary arrangements? I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, on that matter. The inevitable but nevertheless crucial question is: appropriate for whom? Is it appropriate for the Government, for the civil servants behind them, for CMEC to achieve quick resolutions, for the parents or for the children? Perhaps &#147;appropriate&#148; should mean that the arrangements are at least comparable in amount with what would be available under the statutory scheme. I cannot see any good reason why Ministers should say that they would expect most voluntary arrangements to be in line with the statutory scheme. I do not think we have the slightest idea.</p>

The noble Lord is right that these two terms are critical to the commission&#146;s objectives. As such, throughout the passage of the Bill we have been absolutely clear about their meaning. Effective arrangements are arrangements that have the desired effect; in other words, arrangements that are working. Typically that would be where maintenance is flowing, but it is wherever both parties are complying

That seems pretty straightforward. Appropriate voluntary arrangements are arrangements that are suitable to the circumstances of the parents in question, particularly in terms of the level of any agreement. By definition, that needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis and is therefore not suitable for secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0004.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08013172000132">Overall, it is difficult to see what further clarity regulations could bring in this area. We are also concerned that in an attempt to provide a detailed definition in secondary legislation, we lose some flexibility of application that is important for dealing with the incredible variety of personal circumstances facing the commission. For example, only the parents in question can determine the arrangement that is appropriate for them. The system would not work if the commission was attempting to apply a standard, legal interpretation of appropriateness or suitability.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000133">The noble Lords, Lord Kirkwood and Lord Skelmersdale, asked whether arrangements will automatically mirror what would come from the statutory system. They will not inevitably mirror them if they are voluntary arrangements, but I expect that voluntary arrangements would be entered into with the knowledge of what the statutory system would deliver and therefore what wrap-around or alternative is available to parents should the voluntary arrangement not succeed to be effective. I do not see any particular difficulty in that. Although I would expect that voluntary arrangements would not inevitably be linked to the formula, I would expect them to have regard to that formula; otherwise there is a risk that they would be unsustainable.

<p><a name="08013172000138">The noble Lord said: We can deal with this group of amendments with some despatch. The amendments deal generally with parliamentary scrutiny once the commission is up and running. It is sensible that we should take a little time to reflect on what we would like to see happen once the commission is up and running. Obviously, there will be a flurry of interest at the beginning and as things settle down, but I am thinking more about the relationship between Parliament and the commission as it evolves and once it gets into a steady state, as I hope it will, and in the longer term.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0004.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08013172000139">Amendment No. 38 tries to set out an operational plan. I guess that is something that you could integrate into an annual report, and I understand perfectly well that there are provisions for that later on in the Bill. I would take more comfort if there were some guidelines, framework or template that Parliament could request that the commission adopts and develops on an ongoing basis, so that we can track over a period of time exactly what is going on in this important body that we are creating. The annual report or the operational plan could be debated in the Chamber, if nowhere else. An expectation that there be a continuing relationship between what the commission is doing in the future and parliamentary approval&#151;harking back to the discussion that we have just had about technology&#151;might be of interest to some, if not most, of us as the commission starts life and starts to deploy policy.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000140">Amendment No. 66 may arguably be nugatory to the extent that, since I tabled it, it has been made clear that guidance and directions from the Minister will be made public, although I am getting quite negative signals from the Minister at the moment. The power that Clause 10 gives to the department&#151;whoever is in charge of it&#151;needs to be thought about carefully. I can perfectly well understand that, as a residual last-gasp emergency, if everything that can go wrong does go wrong, or if something unexpected happens, the Secretary of State, of any political stripe, could not stand by and watch the thing go wrong for whatever reason, because this is such an important area of policy. Maybe the Secretary of State needs a residual power of guidance or direction. I certainly think it would be worth taking a moment or two to think about this. I am not asking the Minister to use a crystal ball and fantasise, but there must be some sense of the circumstances in which this power is envisaged to be used. Some thought must have been given to it, or else it would not be there. Exactly what evidence would there be for the rest of us if these are not to be published or laid in front of Parliament when the guidance and directions are given?</p>

To what extent are these mandatory, and to what extent are they discretionary? These are important questions, and the Committee would benefit from the Minister giving us some background feel for what those two words mean in practice and the circumstances in which they may be deployed.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000142">Amendment No. 210 is a duty to consult relevant interests before making regulations. I confess that I think the department did very well. It certainly used the time.

<p><a name="08013172000143">The consultation process that took place in advance of the Bill&#146;s publication was commendable. The Minister took part in some of the seminars and in some of the work with the stakeholders to some effect. We were grateful for that. It makes a big difference if Ministers take the trouble to come and not just make a speech and march off, but to sit and listen to what is being said to them and to soak up some of the questions. That is what happened. I was pleased to see that, but there is no guarantee that, if a Minister has been taken on to higher pastures, the next Minister will be as assiduous. Perhaps Parliament should make it a duty to consult relevant interests before making regulations.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000144">The trio of amendments all seek to do the same thing. They try to tie Parliament into the proceedings and the development of the commission&#146;s work as it unfolds. They may be belt and braces, and I guess that is what the Minister will say&#151;that none of it is necessary because it is all going to be done anyway. I would like to believe that. Indeed, in his ministerial hands I might be prepared to believe it. However, we are setting legislation for the long term, and we do not know who will be implementing it in future. On that basis, Parliament would be better to play safe and to put these amendments in the Bill so that we can guarantee that Parliament will stay advised and properly informed about the work of the commission in future.

<p><a name="08013172000150">Once the annual report is published, there is nothing to stop any Member of Parliament debating it. That is absolutely as it should be.

I suppose that means laid and debated, but what happens if it has not? Presumably it becomes null and void and the plan comes to a grinding halt. I fail to understand how any of that is going to help in a stressful situation for the agency. To my mind it is, again, overkill. If the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, wants to be more definite about what goes into the annual report, we can discuss that and I shall listen to him with interest, but for now I am content to leave things as they are.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000153">However, that being said, the noble Lord raises a fair point in Amendment No. 210. We are anxious that too much is decided by statutory instrument. Her Majesty's Government employ the tactic of writing little into the Bill and what they write is, typically, vague. This means that passing a Bill through Parliament becomes easier and faster to do because there is so little to scrutinise. The skeleton of the Bill is then fleshed out by civil servants into regulation, which we then debate. I stand behind the amendment because it makes the Government&#146;s evasion of the parliamentary process a little more complicated.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000154">Moreover, with there being a staggering 16 new regulations created every day in this country and our regulatory system becoming more and more hideously complex and bureaucratic, surely we should attempt to limit any pointless or needless regulations being implemented by insisting on a consultation process. Talking to all persons with a relevant interest will only help to ensure that CMEC works in a more sympathetic and effective manner. CMEC will find its inauguration into the benefits infrastructure far easier if it is seen to be communicating rather than instructing. So, half a mark, perhaps.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0004.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08013172000156">I recognise the concerns the noble Lord raises but I believe it would be inappropriate for us to make the operational business plan of a non-departmental public body subject to the procedure outlined in the amendment. We believe an NDPB is the right governance structure for the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission precisely because of the independence this model allows. The commission will be led by an autonomous board. As we can see from the appointments already made, board members will be highly qualified for their role and will be the people best placed to decide the direction and plans for the commission.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0004.htm_para25">
<p><a name="08013172000157">The commission should provide documentation that allows effective parliamentary scrutiny. Treasury guidance already requires that all NDPBs prepare and agree a corporate plan that looks three years ahead, and a more detailed operational business plan for the year immediately ahead, as part of the financial and management documents that must be agreed and between a sponsor department and NDPB. These plans must be published. In addition, Clause 9 requires the commission to provide a comprehensive annual report alongside its accounts, and the Secretary of State must lay this before Parliament. In all these respects, the commission will follow precedent for the relationship between NDPBs, government and Parliament.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0004.htm_para26">
<p><a name="08013172000158">Amendment No. 66 would place a statutory requirement on the Secretary of State that guidance and directions must be laid in both Houses of Parliament. As the noble Lord will be aware, ultimate accountability for the commission&#146;s performance and actions remains with the Secretary of State. As such, in line with the legislation for other NDPBs, Clause 10 provides powers of direction and guidance. After listening to thoughts provided in another place, as to the importance of parliamentary scrutiny, we brought forward a government amendment providing that any directions given by the Secretary of State should be laid in Parliament. That is now in Clause 10(5).</p>

<a name="80131-gc0004.htm_para27">
<p><a name="08013172000159">I would hope to persuade the noble Lord that this provision should not be applied to guidance, as his amendment would require. There are significant differences between guidance and directions. The commission is required to follow a direction issued by the Secretary of State and we intend that this power is only used in  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC408"><b>31 Jan 2008 : Column GC408</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>emergencies. Guidance, on the other hand, is less rigid. The commission should take it into account but it does not have to be followed to the letter and is likely to be used for relatively routine, low-profile matters. As a result, we do not consider it appropriate to lay all guidance before Parliament as a matter of course. However, it remains open to the Secretary of State to lay before Parliament any guidance he thinks appropriate. We would also expect guidance to be published and the implementation of guidance to be reported on by the commission through the annual report.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0004.htm_para28">
<p><a name="08013172000160">Finally, I turn to Amendment No. 210, which found somewhat more favour with the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. It requires all persons with relevant interests in child maintenance to be consulted before any regulation under the powers in this Bill or the 1991 Act can be made. We are committed to consultation as an essential part of the policy-making process. The Bill has emerged from the Henshaw review, which gave rise to a consultation on a White Paper. Both the Bill and the broader child maintenance redesign programme have been built on consultation with stakeholders and cannot possibly succeed without it&#151;both noble Lords acknowledged that. I can confirm that the department will consult stakeholders as it draws up draft regulations and the Secretary of State will ensure that the commission does likewise in line with the Cabinet Office code of practice on consultation. However, I am not convinced of the case for putting a consultation requirement in the Bill. In view of what I have said, I hope the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

These amendments are grouped so that we can consider a major new aspect of CMEC. We might call it its human aspect, which is intended to make it more than the money-extracting agency that the CSA was believed to have become. The CSA is not liked; more than that, it is resented. As a result, it has not succeeded in its role of administering child maintenance. I have tabled my amendment to ask the Minister what he considers child maintenance to be. On Tuesday, we had quite a

How much of it is a financial duty and how much an emotional duty? More specifically related to the debate in hand, how much of CMEC&#146;s role will be financial support for the parent and how much of it will be emotional support? Have the Government considered looking at the successful reformed Australian child support scheme as a precedent for our own currently unsuccessful scheme? Indeed, Amendment No. 40 acknowledges why the information and guidance facet of CMEC is needed.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para0">
<p><a name="08013172000167">The need to protect the parent with care is great, but in so doing, CMEC must not alienate the non-resident parent because if the latter believes that CMEC sees him or her only as a target from which to demand money, he or she will feel alienated from the agency and resentful towards it. The result will be coercion, not co-operation; which is far from ideal.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08013172000168">Only around one third of eligible families receive child maintenance in this country. In such a climate, where child maintenance is not valued, it is crucial to change child maintenance into something that is unquestioned and unchallenged. I know that is the Minister&#146;s hope. Clearly, that necessitates getting the non-resident parent on side. As we have heard, 95 per cent of them are fathers.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08013172000169">On Amendment No. 43, what does the Minister propose that the information and guidance suggested will be? If this is to be one of the obvious differences between CMEC and its predecessor, why is the new information and support service not even loosely defined in the Bill? A local and face-to-face service that is on hand for all parents is only going to make parents feel more consulted and included in the scheme. However, the Minister sent me&#151;and I am sure other noble Lords&#151;a letter on the appointment of Ventura some time ago. In it, he talked about Ventura operating from a central place, I think, in the north of England; I happen to think it is Sheffield, but I may have got that wrong. The point is that it will operate from a central place. If the inter-relationship with parents with care is going to be by e-mail, that does not matter at all, but if there are to be face-to-face interviews, it will have to set up some sort of local system to do that. There will not be many parents with care in the situation that we have been talking about who have the money to go from, say, Cornwall, up to Sheffield, or wherever in the north of England it happens to be. Clearly, it will have to set up some sort of subsidiary organisation.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000170">I hope that CMEC will be part of a large drive to help to improve the quality of life for Britain&#146;s children and Britain&#146;s struggling parents. That is why Amendment No. 48 is useful, because it points to how child maintenance, both financial and emotional, needs to harness all available resources. If HMG are so keen on joined-up government, why is that not in the Bill?</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08013172000351">&#147;The Commission must devote at least 15% of its total annual budget&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08013172000330">That is inflexible, and it is not always appropriate. The percentage of money to be devoted to this area cannot reasonably be decided until the commission is up and running; and it is likely to change from year to year. A figure plucked out of the sky, uncorroborated by practice, is dangerous because it either threatens unrealistic demands or sets too easy a goal. I beg to move.</p>

The lead amendment is key; but the others in the group deal with the essential area of advice and guidance. The amendments in this group in my name and that of my noble friend are all about trying to beef up, underline and emphasise the importance of getting the information and guidance right. There is a difference between information, guidance and advice, and I think we all understand the difference. Advice needs to be made available to people who are asking questions about what they should do in certain circumstances to be sure that they are getting the best opportunities to improve their life chances and those of their children. The question is how you do that and how you guide the commission to put those services in place.</p>

They are just as important as anyone else. From what I have seen and understand at the moment, I am not confident that that is guaranteed to happen unless we make it happen. Amendment No. 40 in my name and that of my noble friend addresses that question.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000175">Amendment No. 41 looks at what is information, what is guidance, what is to be provided, Ventura and all that. My experience with call centres is very clear. Where you are dealing with a client group, for example, in the Pensions Service, who have landlines, who are confident and who know what they are doing, they can sit at home with a glass of malt whisky in their hands and make arrangements. That is a perfect way for the service to be delivered. But I am  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC411"><b>31 Jan 2008 : Column GC411</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sure that there is a 10 or 15 per cent residue of clients in that category who will struggle to deal with telephones. A lot of them only have mobile phones; they only have pay-as-you-go SIM cards. Often, they have to resort to landlines&#151;God help them, BT land lines and the like&#151;to make contact. That is not an atmosphere conducive to public service delivery.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08013172000176">I understand that Ventura is merely the preferred contract bidder at the moment. It would help the Committee if the Minister explained a little more about what the envisaged contract may look like. We all know what a call centre looks like and we understand that the success or otherwise of call centres depends on how the scripts are worked up and how the professionals who are manning the call centres deal with unexpected questions, because there will be many. They will not just be about how the percentages add up or how the maintenance is calculated; they will get other questions as well. I wonder how the call centre can be configured to deal with the disadvantaged, those who are waiting in long queues outside Jobcentre Plus offices trying to access phones.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08013172000177">We have recently had debates about the Social Fund, where some of those real problems were raised. If we are not careful, we will end up condemning clients of the future service to real access difficulties through a call centre. I understand that the call centre is not the complete picture and that other services will be put in place. Contracts are being considered for those and the voluntary sector is being encouraged. It would be good to know what is the up-to-date situation there as well.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08013172000178">There is very clear evidence that clients have a very clear disposition and are much more comfortable in a face-to-face situation. The Minister knows that, because his own recently published research reports show it. Again with regard to the Australian experience, face-to-face interviews are particularly important for fathers. If we do not get a process put in place that is robust and looks after people, particularly non-resident parents who want to come to reconnect with their estranged children, the system will fail. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, is absolutely right that that requires a local dimension; it must not be delivered through Jobcentre Plus or any other HMRC offices. It must be done somewhere where people can feel comfortable. The location of the local service is important.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08013172000179">I was interested to read David Varney&#146;s recent report on transformational services. Some of this will be brigaded in the DWP, in terms of taking the government-wide agenda forward. The point that he made, which I found interesting, was that you do not actually always need buildings for local face-to-face contact. There may be&#151;I nearly said travelling circus; I do not mean that&#151;a peripatetic service that can be deployed. Perhaps there could even be some house visits. I am old enough to remember the days when social security services used to do house visits. You often learned a lot more from one of those visits than you do from any form filling, the internet or call centre contacts.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08013172000180">The local service, face-to-face and voluntary sector dimension to all this is critical to getting the information and guidance that the Government propose to where I want it to be&#151;which adds up to an advice service in all but name. Amendments Nos. 44 and 46 harp back to the mediation services and the prospect of a one-stop shop, where you can go through the door and, even if it cannot deal with all your needs, at least you will find someone who is intelligent and well trained enough and has the back-up to be able to signpost you to where you really need to be to get the guidance, advice or information that you need.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08013172000181">The penultimate amendment in my name and that of my noble friend takes a stab at 15 per cent of a budget devoted to mediation and advice. I have no idea how much that is or anything about it. I am trying to guess at a level below which it is not safe to fall. It is important as to command something like 15 per cent of the totality of the energy, finance and back-up procedures that the commission will need if it is to have any chance to get a really successful sensitive, face-to-face system that is intelligent in guiding parents of whatever kind, non-resident or with care, to where they want to be.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08013172000182">The final amendment refers in passing to the costs of telephony. The telephony in the agency has improved, which is welcome, but it is not fair to expect people to run up big telephone bills, as they may if they are using pay-as-you-go SIM cards on mobile phones. I should like some reassurance that whatever shape or form the guidance or information takes, it will not prejudice financially those who have no access to landlines or other means of making contact.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08013172000183">This is a big agenda. An enormous amount is covered in these amendments. If we get the subjects contained in this group of amendments right, the policy has a much better chance of succeeding. Contrariwise, if we do not, it is even more likely to fail.</p>

They would amend Clause 4, which places a duty on the commission to raise awareness among parents of the importance of taking responsibility for the maintenance of children and to make appropriate arrangements for securing that maintenance.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para16">
<p><a name="08013172000185">The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, pressed again on definitions of maintenance. We had quite a wide-ranging discussion around that on Tuesday. The statutory system is very much geared to financial support. The Government are not saying that that is the end of maintenance and responsibilities; it is a much wider issue than that, as we discussed on Tuesday. The maintenance arrangements we are talking about here are concerned with the provision of finance and facilities if they are voluntary arrangements. Of course emotional support ought to be an integral part of supporting parents and that is what we would encourage both parents to provide for their children, but that emotional part is specifically, directly and deliberately not part of the Bill.</p>

What happens when you have a parent with care who is exploding in tears down the telephone because they have had threats of being battered by their former partner? There will inevitably be an emotional aspect, for want of a better word, to the advice service. The question is: how will that be delivered?</p>

<p><a name="08013172000187"><b><a name="80131-gc0005.htm_spnew3"><a name="08013172000422">Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> To be clear, I am not in any way suggesting that the emotional turmoil that arises from the breakdown of relationships will not be a common feature of the situations that the information and support service and the commission will have to face. The information and support service will have to engage with that; in some measure, by signposting to other voluntary organisations or to mediation. It will be part of the wider picture that the Department for Children, Schools and Families is leading on, and I shall come to that in just a moment. I shall hold on to the point that when we are talking about maintenance in the context of the Bill, that is geared to financial support.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08013172000188">Two amendments to Clause 4 have been tabled. Amendment No. 39 would remove the commission&#146;s ability to raise awareness among parents of the importance of taking responsibility for the maintenance of their children. We cannot accept the amendment because it aims to remove one of the two interlocking elements underpinning the promotion of the new package of reforms. I understand that in a sense it was a probing amendment. If the commission is to successfully empower parents it must have the ability to raise general awareness, understanding and acceptance about the importance of parents recognising their own personal responsibility for financially supporting their children, as well as promoting understanding of the ways that can be done. The amendment would prevent the commission from raising general awareness.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08013172000189">Amendment No. 40 would place a duty on the commission to demonstrate that it has taken steps to engage both non-resident parents and parents with care equally in any awareness-raising campaigns that it runs. I reassure the noble Lord that I have sympathy with the principle underlying the amendment, but I do not think it necessary. We have deliberately cast the clause broadly and used the word &#147;parents&#148; precisely because we recognise that the commission must have the power to promote the importance of child maintenance to all parents in society to meet its central objective. The amendment will also constrain the commission from running targeted campaigns, which could lead to an imbalance in the level of engagement with particular groups of parents and would force the commission either to drop campaigns or to run additional, less necessary campaigns to ensure that it was achieving that balance. For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08013172000190">The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, rightly raised the point about how this will serve non-resident parents as well as parents with care, an extremely important issue. One of the ways it will seek to engage them is through awareness-raising campaigns targeted at non-resident parents. If we had to do everything equally at every stage, that would be a distraction. I

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para20">
<p><a name="08013172000191">Clause 5 places a duty on the commission to provide parents with the necessary information and support to help them choose, make and keep effective maintenance arrangements while providing some basic information and signposting on a wider range of issues as part of that process. Ten amendments have been tabled to this clause, and I will address each in turn.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para21">
<p><a name="08013172000192">I have assumed that Amendments Nos. 41 and 42 are trying to prevent the commission from providing a limited information and support service for parents, and that Amendment No. 43 has been tabled to ensure that the commission is committed in legislation to providing certain key products as part of the information and support service. The amendments are helpful because they give me an opportunity to set out in a little more detail our thinking on some of the key aspects of the information and support service that we expect the commission to provide at the outset.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para22">
<p><a name="08013172000193">At present, there is no dedicated service providing parents with impartial information about the child maintenance options that are available to them; yet ensuring that parents can make an informed choice underpins the success or failure of the new system. The current absence of information and support reduces our prospects of realising our objectives, reduces our prospects of putting child poverty at the centre of the reform programme and increases the chances that low-income families will end up making no arrangement at all.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para23">
<p><a name="08013172000194">So we expect the commission to provide a comprehensive new service that will reach out to newly separating families on low incomes and will be delivered through three channels: a national contact centre, a web-based online service and a face-to-face support service. We expect that those services will be nationally available from around October this year, having tested elements of the service through prototyping prior to that point.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08013172000195">At present, we anticipate that the national contact centre will be the primary channel through which the commission will provide parents with information about child maintenance. Although parents will be able to contact the service independently through a freephone number, we are also working closely with Jobcentre Plus and HMRC to enable the commission to ensure that separating parents on low incomes can be identified and referred to the information and support service. Such proactive contact is particularly important given the removal of compulsion, and strong evidence that personal communication with this client group can greatly improve outcomes, for example in a welfare-to-work context.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para25">
<p><a name="08013172000196">As announced on Monday 14 January, the department has entered into a contract with Ventura to start to develop and run a national contact centre. Ventura has significant experience working with the public sector, through initiatives such as the pension credit application line. I think it is in Rotherham rather than Sheffield; each is north of Luton.</p>




<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC415"><b>31 Jan 2008 : Column GC415</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para26">
<p><a name="08013172000197">We expect information and support service agents to receive comprehensive training developed in conjunction with the voluntary sector and other government departments enabling them effectively to identify parents&#146; information needs. This will enable national contact centre staff to provide parents with the appropriate information on a range of issues, including the child maintenance options available to them, what those options mean in practice, how to negotiate with an ex-partner, how maintenance affects other benefits and tax credits and a child maintenance estimate of the level of maintenance that a parent would be expected to pay or receive under the statutory scheme. Agents would also help parents to understand what support would be available and their rights and responsibilities under the statutory scheme. Agents would not be expected to directly support parents needing CSA case-specific detail, however, such as the action that the statutory scheme has been taking to secure non-resident parent debts.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para27">
<p><a name="08013172000198">We also want to ensure that the commission supports parents to act on the decisions that they make&#151;for example, by ensuring that parents can be passed across to the statutory maintenance service where that option is preferred. In addition, we expect that the national contact centre will provide parents who are interested in a voluntary arrangement with tools, such as a standard maintenance form, to guide them through constructing and agreeing their own arrangements. This form will also act as a record for parents to review and maintain their voluntary arrangement. We expect this service to be large-scale, potentially supporting 500,000 parents a year.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para28">
<p><a name="08013172000199">As I outlined earlier, we recognise that some parents will need additional support to understand their child maintenance options. Evidence strongly suggests that a face-to-face service will be needed to ensure that parents have access to that level of support. We plan to provide that service where a specific need for more personalised support is identified. We need to ensure that there is not just nominal access to the information and support service but real access for those who cannot do so via a contact centre.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para29">
<p><a name="08013172000200">Research shows that many parents, particularly fathers, prefer to access online services for information. For that reason we expect that the commission will make available a comprehensive website that will provide online information about child maintenance options. It will also include electronic copies of all the information and support guides, leaflets and the standard maintenance form. We also expect that the commission will provide an e-mail function so that parents can receive information without having to contact the telephone service.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para30">
<p><a name="08013172000201">Research shows that during the process of separation parents often have a number of issues to address in addition to child maintenance, such as those that we touched on earlier. We are keen to ensure that the commission is able to respond to parents who raise wider separation issues during their discussions. We are already working with the voluntary sector and other government departments to ensure that the information and support service can provide parents with a basic level of information or can signpost parents to more specialist help on the key areas that

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para31">
<p><a name="08013172000202">In light of that, Amendments Nos. 41 and 42 are unnecessary as, in practice, we have every intention of providing a comprehensive and personalised service to both parents. Amendments Nos. 43 and 50 are also unnecessary, for two reasons. First, we fully expect the commission to provide virtually all those elements as part of the overall service, even without a direct mention in legislation. Secondly, we would not want legislation to force the commission to provide particular products and services to parents because future research may well show that those tools proved unhelpful in practice.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0005.htm_para32">
<p><a name="08013172000203">Amendments Nos. 44 and 46 would commit the information and support service to raising the profile of family mediation services and how they can help parents reach effective maintenance arrangements as well as dealing with non-maintenance issues. We are currently working with the Ministry of Justice and looking to put in place referral arrangements to the family mediation helpline. That should ensure that parents accessing the information and support service can be quickly linked across to local mediators where appropriate. I am happy to confirm that we will be letting people know about mediation and how it can help.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para0">
<p><a name="08013172000204">Amendment No. 45 would restrict the provision of information and support given to parents to child maintenance issues only. I agree that the commission needs to focus its service on helping parents to make financial arrangements for their children. However, evidence shows that separating parents have to deal with clusters of problems and, as such, it is important that the commission is not prevented from offering some degree of support on the wider issues that often get in the way of their making financial arrangements for their children. We therefore do not accept that amendment.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08013172000205">Amendment No. 48 would provide the commission with the power to provide information and guidance in conjunction with public bodies or departments that deliver family breakdown services. The amendment is unnecessary because there is nothing in Clause 5 or any other part of the Bill that would prevent the commission from providing its services alongside other public bodies. In addition, Clause 7 goes even further than that by enabling the commission to carry out work on behalf of other government departments or public bodies and vice versa. We genuinely believe that the suggested amendment is unnecessary to achieve the noble Lord&#146;s aim.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08013172000206">Amendment No. 49 would commit the commission to spending at least 15 per cent of its total annual budget on the provision of information and support services. I assure the Committee that we are clear about the critical role the information and support service can play in helping the commission realise all its objectives. In light of the importance of the service, sums have been clearly allocated to ensure that a robust and comprehensive service is put in place. Our approach towards agreeing the commission&#146;s finances will be dynamic and linked to its achievement of

It will not be based around compelling the commission to apportion certain funds towards any particular aspect of its business. We therefore cannot accept the amendment, and I think the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, was of the same view.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08013172000207">I hope that I have made it clear how important I believe the information and support service to be in supporting low income parents, in particular, into effective arrangements supporting our child poverty objectives. In doing so, I hope that I have addressed and provided assurance on the issues raised by Amendments Nos. 39 to 50.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08013172000208">On the more specific questions raised, the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, referred to the expense of telephones. There will be a freephone number and call centre agents can call back anyone who asks. Low-income parents using a Jobcentre Plus or HMRC can be contacted directly via that source. The noble Lord also raised interesting questions on the scripts for Ventura. Obviously, we are engaging the voluntary sector on that, which will be an important part of the service. I emphasise again that this service has to be available for both non-resident parents and parents with care.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08013172000209">The face-to-face service will need to be local so that it is properly available. We are looking at how that service can be built and, moving forward, how the voluntary sector can be engaged in that. I am very keen and very clear that we need to have a robust and sufficient face-to-face service in place by the time Section 6 compulsion is removed. That will be a critical point in the development of the new system. Having said that, I hope that the noble Lord will be reassured and feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

That is an extremely good idea. I declare an interest as a patron of a Welsh child contact centre. I hope that the Minister appreciates how many of these child contact centres are in danger of not staying open. I am a governor of Coram, which is closing its child contact centre in March because it does not make any money. The Government, in the DCSF, are very good at providing for the opening of child contact centres and helping to fund them for three years, but they are not good at continuing them. The Minister&#146;s department might like to encourage the DCSF to help contact centres to remain open for the very valuable extra service that they might provide. I thought that the Minister should know that a lot of contact centres are in real danger of closing down.</p>

In that letter, he referred to Ventura providing face-to-face facilities, as far as I can remember. If I am wrong, I apologise, and I am sure that we will have discussions later.</p>

We are looking to see initially how staff internally can be involved in providing that face-to-face service.

I am not encouraged by what the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, has just said about mediation centres, but I was interested in what the Minister said about child centres being built around the country. There is also the opportunity to use various voluntary organisations and, I assume, Citizens Advice would fit into this too, which would not exist without government subsidy. It is virtually entirely paid for by the Government. I think we agree that face-to-face bears no relation to phone-to-phone. There is no doubt about that.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000216">Ventura has been doing an advice service for the Pension Service for some time and I understand that the Pension Service is more than happy with the advice that it is giving. Is it not true to say that pension credit take-up, although it has improved slightly recently, is nothing that the Government can write home about? One would have thought that part of Ventura&#146;s remit would be to encourage that.

<p><a name="08013172000226">The noble Lord said: We now turn to the question of contracting out. The amendment is in my name and that of my noble friend, and it deals with a vexed question. I have mixed views about contracting out, which is probably reflected in the shape of the amendment. I did this all before Christmas. I was worried, first, about the state of mind of the staff, who the last time I had anything directly to do with them&#151;at a much earlier stage&#151;were extremely concerned about exactly what was going to happen to them. The amendment was tabled so that I would have a guaranteed slot to make representations and seek assurances from the Minister that members of staff were being properly kept advised of what the Government and the commission may have in mind in relation to the exercise of these powers.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08013172000227">The question in Amendment No. 56 deals with the assurance that might be provided by independent audits before any such powers were made use of. Amendment No. 57 looks at the prospect of getting regulations laid in advance of any contracting-out provisions being enacted. David Henshaw made great play on the question of opting out. His concept was that the commission would be a commissioning body and not very much more than that. I see the force of that argument, in that there should be a dedicated professional service which should be efficient above all else, delivering the level of service that the parents with care, in particular, would expect. But for my money, although I am a bit ambivalent about it, I think that it should still be a public service in its essence. That does not mean to say that at the margins

That is a small niche activity that could conceivably be considered sensibly for contracting-out.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para16">
<p><a name="08013172000228">The evidence that we have to date, such as the debt collection service, some of which we have privatised, had an early flush of success when the bailiffs&#146; letters started coming through front doors. But although the Minister may say that it is too early to judge, and I might be prepared to accept that, the early results are not good in terms of collection rates for arrears that have been put into the private service for debt collection. In that regard, the move towards privatisation has not been demonstrably more successful than the professionals who are already working hard, have the experience and know what they are doing in the agency.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08013172000229">Another example is the experience of Vertex in Bolton, which was set up as a great experiment. The private sector was going to bring in efficiency savings and David Henshaw, rather naively, seemed to think that all you needed was a professional money collection service. In other parts of the commercial world, they are demonstrably more successful than the Child Support Agency, but that naively ignores the determination of this client group&#151;namely, non-resident parents&#151;to avoid the responsibilities at every conceivable point, in some cases. It is a minority but they are a dedicated minority, and there are some who feel so strongly about what they are being asked to pay that they will go to any lengths, including going to jail, to try to avoid their responsibilities. The Henshaw analysis ignores that dimension of that tricky problem.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08013172000230">With the Vertex experience of running the Bolton centre, looking at stuck and manual cases, the information that I have from people working with and within that centre is that the experience has not been a happy one. The stuck cases are still stuck and the manual cases are still manual, and the really difficult ones tend to come back to the people who really know what they are doing at the regional centres. That is what I am told. Again, that may be the early experience. Maybe it is early days, and if we are patient this may all work out in the long run and privatisation will prove its worth. If I was a professional working within the agency, I do not think that I would have any confidence, given the experience that I am aware of to date, that privatisation helps. The Minister may say that this is all up to the commission. That is his fallback defence for everything. The commission can look at this, and maybe it will and maybe it will not.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08013172000231">For my money, I would want clear demonstrations that the privatisation powers in the provisions could effect significant step changes in the service levels before I had got anywhere near them. Why? It is because it demotivates the professionals already in the service who are doing this job against very difficult odds and providing a dedicated public service. The fact that they are public servants is important to them. The fact that this work can be taken away from them and given to people who in their opinion do not

<p><a name="08013172000232">I am absolutely prepared to be attacked again by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, for having technically incompetent, or whatever, amendments. I do not care about that. The important thing is that the subject is raised and that it is understood by the commission that if it is to be given this power it can only be used very carefully, if at all, and it can be used only where it is going to demonstrate evident efficiencies that are clear for all to see. If we do not do that, we risk ticking off the whole body of staff&#151;and they do not deserve that because they have been working so hard for so long to try to keep the service going through some very difficult times.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para21">
<p><a name="08013172000233">The issue is not the wording or the defence of the fine print of the amendment, it is the very important issue of sending a clear signal not just to those non-resident parents who are in the main eliding the service, but also to the staff that they are not going to be second-guessed by private contractors who really do not know what they are doing and who create messes which the public servants in the service then have to spend time clearing up. It is against that background that I move Amendment No. 47. I beg to move.</p>

On Amendments Nos. 54 and 55, I should like to ask the Minister for clarity. Clause 7 concerns agency arrangements between the commission and any &#147;relevant authority&#148;. What is that relevant authority? The Minister may point me to its apparent definition in Clause 7(4), but I still remain unclear. The relevant authority may be,</p>
<ul><a name="08013172000359">&#147;a public body specified in regulations&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08013172000331">That is not a definition. It may be a diversion, but it is not a very good one. I do not wish to remind the Minister that ambiguity in legislation is never a good thing because it often leads to confusion and, more dangerously, misinterpretation.</p>

On Amendments Nos. 54 and 55, which relate to agency arrangements, perhaps I may explain why we have included agency arrangement provisions in the Bill. As a statutory body, the commission will have only the powers conferred on it by statute. The provisions under Clause 7 allow the commission to set up closer working arrangements with other public bodies. A current example is the co-operation between the Child Support Agency and its counterpart in Northern Ireland. Looking forward, the commission might decide to work with the Department for Children, Schools and Families as part of a wider initiative to provide information to parents, which we have just debated. The agency arrangement provisions would enable, for example, other departments to provide child maintenance

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para22">
<p><a name="08013172000236">I am not sure that it is possible to put the definition of the words &#147;relevant authority&#148; much clearer than in Clause 7(4), the provision to which the noble Baroness directed me. There is clarity and the interpretation of that provision would be well understood. Amendments Nos. 56 and 57 seek to prevent the commission from contracting out work unless two criteria have been met; namely, that Parliament has given approval to the detailed provisions of the contract and that an independent audit has first been performed to ensure that contracting out represents long-term value for money.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para23">
<p><a name="08013172000237">I now turn to issues relating to staff at the CSA. I shall use this opportunity to endorse what the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said. Like him, I have visited a number of centres and have always been impressed by the professionalism, dedication and commitment of the staff at the CSA. On my first ministerial visit about a year ago, I did not expect it to be like that, given the difficult backdrop that the CSA has encountered in the popular press. So I take this opportunity to give credit and to acknowledge that work that it has done.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08013172000238">On Amendments Nos. 56 and 57, I believe that the noble Lord seeks to ensure that future contracts contain robust provisions that will lead to successful, efficient delivery and provide adequate redress for poor performance. Those are important points, but I do not believe the proposed amendments are the best way to achieve those goals. This Bill makes it clear that the responsibility for efficiently and effectively discharging functions rests with the commission even if those functions are contracted out. As such, the commission is already bound by this Bill to ensure that any decision to contract out represents value for money; and it will be a priority for the commission to make sure that the terms of any contract are rigorous enough to enable them to ensure effective performance.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para25">
<p><a name="08013172000239">In order to meet this legal requirement, in the initial stages of considering whether one of its functions should be contracted out, the commission will undertake a comprehensive review of those functions. Value for money is one of the standard criteria for such a review and would always be taken into consideration. If the commission decides to contract work out, it would have to adhere to government procurement rules which require any government procurement exercise to be open, fair and transparent. They also require that, when evaluating any response to a tender, one of the main criteria should be whether the contract would provide value for money.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para26">
<p><a name="08013172000240">I recognise that this does not add up to a full independent audit of any decision to contract out. However, in view of the safeguards already in place we consider that such a requirement would be unnecessary. On occasion, the commission may contract out work of a very low value. It may do so to assess the benefits that a larger scale exercise could bring. Having to complete a full, independent audit beforehand would not represent an effective use of taxpayers&#146; money. However, for significant outsourcing we might expect

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para27">
<p><a name="08013172000241">With reference to Amendment No. 57, it is also difficult to see how the process of laying contractual terms before Parliament would work in practice. Contractual terms are often commercially confidential and it would not be appropriate to subject these to the public scrutiny given to affirmative regulations. As we have discussed, the commission will be led by an independent board which is expert in what it does. I believe it is the body best placed to determine appropriate terms of individual contracts and will bring in any expert advice it feels that it needs. Surely, Parliament&#146;s role is to hold the Secretary of State to account for the overall performance of the commission. It is supported in doing so by the comprehensive reporting requirements set out in Clause 9, which will cover any functions contracted out. In light of this, and given the importance of agency arrangements in helping to make joined-up work across the public sector possible, I urge the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0006.htm_para28">
<p><a name="08013172000242">Picking up on a couple of specific points that the noble Lord raised about where contracting out has occurred, we know that the Vertex experience was a challenge, certainly initially, but we should recognise that contracting out clerical cases to the private sector&#151;Vertex in Bolton&#151;is already helping to get more money to more children. Since December 2006, Vertex has arranged and collected more than &#163;30 million in maintenance payments. This is the first time that one of the department&#146;s agencies has contracted out core work on this scale and, as with any significant change, some areas have not progressed as smoothly as wanted. Clearly, the lessons from that need to be learnt and factored into any future proposals for contracting. On contracting out to debt collection agencies, &#163;9.3 million has been collected, so that is making a real contribution to getting more money for more children. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

What other departments might be involved depends on how the commission draws up its business plan and its corporate plan, and how that all fits together.

Quite rightly, it would largely focus on government departments because of the importance of cross-government work in this area. I mentioned the engagement with Northern Ireland. Child support arrangements are dealt with separately in Northern Ireland, but work is provided there on behalf, particularly, of the eastern region of the CSA. There is access to the systems of the CSA, and that might be one example. However, I do not think that that would be a public body, but a government department.

I have two queries. First, the commission will have such a difficult birth and early period before it gets into a stable state, if it ever does. I am prepared to believe that the work done in Bolton, such as it is, and the work that the debt collectors have done, such as that is, has helped a little, but I do not think that that is the point. The question is whether the public servants in other parts of the system, having been tasked with a certain amount of work, get the same results with less effort, less energy and less expense. That is still an open question.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0007.htm_para0">
<p><a name="08013172000252">If the commission goes heavily into contracting out at an early stage, it will have so many other fronts on which to fight that I do not think that would be advisable. I would like from the Minister, during the passage of this legislation, some sense of what the Government believe should be done. Of course, I understand that you do not set up a commission and then do everything for it. His default defence is that this is a matter for the commission. However, the Government must have some idea whether to go for the Henshaw model, which was strictly a commissioning body stripped down and doing nothing but arranging contracts and ensuring that they work, or whether to stay with a model that is more embedded in the public service. The department must have some view about that. It need not be a definitive or final view, but rather than leave all this with such a wide variation, with the potential to unsettle the confidence of the existing staff, at some stage we need a clearer idea of what the Government have in mind. I am prepared to be patient and to wait, but we shall need to press for further and better particulars under the heading of contracting out in future.

<p><a name="08013172000261">The noble Lord said: Clause 6 deals with fees. Amendment No. 51 attempts to say that unless the service is going to be dramatically improved, why are fees being charged of people who are trying to get payments? I have had considerable briefing, which I could go through at length, but the gist of much of it is that if the fees are charged to the parent who is looking after the child, is not that a disincentive to use the service? That is a danger, and we need some clarification of that. Here we are talking about people for whom every penny counts. Can we have a clarification about the intention and some guarantee that this will not happen? It is very worrying.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0007.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08013172000262">In Amendment No. 51, we are asking for &#147;a satisfactory service&#148;. I hope that the Minister does not take this as any kind of affront, but it is not unreasonable to ask for a satisfactory service. At the moment, people do not perceive the Government to have a moral right to charge a fee for this service. There are a variety of historical reasons for that, and I do not know who gets the most blame, but that is an unproductive game. They have effectively failed. We do not know what is going on with the new commission. Can we have an idea of what fee will be charged and how much pressure might be applied to charge fees to parents with care? I beg to move.</p>

It is a rather sensible amendment, because it prevents the commission xharging fees until it is properly up and running and has proved itself as a body that is both efficient and effective. The Minister must surely agree that if a failing body starts demanding fees from parents it will do considerable damage to the reputation of the British system&#146;s ability to provide and protect. More pertinently, is it fair to charge parents for a service that is not being adequately delivered?</p>

Our worry from this side of the Committee is much the same as that registered by the noble Lord, Lord Addington. We know very little about these fees, such as how much and, indeed, even more importantly, what are they for? These questions could go on and on and Clause 6 does not answer them. My Amendment No. 52 is an attempt to learn in a bit more detail from the Minister&#151;if he can give

I realise that every instance cannot be spelt out, but surely we need some precedent to act as a safeguard against the commission unreasonably charging the parents to come to it for help.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0007.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08013172000265">Amendment No. 53 would bar the charging of fees for parents with care who wish to use the statutory scheme. Sir David Henshaw&#146;s original plans for child support reform envisaged the use of fees as a way of disincentivising parents from using the statutory scheme and thereby encouraging involuntary arrangements. As I mentioned earlier, this Bill persistently places voluntary arrangements over statutory schemes. I do not agree with this; I think that the situation should be pari passu. The Bill does not recognise that there is a significant number of non-resident parents who will avoid paying maintenance until they realise that the parent with care will bring in the state to enforce this obligation. The state is invaluable as the bailiff, as it were, for the parent with care, when they have nobody to turn to, and it is naïve and over-optimistic to think that voluntary agreements are always possible. Why seek to deter a parent from using what is clearly going to be&#151;or at least we all hope that it will be&#151;a very valuable service indeed.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0007.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08013172000266">The Minister&#151;and I think that it was the noble Lord, Lord Bach, the same Minister as we have here today, although my memory may again be faulty as it has been shown to be already this afternoon&#151;gave evidence in one of the first two evidence sessions in July of the Select Committee studying this Bill in another place. He said that the thinking behind charging is not to use the system unnecessarily if it can be avoided and if it is not appropriate. It is not a direct quote, because there is a gap in the middle, but I hope that it is a fair summary of what he intended to say even if he did not actually say it. In his rose-tinted world of child maintenance, the noble Lord ignores the possibility or rather the likelihood that there may be a conflict of view between the non-resident parent and the parent with care regarding the former&#146;s willingness to pay child maintenance and whether he will pay amounts on a regular basis. The recent DWP report supports that argument really rather clearly.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000267">The <I>Survey of Relationship Breakdown and Child Maintenance: Interim Report</I>, which has already been referred to in debates&#151;DWP research report No. 468&#151;documented that while 54 per cent of non-resident parents using the CSA thought parents should make voluntary child maintenance arrangements, only 22 per cent of parents with care using the CSA thought the same thing. There are clearly two different views there, and those differences are going to be reflected in reality and what actually happens on the ground. There is even more reinforcement in the report going on to say that the 54 per cent of parents with care using the CSA thought that child maintenance should be arranged by a government agency, compared to only 28 per cent of non-resident parents. We should not be shy of recognising that it is often, although not always, the parent with care who struggles financially and emotionally with the duty of looking after their child. This amendment is appropriate because it makes

<a name="80131-gc0007.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08013172000269">I recognise the concerns that have been raised, and I am grateful for the opportunity to offer, I hope, some reassurance. I turn first to Amendment No. 51. The Government recognise the importance of ensuring that any fees charged do not dissuade vulnerable or low-income parents from applying to the commission in the first place. Indeed, that was made clear in the White Paper, <I>A New System of Child Maintenance</I>, which stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="08013172000363">&#147;the clear burden of charging should fall on the non-resident parent and not the parent with care&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80131-gc0007.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08013172000270">Charges could be incurred for a number of reasons. Most of these, such as penalties for late payment and enforcement measures, could fall only to the non-resident parent. However, there may be a few situations where allowing the commission to charge a fee to both the person with care and the non-resident parent could provide it with a valuable tool to help achieve its objectives. For example, where appropriate, it might be possible to envisage a small application fee, which might encourage both parents to consider whether a voluntary arrangement might be more effective for them. Such a fee is already the case in a number of child maintenance systems around the world and could be waived for those on benefits and low income.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0007.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08013172000271">By way of reassurance, the details of any charging regime will be subject to the commission&#146;s overarching objective, which is to maximise the number of effective maintenance arrangements in place. Any decision the commission makes about fees must be made within the context of that objective, and it will be as concerned as we are not to dissuade vulnerable parents applying to the statutory maintenance scheme.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0007.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08013172000272">We also believe that it is important to recognise that the correct charging regime, properly designed and applied, could play a pivotal role in helping the commission to achieve this overarching objective; for instance, by incentivising non-resident parents to supply information to the commission, and to meet their parental responsibilities regularly and on time. In other words, charging could be an integral part of the new scheme rather than an add-on once the scheme is up and running.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0007.htm_para16">
<p><a name="08013172000273">However, Amendment No. 53 would prevent the commission charging fees until its services have been assessed as satisfactory. We have said all along that it should be the commission who decides the details of any charging scheme. That will include when charging should start. We do not want to hamper the commission at this stage, by restricting how it is able to use this key part of its toolkit.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0007.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08013172000274">Members of the Committee may find it reassuring that we do not intend any charges to be introduced until the launch of the new scheme in 2010 at the earliest. By that time we will have made a number of changes to the existing schemes, such as stronger enforcement powers. The success of those changes, together with the overall performance of the schemes will, of course, provide the context in which the commission will advise the Secretary of State on charging, and the context in which the Secretary of State will take decisions. Importantly, the business case for the reforms does not depend on any income from charging. Furthermore, the regulations required to introduce any charges will be subject to the affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0007.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08013172000275">Whether a service is &#147;satisfactory&#148; remains a subjective measure, but I am sure that the Committee will agree that in any assessment of the commission, a key performance indicator will be how successfully it is meeting its key objectives. I am sure that Parliament will have this, and the commission&#146;s performance in mind when scrutinising the regulations, and will also ensure that any proposed charges meet the needs of the most vulnerable parents.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0007.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08013172000276">I would like to touch briefly on Amendment No. 52. The amendment would remove subsection (3) from Clause 6, which highlights that the commission may charge fees not related to the actual cost of carrying out its functions. There is a simple reason for including such provision. Without it, based on Treasury definitions, it could be presumed that &#147;fees&#148; means a charge directly related to actual administration costs.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0007.htm_para20">
<p><a name="08013172000277">However, as we have already discussed, fees will not be purely for cost recovery purposes. The fee structure could provide a key tool in incentivising parents to meet their responsibilities on time. To achieve this and, just as importantly, to ensure that fees are fair and transparent, the commission might want to charge, for example, a percentage of maintenance owed. Subsection (3) makes clear that such charges are within the scope of Clause 6. I hope that has been a sufficient explanation as to where we are in our thinking on fees. There will be opportunity in due course for affirmative regulations, but in any event it is not proposed to introduce any charges before 2010.</p>

There is a meeting of minds here, at least in direction. Can the Minister confirm that there is a degree of consensus? We have to see how the system is constructed; it will be done in phases; and it must go through a series of approvals. That is what he said; that is correct. So the objectives of Amendment No. 51 are certainly not a hundred miles away from his speech.</p>

I was going to go on to say that it will be done against the backdrop of the annual report that must be made to the Secretary of State and laid before Parliament, so that when the regulations come before Parliament, Parliament will have an opportunity to consider them in the context of the performance achieved. I should have thought that the commission would not want to revert to the experience of the early or mid-1990s, when a charging structure was in place on a more limited basis, I think, that could never be successfully implemented because there was no confidence in how the CSA was operating. That pretty much follows, but I do not want what I said to be misunderstood.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000297">The noble Lord said: The amendments are intended to improve the provisions in the Bill that relate to the commission's annual report to the Secretary of State. The Opposition always ask for reports&#151;and the Minister has heard me ask for them on several occasions before now. This Bill predicates having a report, so I do not feel embarrassed asking about it and suggesting what I believe would be some very real improvements to it. It is important to get these mechanisms right. Strengthening the way in which progress is monitored is essential in ensuring that this new body is truly accountable for its efforts&#151;its successes as well as its failures. Both the Secretary of State and Parliament need to know about both of those.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0008.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08013172000298">The amendments that we have tabled are an attempt to do precisely that and to make the provisions for reporting more robust and transparent. Amendments Nos. 58 and 65 relate to the timing of the report. Amendment No. 58 tidies up the language to ensure that the report comes at the end of the first complete year of the commission&#146;s activities. At the moment, the Bill gives precious little guidance as to when the first report is likely to come.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0008.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08013172000299">Amendment No. 65 places a duty on the Secretary of State to lay the report before Parliament within one month of receiving it. That might be regarded as a slightly eccentric idea but it is necessary to ensure that what takes priority in the presentation of the report is its content and not, perhaps, its political implications. In drafting that amendment I have been generous to the Government; I should have thought that a fortnight would be quite long enough to concentrate their mind before laying it before Parliament. However, as the Bill stands, the Secretary of State could choose any time that he or she liked to present the report to Parliament, waiting until it would not be noticed to report bad news&#151;perhaps on the last day before a parliamentary recess. That has happened. Or he or she may use potentially good news to mask another failure. I hope that that would never be the intention but it is important to remove as far as possible the chance of politicising the commission&#146;s or even appearing to do so. The report must be scrutinised for what it contains, thus placing a duty on the Secretary of State to present it to Parliament promptly, which relieves him of even appearing to choose his timing based on political expediency and goes a long way to ensuring that the report receives the sort of attention that it deserves.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0008.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08013172000300">The other amendments in this group refer to the contents of the report. We feel very strongly that the report should flag up the details of complaints that the commission might have received and how they were dealt with. We understand that creating an agency that will be truly effective is a dynamic process. The Minister has talked in the past two days about stages in this operation that has already started. Inevitably,  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC432"><b>31 Jan 2008 : Column GC432</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>however, there will be bedding down&#151;and bedding down means some problems initially, which one hopes will not go on for too long but will certainly be there in the first two years. Thus if the commission is to be effective there must be a sensitivity to the problems that may arise. By including complaints in the report, the commission is made more accountable&#151;but it also serves as a way in which to shed light on areas that can be improved.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0008.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08013172000301">This part of the Bill allows the commission to empower any of its employees or other authorities to exercise its duties. Authorising employees of the commission to carry out its functions would certainly be a necessary tool in effective implementation, but it is still important to assess whether these authorised agencies are actually meeting the goals that they were assigned to meet. Essentially this is a point about responsibility. We understand that effective management demands empowering other bodies to execute some duties, but the responsibility must ultimately lie with the commission. Thus we propose that the report should include an assessment of the commission&#146;s attempt to meet not only its overall goals but the goals of the bodies that the commission has empowered. Our interest here is in making the report paint the most accurate portrait possible of the progress of the commission&#146;s efforts. The more that we understand about its work and impact, the better placed we will be to improve its effect.</p>

The quarterly statistics enable us to look at developing trends in the performance of the agency in a way that an annual report cannot, so they are not mutually exclusive; they are complementary.

If we are going to have a meaningful annual report, getting a regular annual update on the outstanding client debt, the steps taken to recover it and an estimation of their success or otherwise will be essential. I concur with what the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said, and I hope that the Minister will also consider the suggestions in the amendments tabled in our names.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000306"><b><a name="80131-gc0008.htm_spnew1"><a name="08013172000456">Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> The amendments in this group provide a helpful opportunity to discuss issues around the annual report and Clause 9. This is a standard clause in the founding legislation of non-departmental public bodies and places a number of specific reporting requirements on the commission. Subject to the passage of the Bill, the commission will come into being later in 2008. It is our intention that the first annual report will cover the period from the commencement of the commission to the end of the financial year and then each complete financial year thereafter. That would bring the reporting cycle into line with that of other NDPBs and, indeed, other corporate bodies. Furthermore, it keeps the annual report in line with the period that will be covered by the annual accounts, which must cover financial years. </p>

<a name="80131-gc0008.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08013172000307">Amendment No. 58 requires that these two key reports cover different periods and would run against Treasury guidelines. Perhaps more importantly, it would hinder the ability of stakeholders, particularly Parliament, to scrutinise the commission and monitor the efficiency and effectiveness with which it is performing its functions.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0008.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08013172000308">That brings me to Amendment No. 59, which I think is intended to probe the meaning behind Clause 9(3)(c). Noble Lords will be aware that Clause 3 places a statutory requirement on the commission to exercise its functions effectively and efficiently. As such, we have provided through subsection 3(c) of Clause 9 that the commission must report on the steps taken to monitor its performance in that respect. Amendment No. 59 removes that requirement, but I hope to convince noble Lords of its importance. While reporting on objectives and targets, as required by subsection 3(b), is very much about what the commission has achieved, this subsection of the clause requires the commission to report on how it has been working. It requires that the commission details the steps it is taking to monitor how it is exercising its functions, specifically how it is assuring itself that it is doing so in a way that is both effective and efficient; in other words, to prove that it is providing value for money for the taxpayer. In light of that, I believe that this amendment would remove a requirement from the annual report that is important for proper parliamentary scrutiny of the commission.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0008.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08013172000309">Amendment No. 60 inserts a requirement to report on the details of any complaints received and how they were dealt with. I fully understand the reasoning behind this amendment. However, in subsection 3(c) the Bill already places a requirement upon the commission to report the steps taken to monitor its performance in ensuring that all its functions are exercised effectively and efficiently. As with all public bodies, customer  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC434"><b>31 Jan 2008 : Column GC434</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>service is important and that includes complaints handling. We have every intention that the commission will report its performance against any complaints targets set within the annual report, much as the Child Support Agency does now. We do not feel that that requires specific legislation. It is also our intention that the commission will take into account any of the recommendations made by the independent case examiner who will continue to produce an annual report on complaints received in the area of child support. There is also a requirement under Schedule 7 to the Bill for the commission to report on the standards achieved by the commission in decisions that can be appealed to an appeal tribunal. There is also a separate requirement for the president of the appeal tribunals to report on the standards of decision-making based on the cases that have come before appeal tribunals.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0008.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08013172000310">Amendment No. 62 raises the important issue of contracting out and inserts a requirement into the Bill to report on the extent to which organisations operating under contract to the commission are achieving their objectives. It is entirely proper that Parliament should be given the opportunity to scrutinise not only the extent to which the commission has contracted out functions, but also how effectively those functions are being performed. This is already provided for through Clause 9. Subsection (2) makes it clear that the commission must report on all its activities, including any activities contracted out. Subsection (3) then adds specific requirements. For example, subsection 3(b) requires the commission to report on the steps taken to meet its objectives and the progress made. Again, that must include the functions delivered by contractors.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0008.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08013172000311">This amendment goes beyond that and requires a specific report on the performance of each individual contractor. We are concerned that such a specific requirement could present difficulties, perhaps impinging on commercial confidentiality. For example, if potential contractors can see how existing contractors have performed, it would put the commission at a disadvantage in future contracting exercises. It is the commission&#146;s responsibility to deliver its functions efficiently and effectively regardless of how they are delivered. Clause 9 places comprehensive reporting requirements on the commission that, as I have made clear, will cover functions delivered by contractors and will therefore enable Parliament to hold the commission to account for its responsibilities.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0008.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08013172000312">I can understand the noble Lord&#146;s reasons for tabling Amendment No. 63. It places a specific requirement on the commission to report on the steps taken to recover outstanding debt and to detail its level of success in this area. We consider the collection of existing debt to be an extremely important function and we have provided for increased enforcement powers within the Bill to assist in the collection of debt. However, we consider that this amendment is unnecessary. The existing provisions of Clause 9 require the commission to report on all its activities and also on progress towards its objectives. So not only must the commission report on the effectiveness of debt collection as an activity, it must also report on its objective to secure compliance with parental obligations; in other words it must report on how it is getting all parents to pay all that is owing.</p>




<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC435"><b>31 Jan 2008 : Column GC435</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80131-gc0008.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08013172000313">The amendment also places a specific requirement on the commission to report on the measures used to assess progress towards objectives. As I have just mentioned, there is already a requirement to report on the steps taken to meet objectives and targets and the extent to which they have been met. In meeting this reporting requirement, the commission must adopt and explain a measure of performance for each objective. As such, the amendment would only serve to duplicate an existing requirement.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0008.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08013172000314">Amendment No. 64 provides the opportunity to explain how the commission will publish its annual report. In accordance with Treasury best practice, the report will be laid in Parliament by the Secretary of State at the same time as the annual accounts. We would then expect the annual report to be made available on both the departmental website and the commission&#146;s internet site. As is usual, we would also expect hard copies to be produced and distributed to the commission&#146;s stakeholders and made available to the public on request. This is the approach that is currently taken by the Child Support Agency. The amendment would remove the obligation on the commission to publish the report, and I am aware that this is not what the noble Lord intended.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0008.htm_para16">
<p><a name="08013172000315">Staying with publication, Amendment No. 65 places a requirement that the annual report should be laid in Parliament by the Secretary of State within one month of receiving it from the commission. Current Treasury guidance would mean that the commission&#146;s annual report would need to be laid in Parliament together with the annual accounts. There is currently no timeframe for when the annual report should, as such, be produced. The annual accounts, however, are required through provisions in the Bill to be sent to the Comptroller and Auditor-General for examination by the end of the August following the financial year that the accounts relate to. That is the key reassurance that I think the noble Lord is seeking, that there is a timeframe attached. Under the procedure as set out in the Bill, it is unnecessary to provide a timeframe for the Secretary of State, who has no role in approving the report. Both the annual report and the accounts will be laid as soon as possible following the certification of the annual accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0008.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08013172000316">Finally, Amendment No. 61 would require the commission to report on the extent to which it has relied on the provision for agency arrangements, effectively bringing it into parallel with the provision for contracting out. Noble Lords may be aware that Sir David Henshaw&#146;s report placed an emphasis on the contracting out of functions. As such, we felt it appropriate to provide an explicit requirement on the commission to report on the extent to which it has contracted out any services. In contrast to Clause 8(1), the provision in Clause 7(1) enables the commission to enter into arrangements with other public bodies and departments, which enables a variety of joint working across government. Clause 7(1) will allow for the continued arrangements with Northern Ireland. Consequently, we do not see the  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC436"><b>31 Jan 2008 : Column GC436</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>merit in placing an explicit provision for the commission to report on these arrangements.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0008.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08013172000317">However, just as the CSA currently reports on any arrangements that it has with any relevant authorities; it is likely that the commission would report on any arrangements made under Clause 7(1) when reporting on its activities in the previous financial year. In light of the above, I urge noble Lords to withdraw the amendment. However, in recognition that the inclusion of Clause 7(1) alongside Clause 8(1) would add symmetry to the reporting provisions, I am prepared to take that away to consider it further, and I will possibly come back to this issue at Report stage. I hope that shows noble Lords that we are willing to consider and act on appropriate suggestions and that we are a listening government.</p>

<p><a name="08013172000318"><b><a name="80131-gc0008.htm_spnew2"><a name="08013172000457">Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord for proving what I said in my opening sentences on Tuesday&#151;I do not have Tuesday&#146;s <I>Hansard</I> with me&#151;about the Minister&#146;s way of operating. I am extremely pleased that he will take this away and will hopefully bring back an amendment that is drafted better. Oppositions are never allowed to draft things for themselves; the government draftsman is always very insistent. I remember one occasion when a private secretary in the department of social security, as it then was, said, &#147;Minister, you must not do that; you will have the draftsman spitting blood&#148;. I do not try to pretend that I am any better at drafting than he or she is.</p>

<a name="80131-gc0008.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08013172000319">As far as the other amendments are concerned, I will have to study very carefully what the Minister has said. He has produced some technical arguments against this set of amendments. However, I have to say that in all fairness I found one or two of his arguments a little strange. For example, I am sure that potential competitors to whichever organisation is being contracted by the agency will look at the reports and think &#147;Ah, here is a commercial opportunity for us&#148;, but I am not sure that what I have suggested gives the commission the need in the annual report to go quite that far. I shall look at all these matters again. In the mean time, with quite a lot of hope and expectation, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

 There remain 41 inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton prior to 31 March 2007.  The Oxfordshire coroner has retained jurisdiction in 32 of these cases; nine of these inquests have been transferred to coroners closer to the next of kin. Hearing dates have been set in 22 cases. This includes the inquests into the deaths of 14 crew members who died together in the Nimrod crash on 2 September 2006 which will be heard together. In the remaining 19 inquests investigations are ongoing but it has not yet been possible for an inquest date to be set. The oldest individual military inquest for which no date has been set is that into the death of Lieutenant Palmer who died on 15 April 2006. The Board of Inquiry into Lieutenant Palmer&#146;s death is yet to report.   In addition there are 10 inquests into fatalities which were repatriated via RAF Lyneham prior to 1 April 2007.  These relate to the deaths of 10 crew members who died together in the crash of Hercules XV179 on 30 January 2005.

They indicate that while service personnel who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan are more likely to be assessed with PTSD than those who served in more benign environments, the actual numbers of individuals affected&#151;26 among those who had deployed, seven among those not deployed; and five cases where the deployment history could not be identified from centrally available patient records&#151;are very low.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"><a name="08013155000038">We take very seriously the risk of service personnel developing mental illness and attach a high priority to ensuring that individuals have access to the appropriate advice and, if needed, treatment at the right time. We have measures in place to increase awareness at all levels and to mitigate the development of operational stresses. We have mental health professionals available in theatre and are also increasingly using trauma risk management (TRiM)&#151;a model of peer group mentoring&#151;within the operational environment. Where further treatment is required, our mental health services back in the UK are configured to provide community-based mental healthcare within a military environment in line with national best practice.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"><a name="08013155000039">For those who have left the Armed Forces, I made a joint announcement with the Department of Health in November of the extension of priority treatment to all cases where an individual's doctor considers his condition may be due to service, and of the launch of the first of a number of pilots of a new community-based veterans' mental health service. This service will provide assessment and, where appropriate, treatment from experts in veterans' mental health. Veterans will be able to access the service directly or through their GP, ex-service organisations, the Veterans' Welfare Service, or social service departments. The pilots at the Staffordshire and Shropshire Foundation Healthcare Trust and Camden and Islington are now open; Cardiff, Middlesbrough, St Austell and Scotland are due to follow. If the pilots prove successful, the model will be rolled out more widely across the UK.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"><a name="08013155000040">As an interim measure, and to assist those veterans not in the catchment areas of one of the new community mental health pilots, we have expanded our medical assessment programme (MAP) based at St Thomas's Hospital, London, to include assessments of veterans with mental health symptoms with operational service from 1982 and whose GPs are concerned that they may not understand the military background of the condition or the appropriate treatment.</p>

In cash terms, this sees the daily fee paid by the MoD to Combat Stress for the treatment of each eligible war pensioner increase from around &#163;180 to around &#163;260 a day. This represents a significant boost to the charity's finances. This substantial increase demonstrates the department's continuing commitment to help Combat Stress play an appropriate part in treating veterans with mental health problems and will help Combat Stress deliver an enhanced capability to treat war pensioners.</p>

<a name="08013155000977"><b><a name="80131-wms0003.htm_spmin0"><a name="08013155001055">The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead):</b> My honourable friend the Minister of State for Borders and Immigration and Minister for the West Midlands (Liam Byrne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para0">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_957"><a name="08013155000978">Earlier this month I set out the 10 key changes to Britain's border security and immigration system that we will deliver in 2008. As part of these reforms I said that it was important that we act more sensitively to the children in our care and to the victims of human trafficking. I would like therefore to update the House on measures being taken forward by the Border and Immigration Agency in relation to children.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para1">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_958"><a name="08013155000979">First, I am pleased to announce to the House today the commencement of the public consultation exercise on the draft code of practice for keeping children safe from harm. The consultation will last for 12 weeks and copies of the consultation paper and the draft code of practice have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. As part of this consultation we will be talking to children to get their views.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para2">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_959"><a name="08013155000980">The code will guide the BIA in fulfilling its new legal duty to keep children safe from harm. In drafting it the Border and Immigration Agency has already consulted widely. During the period of the consultation Border and Immigration Agency officials will hold a series of conferences so that interest groups can express their concerns to us in detail and in their own words. These conferences will be devoted to the themes that have been put to us so far as important, such as children in detention, referrals to statutory agencies, and other key areas where children come into contact with our immigration system; as well as seeking to identify what can be learnt from others. In particular there will be conferences on children's issues in each of the devolved Administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para3">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_960"><a name="08013155000981">Secondly, I am also today publishing the responses to the public consultation exercise <I>Planning Better Outcomes and Support</I><I> f</I><I>or Unaccompanied</I><I> Asylum </I><I>Seeking Children</I>. We have considered carefully the responses to this document and taken account of the clear consensus that central government and local authorities need to work together to improve the way in which these children are referred to, cared for and supported by local authorities. Our main areas of reform in this area are:</p>
placing unaccompanied asylum seeking children with a network of specialist local authorities to ensure they receive the expert services they need;better procedures to assess age in order to ensure that children and adults are not accommodated together. We will establish a working group with key stakeholders to gain consensus on how we move forward in this complex area of public policy;ensuring that we resolve a child's immigration status more quickly and therefore enable care planning to focus on integration or safe early return to the country of origin for unaccompanied young people; andputting in place better procedures for identifying and supporting asylum seeking children who are the victims of trafficking paying particular attention

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para4">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_961"><a name="08013155000982">Thirdly, the Home Secretary announced a review of the UK's reservation to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child on 14 January. I know this review has been widely welcomed. I am therefore launching a consultation today to run in parallel with that on the code of practice. I wish to take full account of the views of others in deciding whether the time is now right to withdraw the reservation.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para5">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_962"><a name="08013155000984">This Statement updates the House on the Defence Training Review (DTR) Rationalisation Programme and BORONA Programme following announcements made last year on DTR on 25 October 2007 (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 15WS) and BORONA on 12 September 2007 (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 122WS). The BORONA Programme will establish HQ ARRC, 1 Signal Brigade and 102 Logistic Brigade in enduring bases in the UK.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para6">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_963"><a name="08013155000985">Work continues on DTR Package 1, which aims to deliver training for engineering and communications and information systems at a new site at St Athan in South Wales. It is still anticipated that the department will be in a position to consider the main investment decision in the spring of this year. As part of this work to secure contract signature as soon as possible for Package 1, a programme of risk reduction work to the value of &#163;9.5 million has been proposed with the Metrix Consortium. A departmental minute outlining this activity was laid in the House on 29 January. The proposed activities will be focused on the property and the estate, in particular securing planning consent, and development of the training solution. The cost of this work is included in Metrix's overall bid and is at no additional cost to the department.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para7">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_964"><a name="08013155000986">After reviewing further options for Package 2, which aims to provide training for logistics and personnel administration, police and guarding, security, languages, intelligence and photography, it has become apparent that the Metrix Consortium is not able to offer an affordable and acceptable Package 2 solution and, as a consequence, the competition has been brought to a close. The decision has therefore been taken to remove provisional preferred bidder status from Metrix. This does not have any impact on the department's commitment to the DTR programme, and particularly in pursuing a Package 1 Metrix solution with vigour, but it does allow the department to focus its efforts on alternative approaches for Package 2, which are not legally constrained by the original terms of the procurement. These alternatives may continue to be open to Metrix and other potential industry partners. Options will continue to aim to rationalise and improve the estate, maintain the department's commitment to

A further DTR update on both packages will be provided later this year after the appropriate investment decisions are made.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para8">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_965"><a name="08013155000987">In addition, I wish to advise the House on defence estate solutions related to both the DTR and BORONA Programmes. Following the announcement to release Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut, for disposal on 8 January 2008 (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 7WS), and further work on the defence estate, an agreement has been reached that, in principle, the Defence College of Logistics and Personnel Administration (DCLPA) and the Director Royal Logistics Corps (DRLC) will relocate to Worthy Down and Southwick Park. This move, which will consolidate elements of DCLPA and logistics training already on these sites, will allow the closure of the Deepcut site, currently anticipated to be not before 2013.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para9">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_966"><a name="08013155000988">A decision has also been taken that, under the BORONA Programme, both 1 Signal Brigade and 102 Logistics Brigade returning from Germany will move to Cosford. This will maintain a significant long-term defence presence on this site and continue to provide the associated benefits that this brings to the local community and to the West Midlands following the relocation of the DTR Package 1 units currently based there. Furthermore, Metrix proposes to establish a learning centre and design facility at the Cosford site which may also generate other business and employment opportunities for the local area.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para10">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_967"><a name="08013155000989">The BORONA Programme Team (BPT) will now develop proposals to deliver construction and service requirements at Cosford. In addition, the BPT will also draw up detailed plans and undertake wide consultation with all interested parties, including local authorities, health, education and welfare providers as well as the trades unions. A key piece of this consultation work will involve communication and discussion with the German authorities and with our locally engaged workforce in Germany and their representatives.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para11">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_968"><a name="08013155000990">This detailed planning and consultation will review all possible options and will result in recommendations, including the actual timings of the moves, being made for a final investment decision in spring 2009.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_969"><a name="08013155000991">The implications of these moves for our people will continue to be handled sensitively and in full consultation with trade unions and staff. However, both of these estate solutions are still subject to the appropriate final investment decision being made, after which further updates will be announced.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_970"><a name="08013155000993">Following the Government&#146;s response to the report by Lord Carter of Coles into the long-term supply and demand of prison places in December, (5 December 2007, <I>Official Report</I>, col. 827) I would like to provide the House with an update on progress to  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS56"><b>31 Jan 2008 : Column WS56</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>date.<I> Prison Policy Update</I><I>&#151;</I><I>Briefing Paper,</I> outlining further detail on today&#146;s announcements and an update on the supply measures which we are putting in place following the report of Lord Carter of Coles is published on the Ministry of Justice website at www.justice.gov.uk. Copies have also been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para14">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_971"><a name="08013155000994">The briefing paper sets out progress so far on the prison building programme announced in December. We announced then that we would provide a further 10,500 prison places on top of the 9,500 place programme previously announced. This will lead to a net increase in prison places of 15,000 by 2014. This year alone 2,500 new prison places will be delivered, of which more than 1,000 will be operational before the end of April. A further 1,600 are planned for 2009.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para15">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_972"><a name="08013155000995">The paper also sets out details on how &#147;Titan&#148; prisons will work. We plan to build up to three Titan prisons by 2014 and a consultation on the design of such complexes will begin in April. This will build on the success of clustering small prisons together; for example, at the Isle of Sheppey. We are starting to identify suitable sites for Titans, housing 2,500 prisoners each, in the south-east, West Midlands and the north-west. We are also launching a competition for a new prison ship and have begun a consultation for a new prison at the former RAF Coltishall airfield.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para16">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_973"><a name="08013155000996">The announcements I am making today signal a major drive to overcome some of the barriers to the rehabilitation of offenders. Our primary aim in doing so is further to aid the work we are already doing on cutting reoffending. These measures are focused on tackling drug use among offenders and providing opportunities for offenders to learn the new skills which might help them to a life away from crime outside prison.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para17">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_974"><a name="08013155000997">These announcements are framed by a sense of what the community can expect from those who break the law. We will provide opportunities for offenders to learn the skills which will present the hope of a new life on release, but in return we will set out what the community expects from those offenders who take up these opportunities. I have asked my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Prisons (David Hanson) to bring forward proposals for a clearer &#147;contract&#148; between offenders and the community.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para18">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_975"><a name="08013155000998">In the mean time, I am announcing today a range of new measures on prison work and industries, on tackling drugs and on community justice. These build on the announcements we made in response to Lord Carter of Coles&#146; review of prisons, including Lord Bradley&#146;s review of mental health issues.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para19">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_976"><a name="08013155000999">First, we will increase the range of constructive work available to offenders inside prison, and in turn their job opportunities on the outside. We have an existing corporate alliance with more than 70 employers, in addition to those working in individual prisons and probation areas, but the Government are now committed to expanding this programme significantly. With ministerial colleagues from the Department of Innovation, Universities and Skills,

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para20">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_977"><a name="08013155001000">Today we are also announcing the launch of a major new scheme at HMP Wandsworth, (with Cisco, Bovis Lend Lease and Panduit) to train prisoners in installing voice and data cabling. Providing enhanced vocational training to prisoners is instrumental in helping offenders turn away from crime, and giving them back a sense of stability, discipline and responsibility.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para21">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_978"><a name="08013155001001">Secondly, we are taking further steps to tackle drug use in prison and in the community against a background over the past few years of a tenfold increase in investment in drugs work in prisons and a two-thirds fall in the number of prisoners testing positive for drugs in prison (from 24 per cent in 1996-97 to 8.8 per cent in 2006-07). But we are clear that we have to go further. This drive against drugs will cover both drug treatment programmes in prisons and the control of drugs in prisons, and will be jointly headed by two senior figures with relevant experience in each area, who will be announced shortly.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para22">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_979"><a name="08013155001002">Ministers are urgently considering what further measures we need to take over controlling the supply of drugs into prisons, such as reviewing the criteria for open/closed visits across the prison estate, with a particular focus on local prisons. This will also look at introducing more rigorous searches, including the provision of more sniffer/search dogs.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para23">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_980"><a name="08013155001003">As well as stamping out the supply of drugs, we are helping offenders kick the habit in prison. By April,  29 prisons will have introduced the integrated drug treatment system (IDTS), and I am pleased to announce that with the Department of Health we will be extending this scheme to a further 20 prisons over the next 12 months. IDTS provides better clinical services (funded by the Department of Health), such as improved detoxification programmes and greater continuity of care between the community and prisons, between prisons, and on release into the community, as well as helping offenders to address some of the deeper roots of their drug abuse.  Alongside this, we will also consider extending the number of drug-free wings where prisoners can access increased rehabilitation and support separate from known drug users.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para24">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_981"><a name="08013155001004">In the community, we are increasing the provision of current community sentences that specifically target and intensively supervise offenders with a drug misuse problem by 1,000 next year. These are known as drug rehabilitation requirements (DRR). The aim of the DRR, which involves treatment, regular testing and court reviews of progress and rigorous enforcement, is to get offenders to stop offending, with the longer-term aim of getting them off drugs for good.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para25">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_982"><a name="08013155001005">Thirdly, many offenders come from chaotic backgrounds, their lives ruined by the pernicious cycle of crime and drug abuse. Subject to the current evaluation of the Leeds and West London pilots, we will extend our successful dedicated drug courts to four further areas, in which courts look to address the causes of offending along with the offence.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para26">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_983"><a name="08013155001006">We will also bring forward pilots of models for court diversion and reviewable community orders for  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS58"><b>31 Jan 2008 : Column WS58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>those with mental health issues. These will be based on models in the American and Australian jurisdictions. Problem-solving approaches applied to mental health builds on experience developed within HMCS relating to community justice, domestic violence courts and drugs court pilots, all aimed at ensuring that the courts respond effectively to problems in the criminal justice system.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para27">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_984"><a name="08013155001007">For many offenders on sentences of less than 12 months community-based punishments are proven to be more effective at reducing reoffending than short prison terms. Therefore, we will fund at least six intensive alternatives to custody projects with new investment of &#163;13.9 million over the next three years. The first such project will begin in Derbyshire in March, and will include a combination of unpaid work, electronic monitoring, behaviour programmes, mentoring, and help with resettlement, all under intensive supervision. More than 6 million hours of unpaid work are already carried out in the community each year. With the Department of Communities and Local Government we will further build on community payback, such as through options like citizens&#146; panels to decide on which projects offenders should undertake in their local area.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para28">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_985"><a name="08013155001008">Today&#146;s announcements should be set in the context of an impressive criminal justice record. This is the first post-war administration to preside over a sustained and substantial reduction in crime. The latest British Crime Survey/Recorded Crime Statistics demonstrated that overall crime has fallen a third since 1997, while the chances of being a victim of crime are the lowest since accurate recording began 27 years ago.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para29">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_986"><a name="08013155001009">During the past decade more than 20,000 prison places have been provided due to more offenders being brought to justice, including 60 per cent more violent and dangerous offenders, and being sentenced for longer. We are fully committed to providing a net further 15,000 places by 2014. Meanwhile, prisons and the prison regime are almost unrecognisable from the institutions of 10 to 15 years ago. In spite of the pressures the prisons are under, they continue to be much more decent, humane and constructive places.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para30">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_987"><a name="08013155001011">I am announcing today the launch of a review of the distribution formula for dedicated schools grant (DSG).</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_988"><a name="08013155001012">In my Statement to the House on 25 June 2007 I announced that although the DSG for 2008-11 would be distributed using the spend plus method, there would be a review of the formula for distributing school and early years funding with the aim of developing a single, transparent formula that would be available for use from 2011-12. A consultation on the terms of reference for the review was launched in August 2007. I am today publishing a summary of the responses to the consultation and placing a copy of that summary  


<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS59"><b>31 Jan 2008 : Column WS59</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the Library of the House. I am grateful to all those who responded to the consultation.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para32">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_989"><a name="08013155001013">The overwhelming majority of respondents to the consultation (88 per cent) supported the aims of the review and the need to introduce a formula for the distribution of DSG. Their view was that it would be unsustainable to continue with the spend plus methodology for the longer term.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para33">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_990"><a name="08013155001014">The overarching aim of the review will be to produce a funding system that should support schools and local authorities to raise the educational achievement of all children and young people and to narrow the gap in educational achievement between all children, including those from low income and disadvantaged backgrounds. The resultant distribution formula for DSG should be based on the principles of transparency, simplicity and stability.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para34">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_991"><a name="08013155001015">A number of respondents to the consultation suggested that consideration should be given to removing the ring-fence on the DSG and to the payment of school funding through general formula grant, with decisions on the level of schools expenditure taken locally. Over the past 10 years the Government have invested record amounts in education. Overall per pupil funding, including capital funding, will reach &#163;6,600 by 2011&#151;nearly a threefold cash increase since 1997 and more than double in real terms. This demonstrates our continuing commitment to raising standards for all young people, and we are determined that further increases in school funding should be spent in schools, so that we can meet our long-term aim that per pupil funding for schools should match the level of support available to children in independent day schools. Consequently the review will start from the premise that the ring-fence on DSG will remain. However, the review will examine the scope for greater flexibility in the use of DSG to support the delivery of Every Child Matters outcomes and the implementation of the Children&#146;s Plan.</p>

<a name="80131-wms0003.htm_para35">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_992"><a name="08013155001016">There will be a number of key themes to the review. We will carry out a needs-led analysis to assess the feasibility of using this method to set the basic entitlement to funding that local authorities will receive for each of the pupils in their schools. We will look at the additional costs that should be taken into account in high wage areas and high housing cost areas, in co-ordination with the review of area costs recently announced by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, and with the review of teachers&#146; pay bands recommended by the School Teachers&#146; Review Body. We will commission work to review the costs of educating pupils with additional educational needs (AEN). With the introduction of diplomas and the raising of the age of compulsory participation in education and training to 18, we will review the scope for working towards a common 14 to 19 funding system.
